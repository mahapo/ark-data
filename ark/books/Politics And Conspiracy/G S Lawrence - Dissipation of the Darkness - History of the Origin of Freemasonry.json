Perhaps it still exists. But if it does, it is well hidden, carefully guarded by a descendant o f the man who stole it from ...and killed its right ful owner. Its rightful owner, however, left a widow. And a so n. His widow married a close friend of her deceased husband one of only a handful of men in the entire world wh o had a copy of the original manuscript, which the English translation had been made. And so, despite the fact that his father’s copy had disappeared, the “widow ’s son” inherited the manuscript and passed it on to his de scendants. And then by a series of coincidences, the chains th at bound the secret was broken. The chain of succes sion was broken when one of the descendants bequeathed the m anuscript not to his son’s son, but to his daughter ’s son. The chain of ideology was broken when one of the de scendants was converted by his Christian wife. The chain of silence was broken when one of the descendants t ranslated the manuscript into French—and sought oth er linguists who would translate it and publish it in other languages. And so it went from French to Arab ic to Spanish to English. The secret association, conceived in the mind of an other “widow’s son more than 19 centuries ago, is n o longer secret .

Or was it the hand of God?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DEDICATION Of Awad Khoury (Translator of the work from French to Arabic) To all the Masons of the World Dear Brothers: Before presenting this History, I extend my greetin gs to you from the depths of my heart. To whom, more deserving than you, could this History b e dedicated? Who, other than you, has a greater right to read it and to have it? Who, other than the owner of the house, is the one who should investigate what happens in the house, good or ill, beneficial or harmful and which is under his roof? And, if someone knows nothing of his parents, would it not be his duty to investigate who they are, to know their origin and ancestry? Wouldn’t one be ignorant who takes a beverage witho ut finding out its ingredients? One who wears a suit, should he not determine if it is clea n or if it is contaminated with contagious bacteria? All these allusions pertain to the case of a member of an association who knows nothing of its origin, its past, its founder, the history o f the foundation and the principles of the association . Who is that member who is ignorant of what he sho uld not be ignorant? We are THE MASONS, who for 19 centuries have not kn own the origin or the past of our association ! The Founders hid that secret with rare cunning, in the cloaks of the occult, as you will see . They hid it from their own “brothers” from the beginning to the present, in spite of the endless investigation of historians . Guided by God, 1 have found this History. And since this is a discovery so longed-for by the seekers of historic truth, it would not be gallant to leave it in obscurity before you in particular and the rest in general, forbidding you its benefit s. I consider its concealment a betrayal, an act of cowardice, a crime. This is my reason for translating this work to the A rabic language and for publishing it. To serve history, science and the readers themselves, especi ally you, dear “brothers,” not doubting that this action of mine will find among you, the wise and th e rest of the people, looking beyond all your religious and political differences, the value it d eserves.

In the year 1863 he acquired the title of Doctor of Law. In 1864 he was elected a member of the council of Piracicaba. In 1867 he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Sao Paulo. In 1885, on January 9th, he was elected Deputy of the 8th Distri ct of Sao Paulo. On December 3rd, 1889, he was named by the Provisional Government of the Repu blic, Governor of Sao Paulo until October 18th, 1890, the day on which he was appointed Senat or. On November 21st of the same year, he assumed the Presidency of the Constituent Assembly with 146 votes opposed to 80. In the first days of March of 1894 he triumphed by a smashing majority in the presidential elections, assuming the Presidency on November 15th , 1894. He was an example without precedent in self-sacrifi ce and justice, attaining the friendship, good will and trust of all the people and all the politi cians of the nation. He died December 13,1902. Résumé of the Autobiography of Awad Khoury I was born in Chiah (Beirut), Lebanon in January of 1871. I received a Christian education through my parents, the orthodox priest Yousef Antu n Garios EI Khoury and Naila Mansur Fagale. I studied in the local elementary school, acquiring the title of teacher of Arabic and French, after having finished my secondary studies in special cou rses. My students were numerous, some of them being outstanding personalities, as, for examp le, Prof. Wadih Naim, who came to be president of the College of Lawyers of Lebanon. Spurred on by my aspirations to a brilliant future that I could not attain by means of the profession of teacher, I journeyed to France to stu dy Pasteur’s system of raising silkworms; my studies ended, I became an industrial merchant in t hat profession. Seeking a better future and perhaps by the natural instinct of my adventuresome race, I abandoned everything and journeyed to Brazil, where I had the opportunity of meeting Dr. Prudente de Moraes , President of the Republic of Brazil, who commended to me the task of recoding the private affairs of the Presidency , from February 15, 1896 until September 12, 1897. During this period the President introduced me to the owner of this History , as will be seen in the following pages. For reaso ns of health I journeyed to France. My health regained, a nd at the repeated insistence of my parents, I returned to Lebanon. I journeyed to France again an d, on returning, met in Istanbul, Muzaffar Pasha , who appointed me his secretary . We journeyed together to Beirut, where, because o f a royal intrigue and the discovery of my affiliation with the Association, “ Young Turkey ,” from which I had two decorations of merit, I renounced m y charge. At that time an attempt was made to integrate Leban on in the Turkish Congress, “Mabhuthan” Such an attempt provoked my reaction, and I publish ed a book with respect to this, entitled, “Lebanon in Danger.” My name was inscribed on the black list, and I was persecuted by Jamal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pasha , a governor more merciless than the Imperial Ottom an, which obliged me to take refuge with my family in the vicinity of a convent of reli gious until the end of the World War. My encounter with the owner of this History Do not be surprised, dear reader, if I declare fran kly to you that I was one of the extraordinarily numerous seekers and investigators eager for the Hi story of the foundation of the Masonic Association and of the principal reason for its fou ndation. All my efforts toward that intention were in vain. Many times I had serious discussions with my “brothers,” after having become an affiliate in the association. I struggled terribly to penetrate its secrets through the high degrees that I could scale throug h my activity. I arrived at nothing . My destiny was similar to the destiny of thousand s before me, whose search ended in failure. I almost forgot the objective that I had dreamed of so because the journey was so long. On that long journey I arrived at one point that I could no t pass: the point of resignation before that hermetic secret. The secret of the foundation of Ma sonry. My political occupations, especially, obliged me to neglect that objective, now, for me u nattainable. And one day, providentially, I met Mr. Lawrence, so n of George, son of Samuel, son of Jonas, son of Samuel Lawrence, thanks be to God and to Dr. Prudente de Moraes, President of Brazil, who introduced him to me. Mr. Lawrence is the owner of this History (the Hebrew manuscript ) that I present to the reader translated into Arabic, and he is, at the same time , the last heir of one of the nine founders of the association (The Mysterious Force), as will be seen later. [i.e. 9 unknown men of Satanic Order – Tariq] Within a short period of time, we forged strong cha ins of growing friendship. We agreed to translate the manuscript to Arabic and Turkish, dir ectly from the French version, one of the languages in which it was written. I would make two copies, one for Mr. Lawrence, and the other would remain in my possession, so it could be publi shed in Arabic and Turkish countries. In these countries I would have exclusive rights of translat ion, reproduction, editing and publishing in the two languages. Before finishing the reading of the History, and be fore signing the agreement, in one of the meetings held with Dr. Moraes and my new friend, La wrence, I asked the President: “Every history has its proofs or evidences on behal f of impartial historians; in our history, on what evidences or proofs can we rely besides tho se of its owners?” Behold the answer given by Dr. de Moraes, confirmed by the owner of the manuscript: “What proof will a history such as this have, one that was hidden among nine men and their respective successors, known only to them , the first and only one of its kind, if no one saw it or read even the least part of its conte nts, except the nine? From whence and from whom can come the proofs to which you allude? The proofs, then, are: their"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"testimony, the events that happened until our days, and the detailed investigations of wise historians who worked in vain to explain its secret . Moreover, as every history, the first and oldest of its kind, requires the investigation of subsequent historians who confirm its texts after having seen and read it, but this Histo ry . . .who read it? Who saw it, except the nine founders and their respective successors? We, you and I, untiring readers and investigators of the origin of Masonry, have this m anuscript before us. I, who have read and analyzed it; based on my studies and investigat ions, assert its veracity and recommend its translation and publication. Dr. de Moraes’ answer inspired confidence in me and awakened my e nthusiasm to carry out the work commended. I began to work eagerly, spurred on by the thought that my new friend would cease being so, and would not persist in his agreem ent. Despite Mr. Lawrence’s requirement that the translation (from French to Arabic) be realized in his own house, the development of the work was carried out to perfection, in two copies, as he asked. The work being concluded in the year 1897, one copy remained in Mr. Lawrence’s possession and the other in my possession . I considered it an indescribable treasure and an invaluable relic. In the year 1898 I returned to my country, Lebanon, taking the aforementioned copy with me. Comparison of this History with prior knowledge of Masonry Once in Lebanon, I began a series of studies, inves tigations and comparisons, making use of everything published with respect to this. These ta sks of consulting the different authorities concerning the matter took long years. The war from 1914 to 1918 occasioned an obligatory recess. The conflict ended, I renewed the investiga tion requesting, through correspondence, from Grand Orients, institutions of high rank and import ant newspapers, details concerning the existence of a history that treats of the date of t he foundation and the origin of Masonry. I sent letters to London, Paris, New York, Cairo, Berlin, Madrid and Rome, obtaining the following scant replies: From the prestigious newspaper, “ EI Mukattam ” “The oldest historical evidence of the history of M asonry dates, according to some, from 1217. According to others, from 1390. Ancient Mason ic authors claim that Masonry dates from the era of Moses. We have no confirmatio n of this. Our cordial greetings.” From the Egyptian National Grand Orient : “We do not possess any confirmation of the date of the foundation of Masonry. The only thing we know is that, in the year 1917 a booklet w as published, entitled: Two Centuries of Freemasonry .” Knowing through later references that this booklet is one of the most important documents on which the Masons depend, I began to seek it, findin g it in the Library of International Masonic Affairs in New Castle. From the Grand Orient in London :"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"“We lack certain data concerning the date of the fo undation of Masonry. We do know that it already existed in the year 1717 .” From the rest of the cities mentioned I received no reply whatever, from which I deduced: their silence indicated their ignorance concerning the my stery. Then, on the basis of all the previous studies, in the light of the events that happened in the last two and a half centuries to date, a lapse character ized by a permanent conflict between Masonry on the one hand and Mohammedanism on the other, and in view of the texts of this History we present, all substantiated by the documented bookle t, “ Two Centuries of Masonry ,” there is no doubt concerning the authenticity of this manuscrip t. My Intentions Aided by Providence, which guided me miraculously t oward this discovery, I have decided definitely to publish this History. On doing so, I am not moved either by personal interest or by the hope of profit; if so, I might not have waited more than a quarter of a century. My intentions are: - To keep the promises and the agreement made - To dissipate the darkness that, for nineteen centuries has enveloped a human ity that is wavering in doubt. - To reveal this mystery to the eyes of men to alert them before this cruel danger . I must point out, as well, that I was inspired by t he exclusively Christian intentions of de Moraes , in accord with one of his declarations that states thus: “ With this action of ours we extend to the Christian religion a great benefit, eliminating the forces of evil that attack it , from this fantasy encrusted by the absurd. And yo u, especially, with your task in the Turkish Empire, will extend a nother great service to the Muslim religion .” I pray to God that this work may be a beacon for al l in general, and in particular that it may illuminate the minds of the reduced number of heirs who successively guard the monopolized manuscript.

The following has been agreed upon: Mr. Lawrence, last heir and sole proprietor of the History , THE MYSTERIOUS FORCE (ancient Hebrew manuscript) says: My father and gra ndparents, who have bequeathed this History, apparently have not considered that the Ar abic and Turkish languages are two rich and important languages; and that Arabia and Turkey are two immense countries and in all their regions Freemasonry is now widespread. Therefore, I have considered it necessary to propag ate our History, mentioned above, in said countries, translated to Arabic and later to Turkis h, so that it will be published there and known as much as possible by all those who speak and underst and said languages. Having just had “the honor of meeting Mr. Awad Khou ry; and considering the good intentions of my father and his ancestors, and according to their Wills successively made for the propagation of our History: I agree with Mr. Awad that he should translate to A rabic and later to Turkish our History, print it and propagate it in Arabia and in Turkey, reserving to himself alone all the rights of translation, reproduction, edition and publication in those two languages.

All of this comprises my great obligation to formal ly carry out the intentions of our ancestors, the principal proprietors of the History they have left to us successively from the origin to my father and me. My acquaintance with Mr. Awad Khoury was brought ab out by His Excellency Dr. de Moraes who merits my gratitude for that introduction. Mr. Awad says: I accept, with full consent the clau ses in this agreement and I bind myself to carry them out textually when circumstances permit it, when no obstacle impedes me. This agreement was drawn up in private between the two of us, in the presence only of Dr. de Moraes and with his most excellent advice. The two of us have requested him to permit the ment ion of his honorable name in the History; he has replied thus: “If you succeed in printing it du ring my life, there is no need to mention my name; but if I die before the appearance of this Hi story, no obstacle will impede your declaring the details of this historic audience and the menti on of my name; in any case, whether living or dead, mentioned or not mentioned, I wish you all pr ogress and pleasure, equaling mine, with respect to this History.”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Mr. Lawrence is bound, finally, so that from now on he will not be able to engage anyone, nor authorize anyone other than Mr. Awad Khoury to tran slate this History to Arabic and Turkish.

The other part pertains to some of my ancestors, wh o inherited and bequeathed this History. How many learned men and historians who carried out lengthy investigations to come to know the history of the foundation of the Masonic associ ation and its true origin arrived at no conclusion. Their efforts were in vain. Some believe that the origin of the Masonic associa tion goes back to Adam, others believe that it goes back to Moses, others to David, others to Solo mon, others to Christ, etc., etc. Innumerable are those who spent their time in the s earch without coming to realize their longings. The number of investigators who, together with thei r relatives, friends and helpers, met their downfall in this work is incredible. To the aforeme ntioned are added all the heads of the religions of all the world, especially in Europe, Turkey, Egy pt and America. Whom else should I add? I would add the Masonic family itself, including the Presidents of the Grand Orients, the Presidents of the Lodges, and the affiliates who hold high deg rees; except the Nine Men who have,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"respectively, inherited from their corresponding an cestors, the secret of the foundation of the Mysterious Force . I would also add kings, nobles and governors, wise men, discoverers and investigators, Historians, authors; writers and poets, Orators, le gislators and journalists, Lawyers, judges, doctors and pharmacists, Merchants, industrialists and sportsmen, Even the illiterate to whom this investigation would not belong. All these mentioned , integrated in the different classes of the community, Masons and non-Masons, form a true army that pursues the secret. I divide these investigators into three groups: 1. The historians who spend their days and nights i n study and reading trying in vain to come to know the secret of the true history of the foundation of Masonry. 2. The learned authors who try to establish somethi ng about the secret. All in vain; yet they continue with their studies without having rea ched their goal. 3. The associates and their collaborators who have not gotten anywhere in spite of their efforts. It is deplorable. All the investigations come to nothing , they have not achieved any result! The number of those investigators, from the foundation of the association up to our days (the end of the 19th century) can be estimated in the hundreds o f thousands. I received these truths from my father, who in turn received them from his father, and he from his father, retrospectively to the origin of the lineage: the Nine Founders in the year 43 after Christ . Thus it is that I, Lawrence, son of George, son of Samuel, son of Jonas, son of Samuel Lawrence, of Russian origin, the last descendant of the desce ndants of one of the owners of this History, say: I inherited from my father a manuscript composed by our ancestors in the Hebrew language and translated by one of them to the Russian language. Another of them translated it to English. Our ancestor, Jonas, introduced in the manuscript a series of events; this History, thus, being produced by him and his ancestors. Jonas arranged i t and divided it into two sections. He wanted to publish it, but various obstacles impeded it: he alth, economic means and political events. He and his wife, Janet, conceived the idea of the publ ication of this History; on finding themselves incapable of doing so, they commended its publicati on to their son, my grandfather, Samuel. Jonas died without seeing his longing fulfilled. My grandfather, Samuel, the son of Jonas, who was t he son of Samuel Lawrence, here addresses his words to his son, George, my father. Samuel said to his son , George : Son: Here you see these introductions headed by a l ist of names. These names correspond to the successive heirs of this History since the r enewal of the association (The Mysterious Force) when it changed its name to “Free masonry.” They include: Joseph Levy . Joseph Levy is one of the renewers of the association . He is a Jew and an heir of the History from his ancient ancestors who, in turn, in herited it from Moab Levy , one of the nine founders."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"It was our ancestor, Joseph , who conceived the idea of changing the name of the association (The Mysterious Force) to Freemasonry a nd of reforming the statutes . Here you have the details: He was sent to London with his son , Abraham , and a friend named Abraham Abiud , all Jews, descendants of the heirs of the History a nd very well financed . 1 They had made efforts to enter another city and, no t having success, they headed for London. There they met two influential and knowledgeable persons who served as suitable elements to accomplish their pur poses . They are: John Desaguliers and a companion called George . 2 After having strengthened the friendship among them selves, Joseph Levy revealed the name of the association, “ The Mysterious Force ,” and related to his two friends, in synthesis and wi th discretion, some parts of the History, concealing i ts fundamental secrets . He also made it known to them that for a long time it was inactive, almos t dead, needing for its renewal the change of name and the reform of the statutes in such a way that the new statutes and the changed name might attract many members. Thus it would grow. ---------------------------------- 1 The manuscript does not mention who sent and financ ed them, nor the place of their departure, but it is understood that their country was Russia. Nor does it mention why they chose London; It is thought that they selected it because it was one of the largest capitol cities. In London they met Desaguliers, an ambitious man and one with definite and special goals, as will be seen. ---------------------------------- 2 In the Hebrew manuscript and its French version, Abraham Abiud said: I believe that George is his first name. Desaguliers always called him George . Our arrangements were with Desaguliers, but he was always present at the meetings and parti cipated In the discussions With eloquence and cleverness, Joseph Levy succeede d in convincing his two friends, Desaguliers and George, of the necessity of revivin g the association. Having achieved this initial success, they separated on condition that they woul d meet again, each one of them bringing three names appropriate for the new association , from which the specific name would come. The next meeting was held ten days later. Each one presented his names, the one approved being one of those proposed by Joseph Levy: FREEMASONRY . It was August 25, 1716 . Abraham , son of Joseph Levy, who had witnessed the two sessions , said: This name had preference over the others for two re asons. First, because it is the same name that some Italian architects adopted in the 13 th century (Freemasons) . And second, because it was a suitable expression of the ancient signs a nd symbols used in the association , The Mysterious Force; symbols that pertained to construction and to architecture, proposed by Hiram Abiud , one of the founders, for the purpose of concealing the origin of the Association, attributi ng it to epochs prior to Jesus . In the Second Section surprising details concerning this matter will be seen. Desaguliers approved the words of my father, adding:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"“In the third place, present-day architects and bui lders have associations, syndicates and lodges where they gather to fortify and dignify the ir profession. With this name, then, we can gather all in a single association without anyo ne’s knowing our purposes .” And fourth, these two terms, ‘Masonry,’ (Construction) and ‘Mas on ,’ that are encountered since antiquity, will be a thick veil over the secret of the origin of the foundation ; and, besides, without doubt, they will increase the pres tige of the Association. Our ancestor, Abraham Levy , before his death, added: 3 “ Desaguliers specified that those people who joined the lodges before 1717 in London were masons, 4 in the sense that they were engineers, architects, builders, apprentices, but they had no connection with the Association, The My sterious Force, that began true Masonry.” For that purpose five men met: Levy, Desaguliers, a nd the companions mentioned above and they approved the addition of the term, “Free,” thus une quivocally concealing the date of its foundation from the rest of the people in general a nd the members and associates in particular. John Desaguliers and his companion began to demand that Levy show hi m the History . Levy had made it known to them that it was translated in to English, that three of the inherited manuscripts had been lost recently, four had been l ost long ago, and there remained only his manuscript and one other . 5 Such declarations excited Desaguliers and George ex tremely, the reason why they insisted on the need for a suitable copy so that with said copy it would be much easier for them to form the new statute. They showed themselves so faithful to the principle s, desires and doctrines of Levy that they succeeded in convincing him to deliver a copy to them . It was delivered to them. A time passed during which they read it. The five met again and decided to summon some frien ds on the pretext of establishing a “ Unitive Association .” The true purpose was the renewal of the Association , the Mysterious Force, its resurrection with the new name agreed upon by the f ive and the restoration of the first Principal Lodge (Jerusalem). Thus Levy wanted it. 6 On March 10, 1717 they invited several architects a nd acquaintances. The invited were presided over by a wise man named Dr. James Anderson , who was a friend of Desaguliers . After lengthy discussions they reached an accord and designated June 24, 1717 , to realize a great meeting . 7 --------------------------------------------------- --------------- 3 Each one of the heirs, owners of the manuscript, ad ded what happened in his epoch. 4 Mason: an English word that means stoneworkers. 5 It Is the manuscript of Abraham Abiud .

Ridiculously the monopolizes of the secret declare that they celebrate the feast of St. John. ----------------------------------------- Meanwhile Levy was preparing his son, Abraham, for the great events of the future. Days later Abraham Levy journeyed to Portugal accompanied by Abraham Abiud , his relative . 8 The latter is the descendant of Hiram Abiud , one of the founders , and owner of this copy. Between March 10 and June 24 a great conflict was begun between Levy and Desagul iers and George because of their refusal to return the copy . (This conflict ended with the assassination of Levy and the disappearance of the aforementioned En glish copy, the Hebrew copy and all Levy’s papers. The details of this event are recorded in t he Second Section of this History, where the principal motives for the assassination of our ance stor, Joseph Levy, are made known.) Abraham& Joseph Levy said!: “The meeting was realized on June 24, 1717, and the first Lodge was founded after a violent discussion (as some of those who were present at the meeting related to me on my return from Portugal) during which my father insisted energetically that it be called the Lodge of Jerusalem , in accord with the agreement established between him and Desaguliers and George. Some applauded it, but the majority decreed that it be called the grand Lodge of England . Nevertheless, for a short period of time it was c alled the Lodge of Jerusalem, 9 but at the insistence of the majority it was defini tively changed to the Grand Lodge of England. There was another conflict over the dispute for the Presidency between Levy and Desaguliers ; Two months after that meeting, Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud returned from Portugal. His surprise was indescribable and his weeping unrestrained on his being informed of the d isappearance of Joseph Levy in such an absurd and hidden manner. (We will see the detai ls later.) Here it is necessary to mention the names of the su ccessive heirs of this History, from our ancestor, Joseph Levy, the re-newer of the Associat ion, down to me, Lawrence. Joseph Levy was the son of Nathan, who was the son of Abraham, Abraham the son of Jacob, Jacob the son of Nathan, Nathan the son of Jacob, w ho was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Moab: Moab the son of Rafael, etc., etc:.

The “mysterious ones” 10 by the name, “sons of the widow.” This pseudonym is used by them up to the present. This Hiram is not Hiram Abiff, the ancient Syrian architect who built the Temple of Solomon, as some of the “mysterious ones” and la ter their successors, the Masons, believed. 11 (More details in the second section.) --------------------------------------------------- - 3. Moab Levy , our first ancestor. The names of the other Founders are recorded in the Second Section, with the exception of one whose name is illegible, almost erased in the Hebre w manuscript . My grandfather, Samuel , again addresses his words to his son, George , my father: “My son, you have observed that I am interested in the publication of this History. You have witnessed my agreement with the owner of the p rint shop that will be in charge of editing it in the Hebrew language. “That man is exposed constantly to death”. Your gra ndfather could not fulfill his desires to publish this book because death took him by surp rise. But he had already recommended that I publish it. Now, I say to you: I f I am not able to have this satisfaction, or if I begin the publication and do not finish it, I charge you to give this History the great importance it merits. The History that I will deliver to you before dying. Thus I will comply with the obligation for its succ ession."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"“But; son, I must demand one condition of you in or der to be able to deliver the secret to you. You must collaborate with me with all serenity and absolute discretion. “Now, listen: in the first place you must dominate the English and French languages, and later translate this History literally to those lan guages. It will then be written in four languages: Hebrew and Russian by our ancestors, Eng lish and French by you. The copy in English that existed disappeared with Levy , as you saw. Put all your attention into its publication in the languages mentioned. If it is no t possible for you to do so, you will be able to ask the collaboration of whoever may have f inancial resources. By whatever means, you must utilize all the means within your r each to be able to achieve the publication of this book in all the world, in accor d with the desire of your grandfather, Jonas, and the will of your grandmother, Janet. “Son, you must know that I inherited this History f rom my father and he from his parents and grandparents in a manner contrary to the heredi tary law legislated by the nine Ancestor Founders of the Association, as will be se en below. “The Copy was inherited with indescribable reserve and caution, in absolute secrecy. The father bequeathed it only to one of his male childr en, the one who distinguished himself among his brothers for his wisdom, seriousness and judgment . And if the father had no male child, the most serious and responsible of the direct and close family members inherited it, without going beyond the second degre e of consanguinity. That is: the heir must be male, a son, nephew or cousin (on the fathe r’s side), and no farther, so this secret might be hidden among just nine men, descendants of the nine Founders . “My father inherited the manuscript from his mother , and not from his father in accord with the abovementioned law. Then, in this respect, our inheritance is contrary to the tradition that obliges the successor not to bequeat h it except to male children. Joseph Levy is my ancestor on my mother’s side as we have already seen.” ------------------------------------------------ 10 Members of the Association, \"The Mysterious Force.\" 11 Note of the Translator to Arabic: And as I believed before discovering this History. ------------------------------------------------ Here you have the enumeration of the successive hei rs of this History from the renewal of the Association , 1716-1717, down to us. The ancestor renewer, Joseph Levy , lacking the talents of an historian, copied synth etically, with the collaboration of Abraham Abiud the two manuscripts inherited by him and that of h is own respective ancestors from the year 43 after the “Im postor Jesus,” 12 the year of the foundation of the Association. The two manuscripts were, logicall y, exactly the same. After the return of Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud from Portugal, the former, accompanied by Abiud, addressed himself to Desaguliers and George , asking about his father. These two made it known to him that they had not seen him for a certain period of time and they believed he had gone to Portugal."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Abraham Levy, after that interview, dedicated himse lf to investigating the conspiracy. From the earlier relationship between his father and Desagul iers and George, Abraham Levy inferred that they were the assassins. He decided then to take re venge by his own methods . He began to cultivate the friendship of Desaguliers and George, making it known to them that he wanted to enter the Association to fill the post of his father, who, with their knowledge, had been preparing him for it. The friendship, on each occas ion, increased: the strategy was successful. When an opportunity arose, Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud invited George to take an outing through the suburbs of the city. There they killed their enemy , the event remaining an hermetic secret. This crime was kept concealed, lik e the crime whose victim was Joseph Levy. They decided later to assassinate Desaguliers, the principal actor in the murder of Joseph Levy, and for that reason, he began a zealous vigil, awai ting the moment to realize his goal. A short time later, Abraham Levy died, a victim of tubercul osis, two years after his marriage to Esther. From his son, Nathan, who was quite small at Abraha m’s death, we have inherited the History in the following manner: Abraham Levy’s widow, Nathan’s mother, married Abraham Abiud , the companion, associate and relative of her dead husband. Abraham Abiud che rished Nathan as if he were his own son, especially because he had none. Abraham Abiud and Nathan, his wife’s son, were then the only heirs and possessors of the only known Hebrew manuscript 13 , the one from Abiud’s descent, because the other, from Levy’s descent, disappeared with Joseph Levy. Nathan grew up and married. He had only one daughte r to whom he gave the name Esther, his mother’s name. 14 Nathan arranged for the marriage of his daughter, E sther, to Samuel Lawrence, who was not of his (Levy’s) descent. Not having male children, nor close family members, Nathan delivered the History to his grandson, Jonas, the son of Esther a nd Samuel Lawrence, as legal heir . This is the illegality in the inheritance, because Jonas is not a descendant on his father’s side, as the law requires. This Jonas is my father and the one from whom, naturally, we have received this History. --------------------------------------------------- --------------- 12 We leave the term \"Impostor\" as it is, making it cl ear that we do not use the term; it is rather that of the ancestor founders. 13 That is the copy we have on hand. 14 See the list on page 23. --------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Our inheritance is legal, indeed, and we received f rom him another inheritance: the Christian Religion, because he married a Christian Protestant named Janet, the daughter of John Lincoln, and converted to Christianity. Jonas was the one who translated this History to Po rtuguese , 15 dividing it into two Chapters and adding confirmed truths and the revelations of investigations. From him I inherited the History just as you see it . He and Janet, his wife, conceived the idea of publishing it. As events impeded his publishing it, he urged me not to spare any effort to do it. He told me once: “If the events that impede my publishing the Histor y persist, you, Samuel, must do whatever is possible to print it and publish it.” I, too, oh such bad luck! have had misfortunes beca use of my illnesses, as you see. If I am not cured, I ask you as your grandfather asked me. On y ou, George, on you alone depends the fulfillment of the testimony. From the text of this History, you now know that yo ur grand father, Jonas, was not of the descent of the founders of the Association. We deduce, then , that the violation of Jonas of the right of inheritance of this book and his adoption of the Ch ristian Religion were the reasons for his assassination and disappearance before fulfilling h is desires . Our efforts to find out how he died were in vain. It is a secret . Our original sect, the Jewish sect, on the whole, w ould know nothing of this secret, nor of the secret of the foundation of the Association, nor of its founders, except the nine men mentioned who descended from the first nine men who bequeathe d the respective copies with the secrets since the year 43 after Jesus . We must be grateful for his having made us heir to this precious History, through which we have learned that the Masonic Association was founded with the name of the Mysterious Force in the year 43 after Jesus and that its founders are of ou r original sect , 16 men of extraordinary cunning, as you will see and will admire. They gave it that name because, as they believed, t he force was born with it and would remain concealed in it, grow ing little by little, until the time of its revelation . At that time it had two goals: 1. The first, to impede the apostolate of Jesus’ me n and to combat their preaching 2. The second, to preserve political influence . But that Force did not grow so much due to its terr ible name . It prospered for a while within its magical occultism, and disappeared in another age a s a result of a criminal act committed by it, mysteriously, against one of its members, with no o ne ever knowing anything of the unhappy one who disappeared, nor how it was concealed; the fami ly members did not know the least detail and were ignorant of whether or not he were a member of the Association . Who knew that? Only the members. And of these, who would dare to reveal the secret? No one, because whoever did so paid with his life. That was their law, the strict law of savagery and occultism. 17 For the least contradiction or for the slightest doubt, a member was condemned to deat h . A tribunal of three judges determined the sentence of the accused , and in the greater number of cases by a simple rumo r concerning his conduct . The accused knew the accusation and the sentence at the moment of his assassination."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"That savagery in all its method and significance, i nstilled in that strict law, has as its principal purpose the combating of Jesus ’ men and the opposition of their preaching . Another very important goal existed: to fortify --------------------------------------------- 15 A lost version 16 Jewish. 17 Comment by Jonas : That law of such terrible occultism of the \"Mysteri ous Force\" still exists in Masonry . In it, the son enters as a robber, without the kn owledge of his parents. He eats, drinks, sleeps with them, under the some roof, while he is their political and religious enemy. He tries to impose his corrupt principles in the home; if he do es not succeed in it he reacts by causing suffering and finally the collapse of his own home. ---------------------------------------------- the Jewish element and to return the world to Judai sm 18 according to the very words of some ancient heirs. One of them pertains to the heir-suc cessor, Haron Levy , at the end of the third century after the “impostor” Jesus. Another text is recorded at the beginning of the seventh century, after the “impostor” Mohammed, founder of the Mohammed religion, who “claimed” to prophesy, as did the “impostor” Jesus. This text, that pertains to Levy Moses Levy and that is recorded in this book, manifests the “ Great disorder that the appearance of Mohammed caused among the mysterious ones themselves and the irrepressible hate toward his me n and followers .” It says also: “While the successors of King Agrippa insisted on the battle to crush the religious doctrine of Jesus in order to convert the world to Judaism, the cunning Mohammed appeared and fell over the Jews, especially over th e nine monopolizes of the secret , like a bolt of lightning .” We see then that the declaration of our ancestor, J oseph Levy, in the first quarter of the 18thcentury, several years before the changing of t he name of the Association, coincides exactly with the declarations of his ancestors mentioned in this book, passing from century to century to Jonas, my father, who was converted to Christianity . We see then, in all the texts of this History, that the fundamental principles of the Association are opposed to Jesus and His men, and later opposed to Mohammed and his men, its purpose being: to protect and to preserve only the Jewish r eligion . 19 Lawrence said: “All those texts coincide in that the principle pur pose of the Mother (the Ancient) Masonry is to annihilate Christianity, to destroy i ts foundations and to elevate the prestige of the Jewish religion. Today, in spite of its evol ution, it preserves the same purpose .”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Here Samuel again writes: Our ancestor, Joseph Levy , on seeing that those barbarous systems were impeding the attainmen t of the indicated objectives , and for the benefit of the progress of the Associ ation, proposed the idea of changing its name to a very wealthy contemporary Jew , who embraced the idea and promised his monetary aid. The two of them agreed to erase from the Copy the t ext of that intention so no one would know it except them and t he nine heir-successors . Levy, together with his son, Abraham, and his relat ive, Abraham Abiud (all descendants of the nine founders) journeyed to London, where they made an agreement with Desaguliers and George, and thus, after a long process, the renewal of the Association was completed, with its new name, FREEMASONRY, on June 24, 1717. “Freemason ry,” a word composed of a noun and an adjective (Free—Masonry), proposed by our ancest or, Levy, and approved by the collaborators on August 25, 1716 . From June 24, 1717 , the Association suffered important evolutions and changed its barbarous aspect; but, in what pertained to Occultism, it bec ome much more strict. 18 Words of' Dr. de Moraes : Based on my great experiences I am convinced that i t was Masonry that diffused the spirit of extremist liberty, the fountain of corruption . Extremist liberty was what crushed educational order, corrupted the human community and ignited th e fire of political passion in every territory. From it were born the sources of prostitution and i mmorality . Masonry, wanting to appropriate to itself the first fruits of the words, Liberty, Frat ernity, Equality, exaggerated In their explanations . Words originated by Christ Himself, who founded wit h them the three pillars of Humility and Love, to liberate the slave from his slavery, becau se men are all brothers in humanity, being sons of a single Father and they are equal in rights and in justice . Christ wanted to preserve the prestige of these three words and not leave them to the disposition of those with evil intentions and the extremists who explain them for their own p urposes. 19 With respect to this Janet said in 1818: \"I believe that Laicism has It. origin in the Assoc iation, the \"Mysterious Force,\" and is nothing but a branch of it .\" After reading this History and knowing all the hate unleashed against the two religions: the Christian and the Moslem, the fact that it was sole ly Jewish was confirmed to me, because to the present, it has not been heard that Masonry combats the Jewish religion . In the two worlds: the Christian and the Moslem we see that the Masons affiliate themselves at the beginning with all occultism. We see them, afte r receiving the fundamental secrets, denying their Masonic affiliation and less faithful to thei r religious creeds. Is there any doubt, then, that Masonry is the mortal enemy of these two religions’ ? The Masons, observing the general mistrust toward t heir Association, create a false front, establishing common Associations with other names b ut with the same ends to which they have join those people fearful of their name, for the pu rpose of snaring men and their money, thus"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"fortifying Masonry. The members of these common Associations then go on to be members of Masonry . The origin of all these deceits is Jewish , to revive Jewish principles. Her husband, Jonas , said, confirming it: “The Association of Freemasonry is the same Associa tion as the ‘Mysterious Force’ or ancient Masonry, Laicism being derived from it; Mas onry and Laicism, then, descend from the Association, the ‘Mysterious Force .’” In this way the Association progressed in a form co ntinued until it came to change the face of the world. With respect to the conversion of your grand father, Jonas, to Christianity, I will tell you that his fiancée, the Protestant girl, Janet , whom he “dearly loved, refused to contract matrimon y with him before his conversion to Christianity . You will see in the corresponding Chapter more details with respect to this. After concluding the translation of the History to Portuguese , 20 and while making efforts to reveal it to public opinion, he journeyed suddenly, for an urgent reason, to Russia . He left, at that time, the History, in the care of my mother and me. His j ourney did not last more than one year, and on returning, he involved himself in political affairs that took from him the time and the will to continue the printing of the History . A little while later, he had to make another voyage , from which he did not return . He died there, in the year 1825. No one knew anyt hing of his death. We received the History in two versions, one Hebrew an d one Russian. My mother always insisted on my publishing the Hist ory and one day she said to me; “Samuel! Samuel! In spite of the fact that your father died a victim of his Conversion to Christianity, and perhaps a victim of this History , I make known to you my unqualified desire of continuing your father’s task in order to publish this extraordinary work. You must determine to realize your dead father’s and my will. “ You know that there are nine original copies, in accord with the number of Found ers who bequeathed them to their successors down to our time . Three of the original copies were robbed and have disappeared, according to the texts of the History . The rest of the copies would be in the possession of the respective successors, whom we do not know. But we possess one of them . It is this one we have in our hands. You, Samuel, m ust preserve it zealously to comply with the will of your father and mine to publish th is History for religious, cultural and humanitarian benefit. No doubt the majority of the people will rejoice for the appearance of this History, even the members themselves of the Masonic Association. The entire world, above all the different religious and politi cal groups, will have indescribable joy. Samuel, observe and carry out my recommendations!” 20 Lawrence says: It is clear that the Portuguese version is lost, be cause my grandfather, Samuel , says that he received two translations, the Hebrew and the Ru ssian, and that he received them from my great-grandfather , Jonas . Then she said: “This History, my son, will also be of great importance for Women. These words are for them:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"“Woman! Since Creation you enjoy the greatest affec tion and respect in the world. Wise men, philosophers and great men have said of you” T he woman rocks the cradle with her right hand and shakes the world with her left. “To you then, virtuous women, I present this Histor y that it pleases me to call, ‘THE DISSIPATION OF THE DARKNESS,’ and to you I say: For my having influenced my husband, Jonas, the owner of this History, after hi s conversion to Christianity, and his being able to marry me, and for my having been the instigator of the idea of printing it and publishing it, you, too, must also share in the knowledge of its contents, to utilize what is within reach to convince men that Masonry is nothing but Judaism . To convince men that it was Masonry that made the pillars of na tions totter, that demolished the powers, that rejected religion. It was Masonry that shed rivers of innocent blood with its Jewish cunning. It was Masonry, Masonry! “Know that every event contrary to Religion has its origin in Masonry . . “By the monstrous exaggeration of the interpretatio n of the words : Liberty, Equality, Fraternity , the reins of human morals were loosened . It was Masonry that diffused disobedience to their duties in women, with the pur pose of spreading extremism, corruption and prostitution . These are the purposes of the Mysterious Force and its daughter, Masonry. “Any contact with a Mason inspires in us, in one wa y or another, if not the despising of Religion, coldness toward it. “Here is the example: in the countries where Masons abound, spirituality, honor and virtues diminish . It is a frightening danger that threatens Humanity. The consequences will be disastrous for y our daughters and sons and for the entire world. “You must, then, my friends, diffuse the facts in t his History at each meeting, in every home, because religion is the foundation of all virtue, honor and justice .” Thus ends the most valuable collaboration and Janet ’s message to women, the valuable communication of our ancestor, Janet, that will be heard for centuries. Let us return again to the conversation of my grandfather Samuel, with his son , George, ,my father, concerning the matter of the printing of the History. Samuel said: George, my son, I have exhausted the hope of my cur e and I feel a foreboding that my fatal day is near. How much I lament not having bee n able to carry out the will of my father and mother in regard to the printing of the book. Based on this, I repeat my Will to you: “Make the maximum effort to translate this His tory to the French and English languages and to other languages if it is possible. I leave in your care what your grandfather, Jonas, and your grandmother, Janet, or dered me to do, to publish the Book in whatever language I could. “You must not be frightened, George, by the details of the assassination of our ancestor, Joseph Levy, or of your grandfather, Jonas, because this History will be of great satisfaction for the Masons, who will know the orig in of their Association and the reason for their being deceived . It will cause them immense joy, as your grandmoth er, Janet,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"said. “The entire world will celebrate this discove ry and will applaud it, after having seen the greatest studies crumble when faced with this m ystery. “Come closer, dear son, so I may kiss you, bless yo u and bid you farewell because my hour approaches.” A few days after this Will, Samuel died, grieved at not having been able to carry out the will of his father and mother. Here I, Lawrence, return to add: My father, George died in 1884 (one year after the death of his father) of tuberculosis. Dur ing that year he translated the History to French only three months before his death . He gave me the History to translate to English be cause the English copy disappeared with Joseph Levy, its owne r. Behold his Will when he gave the History to me (I w as 15 years old): “My son, Lawrence, I give you this History, hoping you will guard it zealously. You are now the last one who has the obligation and respons ibility of realizing all those wills whose owners died but whose wills will not. You mus t carry out those wills in the printing of this History in any language possible. This History, buried alive, must be resurrected for the good of humanity. Now I make kn own to you my affection and tenderness, I bless you and I wish you all good for yourself and all of yours.” My father died at the age of 44, no less grieved th an his father and grandfather. I continued studying English until I mastered it, in order to t ranslate the Book to that language, always thinking of carrying out the desires of my father a nd ancestors, of publishing it in every language possible. Thus, I hold the hope that this sole and valuable work may dissipate the darkness that has covered the eyes of Masons and non-Masons for long centurie s . I hold the hope that this History, revealed, may put an end to the discussion concerning the sec ret of the origin of Masonry, this secret mysteriously kept among nine elders and their succe ssors consecutively, including our ancestor Joseph Levy, by whom the secret was transferred to my ancestor Jonas and from Jonas to me through my parents. I see that the hour for the revelation of this Book has come. For that reason, God willing, I will begin to translate it and publish it in every langu age possible. I end my words asking all the readers of this Book to render homage to those who conceived and recommended the idea of its publication and diffusion: Jonas and Janet. Comment of Awad Khoury concerning the Supplement The importance of the supplement that we add at thi s point is extraordinary because of its resume of the most important Masonic History published up to the present and because it is a valuable argument in favor of the accuracy of this secret Hi story. It incorporates a sincerity that confirms the exact coincidence between ancient Masonry, “ The Mysterious Force ,” 21 that was founded in the year 43 A.D. and its daughter, modem Masonry, t hat is called Freemasonry, born in the year 1717 ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"From the text of the following supplement, the elim ination of the last drop of the sea of doubts concerning the origin of Masonry is obvious. 21 Khoury: The learned man, Valette, author of this bo oklet calls ancient Masonry, \"Masonry before the year 1717.\" He does not call It by Its o riginal name, \"The Mysterious Force,\" because, it seem s, he 's not an heir of the secret, and con sequently does not know the truth. SUPPLEMENT “A” 22 In the beginning of the booklet, the learned brothe rs, Alf. Ls. Jacot and Ed. Ouartier la Tente say: “Every person who joins an association, is interest ed in knowing its origin and past.” The author then registers the opinion of some histo rians concerning this point, saying: The Masonic authors of the 18th century recognize that t he investigation of the history of the foundation of “Masonry is difficult. Dr. Anderson , 23 in his historic discourse in the year 1723 on the f undamental statutes, indicated that ancient Masonry began with Adam . Brother Briston said in the year 1772 that Julius Caesar , who died in the year 44 after Christ, was a Mason . The Druids 24 were Masons and Masonry began with Creation itself. Dr. Oliver , on the other hand, went even farther when he said : “Ancient Masonic legends say, and I am of this opin ion, that our Association existed before the creation of the terrestrial globe and that it was spread through the planets of the solar system.” Then Brother Michel did not go so far back as those above; rather he c oncentrated his investigations around the construction of the Temple of Solomon . Other brothers, with greater knowledge, such as Brother Harder , sought its origin among the heretics of the Middle Ages , especially the followers of Peter Waldo , declared a heretic in the year 1179. Other historians presume that Masonry was founded a mong the Chaldeans. Father Grandidieux attributed it to the German association , “ Steinmetzen” . Brother Nicolai attributed its origin to the “ Rosicrucian” societies. Others to the “ Templars.” An infinity of authors, historians and investigator s offer theories but none are certain of the origin of its foundation. On other pages of the booklet we see that associations of masons (construction workers) who held their meetings in four locations, existed in London. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"On page 26 we see a photo of an eating place with t he name of “ The Roasted Duck ,” in which the masons gathered on June 24, 1717 and unified their associations , 26 giving it the name of Freemasonry (free masons) and commissioning Anderso n with drawing up the fundamental laws. The four locations mentioned were called Lodges, an d these are their names, according to a list on page 27 of the booklet. - The first Lodge: “ The Roasted Duck ” (Eating place in the district of St. Paul Churchyar d) - The second Lodge: “ The Wedding ” (Eating place in Parker Lane, near Drury Lane) - The third Lodge: “ The Apple ” (Eating place on Charles Street, Covent Garden) - The fourth Lodge: “ The Big Cup and the Grape Cluster ” (Eating place on Chandler and Westminster) --------------------------------------------------- ---------------- 22 Synthesis of the booklet; “ Two Centuries of Freemasonry . Jubilee Volume, June 24, 1717.” Author: Theodore G. G. Valette , editor of “The Fraternal Union” of the Hague. 23 Khoury: His name is mentioned In the first section. 24 Priests of the Gallic religion. 25 Khoury: This coincides with what is written in the History in the first section, where it speaks of the existence of construction workers (masons) i n London before the changing of the name from the Mysterious Force to Masonry. 26 Here there is perfect coincidence with what is reco rded in the History, with respect to the great meeting on June 24, 1717, where the name of the Ass ociation was changed It was renewed and all the associations of masons, Protestants and oth er similar associations were amalgamated. ------------------------------------------- The abovementioned Lodges, whatever their condition , were formed by masons (construction workers) and other men of related occupations, insp ired always with fidelity to their original mission, related to architecture. Some authors cons ider that in 1717 the direction was changed and it “marched” in the path of “progress” that all the Community, Masonic or not, must follow. A more extensive plan was drawn up when, in the yea r 1721 (September 29), the Superior Lodge considered that the ancient Statutes were not compl ete, necessitating giving them another better, and more modem, form . 27"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"On page 29 of this booklet, the distinguished Broth er Robert Freko Gould , historian of Masonry, says the following: “The renewal consisted of the three following aspec ts: 1. The utilization of new terms such as ‘fellow craftsman’ and ‘entered apprentices .’ 2. Not to declare the degree of ‘master’ except in the Superior Lodge. 3. The abolition of the Christian religion, as the Masonic religion .” 28 Th. G. G. Valette comments: The third renewal is of extraordinary importance be cause it sets a limit of distinction between the Association of Masons (Construction wor kers) and Masonry itself. The learned Brother Albert Mackay said in this respect: The Association of Masons (the Masonry of Professio nal Masons) has never been tolerant nor popular because its principles have al ways been Christian, ecclesiastical, even to the point of fanaticism. The rebellion of many Masons 29 against that renewal (the one manifested by Gould) does not surprise us, then, although it was considered by us , the English Brothers, as acceptable as the elimination of every religious phrase in the French Grand Orient. 30 “That is what Anderson put in the fundamental statu tes, where our doctrine was strictly defined for us, a doctrine of good and faithful men , of honorable and upright men, who have left behind the bitter past sealed by Christia n fanaticism that, lamentably, lift up walls of division even now . “But our association is not to be understood as an attacker of the Christian religion. Many times it is said and we repeat here, that these thi ngs do not interest Masonry; it does not intervene either in politics or in religion. 31 --------------------------------------------------- ----------------- 27 Khoury: This coincides perfectly with the Hebrew ma nuscript in that Anderson and Desaguliers drew up new laws. It is evident, also, that Masonic authors consider the four lodges (eating places) as places to extend the reach of architectu re and construction, not knowing the other diabolic goals. 28 Khoury: Gould’s intention has the clarity of noon-d ay. He means that in Masonry the Christian religion is not necessary . What religion does he want? The Jewish! 29 Khoury: It is evident here that the brothers who ma nifested themselves as against such a renewal were Christians or Catholics, faithful ones who did not accept the abolition of the Christian religion in Masonry. Great numbers of the m abandoned the Association on knowing that intention."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"30 Khoury: His name is not mentioned. Behold the summa ry of what is published on pages 30 and 31 of Valette’s booklet , where his photograph and signature appear: “ We can say with all certainty that one of our great learned men in the Masonic Association acknowledged that, in 1723, the Christi an religion ceased being obligatory in Masonry . From this it can be noted that the Jewish influence prevailed over the influence of Desaguliers and Anderson, who, with their Jewish companions, mo dified the fundamental ancient statutes, as will be seen in the second section. 31 Khoury: Only an idiot would believe this. Permit us to call Mr. Valette’s attention to the fact that Anderson and Desaguliers put that text in the public statutes only to confuse, being believed by the people and by the Masons of recent affiliati on, as it was by the inferior mysterious ones in ancient Masonry. But on understanding that civil an d religious revolutions sprang from the fountains of Masonry, that text must be considered abolished and it is necessary to delete it from the Masonic statutes so no one is deceived. “We must also say, with all precisian, that the opp ression and rigor attributed to the Christian canons in the 18th century, obligated many men to seek refuge in the lodges, which increased admirably. In the interior of the lodge the man was free of ev ery religious chain, which is nothing more than the fou ntain of corruption . “For that reason, Masonry in the 18th century, began to permit tolerance, in accord with the text of the principles established by Anderson in the fundamental statute. The distinguished brother Portig in Prussia said: ‘Masonry is at its greatest prest ige,’ because truly Masonry in 1723, with Anderson’s statutes, re ached the peak of its prestige.” 32 The Hague, March 1917 (Signed): G.

On page 33, the author speaks of Masonry since 1717, what he ca lls “ New Masonry ,” detailing the lodges established in England, Ireland, Scotlan d, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, etc., wi th extensive explanations with respect to their manner of being established, the rapidity of the spread of new Masonry, the number of lodges in each city, etc. 32 Khoury: It Is understood from what we foreknow that Desaguliers and Anderson were of those Protestants characterized by their profound hatred of Catholicism and their greatest interest was in attacking it. Nevertheless, they used the phrase , “the abolition of the Christian religion. This phrase was motivated by the following: - First, the agreement between Desaguliers and Jose ph Levy obliged the former to accept it at the latter’s insistence. - Second, it will be seen in the second section tha t the wealthy Jew , Adoniram , succeeded Levy, imposing more conditions than Levy on Desaguliers , obliging him to accept them . Anderson, being an instrument and servant of Desagu liers could do nothing but express that phrase: “the abolition of the Christian religi on as the Masonic one,” not being able to specify “Catholicism” as was his preferred intentio n. 33 Khoury: This man could be a relative of the great D esaguliers, the companion of Joseph Levy in the renewal of the Association, or it could, be the same man himself, due to on error in the printing of the initials of the name. We know that Desaguliers was the one who had on argument with Levy over the presidency of the First Jerusale m Lodge and because of his refusal to return the two manuscripts, the Hebrew and the English, wi th this conflict leading to the assassination of Levy and the confiscation of all his documents. Abr aham Abiud, the owner of the original Hebrew of this History, gives us these valuable det ails in the second section, as well as the fact that Desaguliers did not attain the presidency, tha t the first lodge kept the name of Jerusalem from June 24, 1717 until September 17, 1719 when it was changed to the Superior Lodge of England. We do not know if Mr. Valette knows these truths an d hides them. But it is presumed that he is ignorant of them because it seems he is not one of the heirs of the history. --------------------------------------------------- - On page 50 the photo of Desaguliers appears with a résumé of his life, indicating that he was born March 12, 1683 and died in the year 1744; it i ndicates that he was the only man who distinguished himself by his fervent zeal in the re vitalization of the Association in the beginning of the 18th century. He merited the title of “Father of the New Masonry. ” The existence of the grand Lodge of England is due to his effort alone. From page 21 it is deduced that, notwithstanding th e indication of the name of Anderson as the one who established the first edition of the fundam ental statutes of the new Masonry, its forger and original observer was Desaguliers. If Anderson composed it, it was Desaguliers who believed it and dictated the fundamental themes and basic id eas. 34"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"On page 52 the author says that. the last days of Desaguliers were dark and enveloped in sadness and poverty . Brother Feller says in his book , “ Cabal Interpretation ,” that Desaguliers went mad in his last days, wearing his clothes inside out, dying in that lamentable state of madness . Brother Cutron said in the “ Moral Poem: The Vanities of Material Joys ,” that Desaguliers reached the depths of poverty before dying . 35 --------------------------------------------------- ------------------ 34 Khoury: Here there is complete agreement with our H istory; it is the fact that Desaguliers took from Levy the Hebrew and English copies in order to “adapt” the old statutes, as he deceived him. But it is certain that those two copies served him as a Constitution. With the collaboration of Anderson, he implemented the new statutes, correcti ng and modifying the old until they were converted into the “absolutely new,” according to D esaguliers and Anderson. According to them, also, they left nothing of the ancient except the f undamentals: the 33 degrees; the two columns, Booz and Jachin; the passwords; the three steps, th e three hammers, the occultism, etc., In accord with the solemn promises made by Desaguliers to Lev y and his successors, the heirs of the manuscript. 35 Khoury: It will be seen in the second section that the founder , Herod Agrippa , was blind in the lost days of his life and spent a long time in mise ry, suffering and unhappiness, dying in that disastrous state . ------------------------------------------------ Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Second Section CHAPTER ONE Narrative of the events in the successive Sessions transacted in the court of King Herod Agrippa , 36 that blossomed, culminating in the foundation of th e Masonic Association. Session of June 24 of the year 43 after Christ : How Hiram Abiud , Counselor of the King Herod, conceived the idea of founding the Masonic Associat ion, proposing it in the Court of Jerusalem . On that date Hiram presented himself before King He rod, expressing himself in the following terms:"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Majesty, when I saw that the impostor Jesus’ men an d their followers increased in number and endeavored to confuse the Jewish people with their preaching , I decided to present myself before Your Majesty to propose the f oundation of a secret association whose principles might attack those confusers with all the means within our reach to bring their corrupt and corrupting works to collaps e and to eliminate them , if it is possible. The King heard him, pleased, and said to him: Speak, Hiram! Majesty: It has been confirmed before Your Excellen cy and before all, that that Impostor, Jesus, has captivated, with his teachings and his a cts (both deceptive) the hearts of a part of the Jewish people, your people; and how it is ob vious that his partisans are multiplied day by day. It is evident, also, that since his appearance unti l and including his death, and from his death until today, we have not known how to attack efficiently those w hom we should call “our enemies’” nor have we been able to elimin ate all that is inculcated in the simple hearts of the people, all the teachings opposed to our religion, which are corrupt and false. We must recognize, although it may grieve us, that the multiple persecutions realized against that Impostor, and notwithstanding submitti ng him to justice, sentencing him and crucifying him: the result has been futile. Without effect our fathers battled tirelessly. We believe in their having conquered in the battle, bu t we have not obtained nor perceived even any sign of success . We contemplate, confounded, that the more arduous o ur battle is against his partisans, the greater is the number of his followers, and the number of sympathizers with the religion established by him i ncreases . It seems that there has been a hand, a force, secret, mysterious, that punishes us without our being able to offer resistance. It seems we have lost all our strength to defend our religion and our existence itself . Majesty, based on the evidence that there is no eff icacious means of incorporating our ideas, nor firm hope of attacking that force, undou btedly mysterious; there is no other path than to establish a Mysterious force, similar to that one (to attack mystery with mystery, in mystery) . I have come to the conclusion that it is our unav oidable duty, unless you have a better idea, to establish an Association of a greater power so it may assemble the Jewish --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- 36 Herod Agrippa Is king of Judea from the year 37 to the year 44 of our era .

It is f itting that no one know anything about its foundation, its principles and its actions. Only those whom Your Majesty may choose as founders will know the secret of the foundation . Only the active associates will know the important decrees . The central see will be this palace and we will found affiliates in all the cent ers that might be invaded by the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"preachers of the teachings that the Impostor publis hed with such audacity . Therefore, Majesty, what do you think of the creation of this longed-for force, with which we will attack and eliminate that hidden but real power tha t threatens our existence ? Speaking then, the King said: You know, oh Hiram , that your idea is glorious, it is worthy of your privileged intelligence, it could no t have come except from your heart, ardent with religious zeal, oh, genius of profound judgment! We must realize this project as quickly as possible . We must ask the opinion of Moab . 37 Then we will choose the men who will participate in the foundation with us. Summon Moab tomorrow. Do not let him know anything. I will inform him. ------------------------------------------ 37 Moab Is the first counselor of Herod Agrippa. [It seems like the Hiram, Moab and the 7 Others wer e Pharisees who believed and practiced Babylonian Magic and were answerable to the Demonic beings who in turn were answerable to the Satan, the Lucifer. These Pharisees, after real izing that the death (of Juda and ascension of Jesus) didn’t stopped the spread of true religion o f Adam, Noah, and Abraham (opposed to their brand of Cabalism), formed a secret society of 9 un known men and are today known as “Elders Of Zion”. Cabala or Kabbalah was a system to learn mystical k nowledge (same as Sufism). The basic of this system was Numerology, Astrology, Alphabets, A stronomy and spiritual awakenings of Chakras located in humans. The lowest one or the fi rst one is attributed to physical use of the laws of nature and mastery over the desires of fles h. Spiritually, All demonic forces, low level spiritual worlds like levels of hell and knowledge of Nature’s laws are associated with the Chakra located at the Navel. With the passage of time, kno wledge of the higher realms, worlds and powers were lost and the Pharisees became synagogue of Satan, stuck at the lower levels. Instead of being befriended with angels, those Pharisees st arted to allow Demonic powers (satanic powers) to rule over them. They were not able to go beyond Navel Chakras because flesh or mortal desires overcome them --TARIQ] ------------------------------------------- CHAPTER TWO The second meeting King Herod held with Moab Levy, his first counselor, and Hiram Abiud, on June 25 of the year 43 of our era. King Herod spoke first and said: What happened and what continues happening, my two companions, since the appearance of the impostor Jesus, deserves to occup y our attention."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"We must find a means to help us attack that sect of people that, in spite of their small number, confuses the people with their false teachi ngs. Moreover, those who adopt those falsities not only conform themselves by their adop tion, but practice them devoutly and, to fill the measure to overflowing, they publish th em courageously, without any fear, wherever they go. Let us note that the propagation of such teaching i ncreases day by day. Let us recognize that their followers, now perfectly identified with the cause, have separated themselves from our religion . Let us not doubt that those who waver today will so on fall in the snare of the deceit. To avoid this danger, no other alternative remains to us than to establish an Association whose object will be to incorporate secretly the sp irit of the Jewish Nation and to be able thus to crush that mysterious and criminal hand tha t directs that movement, and to silence its propaganda . If we do not succeed in this intention, many peop le, inclined toward the lies preached by that deceiver, will fall under his influence. Before the problem worsens, my dear friends, we mus t give it the importance it deserves. Let us now select the companions who will collabora te with us in the foundation. These must be possessors of proven honor, profound discre tion, great activity and immense zeal for the protection of the Jewish religion. I offer you, Hiram , our appreciation, for having been the suggester o f this idea: to found this Association for such a noble purpose. Speaking then, Hiram said: May God prolong the age of Your Majesty the King. All the merit bel ongs to Your Majesty; from your noble origin the entire nation takes grace; all the good the Nation possesses redounds from your blessing. I beg your Majesty the King to select our brothers and companions to form the Association. Then Herod named nine men, ordering Moab and Hiram to record their names, that is : The King, Herod Agrippa , Hiram Abiud , Moab Levy , Johanan , Antipas , Jacob Abdon , Solomon Aberon , Adoniram and Ashad Abia . CHAPTER THREE The Foundation of the Association, “ The Mysterious Force ” 38 The founders named, just mentioned, were summoned a nd they met, presided over by King Herod Agrippa. He began the session with the follow ing discourse: Dear Brothers: You are not the King’s men and his collaborators. Y ou are the support of the King and of the life of the Jewish people. Until now you have been his faithful followers. Fro m this moment on you will be his brothers . I give you this title of Brothers so you may evalua te my sentiments toward you and the tenderness you wrest from me for the purpose that h as brought us together here in this"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"important session I give you this very affectionate title to demonstrate to you that, in spite of being your King, I am your brother in the Jewish nation, in the Jewish religion, for which my heart overflows with love and devotion . All reasons that oblige me, from now on, to help you and be faithful to you. Above all w e need to be brothers in order to begin properly the undertaking for which I have called yo u and which will be of great benefit for our country. Each one of you knows, without doubt, the obligatio ns towards one’s brother. From this moment on, I want you to know that I have linked my self to you with the obligations of a brother. These obligations are greater than those o f a King toward his subjects, for the betrayal of a King is not improbable, but the betra yal of a brother impossible . Let us all understand then, and let us not forget, that this fundamental meeting realized by this new group is based on Brotherhood. On this Bro therhood we will build our edifice; and that title of tenderness, “ Brotherhood ,” will be the cornerstone of our edifice until the end of time . My Brothers: The aristocracy as well as the common people have p erceived the spiritual and even political revolt that the appearance of the Imposto r Jesus has caused among the people, and especially among our Israelites. Since that man arose, preaching those false teachin gs and inculcating that spirit that he pretentiously called the “divine spirit,” numerous persons whose spirits are confused and corrupted are joining him. He attributed divinity t o himself. Being nothing but an indigent, he disputed with us over the Kingdom. We have noted a great power in him, which he left as an inheritance to that group he ca lled disciples . He founded an Association that he called a religion, it being cal led that by them as well. This supposed religion is at the point of overturning the foundat ions of our religion and demolishing it . Being nothing but a humble one and an impostor, he adopted the name, “Jesus of Nazareth, ‘King of the Jews.” He claimed to have be en conceived by a divine power and born of a virgin, one who remained a virgin even af ter having given birth. He exaggerated in this deceit and fraud until affirmin g that He was God, the Son of God, and the One sent by God, doing everything that God does . He attributed to himself the gift of prophecy and t he power of performing miracles. He claimed to be the hoped-for Messias of whom our pro phets announced the coming; not being anything but a vulgar man like the rest of th e people, devoid of any feature of the Divine Spirit, withdrawn to the extreme from the re ctitude of our firm Jewish doctrine, from which we are determined not to deviate in even one point. --------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------- 38 This name, was suggested by King Agrippa for the purpose of attacking the Divine force, mysterious according to them, with a similar force, but how different is the Divine from the human! --------------------------------------------------- -"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Never will we recognize such a person as the Messia s, nor will we recognize his divinity. We know that the hoped-for Messias is not yet among us, nor has the time of his coming arrived. Nor has any sign been exhibited that might indicate his appearance. If we commit the error of letting our people follow him and be d eceived, we convict ourselves of an unforgiveable crime . He was submitted to justice and sentenced to the maximum penalty. He was chastised and injured like the greatest of c riminals. He bore all that with extraordinary patience that astonished everyone. Fi nally, we crucified him, he died and we buried him, leaving guards who watched the tomb. But it was claimed that he was risen, resurrected! Abandoning the tomb. We did not find out how his “resurrection” happened, nor did the guards . No one doubted the loyalty of those posted at the t omb because they were from among his enemies . He disappeared in an unknown manner, in spite of the zealous vigilance and the security of the closure. His followers later claimed to have been with him ( living), as he was before his death; that is, with his body and spirit. They spread the news, then, that he ascended to Heaven and that he will come on the day of Final Judgment to judge the living and the dead . His leaving the tomb , my friends, was a decisive blow for his rivals; i t was a powerful means that encourages his men to continue spreading his teachi ngs and to prove the confirmation of his divinity . Brothers: That was a severe blow that our fathers suffered, d emolishing their force and ours as well. His partisans dispute with us over religious authority and temporal authority; with the first to attack our religion and with the secon d to take the Kingdom from us. We will not recognize, on any point, a religion oth er than ours, the Jewish religion that we have inherited from our ancestors . Duty calls us to preserve it until the end of tim e. That blow had never been expected. That mysterious force had never been dreamed of. Our fathers attacked it and we continue attacking i t. In spite of everything, astonishing! Their number increases. Observe with me how the son is separated from the father, the brother from his brother, the daughter from her mot her, all alienating themselves to join that group. This affair encloses a great secret. Ho w many men, how many women, how many entire families have abandoned the Jewish reli gion in order to follow those impostors, those partisans of Jesus. How many times they were threatened by the priests and authorities, in vain! Brothers: There is something that we must not ignore. Since t hat impostor Jesus began his teaching and preaching years ago -I beg you to consider this among the secrets we must keep he spoke to the people like a man, in spite of his you th. Our fathers asserted it, having been witnesses present. Our fathers gathered in the corridors of the temple , they deliberated and discussed what would have to be done to destroy that danger that threatened the Jewish religion. They did not omit using even a sin gle means to serve, in that way, the Jewish religion and nation. If this enthusiasm had not intervened, the number of Jesus’ partisans would be much greater. Now then: if our fathers have triumphed partially i n impeding the people from following the confusers, they have done so without any associ ation, without a spirit of unity,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"without a strong official league. How successful wi ll it be, then, if we found this Association? Will it not be astonishing? I swear by my life! I swear by Reason! That we will attain all our desire, we will attain our longings, not only of impeding the Jews from following that c onfusing force, but of crushing that force and its leaders . Although we may not reach that ultimate phase, that of final triumph, we will at least liquidate that terrible current that threatens our nation; thus we will save its existence, and the name, Jew, will not be blotted out. It would be fatal if we did not imitate the enthusi asm of our fathers, for if we do not persist in the cause opened by them, know from this point on that the Jewish nation will be blotted out and not a single trace of it will re main. We cannot tolerate our silence, being the leaders of the destinies of the nation. W ould we, by our silence, commit a crime against ourselves, against our children, against ou r grandchildren and against all our descendants? Then. brothers, in order to exchange i deas and reach an agreement about the foundation of an Association that endorses the intention mentioned and explained, I have called you to this meeting of a private, polit ical and religious nature. We will strike, thus, the first of our blows at all those followers of the imposter, especially those outstanding in the villages , who excel in deceit; for in each one of those vil lages an affiliate of the Association will function. We will not be able to diminish them without a gene ral league that unites us all and to make the formation of that league possible it is ne cessary that the principal center be here. Let us not have the slightest doubt that our Associ ation will be of very great importance and of invincible power, with which we will cast to the ground that mysterious force and every thing built by Jesus, his disciples and his p artisans. I have chosen you and called you from among my peop le, demonstrating the confidence I have placed in you; if it were not so, I would not have attempted this secret. I ratify my hope that you will unite your hearts, bodies, words and acts with mine. This is my faith in you; this is my adherence to the religion and to th e nation. I believe you value my confidence in this affair. How do you respond to wh at I have told you? You must keep the secret! Adonirom arose and speaking for all those present before th e King said: Majesty: because of the great emotion that seizes m e, I take upon myself the privilege of speaking in my name and in that of my brothers, my present companions. I do not doubt that the loyalty of these brothers toward the natio n is any less than yours or mine. If our desires and longings are united, then our hearts wi ll be as well. Thus, we have a single heart in several bodies. To this heart we will unit e thousands of other hearts and we will incorporate them to it. How can this not be carried out if Your Majesty has already placed the first stone in this edifice, if he has placed t he cornerstone on a foundation as firm as “Brotherhood?”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A marvelous title, as is its suggester. Majesty, we salute you and we salute the Jewish nation incarnate in your person. Who among us does not offer his service to these ideals, on hearing your so certain and sweet words? Who amo ng us does not rise like a lion to attack those defrauders, to kill them and to kill their partisans, even thou gh it may be one of our sons ? We are all hopeful that the league alluded to by Yo ur Majesty will spring from our Association. From it will be born a very great force with which we will eliminate that magic power of the Impostor and we will defeat his partisans . Thus we will save our Kingdom, which will be prolonged until the end of t he world. Then Adoniram, directing his glance toward his comp anions, said to them: What is your reply?” To which they all cried as one: We approve everything that you have said. Then King Agrippa said: I am grateful to you; I appreciate your enthusiasm; I appreciate your zeal. The confidence you have placed in me pleases me a great deal. Let us meet again, then, the day after tomorrow, to found the Association and to take the oath of sincerity and fidelity. We will begin our work immediately. Hiram , who was entrusted with writing what was manifested in this session , said: Majesty, dear Brothers: Because of his great courtesy, His Majesty has attr ibuted to me, his faithful servant, the merit for the conception of the idea of founding th is Association. It is my duty to offer my gratitude to His Highness and dear Majesty. I as k permission of my Lord to make known a final word concerning the subject in this s ession: In spite of my being the creator of the idea and the expounder of it before His Maje sty, I must acknowledge the merit of its having been approved, embraced and protected; w e must keep in mind his firm will of carrying out this Association, of bearing it to tri umph, which will be the triumph of the nation and the religion. Therefore, I ask you, Brothers, to approve the reco rding of the name of His Majesty with the title of Founder, in the Register of the Associ ation. Moab Levy speaking, said: You are doing well, Hiram, by your fidelity and sub mission to our Lord; we accept and acknowledge your renunciation of this right that we all acknowledge as His Majesty acknowledges it. We share your fidelity with you an d we agree with the request. Let the name of His Majesty be noted in the records as foun der. Hiram so noted it and said:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Does it please my Lord that the name of the Associa tion be the “ Jewish Fraternal Union ?” The King replied: No, Hiram. Yesterday I have prepared another name. “ The Mysterious Force .” Do you all approve it? They all answered: Indeed, we approve it. The name was recorded. The King said: Let all be pr esent the day after tomorrow so each one of us may take the oath corresponding to his responsib ility. And the meeting was closed. CHAPTER FOUR The Frightful Oath In the presence of the nine Founders, the King, pre siding over the session, began it, saying: My Brothers: I have no doubt of your sincerity and affection. We know that your respective functions are in direct relationship with the Jewish religion and nation, with the country and the king; for that reason we must bind ourselves by on oath that each one of us must take in the presence of the others. I have composed its text and I have called it the FRIGHTFUL OATH . I will be the first to take it. I will read its formula to you before t aking it officially, so you may approve it if it seems complete to you. And the King began the reading of the text of the O ath. Text of the Oath: “I, (John Doe, son of John Doe), swear by God, the Bible and my honor, that, having become a member of the nine founders of the Associa tion, ‘The Mysterious Force,’ I bind myself not to betray my brothers, the members, in a nything that might harm their persons, nor to betray anything concerning the decr ees of the Association. I bind myself to follow its principles and to realize what is pro posed in the successive decrees approved by you, the nine founders, with obedience and preci sian, with zeal and fidelity. I bind myself to work for .an increase in the number of it s members. I bind myself to attack whoever follows the teachings of the impostor Jesus and to combat his men until death . I bind myself not to divulge any of the secrets prese rved among us, the nine; either among outsiders or among the affiliated members. “If I commit perjury and my betrayal is confirmed in that I have revealed some secret or some article of the decrees preserved among us and heirs this commission of eight companions will have the right to kill me by whatev er means available .”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The King repeated the reading of the Oath three tim es so that all might understand it well before its being recorded. Hiram said: My Lord, the King: The text of this Oath is solely for us, the Founder s; therefore, there must be another formula for the affiliates . For as Your Majesty has said, no one other than w e must know the secrets of the foundation. The King replied: I know all this, Hiram; this Oath is solely for us. On finalizing the foundation we will prepare the general Oath. You must know, moreover, that all those who are our heirs must bind themselves with our Oath. The King continued. Brothers: You have seen that this Oath is horrifying, frightf ul. Each one of us must mediate on it before taking it, for oath binds the Founder with c hains of steel. It chains him to the brotherhood, it chains him to the fundamental princ iples whether they be innocent or corrupt. It chains him with obedience to the orders and decrees of the commission and with the fulfillment of everything decreed, good as well as bad. It obliges him to attack the Impostor’s men and to kill them in any way poss ible. It obliges him to be a perfect guardian of the decrees of the Association, even in front of his own sons, except the one who will be the trustee as heir to the secret. Just as he is obliged to carry out orders to kill, so also he is obliged with respect to the div ulgence of something prohibited, that the Association judges expedient for the preservation o f the Jewish religion. He is even obliged to sacrifice everything dear to him to serv e its principles . That is why, I repeat to you, because we must media te on this because this Oath is not only for us, but also for our sons, our grandsons, our descendants A proposal of that, I want to reveal to you one of the secrets of my fath er and of my grandfather , Herod the Great . They gave secret orders to kill all those they coul d of the partisans of the Impostor . My father informed me that all those who carried ou t the orders were punished in their property, in their health, in their childr en, with all kinds of illnesses and with a horrible death . I inform you of all this so you may know that, afte r taking the Oath, we are all bound in such a way that we will not be able to release ours elves, repenting for what is committed being of no avail. And do not forget, Brothers, that we and only we, t he nine will be the “Chained Ones, ” and the ones responsible because the Internal Law that we will sanction tomorrow will be known only by us and will be the p atrimony of our heirs only, who will receive it successively until the complete eradicat ion of the impostors. Whoever will enter the Association with us or with our heirs wil l never know anything of the internal secrets nor of the fundamental goals ."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Let each one of us copy the formula and take it to study it before taking the Oath. Let It be known that the first stone of our edifice will b e this frightful Oath. You may leave and the day after tomorrow you will come to decide if t he Oath will have these terms or if the text is to be changed. CHAPTER FIVE The horrifying oath of the founders The nine founders being present, the King declared the session open and asked the opinion of all concerning the Oath. It was accepted unanimously an d recorded. Immediately they agreed to take it to complete the foundation of the Association. The King took the Bible, placed it on a table and s aid, Do as I do. He placed his right hand on the Bible, everyone imitated him, beginning with Moab L evy, Hiram Abiud, etc. Then each one of them held in his other hand the paper with the text of the Oath. The King was the first to take the Oath; Moab followed him, then Hiram, and the others until the last. The Oath taken, each one returned to his place and the King gave the following discourse: Brothers: Now our Association, “The Mysterious Force,” is fou nded. Its force, acts, principles and goals will be mysterious forever. Thus we will be a ble to eradicate the fallacies of Jesus and his followers. We have now made ourselves broth ers. We must form a true brotherhood, different from that which the Impostor claimed to form, a brotherhood of deceit and witchcraft. Our brotherhood is truthful, it is the foundation and the backbone of our Association. Now that we are chained and bou nd to the chains, let each one of us prepare himself for the work; the work consists in killing by whatever means possible the disseminators of the teachings of Jesus. This is ou r noble intention, this is our religious and political goal. Now that we have confederated our hearts here, let us trust that we will attain the formation of the National League that will unite us and dignify our Jewish existence and essence. Only with this league will we defeat our e nemies and crush their forces, those forces that claim to nullify our religion in order to perpetuate the deceits inherited from the Impostor, their Chief. In short, I tell you tha t the foundation of our acts must be: fidelity, discretion and the cruel courage to elimi nate them . On delivering these secrets to our sons, let us inculcate these principles in heri tage. They, in turn, will bequeath them to their sons so that our principles and secrets will continue in an hereditary and sound manner from one century to the next, and thus forev er. We know that the impostor Jesus attributed to himse lf the performance of miracles. He said that he was the Son of God, that he himself wa s God. Could there be greater impudence? Besides, he has spread many other false concepts, which, faced with, we cannot nor must not keep silent; for example, his m anifesting himself as King of the Jews. Do you not see in that claim imprudenc e, impudence and unqualified insult?"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Thus our fathers judged it. That is why they attack ed him; that is why they persecuted his partisans. And that is what inspires us to establis h an Association that may continue the battle. For, without an association, some of them s ucceeded in attaining great and unforgettable triumphs in that field. Two villages that you know, where they killed three followers of Jesus, served as an example to the rest. With the fate of those three, not a single inhabit ant of those villages and their vicinities dared to follow those preacher s. Up to the present we have no knowledge of anyone’s having joined the impostors o r of their having returned to these villages. Such a measure being crowned with such gr eat success without a league or association behind it, can you imagine the magnitud e and the benefit that will be attained with the foundation of our Association? With the will of God, we will blot them from the ea rth, one by one. Thus we will escape the danger of the teachings of their Chief, the Imp ostor. Brothers: I would not have revealed these secrets to you if I had not had the will to ratify my great confidence in you. But I want to reveal to you the profound conviction of our faith in the frightful oath we have taken. From this day on you will relinquish from your heart all doubt, fear, betrayal or perfidy. In this course I will be the example so that from today on we will be a single soul and a single heart. Each one of you, in turn, must be an example for ev ery affiliate. And now, let us rejoice in the inauguration in order to march with gravity and diligence on the path of great success. Brothers, it is the duty of each of us to have a copy of all that has occurred and been written to date and hereafter . Thus each one will have a history of our acts, whic h, although limited, will be the inheritance that he will pass to his son fro m generation to generation ; it will last with the advancing of days and the passing of time as long as the followers of Jesus the Impostor exist on earth. The King stood, followed by the eight; he said: Now let us toast ourselves with a smiling face and a pure heart. Let us toast our brother Hiram with preference; let us applaud and exclaim t hree times: Long live our principles! Long live our Association, until the end of time! A ll the others exclaimed: Long live our King! And the King cried: Long live the Jewish reli gion, long live the Jewish nation! Then he said: The next session will be held six days from now. In this interval you will copy the articles of the sessions held to date so each one may have h is own. Mine will be written by Hiram."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX Foundation of the first lodge, called the “Lodge of Jerusalem” The nine Founders presented themselves. The King, a s President, inaugurated the session, saying: Dear Brothers: Each association must have a private see where its active members meet. This hall, where we have realized our fundamental meetings, will not serve for our secret meetings. We must install a see that will be called the Lodge of Jerusalem . This Lodge must be located in a hidden corridor where no one will see us nor h ear our decrees . I take this opportunity to call your attention to an affair of utmost impor tance. We have said that we must increase our Association until thousands of people join, thus increasing our strength. But if it should come to be known that this Association has been founded at this time, it will cause fear and reaction, and consequently, the alie nation of a part of the people, especially in these critical times in which the rev olution of that Impostor continues increasing its strength. We nine are the cornerston e of this splendid edifice which is “The Mysterious Force.” Let us consider, then, the instruments for the cons truction of this edifice. Let us saturate ourselves with the grandeur of our mission in this political and religious work that would not exist if it were not for us, for without masons and instruments there is no edifice. Obviously, we are the reason for the existence of t his edifice. I desire, and I ask that you accept with me, the making of this edifice the most magnificent of palaces . And how? With Occultism. And what does this Occultism mean? Listen: The best means of making our association, besides g rand and important, exciting, is to hide the date of its foundation, the names of its f ounders, our names, from every affiliate, whoever he may be . These secrets will be guarded by the nine of us and each one of us will pass it on as an inheritance to one of our son s, the most serious, the most secretive, when he reaches 21 years of age . His own brothers must know nothing. What we must say, then, to the affiliates is that this Association is very ancient , no one knows anything about the date of its foundation, no r of its founders; it was dissolved and dead until a little while ago . As there will certainly be opposers, we will sati sfy their doubts telling them: King Herod found in his father’s treasury ancient papers that indicate the existence of a most ancient associatio n , said papers containing signs and laws . And it pleased him so that he wanted to revive it ; and truly he revived it, in accord with what was written in the documents. With this legend we will hide the date of the found ation and the goal of the Association. This will be our principal weapon. Occultism will b e a disguise even for our brothers although they reach the highest of degrees; in rega rd to these degrees, I must let you know beforehand that with brothers Moab and Hiram w e will make different degrees for the associates and, once in order, we will make the m known so you may give us your"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"opinion. What’s more, we will hide all the decrees issued by us nine. Besides, it will not escape your profound discemment that the absolute concealment will provoke the desire to enter our Association, to know the occult. There will be other secrets, secondary ones, that t he brother will only be able to know after taking the General Oath, the text of which we will study in the next session. The Oath will oblige him to keep the secret. Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Chapters 7 to 19 CHAPTER SEVEN The General Oath On August 10, the nine founders met, presided over by the King, who opened the session saying: Dear Brothers: We, the founders, have outlined our fundamental mis sion, We have evaluated our responsibility faced with the horrifying and privat e Oath that we have taken. Now we must study the text of the oath that those who desi re to join our Association must take. I will read its text and if you approve it, we will d ecree it and record it. It will be called the general Oath. Text of the General Oath that every affiliate must take “I, John Doe, son of John Doe, swear by God, the Bi ble and my honor that, since I have been accepted as an affiliate and member in the Ass ociation, ‘The Mysterious Force,’ not to betray my brothers (its members), in anything th at might harm their persons or malign the decrees of the Association, to fulfill in every thing what its active members decree and not to reveal anything of its secrets to anyone. If I betray this oath, my throat will be cut and any type of death will be permitted for me .” Brothers: If the affiliate is Jewish we will make the truth k nown to him, that is, that the goal of the Association is Jewish union ; and if he is not a Jew we will not permit him to understand anything, but then we must have assured ourselves t hat we are not dealing with a spy or partisan of our enemies. As he progresses up the sc ale of the degrees of the Association,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"he will be advanced little by little in the knowled ge of the primordial goals and at an opportune moment it will be revealed to him that th e fundamental goal is to kill the partisans of Jesus and to preserve the Jewish relig ion. Then there will be no need to oblige him, for he will do so with all enthusiasm. Let us not forget that the greatest of the fundamental secrets, hermetical ly guarded, is the date of the foundation and the names of the founder s . If they ask us .we must hide the truth, lie, lie in the interests of the Association , the Jewish religion and the Jewish nation . Thus we must answer. “ In a room in the palace of King Herod the Great papers were found that contain ancient Egyptian laws, signs and symbols with mysterious words concerning this Association. Said papers were inher ited from our remote ancestors of a date impossible to know. Do they date back to Solom on, David or Moses, or to earlier epochs? We do not know .” How does this reply seem to you? Will you approve i t? Yes, they all said; and it was recorded. It is clear here that the goal of ancient Masonry w as solely the preservation of the Jewish religion. The new Masonry, that Is, after the year 1717, trip led Its goal: one port (the Jews) preserved the ancient principles ; the second group embraced the principles of Desaguliers, that is, t o attack Catholicism ; and the third group adopts the principles of naturalism and nihilism . CHAPTER EIGHT The manner of joining Hiram said: King Herod Agrippa, Moab Levy and Hiram Abiud agreed on a special form for those whom they wish to join the Association. They hold t hat the form of affiliation should be different from and superior to that of all associat ions, companies or brotherhoods— this being done for the purpose of creating prestige amo ng the affiliates, who, besides attaching great importance to it, will have to fear it . We will make this objective easier, saying we have inherited this form mentioned, we ha ve found it among the papers found by King Herod in the coffers of his father. And tha t is how we wish to preserve the memories of our ancestor founders of this Associati on, also we will preserve the rest of the relics that remind us of their zeal for the Jew ish religion and people; preserving all these memories we will fulfill our Jewish religious and civil obligations. This version, Majesty, must be anther of the secret s known only by us, the nine founders. What do you think of this, my Lord? The owner of th is Manuscript. Your idea is commendable, Hiram. My opinion is to b andage the eyes of the postulant so he may see absolutely nothing of the temple until a fter the oath. While outside, his eyes will be bandaged; the porte r delivers him to the sponsor, who, in turn, conducts him toward the President, telling hi m in his ear to take three steps, beginning with the right foot. Then, he makes him p ass between two columns. This act"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"symbolizes that the outsider, the stranger, the for eigner is, before entering, in darkness, and joining us and taking the oath he is transporte d from darkness to light, the Jewish religion being represented by the light . The president calls him and makes him swear to the oath. The president will have in his hands a sword whose blade will be over the neck of the postulant. In front of him and in the hands of the sponsor will be the Bible (Torah). The oath taken, the bandage is removed and he finds himself with a sword held over his head and in front of his eyes the Bible and a light . Then the sponsor puts a small apron on him that s ymbolizes his affiliation with us to participate in the construction of the walls of our edifice, which is the fortification of the Jewish religion and the pr otection of its existence. His explanation finished, the King said to his two companions: Do you approve this? They answered in the affirmati ve. On the following day the nine founders were summoned and informed about the manner of join ing, the lecture effected by Hiram. All approved it, it being noted in the record. CHAPTER NINE In the interior of the Temple Designation of the tasks of the Founders King Agrippa said: We all know that our edifice is constructed on the foundations of brotherhood. In spite of the fact that brotherhood and trust are our emblems , each one of us will have his specific mission, which he will carry out with all fidelity, with all zeal. I believe we must begin by assigning a commission t o each one of us who will accept, confirming in that way their adherence to the princ iples of the Association and submitting to any sacrifice for its service. Each one must, be fore his colleagues, demonstrate to be imitated, two qualities: humility and conformity, s o all may know that there is no room in his heart for envy. That is, each one will accept h is commission without envying his colleague; thus your abnegation will be proven. Whe n you will know your respective commissions, if anyone has any objection, he must reveal it; or, if he does not, we will record his approval . • President: King Herod Agrippa • Vice President: Hiram Abiud • First Secretary: Moab Levy • Second Secretary: Adoniram • Observer: Johanan • First Assistant: Abdon • Second Assistant: Antipa • Sponsor: Aberon • Porter: Abia"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"All approved the distribution of the commissions, i t being noted in the records of the Association. Johanan proposed that the name of the meeting place be Temp le, claiming to Immortalize the Temple of Solomon . In 1717 it was changed to the name of Lodge . In the new Masonry, the title of Assistant was changed by Desaguliers . Note also that at the beginning no money was required because ther e was no treasurer . The member who is in charge of the affiliation of those who solicit entry. The King said: You already know that we must make everyone believe that our Association is very ancient. And so there may be no doubt about the leg end of the “found papers,” we will place in our temple Symbols from ancient times, suc h as those Solomon used in his Temple . We will erect two Pillars as Solomon did in the Tem ple . We will call the first BOOZ and the second JACHIN . One will be to the right; the other to the left. We will say also that our brother , Hiram Abiud, is Hiram Abiff , the Great Syria1 Architect called by Solomon for the construction of the Temple . These two subterfuges must be noted in the general principles of the Association. We will reinforce this deceit with the use of the i nstruments of construction that the architect Hiram utilized in the construction, such as the Square, the Compass, the Trowel, the Scales, the Hammer, etc., all of wood as Hiram Abiff had them. It is fundamental that the front of the Temple must face the East, a point that I will explain to you later . I believe also that we must adopt symbols inspire d by the firmament, such as the stars, the sun and the moon, symbols that remin d us more of antiquity . We will also utilize other symbols to recall the impos tor Jesus, the images of which we will select so they may be adopted by our sons and grand sons who inherit this History together with the administration of our new Associa tion. This is what I wanted to consult with you with resp ect to the form and aspect of the temple we have founded and the responsibilities we have thus acquired and decreed in this blessed week, blessed week! Now, what do you t hink? Unanimously they gave their enthusiastic approval t o the words of the King, noting it in the records. [It seems that the King knows much about the occult than the others -- TARIQ] CHAPTER TEN The preparation of the Instruments and Symbols King Agrippa said: Our general union pleases me a great deal because t hus we will be a single heart and a single hand. This indicates that we have no envy, t hat we have no pride. Alleluia! 39 We"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"have completed, thanks be to God, the task of the f oundation of the Temple, and we have, in principle, agreed on the choice of symbols, over coming all disagreement and all envy. Alleluia! We have prepared some symbols in conformance with w hat was decreed in the previous session. Here are the two pillars: Booz 40 and Jachin. 41 Here also are some builders’ instruments that are made of wood in order to verif y that our Association dates from Solomon’s Temple or perhaps earlier, because the in struments utilized in the construction of Solomon’s Temple were all of wood. Let us erect the two pillars, one at the right and the other at the left. Let us bless them. We bless these instrument and we also bless these v arious symbols of Jesus 42 that represent, ironically, some episode of those that t he Impostor spoke of during his preaching in his instructions and blasphemies, such as the cock, the sword, the light, the darkness, the hammer, because of its being the inst rument that was used to nail his hands and his feet, and with it we will open all the sess ions, emphasizing this irony. Every session will be opened by striking three times cons ecutively with this hammer; thus we will remember eternally, through the centuries, tha t we have crucified him and that with this hammer we have fixed the nails in his hands an d feet, killing him . These three stars you see symbolize the three nails . We would be able to change them for three points that VI have the same significance. Among our symbols wi ll be the three steps, ridiculing with them this blasphemy: God is Father, Son and Ho ly Ghost, with his claiming to be the Son. Within our Association, we will make degrees, as we have mentioned previous ly . These will be thirty-three, symbolizing the age of the im postor . We will give a name to each degree and we will create other similar symbols. All these things were my idea and those of brothers Moab and Hiram . The meaning of these ironic symbols must not be perceived; it must remain among the nine of us . For the other brothers or affiliates it is enough to make them see the utilities and instrumen ts so they may believe that the Association was founded in the times of Solomon or earlier than this. Any brother can propose a new symbol. What do you think and observe, brothers, concerning what I have presented to you. The six men 43 approved without objection, everything being record ed. Then the King said: Let us rejoice! Let us begin the march on the path to triumph! Let us take our first three steps! Let us strike three times with this victorio us hammer, with the symbol of death for our enemy the Imposter, the symbol of the establish ment of our honorable principles that we fix with the nails of brotherhood and union! Let us all exclaim with joy: Onward to Victory! --------------------------------------------------- 39 Praise God. 40 Symbol of strength."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"41 Symbol of firm establishment. 42 Referring to Jesus, but not conceding the word ‘Chr ist.’ Translator’s note. 43 The King, Hiram and Moab being the ones who conceiv ed the Idea as of the symbols. --------------------------------------------------- --- CHAPTER ELEVEN The First Session and the First Temple On November 4 of the same year, 43 A.D ., the first official session was realized in the first temple of Jerusalem , which was a basement in the Palace of King Agrippa . The nine founders began their works preparing the i nstruments of construction made of wood and creating a new symbol: the apron that symbolized th e protection of the clothing from the mud; all this to conceal the true purpose and to assure the affiliates of the antiquity of the Association. The King-President said: I, with my authority as President (And not as King) grant each one of you the 33rd degree, the highest degree in our Association . From now on, each of you will enjoy this high degree. But I want to mention something to our brother, Hiram, hoping you may, agree with me. I wish to make the 3rddegree special, and call it Hiram’s degree , because he is the one who merits the distinction, the grati tude and the immortalization for being the first who founded the idea of founding this Ass ociation. He is the creator of this glorious idea. I grant him also the title of Master , because I consider, and you will consider it so with me, that Hiram is the Master . He is the one who deserves the title that the Impostor Jesus falsely attributed to himse lf . We will call this third degree, “the degree of Master Hiram.” And since our brother Hiram is orphaned of his fath er since childhood, knowing no one other than his widowed mother, I propose to call ou r Association, “The Widow,” asking your approval. From now on the name of the founders will be “ The Sons of the Widow .” Each member of the Association will call himself a son of the w idow until the end of time because we believe that our Association will live until the en d of time. For all that we honor our brother Hiram, we will not succeed in esteeming his grand favor. We must honor him still more. But the title of Widow agrees with the object of our Association because the widow always needs help and aid, this title being t he symbol of the co-operation and help among us, besides recognizing Hiram’s work. Do you’ approve all this? Everything was approved and recorded."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE Preaching to attract affiliates The nine founders, with the exception of the King, 44 began the campaign for the inscription of affiliates in the Association. They dispersed primarily in the city of Jerusalem, noting the names of the solicitants, taking them to the Temple and making them inscribe without maki ng known to them the real purposes of the Association (to attack Jesus’ men). After having ta ken the oath, they informed them of the true goals. They inculcated in them that this Associatio n, “The Mysterious Force,” existed since the most remote antiquity, being revived at the will of the King so it might be the one powerful means of defeating the enemies of the Jewish religi on who were dispersed everywhere and with great activity. Hiram said: We let any person affiliate at no cost. In that way their number increased rapidly and we began to attack Jesus’ men with all energy, impedin g the people’s following them. Many times we have caught them in our nets with traps an d deceit, killing those of them that we could . They fled from us like Iambs before ferocious wolve s . But they grew firmly in the faith of their new religion in the measure in which we persecuted them. They increased in number and in firmness. It seemed as if they did no t fear us. It was obvious that a hidden force sustained them in spite of our persecution . For that reason we consulted among ourselves, we renewed our forces and we strengthene d our Association because it was the only means of realizing our objective until the las t phase. Based on this and on our solemn oath it was inevitable that we face the forc e that at the beginning, we believed to be weak. We decided to face death if it were necess ary. We dedicated ourselves to increasing our forces, increasing the number of ins cribers. Within two months we achieved 2000 brothers, bearer s of the title, Mysterious Ones. 45 We began to found affiliates in several places, dep endent on the principal Temple. --------------------------------------------------- -- 44 His royal position Impeded his preaching. 45 Members of the Mysterious Force. --------------------------------------------------- -- CHAPTER THIRTEEN The Foundation of Secondary Temples in Judea Hiram Abiud said: If it were not for our firmness in the prote ction of the Jewish religion, all Jerusalem might have fallen from our hands into the nets of the Impostor Jesus’ preachers. Because the preachers of his teachings, after his d eath, despite their boorishness, were going"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"about bewitching the people. That first successful campaign of ours incited us to establish affiliates everywhere, before the expansion of Jesu s’ preachers might increase and before those inclined toward him might increase. We divided the founding commission in two : one part remained in Jerusalem, resuming the sessions under the presidency of the King , and activating and enthusing the affiliates. The other part headed for different points in Palestine, one in each direction, preaching the principles of the Association, making known the hatred against Jesus and his followers among the people and threatening with death whoever would permit himself to be influenced by those impostor preachers, and warning especially the leaders of th e villages, pressuring them to expel from their regions those men (Jesus’ men) who entered to preac h. At times we found some men faithful to the Jewish r eligion who helped us in our proceedings. Other times we encountered strong resistance. And t he majority of times the fire of discussion was ignited among families and close relatives, com ing to enmities and division. Some continued following those teachings, adopting them. Others followed us, opposing their deceived relatives, battling with them to death . Many of these faithful enthusiasts killed their relatives for having followed the impostors. Such w as the plan of each of us founders: the establishment of Temples and affiliates, persecutio n of the false preachers. With our action we impeded the fall of many thousan ds of persons into their hands. We established forty-five temples from the day of the foundation to date, that is, fourteen months. Never have we taken a single step backward in our b attle, in spite of the sorrow that is caused us by the fact that many of our people went with Jesus , giving in to the first followers and to the pagans who adopted his teachings . It caused us grief to see our relatives going to th e hands of our enemies, without our having succeeded in convincing them. We sacrificed our money, our time and our blood; we expelled them, we persecuted them and we killed those we cou ld . If it were not for this battle they might have dominated our Jewish nation, they might have e liminated our Jewish religion and we ourselves might have inevitably fallen just like th e others who fell in the chasms of the deceit and in the snores of those impostors. Thus we recommend to our sons, grandsons and descen dants who continue our action, not to be discouraged and to continue on the path we have out lined, armed with the “Mysterious Force” that we have founded, that it may continue battling that diabolic force 46 until the end of time as long as it exists and as long as it has imposter pa rtisans. We commend to you, oh descendants of ours, you who love your religion and your people! We commend to you the task of not letting die what we have revived, for your life and your religion. We commend you exceedingly with the defense of the religion until death as your emblem and sentiment, We commend you not to deviate from our l ine, a line of heroes that we have outlined for you with our blood, with the sweat of our brows , with our money and with our time; with which we have saved our religion, defeating our ene mies and killing a number of them. --------------------------------------------------- ---- 46 The force of Jesus Christ Is referred to. --------------------------------------------------- ------"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"If this number had given in to their companions, th e impostors might have defeated us, our religion perishing. We commend you to record our st ruggle and to continue it. We commend you not to forget to commend to your sons all that we commend to you. Never consider as a religion the society the impostor Jesus founded . Never call him the Messias. Never attend the meetin gs of his followers, because they are deceiving and confu sing magic . But, vain were our efforts to impede a great number from falling into his nets. Vain were the threats of death to recall them to our path. They h ad deaf ears. Our arguments, even the most extreme, were worth nothing to counteract the force of that doctrine . Nor was it possible for us to impede our Jewish people from adopting its principl es. However, we must not forget the activity and zeal of our brothers, the founders, who perform ed miracles when faced with that current and in awakening thousands of our nation, directing tow ard us hands of moral and material collaboration. We must record here, in the pages of this History, the great favor that our co-religionists did for us, those who were fathers, brothers and collaborat ors with us without having joined our Association. These were more useful than many of th e inactive and useless affiliates. With the valuable counsels of those rich and benevolent men who offered us their moral and materiel help without joining the Association , we have achieved a new system: the establishment of similar associations with another name, because according t o information, many members are afraid to belong to the Association, “The Mysterious Force.” CHAPTER FOURTEEN The establishment of Associations affiliated to our s, But with other names 47 After having obtained unexpected results by our act ion and after having erected our works on firm foundations and subjecting the affiliate templ es to the orders of the Principal Temple, we all returned to Jerusalem and held a meeting in the pre sence of the nine founders, during which each one of us gave an account of the extent of his jour ney and mission with, reference to the foundation of affiliate temples. This success pleased King Herod exceedingly. He was even more pleased by our valiant attitude in front of the impostors and he was tremendously impressed to know that we succe eded extremely well in killing a great number of them with all the means within our reach, blocking their efforts, destroying their preaching and makin g their snares useless. With this we prevented people from attending their meetings. Some simple e lements that were obstinate we considered of no importance because they belonged to the lower cl ass. In the course of the meeting the proposal of some w ealthy enthusiasts, in regard to establishing affiliates of our Association with other names (dif ferent from “The Mysterious Force”), but having nevertheless the some principles, was put fo rth. This proposal achieved the agreement of the King an d the members and was recorded. The names of the affiliate associations is the resp onsibility and choice of their founders or leaders, under the elementary conditions that they must have the same principles as the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Mysterious Force, except in what concerned the degr ees, the signs, the instruments and the other characteristics of our Association. The symbol of these must be two hands interlocked: Union and Collaborator. The oath of these brotherhoods must be synthesized in the following text: “I, John Doe, Son of John Doe, swear by God, my cre ed and my honor, to unite myself to my brothers of the Association (whatever brotherhoo d} with everything they desire to realize, to collaborate with them and to be as one heart with them until death.” . With this decree we ended the session, each one of us obtaining a copy of the aforementioned oath. Each one of us left then, in his respective d irection, resuming our work without neglecting our original, first task. Such was our march in the path of the battle, rapid ly establishing several brotherhoods with different names: “ The Jewish Brotherhood ,” “ The National Union ,” “ The Religious Collaboration ,” “ The Religious Obligation ,” etc. These brotherhoods made great progress thanks to the will of the leaders whom we selected as founders. These were the only ones who knew the relationship existing between the brother- hoods and our association. In the majority of cases, they were wealthy men . With their material aid, the number of affiliates in their brotherhoods increased and their number surpassed o urs. We appreciate them immensely, in the name of religion and in the name of the nation. The ir name and ours will be immortalized in History until the end of time. --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- 47 It Is obvious that this record Is not only Hiram’s, but also that of all the brother founders who scattered throughout Palestine. --------------------------------------------------- --- CHAPTER FIFTEEN The death of Herod Agrippa, founder of the Associat ion The member founders fulfilled their tasks everywher e. They received orders from King Agrippa to battle, to sacrifice themselves, to disseminate the doctrine, to increase the number of Temples and Brotherhoods, to battle strictly the preachers of the Impostor. This campaign was arranged by the two great men: King Agrippa and Hiram Abiud, wh o will be remembered gloriously until the end of time, because with this Association they rev ived an entire nation, surpassing their ancestors in the defense of the religion. Those (the ancestors) persecuted and killed the Imp ostor, crucifying him, but these two great thinkers created a work that never crossed the mind of any man. Those killed some of Jesus’ men; these, on the other hand, performed great marvels b y their secret efforts and by their strict orders, killing hundreds of those confused confusers. At this height of our battle, while we, the nine, a nd the other members of the central Temple and the other Temples were at the peak of the fighting, our president, the King, contracted an illness in his sight, and became blind within five days . Then he was attacked in his body, and became completely paralyzed . But in spite of his sufferings he did not relax i n reanimating our spirits to"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"persevere in the battle. I being the closest, 48 the King, during his agony, entrusted to me his fin al secrets and his final will, addressing these last w ords to me in a passionate tone: “Keep the secret! Continue the Action! Work untirin gly! Destroy everything that...!” Here he caught his breath, and his soul left. This was in the year 44 after the Impostor . For me, these phrases are my greatest joy and my gr eatest honor. I incorporate them in my discourses and they will be cited in the private an d public meetings as a sacred verse. “Keep the secret! Continue the Action! Work, untiringly!” I d esire that these phrases be the principal foundation of our works, to construct on them our s uccess with the extermination of the preachers of the Impostor Jesus. --------------------------------------------------- ---- 48 This being the copy of Abraham Abiud, the heir of H iram Abiud, it is understood that the one who speaks here is Hiram, one of the nine founders. --------------------------------------------------- ---- CHAPTER SIXTEEN Hiram succeeds King Agrippa In the Presidency of the Association After the death of King Agrippa, Hiram was designat ed as president of the Central Temple of Jerusalem and President General of the Association, “The Mysterious Force,” in a legal election realized by the eight founders, achieving the unani mous vote of the seven. In place of the King, Agrippa was named as a member ; he took the terrible oath and knew the secret. Our brother Hiram deserved the testimony of the King and ours as a true founder. All has been done thanks to his intelligence and will. One of his ideas during the succession was the suggestion of giving another name to the “ Temple of Jerusalem ,” that of “ The Great Eastern Star. ” He wanted to signify by this that the true light that illuminates and orients is this star and not the one that the Magi Kings claimed to have ori ented them when they come from the East to visit the infant Impostor [Jesus]. Then Hiram ordered that the star be drawn in the background of the Temple , behind the head of the President, on the upper port , and that it was to be surrounded by the words, written in purple : “The Great Eastern Star.” He also ordered that the same thing be drawn above the interior door. The president began a campaign to establish affilia te temples in the north of Palestine, delegating the presidency to Moab Levy , going himself to the different parts of the count ry, founding temples, disseminating hate for the Impostor in the hearts of the people and stating that the teachings of his preachers were lies. Hiram, in his lengthy journey, arrived at Sidon , 49 persecuting Jesus’ men, causing fear in the hearts of the simple folk who followed him. Seeing that the number of Jesus’ followers increased enormously he asked the collaboration of his own co mpanion founders. Moab sent him two: Adoniram and Agrippa . The three resumed the persecution against the impos tors wherever they"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"went, arriving even earlier in the respective villa ges in order not to leave them time or opportunity to preach . ---------------------------------------- 49 A city In Lebanon. ---------------------------------------- CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Hiram’s disappearance The three missionaries dispersed in the eastern par t of Sidon, penetrating the lands of Lebanon. A short time after the meeting of Adoniram and Agrippa with Hiram and the departu re of each one in a different direction, Hiram disappeared without his companions’ taking notice. Informed, Agrippa exclaimed: “Hiram disappeared! Our President has been killed! What a disaster! I saw him last in Sidon!” When the news reached Jerusalem all the member foun ders except Johanan, who was sick, left for the region of Sidon. They began the search for their Brother and President, without finding traces. Tobalcain , Hiram’s nephew, who accompanied the members from the Temple, commented that , based on some information from the inhabitants he could have been a victim of wolves ; a rumor was circulating among the inhabitants that wolves h ad devoured a dervish 50 and several other persons in those cold days of full-blown winter. Fo r that reason they hastened the search, separating among themselves, but each little group accompanied by the residents of those areas, with the hope of coming upon Hiram’s body if it wer e true that he had died. Adonirom and Tobalcain , searching in the southeast direction, observed from afar three large birds gathered over an object under a tree . Approaching it, they saw a body lacerated by the birds and other beasts, devoured for the most part. They recognized it immediately as Hiram’s body, by its clothing and especially by his silver ring w ith the hammer engraved on it . The birds they saw were vultures. They gathered up his remains, his clothing, the rin g and some branches of the tree in whose shade the body was and went back to Jerusalem. (We do not know of what species that tree was, but we believe that it is of the type called “ Acacia .”) Having arrived in Jerusalem they presented everything to the Temple. His nephew, Tobalcain , succeeded Hiram; he took the Oath and received the secret . Moab Levy was elected President . The first of his orders was to cover the Temple o f Jerusalem and the other affiliate temples with black letters as a sign of mourning for our brother Hiram. Then he ordered a magnificent wake only among the “ Mysterious Ones” 51 in all the temples on the same night."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"He also ordered that the commemoration of this wake be revived as long as the Association exists . As we read here these orders were recorded. Later the transferal of the first secretariat to Adoniram and the second to Johanan was decreed. King Agrippa had given the Third Degree the name of Master Hiram. Completing the homage to the Master, Moab Levy ordered that the wake be realized every time the Th ird Degree was granted to a member . The member must represent our dead brother, Hiram , thus to keep his memory alive. These orders were recorded, becoming a part of our Fundamental Laws. In the following session I suggested the following: 52 I have an idea that, without doubt, will be the “be st backbone for our principle that indicates moving back the date of the foundation by thousands of years. I beg you, Brothers, not to accuse me of exaggerating the fame of my uncle Hiram with this idea. This is not my purpose, no. Listen to me: One of the principal decrees that I have rea d in the texts of our History indicates the --------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- 50 We dressed ourselves as dervishes: says Tobalcain. 51 Translator’s note: members of the Mysterious Force. 52 It is obvious that from here on the one who records in the copy Is Tobolcoin Abiud, Hiram’s nephew. ------------------------------------------------ hiding of the date of the foundation of our Associa tion from all the people, including from our brothers in the Association, so they remain complet ely ignorant of its origin. My opinion is the following: We must make known to the Mysterious Ones that the wake of homage mentioned is made in memory of Hiram Abiff , the Syrian, the Architect of the Temple of Solomon, killed by the three workers . With this deception we affirm before everyone the antiquity of this Association, the secret being kep t forever . With this event, the nine of us immortalize the mem ory of my uncle, the martyr of the Association. The general and public remembrance wil l be for Hiram Abiff. And so the mysterious ones do not understand anything of this, and to for tify the belief in the antiquity of the Association, we must make the date of the first ord er decreed by the Central Temple for the realization of the wake be the date of the creation of Man. We must add this principle to our others and note it in the records; thus, linking our true date with that of the beginning of creation, we will increase the preoccupation, the doubt in th e world . Do you approve what is proposed, Brothers? All made known their delight in this idea , recording it with appreciation to Tobalcain for his wisdom and timeliness. Adoniram added: It is not fitting to realize the homage of the wake on the same night, as the President said, especially at this time nor is it fitting to inform the temples for their participation with us. Listen to my arguments:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"As the news of the death of our brother Hiram is al ready known it will not be easy to convince the mysterious ones that the wake will be for the soul of Hiram Abiff, the architect of the Temple of Solomon. The nine of us alone must realize the wake for the soul of our brother Hiram Abiud , without making it known to anyone . Then we will keep it in reserve until a time passes during which the people’s recollection of the memory of our Hiram will be erased . We, the nine, and whoever succeeds us through the c enturies, will not forget it. How can we forget it if there will be a copy of this Histor y in the hand of each one of the nine? And thus we will complete the deception in such a way that n one of the mysterious ones will suspect that the wake of the third degree corr esponds to our brother, Hiram, president and founder of this Association . And everyone will believe that the wake of the th ird degree is for Hiram Abiff, the architect of the Tem ple of Solomon, it being impressed in the mind of the people that the origin of the Assoc iation is prior to Solomon. Thus no one will know anything of the date, the purpose, the pl ace and the founders of the Association. Will you trust me Brothers, to prepare the text for this proposal? We approved it and assigned Adoniram to do so. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Plan for the wake held as homage in honor of Hiram Abiud, Founder of the Association The task assigned to Adoniram completed, we held a session to discuss that matter. During the session our brother Adoniram read the following: Ea ch one of us values Hiram as highly as King Agrippa, and we know that the King decreed that the third degree be denoted, “The Degree of Master Hiram.” To dignify even more this degree and in homage to the King as well as to Hiram, I believe that what I read to you should form part of the rites of the Third Degree. I say: 1. Place the remains of our brother Hiram in a hidden room, with the door open . We will place in it his mantle, clothing and ring, and besi des, a branch of those that accompanied his remains. 2. Two of us will go around, seeking the remains an d return lamenting on not having found them. 3. Then five will go around, for the same purpose, returning, crying for not having found them. 4. Then we will all go about and seek separately he re and there until finding his remains in the hidden room. 5. Having prepared then a coffin and a black mantle , some of us will return and, bringing the remains and Hiram’s articles, we will place the m in the coffin and cover them with the black mantle."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"6. We will carry the coffin to the temple and over the mantle will be written the words, “dead,” “living.” Then we will begin the mourning, each one crying and pronouncing phrases of sorrow and lamentation. 7. We will light three lanterns: two over his head, wh ich will be directed toward the “Eastern Star,” and the third lantern over his feet . This is the symbol of the three nails with which we nailed Jesus . 8. The President will read some prayers for his sou l, pointing out his character, his works and the graces attained for the good of the Associa tion. He will recall that he was its founder and that he died a martyr to religious duty . That is why he is living, because he lives forever in us and in these symbols I have men tioned. 9. We will uncover the coffin and look at the remai ns as if he would speak to us. Then the President will say: “Speak, Hiram! Inform us about your battle and who killed you! We have heard that you did not perish by a natural dea th. 10. The President will kneel near his head and say the following discourse, representing Hiram. “I sought you, dear brothers, during my batt le and in the last moment of my life I found no one! “Indeed, I have not died a natural death; a hand ki lled me; the hand of the enemies or their followers! “I have died far from you! But my memory will live among you until the end of time! Keep my memory and my principles alway s! Fight as I have fought, attacking the Impostor’s men who divided our religi on! Do not fear nor lament for me! I am not dead! I am among you until the end of time! Do not renounce the mission of uniting our religion! I will help you wherever I am ; my soul prays for you, my eyes watch you forever! Fight keeping the secret of my indestr uctible principles! “To you I deliver the instruments, the implements w ith which I constructed this hidden edifice. “To you I give a name and a memory that wi ll live forever. “Attack your enemies, the Impostor’s men. Increase and grow. I am here watching your acts. In the final encounter I will pass judgment o n you when I hear you say to me: ‘You remained living among us, oh Hiram!’ “Brother founders, I call you from this desolation, I greet you, asking life for you and your Association. Death to your enemies!” After the President finishes, kneeling, his discour se, as if Hiram himself had spoken, we will carry Hiram’s remains to bury them in the tomb we h ave prepared at the side of the Temple. From now on, the first of the conditions that the a spirant to the third degree (that of Hiram) must fulfill, is that of representing our dead brother; suffering the insults and the bitterness’s that Hiram suffered in his battles on behalf of the prin ciples of the Association. The associate must accept being placed in a coffin representing the co rpse of Hiram . The coffin is left with the graduate in a dark room representing Hiram in the d esolate field where he died . Then it is to be carried to the Temple and placed between the two co lumns: Booz and Jachin . You must know the importance of the following matte r. he who reaches the third degree must not relate its secrets to one who is lower, so the latt er may not know its rites until his graduation."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Before finishing Adoniran said: What do you think of what I have proposed to you? To which we answered that we approved the precision of his o pinion; then it was recorded. On the following day we buried Hiram in accord with the approved norms. After burying the remains, the nine of us completing the wake in homa ge, Adoniram said: Brothers: These symbols are exclusively for the nin e of us and those who succeed us. Thus it will continue as a memory and secret among the nine successors. None of the other Mysterious Ones must know that the homage is for our brother, Hiram Abiud, for on knowing it they will know that our Association w as founded recently to combat Jesus’ men. This would be troublesome for us because it wo uld alienate many who desire to join. In order to fulfill our purpose and to make the sec ret more hermetic, we must add to these symbols, other objects and symbols pertaining to Hi ram Abiff, Solomon’s architect. I will prepare them and explain them to you. Thus the myst erious ones will believe that the graduate represents Hiram Abiff and they will be co nvinced that the Association is most ancient, from remote times. 53 You must remember that this degree is one of the mo st important traditional degrees. --------------------------------------------------- --- 53 Jonas : These were the ridiculous legends of our ancestor s and that was their fanaticism. They Insisted that these symbols remain in the Associati on as long as it existed. The first condition that our ancestor Joseph Levy , imposed on Desaguliers was to preserve those symbols and legends, as was noted in the first section of this book. --------------------------------------------------- --- CHAPTER NINETEEN The signs of recognition and the norms for entering the Temple Adoniram said: We have taken the symbols for our Association from the stars, from the implements of construction and architecture, and from what the Im postor said and did. We must now, brothers, create general signs that may be known by all the mysterious ones, not only by the nine of us. The purpose of this is so they may recognize one another wherever they meet. Here I read to you what I have prepared: 1. He who desires to enter the Temple officially, m ay not do so until the Commission of the Temple is certain that he is a mysterious one. It w ill be known if he answers properly with the secret word that they will know. 2. On entering he must take the three steps that we have so disposed in such a way that with the third step he may arrive at the center of the s pace bound by the two pillars. Then he greets the President in the following manner: the r ight hand is placed over his head; then he lowers it and places it, open, over his breast, below his neck. He will repeat his greeting three times; 54 The President stands and strikes three times with t he hammer,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"lifting it over the head of the visitor, as if to t hreaten him. Then the president sits and the visitor, too. These movements signify that the visi tor repeats the oath that he took when he was accepted as a member, that he is firm and ac tive in the service of the Association, that he is sincere and that he will never betray it . The movement of the president symbolizes his threat with death if he betrays it. 55 3. The mysterious one carries out these movements b efore whomever he wishes in order to make himself known, on the condition that he does n ot make the significance understood. 4. In case of danger or to ask help, the mysterious on e will lift his clasped hands above his head. If there are mysterious ones near him they wi ll offer him assistance . 5. Recognition with the eyes. Looking first at the forehead, then turning the eye s toward the left shoulder, then toward the right shoulder. If t he other one is a mysterious one he must do the same, thus realizing the recognition . 56 6. Recognition by touch. It is indispensable. It mu st be carried out in the following way: when the greeting is effected by the pressing of ha nds, the mysterious one will exert light pressure with his thumb over the first joint of the index finger of the one greeted . If the latter is a mysterious one, he will respond with th e same movement, realizing immediately the recognition. 57 7. Recognition by speech. I believe that it is fitt ing to have a “key” word and that it be sacred for us. I suggest that this word be BOOZ . When one asks the mysterious one, Are you a mysterious one? He will answer, “B;” then the other must say “0.” The first will say “0.” And the inquirer will complete it, “Z.” Th en they will recognize one another. 58 8. Recognition by age. Mocking Jesus, his acts and his teachings with everything that was in our reach, we made the Degrees of our Association be of the nu mber 33, symbolizing ironically his age . I think that the age of the mysterious one should be in accord with the following points: A. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 1st to th e 3rd degree be: three years, mocking thus the belief of the Impostor’s me n that he was three days in the tomb . B. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 4rth to t he 30th degree be: 33 years, mocking the age of the Impostor . --------------------------------------------------- --------------- 54 Jonas: It was made clear to me that modem Masonry h as evolved somewhat with respect to these signs, as will be seen in my studies of the n ew Masonry. 55 Jonas: This is changed In the new Masonry. 56 Jonas: This is changed in the new Masonry."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"57 This greeting exists in new Masonry thanks to our a ncestor Levy who insisted on preserving It because It was one of the first princlpa1 movements . 58 Modified in the new Masonry. --------------------------------------------------- ------------- C. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 31st t o the 33rd degree be unlimited, ridiculing thus their claim that the Imp ostor arose from the tomb and ascended to Heaven and that he lives forev er 59. D. We consider the age of our Association from the beginning of human creation, One, asking the other, What is the age of your widowed mother? The other must answer him, As old as Creation. The widow is our association, Thus King Agrippa, our first President , named it, reviving the memory of our brother Hiram, the son of the widow. Thus you must recognize yourselves. You must preserve these princ iples until the end of time. The session was recorded with complete agreem ent. --------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ 59 Modified in the new Masonry. --------------------------------------------------- ----------- Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Chapters 20 to 32 CHAPTER TWENTY The Official Norms of the Third Degree Their divulgence to the other temples in Master Hir am’s name, according to King Agrippa’s will during his life. Tobalcain Abiud said: Some years after the death of my uncle, Hiram Abiud , I felt the obligation of carrying out the will of King Agrippa and our earlier decrees, giving ord ers to the other temples of the Association so they might consider the third degree, the degree of Master Hiram, as a legal and canonical degree. I made my opinion known to my eight companions who approved it. Our brother, Adoniram, had already prepared, according to his promise, the nec essary supplements that would indicate Hiram"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Abiff, the architect of the Temple of Solomon and t hat would be attributed to him. With reference to this Adoniram said: When any brother ascends to the third degree, all the rites that we, the nine, have performed in the wake for our brother Hi ram Abiud, must be realized in him, but in the following concealed manner: After transferring the coffin from the dark room to the temple, ending with all the rites, including the president’s discourse, representing Hiram, the martyr of our religious battle (we must not neglect the act of eliminating from this specialize d rite for all the temples, all reference to our brother Hiram, changing them for those that indicat e Hiram Abiff), the aspirant is made to arise from the coffin and, with his eyes blindfolded, 60 the President leads him to a closed door of those of the temple where he says to him: “ Enter after knocking on this door three times.” The aspirant knocks. A member of the commission ope ns the door from within where he receives him with the hammer of the Impostor Jesus, 61 striking him on the back of the neck, 62 and asking him: “ Where were you and where are you going ?” to which the aspirant will answer: “ I was in idleness and now I go to fight. ” The member replies: “ You are lost, march by another path .” The designated guide leads him to another door, knockin g three times. The door is opened by another mysterious one, receiving him with a blow of the ha mmer on his forehead, asking him as the first one did and receiving the same reply. Then the myst erious one will say: “ You lost the way for the battle, you must follow me, knowing the path is dif ficult and dangerous .” He conducts him to a third door or to the same door but via a most difficult trip, during which he encounters many obstacles and suffers several falls . Once he will fall over thorns or rocks; another time he will go down or up a hill. All thes e obstacles will be prepared in the temple for this purpose. On arriving at the third door he knoc ks on it. The door is open, where a mysterious one gives him blows on the upper part of his head w ith a hammer. Immediately the aspirant’s guide throws him to the floor as if he had died. Th en they carry him, place him in the coffin and cover him with a mantle, leaving him with his eyes blindfolded. Immediately the President or another member of the commission reads the followin g discourse: --------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------- 60 Jonas: It seems that in ancient Masonry the eyes of the mysterious one were blindfolded only when he ascended to the third degree (the degree of Master Hiram). 61 That Is, the hammer with which Jesus was nailed. 62 The blows are light because they are symbolic. In n ew Masonry the site of the blows was changed. --------------------------------------------------- ------- “Brothers, you have seen in this traditional celebr ation, several spectacles that symbolize an exalted goal that cannot be attained without bearin g suffering, fatigue and bitterness. Said goal is the departure of the man from death to life, this b eing impossible without his exposing himself to the greatest hazards of death. These sufferings tha t a new brother must suffer are the symbols of what I have just made known and also the historic s ymbol by which the new brother represents Hiram Abiff in his arduous task of constructing the Temple of Solomon. Thus it is that by exaggeration in the guarding of the secrets of his profession, architecture, he was persecuted by three workers 63 who, after having imported heavy punishments and su fferings, killed him at the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"third door. All this makes us understand that the p ath of the battle is difficult and dangerous. Nevertheless, we must not fear it nor deviate from it. We must continue in the path of courage to achieve our goals of fortifying the principles of o ur noble Association.” On ending his discourse, the president whispers in the ear of the aspirant that he is to rise from the coffin, standing between the two pillars where the blindfold is removed. There the president will say: “Brother Aspirant to this sacred degree, you h ave heard what I have read when you were lying in this coffin which is the symbol of the str uggle. You represented boldness and courage. You represented Hiram Abiff with his secrecy that h e did not want to reveal, even to death. Look at these two columns that Hiram chose and erected i n the back of the Temple of Solomon, Be as they are, strong in will and firm in principles.” After this, the aspirant will say the following wor ds: “I am no more than force, will, decision and firmness. I will keep the secret of all that I have seen and heard before men and even before the other mysterious ones who are below my degree .” Thus the new brother in the third degree will belie ve that during the rituals he represented Hiram Abiff, without having the least idea that that homa ge was a memorial act for our brother, Hiram Abiud, founder of our Association, and therefore, h e will not know either that it was founded recently and that we, the Nine, are the founder s. Thus, Brothers, we will revive the memory of our br other, Hiram Abiud, with none of the mysterious ones or those outside our Association be ing informed of the intention of the nine of us, that is, the immortalization of Hiram, the foun der of our Association, its fountain and father to whom we owe all zeal, enthusiasm and gratitude. Do you approve what I have read to you, in order to read then the text of the order we must send to all the temples? Adonirom’s opinion was approved by all of us; we recorded it, and then we sent the order to the affiliated temples for their knowledge of the norms of the third degree and for its execution with all meticulousness and secre cy. --------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ 63 Jonas: In the Masonry of our ancestors (The Mysteri ous Force) the names of the three workers who “killed” Hiram were not mentioned. In new Mason ry their names are: Jubilo, Jubila and Jubilum. --------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE The text of the order sent to all the temples of th e Association. The confirmation of the Third Degree: the Degree of Master Hiram and the Rituals of the Act From the central Temple in Jerusalem to all the oth er Temples: Brother mysterious ones, president and active members of the Association, Th e Mysterious Force, give glory to God. 64 Because our Association is of a most remote epoch and of un known origin, we have tried to"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"satisfy our desire of knowing that secret but, unfo rtunately, it was as impossible for us as it was for our fathers and ancestors. All that we have obtained was a document among the papers of King Herod Agrippa , the president of our temple, whose text is as fol lows : “ Since Hiram, the architect of the Temple of Solomon , enjoyed the respect of his lord, and due to the great favor he did in the foundation and construction of the Temple and the administration of its works, we decree that the thi rd degree of the Association is to be the one that bears his name: the degree of Master Hiram ; and that this is to last forever.” This found document is not signed by anyone, and ob eying the will of the owner of this order, whoever it may be, we order, in turn, that the Thir d Degree be denoted by the name of Hiram from today on. As we did not find among the papers, as we had expected, rituals pertaining to this degree, with the collaboration of the brothers, the members of the central temple, we have conceived rituals that you must respect without neg lecting anything in the act of a mysterious one’s ascending to the third degree. The norms that we have decreed are: 1. Reserve in each temple a very small and dark roo m. The brother of the second degree is taken to the room with his eyes blindfolded, before being admitted to the temple. The blindfold is removed and the door is closed. A coff in is prepared and a black mantle with the words, “living, dead” written on it. The two co lumns and the President’s table only are covered with black cloths. 2. One of the members is sent to seek the mysteriou s one and returns saying that he has not found him. Two others are sent, returning and sayin g the same. And then four are sent who find him in the dark room. 3. The members of the commission walk toward the da rk room carrying the” coffin and the mantle, where the aforementioned brother lies in th e coffin with his eyes blindfolded, and they cover him with the mantle, placing over it the branch of acacia. They carry him thus to the temple, placing him between the two columns. 4. Three lanterns are lit, one at each side of his head and the third over his feet. The members begin the mourning; crying and praying for the rest of the soul of Hiram, the one who is represented in this homage. 65 5. The president approaches the coffin and uncovers the head with the immediate cry: “’Hiram is alive!” The president puts the cover on again, pronouncing the following discourse: 66 On ending all that was mentioned, they uncover the coffin and remove the blindfold from the eyes of the aspirant, who arises. The president wil l then say: “Brother, you know that in your ascendancy to the degree of Master Hiram you repres ented him, dead and living. Dead, you represented him assassinated in the struggle during his mission. Living, in his secrecy. You must adopt then, his struggle, his activity, his secrecy .” --------------------------------------------------- - 64 Alleluia."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"65 Jonas; And thus all who ascend to the third degree, even the modern Masons, believe they represent Hiram Abiff. 66 Jonas: It Is the some discourse recorded In the wak e of Hiram Abiud, its secret guarded among the nine founders. It varies only in that the words and expressions referring to Hiram Abiud are changed for others that denote Hiram Ablff. Then th e president reads the text mentioned In the last chapter, referring to Hiram Ablff. --------------------------------------------------- ---- The new brother answers with the words previously m entioned:, “I am no more than force, will, etc” At this time the president reveals to him the secret of the Degree, saying to him: “ For recognition, there are three secrets : 1. When you wish to make yourself known to those wh o are your superiors you will pronounce the first letter of the name JACHIN, you will be answered by the pronouncing of the second letter, etc... 2. Or you will say, “DEAD,” and you will be answere d, “LIVING.” 3. Or you will touch your temple with your fist, lo wering your open hand rapidly.” At the end of the act and after the delivery of the secret, you will vest the aspirant in a black shir t, indicating his participation with you in the mourni ng for Hiram. The lights will be tuned off and the coffin and mantle will be retuned to the dark r oom. Adopt these norms with all precision and consider them as our fundamental law.

Thus the Jewish nation grew and its glory glowed for many years. But, at the same time, the people who follow ed the Impostor increased more. They were, in the majority, pagans. Thanks to our contin uous work very few of our people"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"followed him. Our influence increased parallel to t he growth of the affiliate Temples, especially those of Rome and Achaea, which were out standing in the diffusion of our principles, thus meriting eternal glory.

We omit translating the text referring to it because o f its similarity in description to the battle of the mysterious ones.) Words of Antipa , heir of one of the Nine Founders: “The temples of Rome and of Achaea recorded indelib le honor for our Association. We owe them on immense favor. For they have won innume rable pagans, no less than those the impostors won with their magic force. Those two temples surpassed this temple of ours 67 when they killed Peter and his brother, Andrew , deserving to perpetuate their memory in the pages of time. The dangerousness of t hose two preachers was noteworthy in their marvelous sermons, in their power of attra ction and in their indescribable eloquence, in such a way that if it were not for th e battle of those two temples thousands of our nation would have been converted to the Impo stor’s religion. The two great temples must be glorified by every mysterious one, just as Hiram himself. May God protect them! They crucified Peter and Andrew just as the Impostor was crucified . They frightened the people and paralyzed the movement of Jesus’ (followers) for a long time . We must follow the effective plan of those two temp les to attain our goal, that is, the life of the Jewish religion; and woe to us if we fall ba ck, for our works will be lost without our achieving our purpose. “For that reason I suggest the distribution of a ge neral publication among all the temples, applauding the work of the temples of Rome and of A chaea, ordering all the mysterious ones to take them as an example. And in order to immortalize their memory we will ma ke the day, November 30 of each year, the day of those two temples, celebrating it with all joy for its having been the day on which Andrew the Impostor was crucified .” Antipa’s proposal was approved. The publication was written and distributed. The day decreed for the Temple of Achaea was recorded for their hav ing killed Andrew, this death being the fruit of the battle of that temple. 68 Jonas: (At this point there are some details that we omit from the translation, referring to the massacres the mysterious ones committed against man y of their brothers who abandoned them and followed Jesus’ men, for fear they’ might revea l the Association’s secrets .) --------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- 67 The temple of Jerusalem. 68 Samuel , son of Jonas : Our ancestor could also have recorded June 29 as another feast of Masonry because it was the day of the crucifixion o f Peter, through the plot of the temple of Rome.

The latter was extraordinary in his zeal for the as sociation. He himself visited many temples, founding several . So great was the success of his efforts that in his epoh, the numbers of the partisans of the Impostor decreased . He conceived several ideas that offered great ben efits to the Association. He solved a great conflict incited amo ng the members of the principal temple. He created names for some decrees, after the degree of Hiram, of utmost importance. These are: • Degree 7: The Guide • Degree 9: The Elder • Degree 12: The Triumphant One • Degree 15: The Scientist • Degree 18: The Talented One • Degree 21: The Preacher • Degree 24: The Little Master • Degree 27: The Little Philosopher • Degree 30: The Kadosch • Degree 31: The Cross • Degree 32: The Great Architect • Degree 33: The Living Dead 70 Then Misraim gave this order. “To all the dear brother members of the affiliate t emples: Degree 33 being the symbol of the end of the, life of the impostor Jesus , we have decreed that the aspirant to the Degree mentioned must wear a shirt of a purple color with a cross of white fabric sewn over the breast, over the cros s must be drawn the four letters INRI . 71 These letters will then be a sacred word of recogni tion for the degree mentioned, like the word BOOZ. And, as the secret word must be changed every six months, we authorize the presidents of the temples to select the word th ey desire. Continue the battle to serve religion and the prestige of the Association. May u nion and occultism be our emblem.” April 19, 4115 President Misraim Aberon Aaron Abiud , one of the heirs of this manuscript, said: “After the destruction of Jerusalem and our dispers al, we installed our new temple ‘Jerusalem’ in an unknown place where we remained f or several years, our heirs as well, issuing orders without anyone’s knowing of our loca tion , not even the affiliate temples themselves .

We worked urged on by religious and national duty, but they worked by mea ns of a factor unknown to us . We see them acting with affection, with sacrifice, self-de nial and humility, whose origins were unknown to us. We could not discover this apparent force. They must be supported by a mysterious, magic force. For that reason we decided to continue our struggle, fulfilling our oath and continuing the march according to the plan of our ancestors, Hiram and his companions. “Our ancestor, Hiram Abiud, recommended that we kil l all the Impostor’s followers. He recommended that we recognize nothing but the Jewis h religion. Several times he declared that however much the number of religions increases, we must attack them and annihilate them with the force of our union, our st ruggle and our constancy in personal abnegation.” 72 --------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- 72 Jonas: Here we omit the translation of some paragra phs that explain how non-Jews entered the Association, and how they punished Jesus’ followers , and the foundation of other temples, until the year 500. --------------------------------------------------- - CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE What happened after the appearance of Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic, Religion"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Levy Moses Levy said: At the end of the sixth century of the Impostor Jes us, who harassed us with his falsehoods, another impostor appeared who claimed (the gift of) prophecy, of inspiration and of orientation for the Arabs in the path of a t rue God, making laws contrary to our Jewish religion and succeeding in convincing many i n a short time . We arose, attacking his claims, raising our voices to make his men and his followers understand that he and his followers are impostors and false as Jesus was an impostor and false. Nevertheless success was not with us. Day by day the number of the followers of Mohammed increased, as did the followers of Jesus . With the sword and terror they attracted the people and even many of our Jewish nation. Then the y used tolerance and deceit, succeeding in accelerating their growth. We attacke d them like the followers of Jesus and they increased even more, until we succeeded in imp eding our people from converting to them. The Jews that were inclined toward them were simple ones, like animals. Nevertheless we could not impede the pagans’ follow ing them in spite of our battles. We ordered the Jews to attack the two religions, th at of Jesus and that of Mohammed, as a consecration to our Jewish religion. I have said religions, while I must say associations. For that reason we ordered all the temples to absta in strictly from considering those two associations as religions. There is no religion other than the Jewish. All the others are corrupt and degenerate . The disturbances caused by the impostor Jesus were not enough; so now this other impostor comes causing us more concern. Our resista nce is of one kind. The former, we crucified; for the latter it was not necessary beca use we are killing him by poison. Now our religious, social and national duty obliges us to attack their teaching with all our forces, as we did with the teachings of the imposto r Jesus, who was the cause of the establishment of our Association. CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX The Foundation of Temples in Europe, After the Temple of Rome Abdon Adoniram said: Our ancestors neglected to mention the name of the founder of the Temple of Rome , but now we will see in the next chapter that he was a descendant of Hiram Abiud . That temple achieved great triumphs that fortified the Association to su ch a degree that it incited the nine heirs to establish other temples in other kingdoms . The heir-descendant of Moab Levy was sent to Russia . The heir-descendant of Adoniram (my ancestor) was sent to Gaul . The successor of the Abiuds to Germany . This happened in the middle of the eighth century . In those Kingdoms they began to establish temples, some dependent on the Central Temple of Je rusalem and others dependent on the Temple of Rome, which was, in turn, an affiliate of the Central Temple."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"In the eighth century, after seven centuries of con tinual battle, when the Temple of Rome was in its glory, the following temples existed: in Russia , four; in Gaul, four; and in Germany, three. Then the number of temples in the capitals of the k ingdoms mentioned increased; others were founded in other capitals and also in the interior. The temples in each kingdom depended on the principal temples in its capitol. Those of the capi tols depended on the Central Temple, “Jerusalem.” This situation continued until the 12t h century. In said 12th century the great progress achieved by the temple of Rome and its great services inspired the commission of the Central Temple with the idea of abdicating in its favor, according to a decree recorded on June 5, 5166. 73 By this decree the temple of Rome had the right to preside over all the temples in the East . The temple of Rome with its new and powerful author ization insisted on occultism and reduced the meetings of t he mysterious ones only to those temples hermetically hidden and subterranean . At that time the members of the underground Templ es left with their faces painted black to make it appear as though they were working in the coalmines. These were same of the stratagems our ancestors car ried out to hide the truth of their acts. This system was followed until the end of the 18th c entury, or until 80 years after the changing of the name of the Association to the name of Freemaso nry. In spite of the fact that new Masonry established i ts lodges above ground and in spite of the modification of its laws, and not withstanding its callings to civilization, the strict occultism exercised by our ancestors provoked fear and aliena tion in the people . Even many members trusted it for a certain time, many even took the o ath, but soon abandoned the Association. The threats of death were in vain. --------------------------------------------------- ----------- 73 The year 1166 after Christ. ---------------------------------------- CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN How we knew that the founder of the Temple of Rome, and its first president, were descendants of Hiram Abiud; a nd the transfer of one of his descendants to Russia Cohen Abiud said: I received this manuscript from my father in Rome. I journeyed in the middle of the 15th century to Russia and came to an understanding with Jacob Levy in order to disseminate the principles of our Association, achieving excellent results. Jonas said: Here is the explanation of a series of similar even ts, of struggles that we abstain from translating because of their little interest. The state of things did not vary until the end of t he 17th century"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"when the struggle disappeared and the Association e ntered its agony. The reasons for such a retrocession were internal conflicts and personal e nmities among the members. CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT How Joseph Levy, his son, Abraham, and Abraham Abiu d were sent to London 74 It is made clear in the previous words that our Ass ociation progressed in some eras and degenerated in others. In the previous chapter we s aw that at the end of the 17th century it was almost dead . Also, I came to the conclusion that the reason for this degeneration and retreat was the spirit of envy, pride and corruption that domin ated us . I decided then to lift the Association from this fa ll. Its name, “ The Mysterious Force ,” had come to provoke apprehension and fear among the people. For that reason I thought, in the beginning, to change the name, but in what manner? With the po wer of money. I exerted myself with that power and I achieved success, together with my majo r collaborator, our brother, Abraham Abiud. We were both descendants of the nine founders. We communicated in person and by correspondence wit h our brother heirs of the same manuscript, the idea being approved. From then on, Abraham Abiud and I began the task of carrying out that longing, succeeding in winning th e sympathy of a rich man from among the active members of the great mysterious ones, who su pported our undertaking and provided us with a large sum of money. We went to Germany where we had no success. We went to Italy and France, always stumbling over obstacles that demolished our efforts in all t hose kingdoms. Not obtaining support to carry out our intentions we returned to Russia to inform the man of fortune who had supplied the money to us, of what had occurred. That man, 75 with admirable zeal and will to regain the glory of the Association, was working with enthusiasm to elevate the prestige of the Jews and to preserve and dignify our nationality and our religi on. After encouraging us, he sent us to London, the capital of England. We were three: Abraham Abiud, my son Abraham and I. We judged it fitting to communicate with a man named John Desaguliers and a disciple or companion with the name, George , not knowing his last name. After studying his character and religion, we contracted a strong friendship with him, explaining the plan to him. De saguliers found in the plan the opportunity to realize his own religious purposes. He supported Le vy and promised him all the help he needed, reaching the point of saying: “ We must demolish the Catholics , 76 we must not regress until annihilating them .” Levy felt confidence in his new friend, without, however, coming to know very well the true intention of Desaguliers . Jonas said: I do not believe it is necessary to rep eat here what we have seen in the first section concerning the accord realized among the five: Levy , Desaguliers and their companions. Their meeting, the deceit of Desaguliers, his taking from Levy the English manuscript, how they agreed on naming the Association: Freemasonry, on August 2 5, 1716, the united meeting realized on"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"June 24, 1717,. with the associations of architects and builders in London with its new name, the origin of the discussion and aggravation of the con flict between Levy and Desaguliers for his refusing to return the manuscript and the conclusio n of the conflict with the disappearance of Levy and the confiscation of all his papers. --------------------------------------------------- - 74 Jonas: The one who is writing here is my ancestor, Joseph Levy. 75 Abraham Abiud said: That rich man did not permit his name to be mention ed in this History . 76 Desaguliers belonged to the Protestant sect that held the grea test enmity against the Catholic Church; thus his Intentions of destroying Catholic Church are understood --------------------------------------------------- -- CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE Details of Joseph Levy’s assassination and what occ urred later Jonas continues narrating: Our two ancestors, the two Ab rahams 77 said: ‘ What was said by Abraham Levy: Of the fundamental c onditions between my father and Desaguliers there were, that the presidency would b e Levy’s and that the first Lodge would be called, “The Lodge of Jerusalem,” 78 as a remembrance of the principal Temple. Desaguliers accepted these two conditions; neverthe less at the great meeting on June 24, 1717, the majority were on the side of Desaguliers and Anderson; 79 as a result both conspired against Levy, assassinating him and robbi ng his papers. We did not have proof against anyone, but we decide d to wreak vengeance on Desaguliers and his disciple, George. We killed the latter. We did not succeed in killing Desaguliers because one of us, Abraham Abiud, becom e ill. Jonas said: Here there are details read in the first section fo r which there is no need to repeat them. Here is the narration of the other successor, Abraham Abiud , the owner of this manuscript: After the death of Abraham Levy, which happened almost immedi ately after the death of his father (as we have seen in the family tree of ancestors, from Jos eph Levy to Lawrence) I did not renounce the task of avenging myself on Desaguliers. But I felt alone and weak to carry out the idea; and as I did not want to die without satisfying my longings for revenge, I sought another path. I sought the path of moral vengeance that had perhaps greater ef fects than a bloody revenge . Another of the descendants of one of the founders, whose name was Adoniram David , a descendant of the first Adoniram, was living with us at that time. He lived in France and was the possessor of great wealth; he possessed the Hebrew manuscript from his ancestors . I visited him and related to him the details of the events. We decided to denounce both to Justice for the assassination of Joseph Levy and the theft of his documents and to protest personally before Desaguliers.

We pointed out to him that we were basing ourselves on the fact that the nine manuscripts, including mine and that of David Adoniram, belonged to a single history, and that Joseph Levy was a descendant of M oab Levy.

We warned him that we had decided to sacrifice everything in our power to preserve the secret of the Association in our hands in accord with the recommendations and desire s of our ancestors.

The superior and general leadership of the Associat ion remains in our hands ; I will be one of the principal chiefs. 2. All the symbols, signs, touches, words and norms th at our ancestors, the founders, imposed, will be respected, without their suffering change or conversion. However, additional ones will be permitted . 3. The words inculcated by our ancestors, the founders , in the year 43, and their successors, will remain intact . 4. The principal treasury will be in our hands . I collaborate with two thousand English pounds sterling as a donation for the Association. 5. Neither internal nor external laws will be printed unless I see and approve them . In their fundamentals they must agree with those of the Maso nry of our ancestors, with the exception of the laws. 80 6. (This item was inserted by Desaguliers in homage to Adoniram for his donation.) The Association will preserve a memory of Adoniram, con secrating his name among the sacred words, or a ritual may be formed in his name . Thus his name and that of his ancestor, Adoniram, the founder, we will immortaliz e. David Adoniram replied: Then I ask that a ritual be specified 81 with the name of Misraim , one of the ancient ancestors, who accomplished great achievements in favor of the Association."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"7. A function in the Association will be given to Abraham Abiud , according to his capacity, because he is a descendant of one of the founders. 8. For the first, or superior, lodge, the name “Jer usalem” will be reserved as Joseph Levy asked, in memory of the first principal temple. 82 9. All movement in the Association is suspended. Al l election will be held for a principal commission of five Chiefs of wealthy Jews, accordin g to article one. 83 10. The decrees of the Association will not be in force before they are signed by the commission mentioned or the majority of its members . This is so when the decrees are sanctioned here in London, but if the number of lod ges increases and the Association spreads, the signatures of the commission will be n ecessary only for important matters. Special and local ones may be approved by special c ommissions, elected for that purpose. 84 11. It being one of our moral obligations to revive the memory of those who benefited the Association by their works, among the founders, anc estors and successors, I ask that the name of Tobalcain , nephew of our ancestor founder, Hiram Abiud , be recorded together with the word Booz , as another of the Association’s sacred words, as long as it exists . All these requests were fulfilled and recorded; the leadership of the Association thus remaining in our hands. 85 Abraham Abiud said: The mishap that the efforts of Desaguliers suffered caused great emotion in my heart and in that of Adoniram. We considered it as a great revenge for Joseph Levy and a great general consolation for all our Jewish people . --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- 80 Jonas: The laws Imposed by Desaguliers and Anderson were, in fact, approved by Adoniram. After his death, they suffered certain amendments a nd additions. 81 Samuel, son of Jonas: To this day several rituals c reated in the Association exist. 82 Samuel, son of Jonas: After the death of David Adon iram the name of the principal lodge was changed to the “Grand Lodge of England,” by Desagul iers and Anderson as they had insisted on June 24, 1717. 83 The manuscript does not mention the names of the me mbers of the commission, except the name of David Adoniram . 84 Samuel, son of Jonas: These commissions grew in all countries, especially where there is a majority of Protestants belonging to the sects with the greatest hate for Catholicism, and where there is Jewish influence."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"85 Jonas: The primary leadership continues being in the hands of Jews and the secondary in the hands of fanatical anti-Catholic Protestants . --------------------------------------------------- -------- Jonas said: We end, thanks be to God, the fulfillin g of our mission of making known the secret of the History concerning the origin of Masonry, found ed by our ancestors, and detailing its events in accord with the preceding chapters. Thus our vis ion and our hearts are cleared of the darkness that covered them. Everything has been made known a nd thus the light springs from the darkness. To give more data to the reader about the evolution of Masonry after the year 1717 when our ancestor Levy changed the name of the “Mysterious F orce” to “Masonry,” we continue detailing the events of this History through the following ch apters. CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE Jonas’ affiliation with New Masonry86 Jonas said: I was destined to be one of the heirs o f this precious History who revealed to the world terrible secrets that were hidden, even from those who deserved to know them: the Masons themselves. God inspired me to adopt the religion of Jesus on m y marrying a Christian woman to whom I attribute great gratitude for the revelation of the se secrets and for my conversion to Christianity. We have both seen that we will not obtain any benef it without comparing the Masonry of our ancient ancestors with the new Masonry. To achieve this, I found myself obliged to join it. I entered with all enthusiasm and with the decision to follow an active life and one of zeal. In the Association I was not only a mere member, but also an observer and studious investigator. Nevertheless, on ascending in its rituals, the norm s, words, utensils, signs, steps, touches, movements, etc. did not surprise me, because in ess ence they continued being equal to those of the Masonry of Agrippa, and of the new affiliates. When I presented my petition they required no prior requisite of me. The main thing, it seemed, was to pay the price of the inscription without exp osing oneself to an investigation. They blindfolded my eyes and took me to a room illuminat ed by a weak light. Then they took the blindfold off me. The sponsor said to me: “Wait her e and think of Eternity. Here you have the human skeleton, the skull, the verses, etc.” 87 I then thought that the new brothers, it seems, hav e perfected themselves in subterfuge until surpassing our ancestors . My sponsor then returned and asked me: ,”Are you re ady to face the afflictions of bearing the dangers?” I answered: “I was born for all this.” He took from me what I had of money and some metallic items and left. Another member presented h imself and took my jacket off and rolled the trouser of my left leg up to the knee. He bared my right arm. He opened my collar and (exposed my) chest and tied a rope around my neck and withdr ew. My sponsor presented himself again, he closed my ey es and led me a certain distance, making me stop. I understood by the conversation of the men o f the commission around me, that I was in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"front of the door of the lodge. I heard some phrase s referring to my leaving darkness for light, and that now I was oriented on the path of reason. I observed that many scandalous rituals were added after the death of Adoniram . Then they drew me to the door and I felt a sword ov er my neck. 88 Someone said to me: “What do you feel over your neck?” I answered: “It seems to be a sword.” The President said: “Understand, you who join us, that this sword threatens you If y ou are not disposed to preserve the secrets. If you betray us we will kill you with this sword.” 89 After these and other ridiculous movements that it is not worth mentioning, they took me on three consecutive trips during which I heard murmurs of a nguish, cries of fear and blows with the sword. They asked me several childish questions. Then they made me drink vinegar . The vinegar is not in the texts of our History . But, as the reason for the foundation of the Asso ciation was the appearance of Jesus, the symbols utilized were to r idicule --------------------------------------------------- --------------------- 86 Samuel, son of Jonas: My father did not make clear with which name he entered Masonry, with Jonas or with James, which he adopted after convert ing to Christianity. 87 These are new additions. To blindfold the eyes corr esponded to the degree of Hiram. 88 Here I thought: How soon my hour has come! 89 Jonas: The ritual of the sword in the Masonry of ou r ancestors corresponded only to the degree of Hiram. ------------------------------------------------ him; thus, the use of vinegar is the invention of the new Maso nry , but it completes the chain of ironies against Jesus. After the three trips, always blindfolded, they led me, by the rope, to a door where they ordered me to knock three times and ask to be one of the “S ons of the Widow” and to be with them to sustain her. Then after having asked me some tiresome questions, they “cleaned me,” in their manner, of impurity, washing my hand. Again they “purified” me with an inflammable substance. They passed a scissors over my arm as if to make me blee d and an iron bar as if to burn me. With this they symbolize my distinction with the Masonic seal . 90 Jonas said: It is known that the three trips symbol ize the three journeys our ancestor founders realized searching for their president, Hiram Abiud . No one knew this truth other than the nine founders and also Desaguliers and Anderson, who con fiscated Levy’s manuscript but were obliged to hide it. All the Masons after these continue believing that the three trips have as their significance the three journeys of Hiram Abiff, and what he had to f ace in the three doors of the temple of Solomon."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"When I finished the three trips the President order ed me to approach the “temple.” 91 They took me closer. The President taught me to make the firs t sign, in which they realized a change. Instead of putting the hand over the head and then lowering it, open, to the throat, etc., it is begun now, by placing the hand over the throat, etc., etc . They moved my feet, forming on angle. 92 They made me walk forward three steps. 93 They made me kneel with my knees in the form of on angle. 94 ’Then they made me take the oath that, after having ascended to the high degrees and havin g met with grand Masons, I found out that no one gives it importance. Its text and the rituals varied in the majority of lodges, and no mention of God is ma de in it. I have confirmed that many of the non-Masons know the majority of these signs and sym bols through the declarations of the grand Masons who abandoned the Association, denouncing it s scandals and declaring their rancor against the monopolizers of those secrets, whom the y mock as “brothers,” the other Masons. 95 They mock all the Masons without fear or shame, fro m the greatest elder down to the illiterate. The oath ended, the President read some warnings to me. They opened my eyes and untied the rope around my neck. Immediately they ignited infla mmable materials that blinded me. Then I saw that all the brothers took out their swords and extended them over my head and placed their bayonets against my chest. I thought: What benefit springs from these insignif icant things that they added to this ‘history? ’ I kept silent until the end. They taught me the “ touch for greeting.” It was the same one that my ancestors in ancient Mason ry used: However, its significance was changed, from that of a mere salute to a sign that signifies, “Tell me the secret word,” one beginning with the first letter and the other answe ring with the following until completing the word. Then they made me understand that my age was three years and they taught me new movements and special praises (that --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- 90 Jonas; It is understood that some of these rituals were in the Masonry of my ancestors and others were added. However, since 1810, many of the se movements were annulled and others were added. 91 The word “temple” in the new order is given to the place where the president sits. 92 This did not exist In the Masonry of my ancestors. 93 The same ancient three steps. 94 Also added. 95 The translator to Spanish: Several Investigators, a mong them the great historian, Rev. Fr. Luis Chejo, S.J., wrote In detail concerning the secrets of Masonry: its signs, terms, touches, vestments, steps, greetings, purposes, movements, e tc., knowing them through the works and declarations of the Masons themselves. But the orig in, the date and the founders were not known until the publication of this manuscript translated from French to Arabic"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------- ---------- did not exist in our history). They tied the apron around my neck (that of our ancestors), acknowledging then that I am an apprentice worker n ext to the Masons. CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO The ascent of Jonas to the Second Degree: Fellow Craftsman In this degree innumerable movements and added thin gs exist. Instead of the three blows there are six, also the trips, the drawings, the symbols and other things that would bore the reader of this history if they were to be published. For this reas on I will indicate the ritual s of this degree in synthesis. When I ascended in the profession of the Masons and passed from “apprentice” to “fellow craftsman,” I congratulated myself, but my brothers congratulated me more, especially the treasurer, who increased the payment and (surely he congratulated the treasury in his heart) for the joy, the congratulation and all the pleasures converge o n money, on gold ! They showed me, as a resume of the spectacles, a st ar they call the “ Luminous Star ”. I remembered then the “ Eastern Star ” in the Masonry of our ancestors that symbolized t he star of the Magi. That is why in the new Masonry the name of the “Gr and Orient” was given to each Masonic club in each country, and also the Presidents council in the lodge is noted “ Directorate of the East. ” All this was preserved in new Masonry in homage t o the founders, by David Adoniram, Desaguliers and Anderson, in accord with was written in earlier chapters. While I was talking with the Brother Guide, I tried to test him with the following question: “ Can you tell me about the founders and the authors of t hese instructions, signs, symbol s, instruments, etc. ?” He responded: “ How come you are asking me who founded Masonry? It is unknown to this day .” I smiled. He said to me: “ What makes you smile ?” I answered him: “ How can one be in a society without knowing its president and founder? ” Then he said to me: “ Come with me to ask the President of the Lodge .” I went with him and we asked the President. He responded: “ This is a question a fellow craftsman like you must not ask .” To this I replied, with pretense: “ This fellow craftsman must know one day what is unk nown and will make it known to the others, is that not so ?” To which he said to me: “ Try, then, to ascend.” Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Chapters 33 to the end of the book"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE Jonas’ ascent to the Third Degree: The Degree of Master Hiram Jonas said: This is the major degree, from the hist oric, symbolic, imaginary and tragicomic point of view all at the same time. We have understood that its true history, together with the secret of the foundation of the Association, is monopolized among the nine founders and their successors or heirs . All Masons, ancient and modern, present in this Degree an ironi c drama and all believe they reproduce the death and the wake of Hiram Abiff, the Architect of the Temple of Solomon. But the truth is that they reproduce, without the least knowledge, the de ath and wake of Hiram Abiud, the founder of this Association. They introduced in the rite the m ost ironic and depreciating acts toward the death of Jesus and his resurrection. Notwithstanding the knowledge of what I was going t o suffer with the nature of the examination and the scam to which they were going to submit me in ascending to this Degree, I decided to petition for it, with the purpose of completing thi s “History,” because the new Masonry (that of the year 1717) is nothing but a complementary part of the ancient Masonry, that of our ancestors; it is like its daughter, as we had anticipated. My petition was accepted. To detail the movements, events and sayings of the ritual would require more than ten pages, for which I prefer to omit them, for it would bore whoe ver might write, read or witness it. It is verified, then, that the movements, touches a nd terms composed by our ancestors, Herod Agrippa, Hiram Abiud and their seven companions, st ill exist in the Association. But many scandalous rites were added , for example: the act of stopping me, tying me wit h a rope, leading me walking backwards, threatening me with the point s of swords against my chest , disrobing me before the brothers while they looked at me, mockin g me, as was done to them in their turn, asking me innumerable and subtly deceptive question s, etc., etc. The strange thing was that later all of us were lau ghing at these fallacies, saying to each other: “Their authors must be very clever, what a pity we cannot know them!” I was silent. and laughed to myself interiorly. To make a comparison between ancient and modern Mas onry, I carried out several investigations about these rituals in several lodges, finding out that the rites, although apparently different, were the same in their fundamental: all masking cunning, fallacy, irony and mockery."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR Jonas’ ascent to the following Degrees, to to the 1 8th We did not see in our Hebrew history any name for t he degrees from 1 to 33. Only 15 of them had titles, the other 18 were untitled . We saw that our ancestor, Misraim , one of the ancient presidents, and his eight compan ions, established those titles for the purpose of mocking Jesus . The chiefs of modern Masonry, that of the year 1717 , who were three Jews and three Protestants, established other titles, additions, variations, at tractions and curiosities that made my wife, Janet, and me think that the Protestants that guided the new Masonry were more c unning and aggressive against Catholicism than the ancient Jews themselve s . I verify this with the fact that in Protestant countries the leadership of the lodges is more in t he hands of Protestants, than in those of Jews. I ascended to the degrees mentioned rapidly, paying the corresponding price without complaining , for the purpose of completing this History. I am sure that no one will reproach me for the omission of the details of those fallacious rituals that do no more than waste my time. This is not my purpose. We are satiated with the fallaci es of our ancestor founders and their successors. Their fanaticism and lies, their cunning and deceit ; the confusion of the members of their Association, the mysterious sons of the widow and the other sons of the original sect are sufficient for us . Why do they not reveal their true purpose, which is to attack Jesus? Would it not have been more noble for them to fight openly, armed with their pr inciples, against the Christian religion? Without doubt, they themselves knew their principle s were not noble CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE My ascent to the 18th degree, or that of the Rose C ross 96 I decided to complete my march until achieving my w ife’s and my purpose. I preferred to be up to date on the secrets of this degree because it is called the “Ro se Cross,” while its name in our History is “ The Talented One ,” the, “ Cross ” being the name of the 31st degree . I paid the price of the ascent and solicited the degree, my petition being accepted. How great my joy was! I prepared myself to ascend that ladder of “glory,” o f “honor,” of heaven!” I received the secrets of the degree, the signs, th e symbols, the norms and the type of vestments corresponding to it. Being now one of the bearers o f the cross, I lifted it on my shoulder and marched with them. 97 I began to count the extras that the new chiefs add ed to the original. My forces were exhausted before counting all of them. There are innumerable fallacies there. There are laughable acrobatics . In this degree I did not find what our ancestors di d except the four letters,” I N R I,” that signify, “Jesus, Nazarene, King of the Jews,” that they adop ted from the cross of Jesus when his crucifiers wanted to mock Him . This phrase was one of those imposed by Levy and Adoniram in their agreement with Desaguliers."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"All that I saw in this degree was a new fallacy add ed to an ancient fallacy. The lodge to which I belong had almost all its memb ers from the Protestant partisans of Desaguliers and Anderson, that is to say, from the Protestant sect with the most animosity toward Catholicism. I noticed this truth in the meetings where several suggestions and decrees were presented to attack the Pope and his collaborators . Nevertheless, those suggestions divided us into two bands, some in favor and others against. I felt that there was a wave of enmity against religions . The majority of the members disseminated the anti-r eligious spirit and mocked religion and religious . Meanwhile, some members, I among them, formed a g roup, although small, of resistance. Considering that my conversion to Christianity was effected by the intercession of my wife, and knowing that she is of a moderate religious nature, not fanatical, I asked her opinion about these secrets. Her opinion and counsel s are recorded in the next chapter. --------------------------------------------------- ---- 96 Samuel, son of Jonas: It is understood that the one s who continues narrating here is my father, Jonas. 97 Jonas: I felt an interior voice say to me: Take up your cross and follow them! --------------------------------------------------- ---- CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX The counsels offered by Janet to her husband James (Jonas) so he would no longer associate himself with the enemi es of the Church of Rome Before beginning with her words, my wife required m e to relate to her all the efforts and conspiracies that the Masons devised against Cathol icism. I told her how, through my permanent contact with t he grand Masons, I discovered that there are three groups of them in the lodges : Some of them attack Catholicism. Others attack all religions. The third, composed of men from the first two group s, battle in politics for the purpose of coming to dominate temporal authority . Here is what my wife said to me: “James, your affil iation with the new Masonry was not to support the enemies of religions, nor to support an y religion, but, as we have resolved from the beginning, to study it and compare it with the Maso nry of your ancestors for the purpose of completing this History. “We have both understood in the texts of this Histo ry the upset produced when your ancestor Levy changed the name of the Association, together with Desaguliers. In accord with what you relate to me, there exists among us Protestants a s ect united to the Jews (your relatives) whose"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"goal is to demolish what our Jesus, may He be glori fied, and to crush Catholicism and the Roman Church. Such are the principles of Desaguliers and Anderson. “My parents and I, dear James, are not of that sect. Yes, we are Protestants, but we a re for from the intention of crushing the Roman Church. Listen to what I tell you: We believe tat J esus Christ is the one who built it and He said that it will not fall. You must have our faith in spite of our traditional revolt that we inherited from our parents against the authority of the Ponti ff. In our hearts we conceal a firm faith that the Chur ch of St. Peter is the original Church of Jesus. Never have we thought, neither my parents nor I, of associating with the enemies of the Church. You, who are now converted to Christianity through my intercession, must adapt the principles I have inherited from my parents. Be careful in collaborating with those two sects: t he one that attacks Catholicism in particular and the other that attacks all religions in general . Be careful that you do not fall into their traps. Since you obeyed me and converted to my religion, you lov ed me and married me, I desire that you always continue firm with me in your Christianity, firm in your promises, and in your new principles. Continue then in the path of completing the studies for which you entered the new Masonry, to succeed in satisfying our longings to reveal truth and to denounce evil, in order to dissipate the darkness when later the doors of light will be open ed before the blindfolded eyes so they may orient themselves in the path of truth. And there o n the peak of the solid mountain of reality the light will be irradiated that will guide each confu sed person and each confuser.” CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN My ascent to the other degrees, from the 19th to the 33rd Jonas said: I have known throughout my studies that the ascent to the high degrees requires, above all, the payment of the price of the inscript ion, a price that varies according to the degree, but it also requires activity, zeal and services on behalf of the principles of the Association and the realization of its purposes. I discharged the d uties within my reach to make a false show of my activities and I saved, at the same time, what w as necessary to pay the respective inscriptions. I solicited the ascent, paying the dues for the 11 degrees, from the 19th to the 29th inclusive. My petition was accepted with pleasure. Being one of t he holders of the 29th degree, I knew the secrets, vestments, terms, movements and signs corr esponding to all those degrees. All the rituals are of no interest, for they are similar to those o f the earlier degrees in their falsity and ridiculousness. I saved the amount necessary to attain the 30th degr ee. I solicited it and attained it. I did not delay much in attaining Degrees 31, 32 an d 33 in the same way. Here my age become infinite; I remembered then what was recorded by th e ancestors of my mother, Esther, who tried by that definition ‘to mock the Resurrection of Jes us, His Ascension and His eternal life. Thus I completed my ascent to the maximum degree of “elevation,” reaching the “gates of Heaven.” Thus I come to be considered among the ran ks of the chiefs of “liberty!” Despite the superiority of my high degree, I did not know from whence come the superior orders . The"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"president himself of our lodge did not know their o rigin. I saw that all the presidents of the lodges were subject to those orders that came mysteriously . For example: “Carry out the exalted order as we hav e carried out ours, executing the following.... Another example: “By a superior order we must make every effort to do such-and-such a thing; comply with it and begin... “ Another example: “By orders, the knowledge of whose origin is prohibited by Law, you must initiate a subscription to collect (such-and-such a sum of) money that will be destined to expand the capacity of the Association and its interests.. .. “ All the orders were of this nature. Then 1 remembered the cunning of our ancestor found ers and their successors and noted that the nine successors improved considerably in the art of fallacy and cunning. I deplored the word “free,” which should be omitted from the dictionaries of languages with that meaning, to use rather the meaning, “ those who claim to be free and are nothing but slav es ordered by their masters to do good or evil .” Nevertheless, the slave knows his master, but we, o n the other hand, do not know who orders us, and we o bey blindly . How much I congratulate my wife, Janet, for her poe m in which she laments the liberty of the Masons who obey blindly and reproaches the nine fou nders and their successors for the monopoly of the secrets and the hidden principal leadership. CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT The delivery of the secrets on the part of James, o r Jones, to his son, Samuel George, the grandson of James, said: We saw, in wha t was recorded previously, that the secrets of the History are passed from the founders to their p resent successors, the most intelligent and serious of their sons. This was their traditional l aw of succession. A law of contemptible and blind religious fanaticism. But when we see the importance of these secrets and that terrible oath that the nine founders established, taking it themselves and imposing it o n their successors in the act of receiving the secrets, when we see that strange and terrible requ irement of hiding those secrets, that blind belief that whoever opposes the fundamental laws or violat es a single word of the oath will die horribly and will be “punished by God,” when we see all this , the obstinacy of our ancestors with their fundamental laws filled with barbarism, fanaticism and foolishness does not surprise us. We see now my grandfather, James, delivering the se crets to my father, Samuel, his only son, by his first wife, as we will see. The will of my gran dfather was to complete this history, completing the relationship between the Masonry of our ancesto rs and its daughter: the new Masonry. For that purpose he joined the Association to study its history and secrets in the light of this manuscript. His extensive studies were divided by h im into 22 investigations."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"First Investigation James, addressing his son, Samuel, and the readers of this History, said: Before my conversion to Christianity I was following the plan of the ancest ors of my mother, Esther, from whom I inherited this History, preserving its secrets and believing in the truth of its doctrine. Thus I continued until destiny wanted me to fall deeply in love with Janet, the Christian. She, too, professed a great love for me and agreed to be my w ife on condition that I would convert to Christianity; I converted and we married, then Samu el, my son by my first wife, converted too. Before completing one month of our marriage, my new wife had already known of this History, reviewing it. She reacted in such a way that she be gan to form in me a spirit of indignation toward the “History” and its heirs and to encourage me to publish it for the good and the salvation of the Christian religion, first, and all of humanity, lat er. She insisted so that she convinced me. Before beginning its printing we had to understand some fundamental secrets of modern Masonry, without which the benefits of this History would not be complete. We wanted to know, especially, if the secret remained with Desaguliers , Anderson and his companions or if they got in touch with others of the successors, owners of thes e Hebrew manuscripts. In search of that, I entered the new Masonry and ascended in it to the h ighest degree. Because of my coming journey to Russia on a mission , I fulfill my duty on delivering to you, my son, this History and its secrets, for fear somethi ng might happen. Your mother, Janet, will be your collaborator and administrator in all that is related with this History. Second Investigation James, to his son, Samuel, said: Son, you have here a History more precious than diamonds. When you read it you will understand its extraordin ary importance. I deliver it to you with all its secrets. You will not take the Frightful Oath that I had to take; you will see its text in it, as it w as decreed by our ancestors, the nine founders of the Masonic Association. They took it first and they imposed it on all the heirs of this History. A fter your conversion to Christianity with me, you will not obey that injunction. 98 Know, Samuel, how great is my love and respect for your mother Janet. Know, too, that I loved her more because she adopted you as affectionately as if she were your own mother. You must then, love her, obey her and serve her in homage an d memory of your true mother, whose soul at present is comforted on seeing that you find affect ion in this mother. We must, moreover, love her, in acknowledgment of her kindness in convertin g us to Christianity and for having encouraged me to publish this “History.” I have seen indescribable virtues in her. I have se en in her love, purity, integrity, intelligence, tr ue faith and authentic piety. I have seen self-denial that your dead mother did not possess. I have seen in her economy and generosity together. I have seen in her a deeply rooted sentiment of love for duty. But the major factor in my infinite love for her is her affection with you. She gave you, Samuel, a virtuous education. Without her you would not be able to have these virtues. She is your mother, your educator and your Christianizer. One of your most sacred duties is to love her and to discharge your duty toward her. I know her t o be, in my presence or absence, faithful and a collaborator. Above all, I desire that you do nothi ng without consulting her. She, in turn, will give you counsels related to this History and to your ot her actions."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"This meeting of ours must be added, with all that w e have spoken, to our History; let us record it. Now, Samuel, review this History and delve into it because, before my journey, I want to tell you a secret of great importance. Third Investigation Samuel’s surprise when faced with the Secrets And the cunning on reading the History After a week the three, James, Janet and Samuel, me t. James said to Samuel: I believe, son, that you read this History completely, with great avidit y. You have spent many hours in its study, but it does not matter. So it happened to me when I rec eived it from your grandfather, Samuel (whose name you bear), because it contains everything that can surprise, affect and elevate the heart of the reader, filling it with joy and pleasure for kn owing its secrets. Perhaps the illiterate, those of poor mentality and the incredulous may not have the se feelings. However, I do not believe there are people who are not interested in these secrets. Samuel said: Father, when I read this History I for got everything and became inebriated on seeing its secrets, its wickedness and its cunning. Secret s that, if they come to be published, will cast the Masonic states into catastrophe; secrets that will make the entire world tremble: the Masons and the leaders of all religions, especially the Christ ian, when they know the conspiracy against them. James said: Record, Samuel, in synthesis, what we h ave said. I, for my part, will write the following that I, too, will record. The elements of this study will thus remain organized. ------------------------------------------- 98 Translator’s note: The difference between the chara cter of James (the Christian) and that of his ancestors (the Jews) is impressive. ------------------------------------------- Fourth Investigation Synthesis of the Comments about the superior And anti-religious Orders that James revealed to hi s son, Samuel The Intended Erroneous Interpretation of the three words: Liberty, Fraternity and Equality You see, son, that I entered the new Masonry to com pare it with the Masonry of our ancestors, “ The Mysterious Force.” Because the modern is a comp lementary part of the ancient, because of the complete ignorance of the secrets and occult fo undations of this Association on the part of the Masons, and because of the joy it will produce in w ise men and historians on their knowing the cornerstone of that foundation, your mother Janet a nd I decided I would enter the Association. She told me: “I will call this History: The Dissipa tion of the Darkness. But the darkness will not be dissipated if you do not enter the Association i n order to be up to date with the innovations that happened in it after Levy changed its name.” That w as when I joined the Association and studied its secrets, thus achieving my objective. Behold my studies: All that I had expected to see i n it I saw with ample time for thought. I saw that its general public statutes were taken from th e same ancient statutes. But Anderson and"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Desaguliers gave it a scientific aspect and a gener al style suited to all readers, Masons and non- Masons. There is no doubt that David Adoniram collaborated with them, as you observed in his “conditions.” I did not get to see the internal statutes, nor can anyone else, because the statutes are monopolized by the principal chiefs, heirs of the n ine founder s. 99 I saw that superior orders were distributed from ch iefs unknown to their executors . Those chiefs, in turn, obey a supreme and completely unknown auth ority whose orders must be carried out blindly by them . I saw that in ancient Masonry only the Jewish relig ion was preserved. In the modem I saw an anti-religiosity of extensive contours , but concentrated against Christianity and particu larly, against Catholicism, an anti-religiosity inspired i n absolute nihilism. I saw the chiefs of ancient Masonry were cunning Je ws who attacked Jesus’ men. The chiefs of modem Masonry, the successors of Desaguliers and Adoniram are, on the other hand, an amalgam of mercenaries: Jews who attack the Christi an religion and Protestants who attack Catholicism . The new chiefs are no less cunning than the ancient ancestors. They have in their hands the reins of all the Masons. They play with them at will. And finally, I saw disasters and catastrophes advancing on humanity . So you will see it, too, Samuel. In this History you see that the Masonry of our anc estors was built on lies, fallacies, fanaticism and corruption. From this lying were born the ancie nt symbols and the instruments of architecture and construction with which they armed themselves. With this lying Herod “found” ancient papers in his grandfather’s chest, etc. as we saw e arlier. They created all those lies to conceal the secret of the date of its foundation, achieving suc cess in their deceits for many centuries. --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- 99 Jonas: I, as one of the heirs, was working with the same statutes. --------------------------------------------------- --- You see, too, that in the modem, the same deceit ex ists, used by the heir chiefs among the mass of the Masons. These, just like the ancient mysterious ones, believe that no one knows the origin, time, place or goal of this Association. 100 The mother Masonry threw all her intention in a sin gle goal, which was the battle against Jesus’ men. The daughter Masonry, surpasses that limit by great distances. It acts for the demolition of thrones and the abolition of authorities, spiritual and temporal, so it may have absolute domination of the world. It adopted the same emblem s as Jesus: liberty, fraternity, equality; but this adoption proves to be very contradictory to th e true. The liberty of Jesus was moderated, benevolent and fruitful. The liberty of the Masons is extremist, without limits, liberty of blasphemies a nd deceits, destructive of characters, religions, wealth, lives and families ."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The fraternity of Jesus was pure and human; it prea ches brotherhood among people . It imposes mutual love on them and alienates them from hate an d from evil . Masons, my son, practice a brotherhood full of egoi sms and privileges. Personal love prevails among them, the love of revenge, divisions and endl ess conflicts. I see that betrayal, aggression, robbery, pride, profanation and nihilism reign amon g them . The equality of Jesus’ is just and legal before the law and religion. In Masonry, “equality” signifies the disappearance of all order, with this supposed equality the reins of liberty are beyond all order, with everything falling into confusion a nd with the loss of true values. Fifth Investigation MUTUAL AID Behold, Samuel, my studies of the “aid” in the daug hter Masonry. 101 This word was nothing but a net cleverly tended by the successors, founders of the new Masonry and the secondary chiefs in order to snare young solicitants . Our “History” does not mention this term, “Mutual Aid,” among the mysterious ones except in what is related to at tacking the Christian religion. The cunning of Desaguliers and Anderson inspired them with the cre ation of this net for the purpose of attracting people to the Association, knowing that every broth er, with regard to aid, is needy and needs it. For that reason they put in their general statutes the term “Aid.” If, at the beginning, some brothers were benefited by some aid, later, with the increase in the number of affiliates in the lodges spread throughou t all countries and territories, that aid was dissipated until disappearing. We have heard many complaints from brothers about t he neglect of the chiefs, especially when aid was given only to the wealthy brothers . The aid was sold and bought. The discontented one s increased in number demanding the application of An derson’s law of “Mutual Aid.” Finally they made this stipulation: Either Anderson’s law of Mutual Aid be applied or i t be revised in this way: Whoever pays more, receives more aid . I knew many who lost their jobs in commerce, govern ment, industry and other occupations, it being impossible for the chiefs to offer them aid, and they remained without work. I also know many brothers who intentionally burned down their o wn businesses, expecting Masonic aid that they never received. --------------------------------------------------- ----------------- 100 Awad Khoury: Review the translation of the booklet, “Two Centuries of Masonry,” in this same work, page 36 where it mentions Dr. Oliver, wh o said: “Our Association existed before the creation of the terrestrial globe and was spread th rough the planets of the solar system.” 101 Samuel: It Is understood that the mother Masonry is the ancient, “The Mysterious Force,” from the year 43 after Christ until 1717. The daughter M asonry is the new, from June 24. 1717 on. --------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Sixth Investigation The secrets and the Principal Leadership Son, I believe that Desaguliers, the Protestant, be queathed the secrets to his successors, the Protestants; and that David Adoniram bequeathed the m to his successors, the Jews; the inheritance proceeding, without doubt, from Desagul iers, who had robbed the manuscript from Joseph Levy, the grandfather of my mother, Esther, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, Adoniram’s own manuscript that undoubtedly would be in the possession of his successors until today. As we, too, possess this manuscript of Abiud . But the chief successors of those two groups (those of Desaguliers and those of Adoniram) continue inheriting the same principal secrets and bequeathing them, in turn, monopolizing and mocking their brother Masons. Seventh Investigation Mother Masonry, her Daughters and Granddaughters The Masonry of our ancestors, “ The Mysterious Force,” was called the “ widowed mother ” in honor of Hiram who was orphaned of his father. Hira m, therefore, was called the “widow’s son.” The mother grew monstrously . If it were not for her the Jewish religion would have disappeared. But it did not succeed in its longing to annihilate the Christian religion. It did, however, increase enormously. Later, oh surprise! it ended in dissens ions and disturbances. Disturbances that dragged it to death; it was ready for burial at the beginning of the 17th century. After a time it began to revive slowly. In silence and without pain a daughter was born : Laicism . This creature felt itself weak and retarded in its growth . It asked its mother to give it a sister to aid it . Then New Masonry was born, thanks to the work of Joseph Levy and John Desaguliers . The two sisters grew, united by a great love. From them two groups were formed: one Jewish, the other Protestant. The first group, the Jewish, preserved the principl e of the mother Masonry, which is to attack all Christianity. The second, th e Protestant, specialized in attacking Catholicism . Then they arose united and began the war against th rones, destroying a great number of them and casting royal authority to the ground. Over those r uins they established fictitious “republics, “ whose evil was much worse than that of the thrones. The dilemma was greater because instead of being merely democratic republics, beneficial to th e people and the country, they were intentionally based on confusion and injustice, dis crediting the two authorities: Spiritual and Temporal, and liquidating values, respects and righ ts. Know, then, that the offspring of those wicked prin ciples have not yet been stopped. In the course of centuries other daughters and granddaughters wil l be born of them. Eighth Investigation Socialism Know, my son that the new Masonry, responding to th e demands of the enemy of humanity and fulfilling orders to increase the daughters of corr uption, gave birth to Socialism . This granddaughter came to be evil worse than earliest e vils."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"I predict to you, Samuel, that all these creatures will grow and give birth, by Satanic spouses, to other creatures of wickedness, corruption and destr uction . They will be multiplied and they will scatter their seeds over all the earth, corrupting it and how poisonous will be their fruits ! Each one of those creatures will form a party and e ach party will look out for the interests of its mother, aggravati ng the evils of confusion, civilization disappearing, eliminating religion and education de generating . Then the trumpets of grief and disaster will blow. This prophecy of mine will be fulfilled and will ha ve a great echo . 102 Our descendants will see infernal generations . Men will remember me, after my death. They will t estify to this opinion of mine that all the corrupt descendants will be daugh ters and granddaughters of mother Masonry. How fitting this is, with respect to this: Evils beget nothing but evils . Ninth Investigation Masonic Education Thus, son, you understand that modem Masonry preaches exaggerated liberty to attra ct the people. Man is, by nature, inclined to absolutism . The father Masons inherited this style of life from their fathers, expanding it, generation after generation, until reaching, little by little, “Nihi lism.” The father Masons create in their sons the love of easy objectives . They educate them in the love of the worldly and th ey inculcate in them disbelief in punishment for wickedness and in rewar d for good works . Thus the sons are reared in extremist liberty, corrupt character and avid desir es. It is necessary to mention those few Masons who, kn owing that terrible evil, impede their sons from joining Masonry, giving them a correct educati on. Tenth Investigation Masonic Teaching All that I have recorded in my investigations about the foundation of new Masonry and what we see in the new human community is confirmed in the Masonic laical (anti-religious) institutions. These institutions, Samuel, on increasing in number , will be a disaster for religions, because whoever is bred and educated in the principles of “ No Religion,” will grow, marry and have children without their knowing a religion that lead s them to God and to follow the path of reason. The parents, sunk in worldly joys, cannot do anythi ng but bring their children up according to this system. The laical institutions, my son, will be a rude blow for religions. You will see the certainty of my prophecy. What horrendous sin those first ancestors bear! Eleventh Investigation The Responsibility of the Corrupt Clergy"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"This, son, is an investigation on which I should no t comment because we are still new in a religion that is an enemy of Masonry . But, inspired by my firm purpose of perfecting th is History, I take this investigation upon myself, not without first gathering firm and profound proofs. Among those whom God created to be the mirror of vi rtues, an example of purity, a fountain of correction, veracity and justice, the pride and cen ter of social gatherings, the prototype of kindness, the pillar of piety and reason; among the m, I tell you, there is a small number who, corrupt, avoid their duties and spatter themselves ------------------------------------------------ 102 George Lawrence: The prophecies of my grandfather, Jonas, have been fulfilled, for the most part. Those evil creatures produced worse creatures . Nihilism, Bolshevisms, Communism and Socialism. And we will see many such examples. May God free us from what will occur! ------------------------------------------------ with the mud of diverse sins. ! do not specify any religion; in accord with my experiences and investigation to complete this History, I noticed c orruption in the religious of all religions. This corrupt element was an important pretext in th e Masons at the beginning and the recent Masons. It was a useful weapon for them, used to at tack all religions, without considering their virtues. They have condemned the good as well as th e evil and the pure as well as the corrupt. They have inculcated in the people the spirit of ra ncor, rebellion and scorn with cries of: “Corruption embraces the clergy!” “The clergy conce als delinquency, lies, crime, rancor, pride, envy, disturbances, drunkenness, degeneration, etc. , etc...!” Son, you will certainly find among the clergy some men with these characteristics, but you must not judge all by the sins of some . Nevertheless, we are not justifying the works of those corrupt ones; they must be warned and reproached, they must be expelled, they must be eliminated like the weed from the good seed. Twelfth Investigation Masonry and the Woman Jonas said: When my wife, Janet, read the narrative of my investigations and reached here, she asked me to let her write this part because of its relationship to the woman. Janet said: it is understood that the mother Masonry is the mor tal enemy of Jesus and that it was established to attack him . It ridiculed all his works and ironically imitate d all his kind teachings. The heirs embraced these principles. They wanted to imitate Jesus in his affection for t he woman, do not believe that their affection is pure as was that of Jesus. Jesus loved the woman wi th his divine affection, obliging the man to treat her with justice and obliging her to obey him , the women’s leader. Jesus wanted to give the woman that divine affection because she is the soul of the education of her children, its foundation and its strength. He traced for her the path of correction to teach her children the virtues and good behavior. If all the people follow ed this pure style and gave the woman what Jesus specified for her, the result would surely ha ve been virtuous children."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Masons gave the woman a different affection, a disf igured affection, an ignoble affection . The imitation of Jesus on the part of the Masons is, in this sense, false and evilly intended. It is different from the pure will of Jesus. They do not define affection as Jesus did. They liberated her from all rules and conditions, having as a result t he degeneration and misery of the woman . Our descendants will witness horrible spectacles born o f the misery of the woman. The woman, with this exaggerated affection, was fal sely exalted, fraudulently cultivating her pride without advising her of the irreparable loss that would be produced in her. With extremist liberty, the woman lost her temporal and eternal ha ppiness, she lost her education, she lost her life and even more, she made the world lose family, soci al, educational and procreative order. If she took comfort in this easy and voluptuous life, the result of this joy was misery and mourning, mourning and misery for all the world. Samuel said: After finishing the recording of the p revious investigations, I wanted to explain an idea to my father. It was midnight in the month of March of 1822; I pu t down my pen and said to my father: I have recorded all your investigations up to the twelfth. Now, in spite of my youthful age 103 I dare to suggest that the rest of the investigations are not so indispensable for this History. It is enough, indeed, to mention their Titles: • Masonry and Intuition • Eternity • Beliefs • The Church • The Mosque, etc., etc -------------------------------- 103 Fifteen years -------------------------------- Then James 104 reviewing the investigations mentioned agreed to Sa muel’s proposal. Looking then at his wife, he said to her: I fulfilled your sacre d will, dear Janet. I fulfilled my mission and my duty; I dissipated the darkness, as you asked me to . I justify my attitude before science, history, religion and I am content. Now the history of my an cestors is in your hands and those of my son, Samuel. Soon I will be traveling and you will have the right, if I do not return, of giving to this manuscript the destiny that God will inspire in you . Janet said: After those events my husband traveled and died in a foreign land in the year 182 5. May God give him peace in reward for his great work for humanity. ---------------------- 104 Jonas. ---------------------- SOME REFERENCES ON FREEMASONRY 105 Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Masonic Order Edited in Buenos Aires in 1947, vol. I, pg. 496:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"“With respect to the origin of Masonry, nothing, ab solutely nothing concrete and indisputable can be affirmed prior to the transformation and evoluti on of the year 1717, which is the true rational and demonstrable origin of the Order.” Salvat Encyclopedic Dictionary (9 th edition), vol. 6, pg. 127: “Freemasonry. Secret Association in which are used several symbols taken from masonry; such as squares, levels, etc. History. FRE EMASONRY claims to be an association of men who are dedicated to the persona l improvement of their members and universal brotherhood, based on a claimed religious tolerance and with principles of humanitarianism. It is a secret society, whose goals are known entir ely only to those who have reached the highest degrees of initiation and that conceals its activities under symbolism apparently derived in great part from the occupati on of mason and from the art of architecture. !In regard to its origin, it i s the almost general opinion today that it was born of the ancient guilds of English masons, f our of whom, under the initiative of one of their leaders, Anthony Sayer , founded the first Grand Lodge in 1717 , having edited, then in the early years of its existence, t he statutes of the Order, of which, for the first time, the “ancient duties,” that are still in force today, formed a part. This FREEMASONRY, called Anglo-American, so it seem s, does not have the anti- religious spirit that characterizes the Roman or La tin. The latter, subject to the influence of the Grand Orient of France, does not require of its members the belief in the Great Architect and in the” immortality of the soul and h as been marked always by its anticlerical position. The first French Lodge was founded in Dunkirk in 17 21 , under the influence of English FREEMASONRY, from which were derived also the first lodge of Spain (1728) and that of Portugal (1735) . In 1925 Fascism dissolved it and in 1934 Naziism continued its example. In Spain, by a law of March 1, 1940, it ha s been condemned and it is considered a form of crime to belong to it. In France, the gov ernment of Petain also prohibited its officials forming part of it. The Church prohibits belonging to FREEMASONRY under pain of excommunication under Canon 2335 of the Corp.Jur.Can. Earlier Cleme nt XII (1738). Benedict XIV (1751), Pius VII (1821), Leo XII (1825), Pius IX (1 846) and Leo XIII (1884) had already hurled their anathemas against it. In 1934, 4½ million Masons existed in the world, of which 200,000 pertained to the European continent, 479,000 to Great Britain and 3,260,000 to the United States . Universal Illustrated Encyclopedia . Espasa. Barcelona. “Masonry...Origin and Development of Masonry (pg. 7 33) Vol. 33.... There are three principal Theories: 1. That which attributes the origins of Masonry to the Knights Templar 2. That which supposed it was born of the battle la unched by the popular classes to free themselves from the pressure of feudalism, taking f or its base the organizations of the societies and guilds."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"3. That which attributes its foundation to the Jews . Tirado-Rojas claims to harmonize these three opinions, saying: ‘that symbolic Masonry, up to Degree 13, corresponds to the Ancient Age; to Degree 30, to the philosophic; and sublime Masonry, to the Modem Age.’ ...Without going into details about these diverse o pinions, we observe only that the one that still enjoys the most credit is that which makes Ma sonry a continuation and transformation of the ancient corporations of architects and builders of buildings, in which the artesans were making room for more learned members, with whom the y began speculative discussions, until coming to transform itself into modern Masonr y “ ------------------------------------- 105 References gathered by the translator to Spanish. ------------------------------------- James Oliver in his book, “ Antiquity of Masonry ” “Masonry was practiced in other planetary systems b efore the formation of the Earth.” Alberto J. Triana in his book, “ Masonry .. History of the Brothers Three Points ,” pt. II: “With respect to ancient Masonry great obscurity re igns; which gave place to the invention of numerous hypotheses, many of them impr obable, absurd and ridiculous; such as those like for example, the making of its d ating back to our first father, Adam. the Order being initiated by the Eternal Father in the Earthly Paradise; to Lamech, the killer of Cain, who killed his brother, to Zoroaster, supr eme head of the Magi and founder of Mazdaism (religion of the Persians, contained in th e sacred books of the Zend-Avesta); to Confucius, founder of the religion of the Chinese; to Pythagoras, Greek philosopher and mathematician, founder of the sect of Pythagoreans. .. Numerous concurrences exist between Judaism and Masonry. On the other hand, the obscurity of its origin is a tactic that the Masons employ in order to make difficult t he investigation of its ultimate goals. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that historically such origin has not been able to be demonstrated, it is a fact that Jews as well as Pro testants easily accommodate themselves to the purposes of Masonry ; because modern Judaism suffers the same crisis in its religious beliefs as Protestantism; “ and because everything that is directed directly against Christianity, protects, in a similar manner , Judaism .” Mariano Tirado-Rojas , converted Mason, states—according to Triana That the Order was founded after the “Diaspora” or dispersion of the Jews, on Jerusalem’s being destroyed by the Romans in the ye ar 70; that it always subsisted hidden; that it made use of the associations of med ieval artesan builders for its purposes; and that it succeeded in conquering members among the knight crusaders in the Holy Land. Joseph Lehman , Catholic Priest. wrote the following:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"“The origin of freemasonry must be attributed to Ju daism, certainly not to Judaism as a whole, but at least, to a perverted Judaism .” Nicolas Serra-Caussa states: “The inventor, founder or introducer of the Masonic system, if he was not a Jew by circumcision, was as much a Jew at heart as the bes t of the circumcised, for Masonry breathes Judaism through its four sides .” The rabbi, Isaac Wise , wrote in 1855: “Masonry is a Jewish institution, whose history, de grees, assignments, signs and explanations are of a Jewish nature from beginning to end,” The Jewish historian, Bernard Lazare , wrote: “It is evident there were only Jews, and cabalistic Jews, in Masonry’s origin .” And finally Hertzel , the founder of Zionism , in 1897 in Switzerland, said: “Masonic lodges established all over the world offe red to help us achieve our independence. Those pigs, the non-Jewish Masons, wi ll never understand the final object of Masonry .”"}]
