Back in 1968 my Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development was published by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In three substantial volumes I detailed how the West had built the Soviet Union. However, the work generated a seemingly insoluble puzzle - why have we done this? Why did we build the Soviet Union, while we also transferred technology to Hitler's Germany? Why does Washington want to conceal these facts? Why have we boosted Soviet military power? And simultan eously boosted our own? In subsequent books, the Wall Street series, I added more questions - but no answers. I had more or less arrived at the conclusion that there was no rational answer that could be proven. Then a year or so ago I received an eight-inch batch of doc uments - nothing less than the membership lists of an American secret society. Glancing through the sheets it was more than obvious - this was no ordinary group. The names spelled Power, with a capital P. As I probed each individual a pattern emerged ... and a formerly fuzzy world became crystal clear. The book you will read here is a combined version of a series reporting on this research. Each volume builds on the previous volume in a l ogical step-by-step process. These volumes will explain why the West built the Soviets and Hitler; why we go to war, to lose; why Wall Street loves Marxists and Nazis; why the kids can't read; why the Churches have become propaganda founts; why historical facts are suppressed, why politicians lie and a hundred other whys. This series is infinitely more important than the original Western Technology series on technological transfers. If I have a magnum opus, this is it. ANTONY C.

The book began with an anonymous donation to the author of an 8-inch package of documents in the early 1980s. Nothing less than the membership list and supporting documents for a truly secret society the Yale Skull and Bones. The late Johnny Johnson, of Phoenix Arizona was the spark that moved me to write first a four-part series and later, a jumbo volume based on this material. This volume went to several editions with several publishers, even a Russian edition of 12,000 copies. Probably in the past few year s, as many copies have been sold in Russia as in the United States. America's Secret Establishment has had little publicity, few reviews ignored by mainline distributors yet, has sold steadily for the past 16 years at a rate of several hundred copies a month. This activity, in turn, has generated other articles and books by other authors. But my real intent, to generate an exploration of Hegelian influence in modern America, has not been fulfilled. In great part, this can be attributed to an educational system based on a statist-Hegelian philosophy, and which has already achieved the \"dumbing down\" of America. This disastrous, destructive philosophy, the source of both Naziism and Marxism, has infected and corrupted our constitutional republic. Much of the blame for this corrup tion is with an elitist group of Yalie \"Bonesmen.\" Their symbol of Skull and Bones, and their Hegelian philosophy, sa ys it all, although with typical duplicity, they would have you believe otherwise. Hegelianism glorifies the State, the vehicle for the dissemination of statist and materialist ideas and policies in education, science, politics and economics. Wonder why we have a \"dumbed-down\" society? Look no further than the Bonesman troika who imported the Prussian education system into the U.S. in the 19` h Century. A political philosophy in direct opposition to the classical liberalism nurtured in 19` h Century British and American history. In classical liberalism, the State is always subordinate to the individual. In Hegelian Statism, as we see in Naziism and Marxism, the State is supreme, and the individual exists only to serve the State. Our two-parry Republican-Democrat (= one Hegelian party, no one else welcome or allowed) system is a reflection of this Hegelianism. A small group - a very small group - by using Hegel, can manipulate, and to some extent, control society for its own purposes. More than that, reflect on their pirate flag. An emblem found on poison bottles, the symbol of the Nazi Death Head Division in World War Two. Not only did Skull and Bones become a major force in drug smuggling (the Bush and Prescott families in the 1860s), but in true Hegelian fashion, generated the antithesis, the so-called \"war on drugs.\" This hypocritical policy maintains the price of drugs, controls supply, and puts millions in jail while the gainers, in great part, are none other than the same \"Bonesmen\" who pass the laws to prohibit (Bonesman Taft, 1904). Right and Left - A Control Device For Hegelians, the State is almighty, and seen as \"t he march of God on earth.\" Indeed, a State religion . Progress in the Hegelian State is through contrived conflict: the clash of opposites makes for progress. If you can control the opposites, you dominate the nature of the outcome. We trace the extraordinary Skull and Bones infl uence in a major Hegelian conflict: Naziism vs. Communism. Skull and Bones members were in the dominant decision-making positions - Bush, Harriman, Stimson, Lovett, and so on - all Bonesmen, and instrumental in guiding the conflict through use of \"right\" and \"left.\" They financed and encouraged the growths of both philosophies and controlled the outcome to a significant extent. This was aided by the \"reductionist\" division in science, the opposite of historical \"wholeness.\" By dividing science and learning into narrower and narrower segments, it became easier to control the whole through the parts. In education, the Dewey system was initiated and pr omoted by Skull and Bones members. Dewey was an ardent statist, and a believer in the Hegelian idea that th e child exists to be trained to serve the State. This requires suppression of individualist tendencies and a careful spoon-feeding of approved knowledge. This"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"dumbing down\" of American education is not easily apparent unless you have studied in both foreign and domestic U.S. universities - then the contrast becomes crystal clear. This dumbing down is now receiving attention. Two excellent books are The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt (Conscience Press, Revenna Ohio, 2001), and The Dumbing Down of America, by John Taylor Gotta. Bo th books trace this proce ss to the impact of education, and both give remarkable detail of the process. We go further, in that we trace the import of the system to three Yalies ­ members of Skull & Bones. For Iserbyt, in The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, the American education system begins with Rockefeller and Gates. But in fact, this statist system is a reflection of the Hegelian ideas brought to the United States by the Skull and Bones \"troika\" of Gilman, White and Dwight, and then financed by Rockefeller. People Control Today in California, one can see in real time the use of controlled conflict to achieve a desired outcome. The debate over the energy crisis is carefully contained to a debate over price caps and price control. Republicans want no caps and no controls. Most Democrats want price controls through caps. But look at what is NOT discussed anywhere. The entir e spectrum of almost free energy, based on a decade of research is carefully kept out of the discussion. Isn't this highly relevant to an energy crisis? In fact, the existence of free energy systems just down the road is the reason for the controlled debate. Mills Blacklight Power now has its patents and some utili ties have already bought in. Bearde n's MEG energy from space, is under discussion. Working models exist. The maligned cold fusion has hundreds of successful experiments, but so far as we know, cannot be repeated with sufficient assurance. Other systems have come into the view of government agencies, and then disappear from sight. A knowing public would ask, Why are these not included in the discussion?\" - Simple. Because the utilities know they are for real, and only a few years down the road. The problem for utilities is not the price of energy today, but how to dump their fixed assets (hydro plants, transmission lines, et c.) onto the public. These \"valuable\" assets will have zero value down the road, because all new systems are stand-alone units which don't ne ed fixed plant and transmission lines. If the public is aware of the dilemma of the utilities, the ability to dump assets onto the State is heavily reduced. The Republican-Democrat debate over \"caps\" is a diversion. The relevant question carefully avoided is, how long will it take to get these new systems into production? Another example is Monsanto Corporation development of genetic engineering and predat or seed, a barely-concealed effort for world domina tion of agriculture. President George Bush, Jr. , a Bonesman, appoints a Monsan to vice president, Dr. Virg inia Weldon, as Director of Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to block labeling of genetically-engineered foods, and pass on other corporate control efforts. Just before this, in New Technology, we had the 1989 dramatic announcement of \"cold fusion.\" When this announcement was made public, President George Bush (a lso a Bonesman) called establishment scientist the late physicist Seagrum into his office and gave instructions. We don't know what was said, but we know what happened . Cold fusion, a valid pro cess for free energy, as was subsequently revealed, was slandered and harassed by the establishment, no doubt fearful of what free energy would do to the oil industry. What is to be Done? If the voting public was even vaguely aware of this ramp ant and concealed scenario, it could, and possibly would force change. However, this is not a likely possibility. Most people are \"go-along\" types, with limited personal objectives and a high thresh old for official misdeeds. What has taken over a century to establish cannot be changed in a few years. The initial question is education. To eliminate the Hegelian system that stifles individual initiative and trains children to become mindless zombies, serving the State. We need a lot less propaganda for \"education\" and a more individual creative search for learning. Instead of more money for education, we need to allocate a lot less. The existing system of education is little more than a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"conditioning mechanism.

The reader anxious to get into the story of The Orde r should go directly to Memorandum Number Two. This section concerns methods, evidence and proof . Essential, but perhaps boring for most readers. During the past one hundred years any theory of history or historical evidence that falls outside a pattern established by the American Historic al Association and the major foundati ons with their grantmaking power has been attacked or rejected - not on the basis of any ev idence presented, but on the ba sis of the acceptability of the argument to the so-called Eastern Liberal Es tablishment and its official historical line. The Official Establishment History There is an Establishment history, an official histor y, which dominates history textbooks, trade publishing, the media and library shelves. The official line always as sumes that events such as wars, revolutions, scandals, assassinations, are more or less random unconnected events . By definition events can NEVER be the result of a conspiracy, they can never result from premeditated planned gr oup action. An excellent example is the Kennedy assassination when, within 9 hours of the Dallas trag edy, TV networks announced the shooting was NOT a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"conspiracy, regardless of the fact th at a negative proposition can never be proven, and that the investigation had barely begun. Woe betide any book or author that falls outside the official guidelines. Founda tion support is not there. Publishers get cold feet. Distributi on is hit and miss, or non-existent. Just to ensure the official line dominates, in 1946 the Rockefeller Foundation allotted $139,000 for an official history of World War Two. This to avoid a repeat of debunkin g history books which embarrassed the Establishment after World War One. The reader will be interested to know that The Order we are about to investigate had great foresight, back in the 1880s, to create both the American Hi storical Association and the American Economic Association (most ec onomists were then more historians than analysts) under their terms, with their people and their objective s. Andrew Dickson White was a member of The Order and the first President of the American Historical Association. Failure of Official History Times have changed. The weaknesses, in consistencies and plain untruths in official history ha ve surfaced. In the 1980s it is rare to find a thinking reader who accepts offi cial history. Most believe it has been more or less packaged for mass consumption by naive or greedy historians. Although an historian who will stick out hi s neck and buck the trend is rare, some who do are victims of an even deeper game. Conspiracy then is an accepted explanation for many events at the intelligent grass roots level, that level furthest removed from the influence of The Order. We can cite at random the Kennedy assassination where the offi cial \"lone gunman\" theory was neve r accepted by Americans in the street; Watergate, where a \"deep throat\" informer and erased tapes reek of conspiracy, and Pearl Harbor, where Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Major General Walter C. Short took the rap for General George C. Marshall and President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The revisionist historian has a double burden as well as a double task. The double burden is that research likely to question the official historical line will not ge t financed. The double task is that research must be more than usually careful and precise. A non-official work is not going to be judged on its merits. The work will be judged on the basis of its acceptability to a predetermined historical standard . What this standard is we shall explore later. Hypotheses and Method Which brings us to methodology. In this volume we will present three hypotheses. What is a hypothesis? A hypothesis is a theory, a working theory, a start point , which has to be supported by evidence. We arrived at these three hypotheses by examining certain document s which will also be described. The official history hatchet mongers will scream that our hypotheses ar e now being presented as proven assertions - and whatever we write here will not stop the screams. But again, these are only hypotheses at this point, they have to be supported with evidence. They are a first step in a logical research process. Now in scientific methodology a hypothesis can be proven. It cannot be disproven. It is up to the reader to decide whether the evidence presented later supports, or does not support, the hypotheses. Obviously no one author, critic, or reader can decide either way until all the evidence has been presented. We also intend to use two other principles of scie ntific research ignored by official establishment historians. Firstly, in science the simplest explanation to a pr oblem is always the most acceptable solution. By contrast, in establishment history, a simple answer is usually criticized as \"simplistic.\" What the critic implies is \"The poor writer hasn't used all the facts,\" In other words, it's a ch eap \"putdown\" without the necessity of providing an alternate answer or additional facts. Secondly, again in science, an answer that fits the most cases, i.e., the most general answer, is also the most acceptable answer. For example, you have 12 events to explain and a theory that fits 11 of these events. That theory is more acceptable than a theory that fits only 4 or 5 of the events."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Devil Theory of History Using this methodology we are going to argue and pr esent detailed precise evidence (including names, dates and places) that the only reasonable explanation fo r recent history in the United States is that there exists a conspiracy to use political power for ends which are inconsistent with the Constitution. This is known by the official historians as the \"devil theory of history,\" which again is a quick, cheap device for brushing facts under the rug. However, these critics ignore, for example, the Sherman Act, i.e., the anti-trust laws where conspiracy is the basic accepted theo ry. If there can be a conspi racy in the market place, then why not in the political arena? Are politicians any purer than busine ssmen? Following the antitrust laws we know that conspiracy can only be proven in a specif ic manner. A similar pattern of market actions is not proof of conspiracy. Just because something looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and all the ducks act similarly, does not make it a duck - or a conspiracy. Under the Sherman Act a simila r pattern of prices, where all prices are the same, is not proof of conspiracy. Similarity of prices can occur in a purely competitive market. Neither is simi lar political action necessarily a conspiracy. Proof of conspiracy requires specific types of evidence, i.e.,: (a) there must be secret meetings of the particip ants and efforts made to conceal joint actions, (b) those meetings must jointly agree to take a course of action, (c) and this action must be illegal. The Council on Foreign Relations Widely accepted explanations of recent history based on a conspiracy theory do not present evidence that fits the above criteria. For example, the Council on Fore ign Relations cannot be claimed as a conspiracy even for the period since its founding in 1921. Membership in the CFR is not a secret. Membership lists are freely available for the cost of a postage stamp. There is no proof that the entire membership conspires to commit illegal acts. What has to be proven in any conspiracy explanatio n of history is that the participants have secret groupings, and meet to plan illegal actions. Members of the CFR, when accused of being involved in a conspiracy, have protested to the contrary. And by and large they are right. Most CFR members ar e not involved in a conspi racy and have no knowledge of any conspiracy. And some personally known to the author are about the last people on earth to get involved in an illegal conspiracy. HOWEVER, there is a group WITHIN the Council of Fo reign Relations which belongs to a secret society, sworn to secrecy, and which more or less controls the CFR. CFR meetings are used for their own purposes, i.e., to push out ideas, to weigh up people who might be us eful, to use meetings as a forum for discussion. These members are in The Order. Th eir membership in The Order can be proven. Their meetings can be proven. Their objectives are plainly un constitutional. And this ORDER has existed for 150 years in the United States."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Two: The Order - What It Is And How It Began THOSE on the inside know it as The Order. Others have known it for more than 150 years as Chapter 322 of a German secret society. More formally for legal purposes, The Order was incorporated as The Russell Trust in 1856. It was also once known as th e \"Brotherhood of Death.\" Those who ma ke light of it, or want to make fun of it, call it \"Skull & Bones,\" or just plain \"Bones.\" The American chapter of this German order was founded in 1833 at Yale University by General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft who, in 1876, became Secretary of War in the Grant Administration. Alphonso Taft was the father of William Howard Taft, the only to be both President and Chief Justice of the United States. What Is The Order? The Order is not just another campus Greek letter fr aternal society with passwords and handgrips, common to most campuses. Chapter 322 is a s ecret society whose members are sworn to silence. It only exists on the Yale campus (that we know about). It has rules. It has ceremonial rites. It is not at all happy with prying, probing citizens - known among initiate s as \"outsiders\" or \"vandals.\" Its members always deny membership (or are supposed to deny membership) and in checking hu ndreds of autobiographical listings for members we found only half a dozen who cited an affiliation with Skull & Bones. The rest were nt. An interesting point is whether the many members in various Administrations or who hold government positions have declared their members in the biog raphical data supplied for FBI \"background checks. Above all, The Order is powerful, unbelievably powerful. If the reader will persist and examine the evidence to be presented - which is overwhelmi ng - there is no doubt his view of the world will suddenly come sharply into focus, with almost frightening clarity. t Before we go further we need to add a coup le of important observations about The Order: ● It is a Senior year society which exists only at Yale. Members are chosen in their Junior year and spend only one year on campus, the 5enior ye ar, with Skull & Bones. In ot her words, the organization is o riented to the post graduate outside world. The Order meets annually - patriarchs only - on Deer Island in the St. Lawrence River. ● Senior societies are unique to Yale . There are two other senior societies at Yale, but none elsewhere. Scroll & Key and Wolf's Head are supposedly competitive societies founded in the mi d-19th century. We believe these to be part of the same network. Rosenbaum commented in h is Esquire article, very accurately, that anyone in the Eastern Liberal Establishment who is not a member of Sk ull & Bones is almost certainly a member of either Scroll & Key or Wolf's Head. What is the significance of the \"322\" in Chapter 32 2? William Russell imported the society from Germany and so it has been argued the 322 stands for '32 (f rom 1832), the second chapter, of this German organization. Possibly a chapter 320 and a chapter 321 may exist somewhere And 323 is the designation of a room within the Skull & Bones temple at Yale. Another interpretation is that The Order is descended from a Greek fraternal society dating back to Demosthenes in 322 B.C. This has perhaps some credib ility because Bones records are dated by adding 322 to the current year, i.e., records originatin g in 1950 are dated Anno - Demostheni 2272. How A Member Is Chosen By The Order? The selection procedure for new members of The Order has not changed since 1832. Each year 15, and only 15, never more, never fewer', are selected. In th e past 150 years about 2500 Yale graduates have been initiated into The Order. At any one time about 500-600 are alive and active. Roughly about one-quarter of these take an active role in furthering the objectives of The Order. The others either lose interest or change their minds. They are silent drop-outs."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"A Yale Junior cannot ask to join. There is no election eering. Juniors are invited to join and are given two options: accept or reject. Apparently some amount of personal information is gathered on potential members. The following is the kind of evaluation made in the last century; we doubt it has changed too much down to the present time: ● \"Frank Moore is an ideal Bones man, he is a hard worker and a man whose efforts have been more for Yale than himself. He is manager of the Musica l clubs and has been active in Dwight Hall. His election will be well deserved and popular.\" ● \"Don Thompson is a sure man whom the class wish es well for and will be gl ad to see go. He comes from a Bones family.\" In selection emphasis is placed on athletic ability - the ability to play on a team. The most unlikely potential member of The Order is a loner, an iconoclast, an individualist, the man who goes his own way in the world. 1 Readers who want more on the cermonial and initiation aspects should read the September. 1977 Esquire article by Ron Rosenbaum. ' The Last Secrets of Skull and Bones` Unfortunately, the article completely misses the historical significance of Skull & Bones, although it is a n excellent source of lurid details and the mumbo-jumbo rites The most likely potential member is from a Bones family, who is energetic, resourceful, political and probably an amoral team player. A man who understand s that to get along you have to go along. A man wh o will sacrifice himself for the good of th e team. A moment's reflection illustrate s why this is so. In real life the thrust of The Order is to :)ring about certain objectiv es. Honors and financial rewards are guaranteed by the power of The Order. But the price of these honors and rewards is sacrifice to the common goal, the goal of The Order. Some, perhaps many, have not been willing to pay this price. Inside The Order Entry into The Order is accompanied by an elaborate ritual and no doubt by psychological conditioning. For example: \"Immediately on entering Bones the neophyte's name is ch anged. He is no longer known by his name as it appears in the college catalogue but like a monk or Knight of Malta or St. John, becomes Knight so and so. The old Knights are then known as Patriarch so an d so. The outside world are known as Gentiles and vandals.\" The Catalogue (or membership list - it became \"Addresses\" sometime in this century) of Chapter 322, however, is made with the usual \"o utside\" names and is unique and im pressive. Each member has a copy bound in black leather with peculiar symbols on the ou tside and inside. The symbols presumably have some meaning. The owner's name and the single letter \"D\" is gilt-stamp ed' on the outer cover of earlier issues, at least up to the mid-19th century. It then appears to have been omitted, at least on copies we have seen: Each right- hand page, printed one side only, about 6 x 4 inches, has the members listed for one year and surrounded by a heavy black border, :hick in the early years, not so thic k in recent decades. This symbolizes the death of the person named as he adopts his new name and new life upon entering The Order. Most interesting is an entry between the decade li sts of members. On the 1833 list, before the 15 founders' names, are the words \"Perio d 2 Decade 3.\" Similarly, before names on the 1843 list are the words \"Period 2 Decade 4.\" In brief, \"Period\" stays the same throughout the years , but the \"Decade\" number increases by one in each ten years. No doubt this mean s something to The Order, else it wouldn't be there. Another mystical group of letters and numbers is at th e top of the first list of names in 1833, \"P.231-D.31.\" The numbers increase by one in each succeeding class. In 1834 , for example, the entry reads \"P.232-D 32.\" Furthermore, the first class list of 1833 has two blank lines in place of the eleventh name on the list. This supports the argument that the society has German orig ins and this is the listing of the anonymous German connection."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Members of 1833 We estimate that at any one time only about one-quarter of the membership is active. Even the active quarter is not always effective or successful. It's in structive to compare 1833 wi th 1983 and how, over the century and a half span, a group of 20-30 fa milies has emerged to dominate The Order. The very first name on the very first membership list , Samuel Henshaw Bates, wa s a private in the Union Army, went west to farm in Santa Rosa, California, at that time very much in the boondocks, and died in 1879. A life not different to millions of other Americans. In fact, out of the first 15 members (actually 14 plus the anonymous member), achievements were not much greater than we would expect from the cream of a Yale \"class\". Rufus Hart spent several years in the Ohio Senate, Asahel Hooker Lewis was in the Ohio Legislature for a couple of years, Samuel Marshall was an Illinois State Legislator for a while, and Frederick Math er was in the New York Legislature. Other members, apart from the two founders of The Order, did no thing much with their liv es or for The Order. By contrast, the two founding members, William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft, went far. William Russell was a member of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1846-47, a General in the Connecticut National Guard from 1862-70, and founded the Collegiate and Commercial Institute in New Haven, Connecticut. Alphonso Taft went furthe r: he was Secretary of War in 1876 - the first of several members of The Order to hold this post down into the 1950s. Taft became U.S. Attorney General in 1876-7, then U.S. Minister to Austria in 1882-4, and finally U.S: Ambassador to Russia in 1884-5. During the 150-year interval since 1833, active membership has evolved into a core group of perhaps 20­ 30 families; it seems that active members have enough influence to push their sons and relatives into The Order, and there is significant inter-marriage among the families. These families fall into two major groups. First we find old line American fam ilies who arrived on the East coast in the 1600s, e.g., Whitney, Lord, Phelps, Wadsworth, Allen, Bundy, Adams and so on. Second, we find families who acquired wealth in the last 100 years, sent their sons to Yale and in time became almost old line families, e.g., Ha rriman, Rockefeller, Payne, Davison. Some families, like the Whitneys, were Connecticu t Yankees and acquired wealth in the nineteenth century. In the last 150 years a few families in The Order have gained enormous infl uence in society and the world. One example is the Lord family. Two branches of this family date from the 1630s: Those descended from Nathan Lord and those from Thomas Lord. Other Lords ar rived in the U.S. over the years but do not enter our discussion. Of these two main branch es, only the Thomas Lord group appears to have contributed members to The Order. Their ancestry traces to Thomas Lord, who left Essex, England in 1635 in a company led by Rev. Thomas Hooker, and settled in what is now Hartford, Connecticut. In fact, part of Hartford is still known as Lord's Hill. The line of descent for this Lord family is full of DeForest and Lockwood names because intermarriage is more than co mmon among these elite families. The first Lord to be initiated in to The Order was George DeForest Lord (1854), a New York lawyer. Together with his father, Daniel Lo rd (another Yale graduate ), George DeForest Lord established the New York law firm of Lord, Day and Lo rd. Among its present day clients are The New York Times and the Rubin Foundation. The Rubin Foundation is one of the financial angels for the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. In the next hundred years five mo re Lords were initiated into The Order: Franklin Atkins Lord ('98) William Gale y Lord ('22) Oswald Bates Lord ( '26 ) Charles Edwin Lord, II ('49) Winston Lord ( '59 ) When we ask the question, what have these members achieved? And what are they doing today? a dramatic picture emerges . . . as demonstrated in the chart . . ."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Three: H ow Much Is Known About The Order? The openly published literature on The Order amounts to merely two articles over a span of one hundred years: The Iconoclast (Volume One, Number One only) published October 13, 1873 and an already cited article in Esquire by Ron Rosenbaum, published in 1977. This book and its successors are based on unpublished archival material originating with The Order. The Iconoclast October 1873) Back in October 1873 an enterprising Yale student, stung to action because The Order had taken over Yale finances and left the University near poverty, took it upon himself to publish an expose. Unfortunately, some of the anonymous student's acutest observa tions were buried in not-so-good ve rse. We will reprint some of the verse below as in the original Iconoclast because it's impossi ble to summarize. The Yale college newspapers, Courant and Record, had a blackout policy on The Order. As Iconoclast puts it, \"We speak through a new publication, because the coll ege press is closed to t hose who dare to openly mention 'Bones'.\" The College Press was controlled by The Order. From time to time Yale newspapers were run by Editors in The Order. For example, one noteworthy editor of the Yale Record also in The Order was Thomas Cochran ('94), who went on to make a career as an influential partner in the influential banking firm of J.P. Morgan. Three paragraphs in this anonymous publication summarize the Iconoclast accusation. First, there is a Yale secret society open only to a select few: \"For more than forty years a secret society called Skull and Bones has existed in Yale College. It receives a certain number of men from each class. These are chosen nominally by the members of the class . . ., although it is understood that a prominent man's influence avails for his friends and relatives through several years after his graduation. By observi ng the men elected from year to year, we find that they are chosen with a distinct end in view, namely, that of obtaining for the society the most honors. Some of these h onors are given to literary, some to wealthy men. This, then, is the case. Men receive marks of distinction from Yale College or from their entire class, because of which they ar e taken into this secret society. Si nce Yale honors men, this fraternity professes to honor them also.\" Secondly, the Iconoclast states that The Order has obtai ned control of Yale, and its members care more for their society than for Yale:"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"\"Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men. They have gone out into the world and have become, in many instances, leaders in society. They have obtain ed control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be subject to their will. No doubt they are worthy men in themselves, but the many whom they looked down upon while in co llege, cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands. Men in Wall Street complain that the college comes straight to them for help, instead of asking each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale's and America's first men: Few will give but Bones men, and they care far more for their society than they do for the college.' \" Finally, the Iconoclast calls The Order a \"deadly evil\" growing year by year: \"Year by year the deadly evil is growing. The society was never as obnoxious to the college as it is today, and it is just this ill-feeling that shuts the pock ets of non-members. Never before has it shown such arrogance and self-fancied superiority. It grasps the College Press and endeavors to rule it all. It does not deign to show its credentials, but clutches at power with the silence of conscious guilt. To tell the good which Yale College has done would be well nigh impossible. To tell the good she might do would be yet more difficult. The question, then, is reduced to this - on the one hand lies a source of in­ calculable good, - on the other a society guilty of serious and farreaching crimes. It is Yale College against Skull and Bones!! We ask all men, as a question of right, which should be allowed to live?\" The power of The Order is put to use on behalf of its members even before they leave Yale. Here's a case from the late 19th century which predates the cases we will present later and suggests how long immoral use of power has prevailed within The Order:"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\"The Favoritism Sh own To Bones Men\" \"Are not we coming to a sad state when open injustice can be done by the Faculty, and when the fact that a man is a member of Skull and Bones can prejudice them in his favor? Briefly, the case which calls forth this question is this: Two members of the Senior class, the one being a neutral, the other a Bones man, returned at the beginning of the college year laden with severa l conditions, some of which, upon examination, they failed to pass. Up to this point the cases were parallel , and the leniency, if there was to be leniency, should have been shown to the neutral, who has done all that lay in his power to further the interests of the college, rather than to the Bones man, who has, during his three years at Yale, accomplished nothing that we wot of. But, strange to say, the former has been suspended un til the end of the term and obliged to leave town, not being permitted to pass another examination until he re turns. The Bones man, on the contrary, is allowed to remain in New Haven, attends recitation daily, is call ed upon to recite, and will have a second examination in less than six weeks. Why is this distinction made? `O, Mr. So-and-so's is a special case,' said a professor (a Bones man), - the specialty, we presume, being the fa ct that Mr. So-and-so wears a death's head and cross bones upon his bosom. We understand that Mr. So-and-so claims to have been ill during vacation and offers the illness as an excuse for not passing the examination; but the neutral gentleman was also ill, as the Faculty were expressly informed in a letter from his father.\" \"The circumstance has caused a very lively indignation throughout the Senior class. It is certainly time for a radical reform when the gentlemen who superintend our destinies, and who should be just if nothing else, can allow themselves to be influenced by so petty a th ing as society connections.\" Esquire (September 1977) Only one article is known to have been published within the last 100 years on The Order. Unfortunately, it is a superficial, almost mocking, review and provides some enlightenment but little contribution to historical knowledge. The article is the \"Last Secrets of Sku ll and Bones\" by Ron Rosenbaum (Esquire, September 1977). Rosenbaum is a Yale graduate attracted by the fictional possibilities of a secret society out to control the world; he is apparently not aware of the political implications. The contribution is a blend of known authentic documents and outright hearsay. On the other hand, Rosenbaum does make some notable observations. Among these are: \". . . the people who have shaped America' s national character since it ceased being an undergraduate power had their undergraduate char acter shaped in that cryp t over there\" (i.e., the \"temple\" on the Yale campus). Another comment: when a new member is initiated into The Order, \"tonight he will die to the world and be born again into The Order as he will thenceforth refe r to it. The Order is a world unto itself in which he will have a new name and fourteen new blood brothers, also with new names.\" And when Rosenbaum starts to inquire about The Order, he is told: \"They don't like people tampering and prying. The power of Bones is incredible. They've got their hands on every lever of power in the country. You'll see - it's like trying to look into the Mafia. Remember they're a secret society too.\" The Esquire piece is well worth reading, it gives a si de of The Order that doesn't concern us too much. The \"Addreses\" Books As The Order is a secret society it does not publish minutes or journals. As Rosenbaum suggests, \"they don't like people tampering and prying.„ This author does, however, possess copies of the \"Addresses\" books, which used to be called \"Catalogues.\" These are the membership lists all the way back to 1832, the founding date in the United States. How did this material make its way into outside hands? It is possible that one or more members, although bound by oath, would not be dismayed if the story became public knowledge. That's all we will say. Other material exists, Skull & Bones is always a live ly topic for Yale conversation. Some time back a few practical minded students made their own investigation; th ey did a break-in job, a \"Yalegate.\" A small hoard of Bones momentos, a layout diagram and considerable embarrassment resulted."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The core of the research for this book is the \"Addresses\" books. With these we can reconstruct a picture of motives, objectives and operations. The actions of in dividual members are already recorded in open history and archives. By determining when members enter a scene, what th ey did, what they argued, who they appointed and when they faded out, we can asse mble patterns and deduce objectives."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Four: Who Is In This Secret Society? The membership list of about 2500 initiates in to The Order has very obvious features: ● Most members are from the Eastern seaboard United States. As late as 1950 only three members resided in Los Angeles, California, but 28 members resided in New Haven, Connecticut. ● Members are all males and almost all WASPS (White Anglo Saxon Protestant). In great part they descended from English Puritan fa milies, their ancestors arrived in North America in the 1630-1660 period. ● These Puritan families either intermarried with financial power or invited in sons of money mogu ls, e.g., Rockefellers, Davisons, and Harrimans, whose sons became members of The Order. From this preliminary informati on we can derive Hypothesis One: THERE EXISTS [N THE UNITED STATES TO DAY, AND HAS EXISTED SINCE 1833, A SECRET SOCIETY COMPRISING MEMBERS OF OLD LINE AMERICAN FAMILIES AND REPRESENTATIVES OF FINANCIAL POWER. The chart on page 19 presents a simp lified layout of this hypothesis. Full information remains for a later book - for now we'll give details of just two key families, the Whitneys and the Harrimans. The Whitney Family A key family is the Whitneys, descended from English Puritans who came to the U.S. about 1635 and settled in Watertown, Mass. Eight Whitneys have been members of The Order. Of these, three had brief lives; Emerson Cogswell Whitney died a few months after initiation and Edward Payson Whitney \"disappeared in 1858\" according to his biographer. However, three Whit neys, William Collins Whitney and his two sons, are the core of Whitney influence in The Order which survives today through the Harriman family and intermarriage with Paynes and Vanderbilts.

Whitne y) and Gu gg enheim Ex p lora tion Co."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"William Collins Whitney (1841-1904) is a fine exampl e of how members of The Order rise to fame and fortune. W.C. Whitney was initiated in 1863 and by 1872 had only advanced his career to Inspector of Schools for New York. However, in the last three deca des of the century, he rolled up a massive fortune, became a power behind the throne in the Cleveland Administration, and directed the often unscrupulous activities of a cluster of capitalists known as \"the Whitney Group\". A brief quotation suggests the power that Whitney amassed in a brief 30 years. This is a list of Whitney estates at the turn of the century: \". . . a city residence in New York, a Venetian pala ce and 5,000 acres in Wheatl ey Hills, near Jamaica, L.I.; a Sheepshead Bay house, with a private track covering 300 acres; a mansion at Berkshire Hills, Mass., with 700 acres of land; October Mountain hou se, with a large tract of land; Stony Ford Farm, New York, used as an auxiliary to his Kentucky St ock Farm; an Adirondack game preserve of 16,000 acres; a lodge at Blue Mountain Lake with a fine golf course, a Blue Grass farm of 3,000 acres in Ken­ tucky; and an estate at Aiken, S.C., comprising a mansion, race course, and 2,000 acres of hunting land.\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"William C. Whitney married Flora Payne, daughter of Standard Oil Treasurer Oliv er Payne. The Paynes are not in The Order, but adding the Payne piece of the St andard Oil fortune made Whitney's fortune that much larger. Their two sons, Harry Payne ('94) and Payne Whitney ('98), went to Yale and became members of The Order. After Yale Harry Payne promptly married Ge rtrude Vanderbilt in 1896 and so the Whitney-Payne fortune now joined some Vanderbilt money. This financial power was channeled into Guaranty Trust, the J.P. Morgan and Guggenheim outfits. And it gets more complicated. For example, the son of Harry Payne Whitney, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, married Marie Norton. After their divorce, Marie Norton Whitney married W. Averell Harriman (his first wife) who is today at 91 a key member. It is these tightly woven family and financial interlocks that make up the core of The Order. So let's take a look at the Harriman family. The Harriman Family In the first few days of June 1983 a prominent Am erican, a private citizen, flew to Moscow for a confidential chat with Yuri Andropov. A State Department interpreter went along. This American was not the President, nor the Vice-President, nor the Secretary of State, nor any member of the Reagan Administration. It was a private individual - W. Averell Harriman. The first time any American had talked with Yuri Andropov since the death of his predecessor, Brezhnev. So who is W. Averell Harriman? The elder Harriman, a prominent and not too scrupulous railroad magnate, sent both his sons to Yale. William Averell Harriman ('13) and Edward Roland Noel Harrima n ('17) joined The Order. A good example of how old line families in The Order absorbed ne w wealth families, although as hist ory has unfolded it may be that Harriman and his fellow investment bankers have domi nated the direction of The Order in the past few decades."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Brown Brothers Harriman , advertisemen t fro m Wall Street Journal listing partners ."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In the 1930s W.A. Harriman & Company merged with Brown Brothers. This was an older financial house whose partners were also members of The Order. Alexander Brown was founde d 1800 in New York and Philadelphia. By the 1970s the relatively unknown private intern ational banking firm of Brown Brothers, Harriman, with assets of about one-half billion dollars, had taken in so many of \"the Brotherhood\" that out of 26 in­ dividual partners, no fewer than 9 were members of The Order. We don't know of any greater concentration of members. And to make it more interesting, Prescott Bush, father of President George H. W. Bush (both in The Order), was a partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman for over 40 years. Finally, because Brown Brothers, Harriman is a private banking firm it has relatively no government supervision and does not publish an annual report. In other words, we know NO THING about its operations - at least we know nothing from Brown Brothers, Harriman sources. Here's a line-up of Brown Brothers, Harriman partners who were also members of The Order in the mid 1970s: Name of Partner Date Initiated Walter H. Brown 1945 Prescott Sheldon Bush 1917 Granger Kent Costikyan 1929 Edward Roland Noel Harriman 1917 W. Averell Harriman 1913 Stephen Young Hord 1921 Robert Abercrombie Lovett 1918 John Beckwith Madden 1941 Knight Woolley 1917 It's worth thinking about this concentration of names and the power it represents in the light of outside comments on The Order over the years. After the title page of this volume we reprint the verse of an anonymous Yale student of the 1870s. He commented on the requirement to put The Order ahead of all else. The Editor of The Iconoclast (also in the 1870s) wrote: And on their breasts they wear a sign That tells their race and name It is the ghastly badge of death And from his kingdom came The son of Satan, son of sin The enemy of man. Another writer in the 1870s called Th e Order the \"Brotherhood of Death\": Outside already, in the doubtful dawn, Thither, from this side and from that, slow sweep, And settle down in silence solidly, Crow-wise, the frightful Brotherhood of De ath. Black-hatted an d black-hooded huddle they, With black cravats a-dangling from each neck; So take they their grim station at the door, Torches lit, skull-and-cross-bones-banner spread."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Ron Rosenbaum in his 1977 Esquire article a century la ter, was no less caustic. Rosenbaum called it a Mafia. From evidence to be presented later this author would term The Order \"an international Mafia\" . . . unregulated and all but unknown. To the outside world, however, it's merely Br own Brothers, Harriman, 59 Wall Street, New York. But obviously Yuri Andropov over in Moscow knows who holds the cards. The British Connection Some well read readers may raise a question - how does The Order the its families relate to Cecil Rhodes secret society, Milners Round Table, the Illuminati and the Jewish secret society equivalents? How do these fit into the picture? We are concerned here only with the core of a pure ly American phenomenon with German origin. It is undoubtedly linked to overseas grou ps. The links between The Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. Notably the British establishment was also founded at a University - Oxford University, and especially Al l Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called \"The Group.\" The Group links to the Jewish equi valent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes \"inner circle\"). The Orde r in the U.S. links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families. There were no Jews at all in The Or der until very recently. In fact, The Order has, as Rosenbaum suggests, some definite an ti-semetic tendencies. Token Jews (and token blacks) have been ad­ mitted in recent years. There is an Illuminati connection. Some details are in the Esquire article, more details will be in our future volumes. All these groups have cooperative an d competitive features. But to argue that all the world's ills can be ascribed to any one of these groups is false. The core of The Order, like the core of \"The Group\" in England, comprises about 20 families. In the U.S. case they are mostly descendents from the original settlers in Massachusetts. New wealth did not enter The Order until the mid-19th century and until recently, has never dominated The Order. On the other hand, key fa milies, the Whitneys and the Harrimans, are linked to their own banking interests. In many ways these old line Yankee families have outsmarted the bankers. The Puritans diverted bankers' wealth to their own object ives without always absorbing the banker families. The Order controls the substantial wealth of Andrew Carn egie, but no Carnegie has ever been a member of The Order. The Order used the Ford wealth so flagrantly ag ainst the wishes of the Fo rd family that two Fords resigned from the board of the Ford Foundation. No Ford has been a member of Th e Order. The name Morgan has never appeared on the membership lists, although some Morgan partners are with the inner core, for example, Davison and Perkins. Interestingly, the Astor name is prominent in \"The Group\" in England, but not in The Order in the U.S."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Five: What Organizations Has It Penetrated? The Order has either set up or penetrated just about every significant research, policy, and opinion- making organization in the United States, in addition to the Church, business, law. government and politics. Not all at the same time, but persistently and consiste ntly enough to dominate the direction of American society. The evolution of American society is not, and has not been for a century, a voluntary development reflecting individual opinion, ideas and decisions at th e grass roots. On the contrary, the broad direction has been created artificially and stimulated by The Order. Not all organizations know they have been penetrated or used for another purpose. It's a situation very much as Quigley (see page 30) found in \"The Group\": \"there is . . . an inner core of intimate associates who unquestionably knew that they were members of a group devoted to a common pu rpose and an outer circle of a larger number on whom the inner circle acted by personal persuasion, patronage distribution and social pressure. It is probable that most members of the outer circle were not conscious that they were being used by a secret society.\" Therefore our Hypothesis Number Two is: THE ORDER HAS PENETRATED OR BEEN THE DOMINANT INFLUENCE [N SUFFICIENT POLICY, RESEARCH AND OPINION MAKING ORGANIZATIONS THAT IT DETERMINES THE BASIC DIRECTION OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. The Order Is The Original Impulse One observation is that The Order gets the ball rolling in new organizations, i.e., pu ts in the FIRST President or Chairman and the ideas and then, when operations ar e rolling along, often just fa des out of the picture. Among universities we can cite Cornell University, where Andrew Dickson White ('53) was its FIRST President, and Johns Hopkins University, based on the Ge rman educational system, where Daniel Coit Gilman ('52) was the FIRST President (1875-1901). Among academic associations the Amer ican Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the American Psycholog ical Association were all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order. These are ke y associations for the c onditioning of society. This phenomenon of The Order as the FIRST on the scene is found especially among foundations, although it appears that The Order keeps a contin uing presence among Foundation Truste es. It does more than just be"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FIRST where money is concerned. It stays around to keep an eye on expenditures. The FIRST President of the Carnegie Institution (1902-5) was Daniel Coit Gilman, but other members of The Or der nave been on Carnegie boards since the turn of the century. Gilman .vas on th e scene for the founding of the Peabody, Slater, and Russell 5age Foundations. McGeor ge Bundy was President of the Ford Foundation from 1966-1979. The FIRST Chairman of an influential but almost unknown organiza t ion established in 1910 was also a member of The Order. In 1920 Theodore Marburg founded the American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes, but Marbur g was only President. The FIRST Chairman was member William Howard Taft ('78). The Society .vas the forerunner of the League to Enforce the Peace, which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately into the United Nations. In United Nations we find, for example, that Archibal d McLeash ('15) was the brains behind the constitution of the UNESCO organization. We find the same FIRS T on the scene phenomenon in \"think tanks.\" :n 1960, James Jeremiah Wadsworth ('27) set up the Peace Research Institute. In 1963 this was merged to become the Institute for Policy Studies, along with Marcus Rashkin, who had been National Secu rity Council Aide (1961-3) to McGeorge Bundy ('40), a very active member of The Order. The Church About 2 percent of The Order is in the Church (all Prot estant denominations), alt hough this percentage has declined in r ecent years. A key penetration is the Union Theological Seminary, af filiated with Columbia University in New York. This Seminary, a past subject of investigation for Communist infiltration, has close links to The Order. Henry Sloane Coffin ('97) was Professor of Practical Theology at Union from 1904 to 1926 and President of Union Theological Seminary, also known as the \"Red Semi nary,\" from 1926 to 1945. Union has such a wide interpretation of religious activity that has, or used to have, an Atheists Club for its students. Henry Sloane Coffin, Jr. ('49) was one of the Boston Five indicted on federal conspiracy charges. And this is only part of The Order's penetration into the Church. The Law The major establishment law firms in Ne w York are saturated with The Order. In particular, Lord, Day and Lord, dominated by the Lord family already discussed; also Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett, especially the Thacher family; David, Polk, Wardwell and Debevoise, Plimpton, the Rockefeller family law firm. Communications There has been a significant penetratio n into communications. Some examples: • Henry Luce of Time-Life is in The Order. • so is William Buckley ('50) of National Review • and Alfred Cowles ('13), Presid ent of Cowles Communications, Des Moines Register, Minneapolis Star • and Emmert Bates ('32) of Litton Educational Systems, pl us ' Richard Ely Danielson ('07) of Atlantic Monthly • Russell Wheeler Davenport ('23), Fortune ' John Chipman Farrar ('18), of Farrar, Straus, the pu blishers. The most prestigious award in journalism is a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. Over 300 were granted from 1937-68. The FIRST Director of the Nieman Fund was member Archibald McLeash. Industry"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The oil companies have their links to The Order. Members Percy Rockefeller, the Paynes, the Pratts, all link to Standard Oil. Shell Oil, Creole Petroleum, and Socony Vacuum also link. A wide variet y of manufacturing firms have members in The Order from the Donnelley family in Chicago (printers of the Official Airline Guide and other references); lu mber companies like Weyerhaeuser, who is also a Trilateralist; Dresser Industries, and so on. The Federal Reserve System A dozen members can be linked to the Federal Reserv e, but one appointment is noteworthy, Pierre Jay ('92), whose only claim to fame in 1913 was to run a private school and be an obscure Vice President of Manhattan Bank yet he became FIRST Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, the really significant Reserve Bank. The White House, Politics and Government This is the area where The Order has made headway: with names like Taft, Bush, Stimson, Chafee, Lovett, Whitn ey, Bundy and so on. It will take a separate volume to cover this story and in Memorandum Nine we describe just one example, THE BUNDY OPERATION. Memorandum Number Six: Operations Of The Order In 1981 The Anglo American Establishment, by Carroll Quigley, was published in New York by a small anti- Establishment publisher. Quigley was formerly instructor at Princeton an d Harvard and then Professor at the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University. The publisher notes in his introduction that Quigley had been unable to find a major publisher for the manuscript . This is not surprising. The book blows the lid off the British equivalent of The Order. The Anglo American Establishment has nothing at all to do with the American establishment, which is hardly mentioned, but it has a lot to do with the British establishment. The publisher probably inserted the word \"AMERICAN\" into the title to enhance marketability in the States. Quigley describes in minute detail the historical operations of the British establishment controlle d by a secret society and operating very much as The Order operates in the U.S. This is the re al significance of Quigley's explosive book. The Group The British secret society, known as \"The Group\" or just plain \"US\", was foun ded at Oxford University, much as The Order was founded at Yale, but wit hout the Masonic mumbo jumbo. As we noted in Memorandum Five. the Group operates in a series of c oncentric circles and like The Order consists of old line families allied with private merc hant bankers, known in the U. S. as investment bankers. Bearing in mind. the proven existence of The Grou p. the operations of The Order and the kind of penetration it has achieved cannot be explained by mere chance. By examining The Order's operations we can generate a picture of its objectives wi thout access to any internal constituti on or statement of objectives even if such exists. It may only be word of mouth. By contrast. The Group's objective is re corded in Cecil Rhod es' will. It was: The extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are at- tainable by energy. labor and enterprise ... and the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire. This objective is, of course. ridiculous and somewhat immature, but no less ridiculous and immature than the New World order objective of The Order. Yet The Group has controlled British policy for a hundred years and still does."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Both The Group and The Order have been created by Anglophiles who want to pattern the world on a Hegelian-Anglo hybrid cu lture. Where the Latins, the Slavs and the Sino races fit is not considered, but clearly these cultures will be disinclined to become pawns of ei ther the British Empire or New England Yankees. Even within the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of nations, it is unlik ely that Canada, Australia and New Zealand would accept the constitu tional bondage envisaged by Cecil R hodes. Both secret organizations overlook, and there is a philosophic basis for this neglect, the natural right of any ethnic group, be it white, black or yellow, English, Slav ic or Latin, to develop its own culture without coercion. Unlike this author, Quigley sympathizes with the ends of The Group, although he terms their methods despicable. Both The Group and The Or der are unwilling or unable to bring about a global society by voluntary means, so they opted for coercion. To do this they have created wars and revo lutions, they have ransacked public treasuries, they have oppresse d, they have pillaged, they have lied - even to their own countrymen. How have they done this? Modus Operandi Of The Order The activities of The Order are directed towards changi ng our society, -hanging the world, to bring about a New World Order. This will be a pl anned order with heavily restricted individual freedom, without Con- stitutional protection, without national boundaries or cultural distinction. We deduce this objective by examining and then summin g up the actions of individual members: there has been a consistent pattern of activity over one hundred years. Part of this ac tivity has been in cooperation with The Group, with its parallel and recorded objectives. Now if, for example, we found that the dominant intere st of members .vas raising ducks, that they wrote articles about ducks, bred ducks, sold ducks, formed duck-studying councils, develo ped a philosophy of ducks, then it would be reasonable to conclude that they had an objective concerning ducks, that this is not mere random activity. Historically, operations of The Orde r have concentrated on society, now to change society in a specific manner towards a specific goal: a New World Order. We know the elements in society that will have to be changed in order to bring about this New World order, we can then examine The Order's actions in this context. More or less these elements would have to be: Education - how the population of the future will behave, Money - the means of holding wealth and exchanging goods, Law - the authority to enforce the will of the state, a world law and a world court is needed for a world state, Politics - the direction of the State, Economy - the creation of wealth, History - what people believe ha ppened in the past, Psychology - the means of controlling how people think, Philanthropy - so that people think well of the controllers, Medicine - the power over health, life and death, Religion - people's spiritual beliefs, the spur to action for many, Media - what people know and learn about current events, Continuity - the power to appoint who follows in your footsteps. Operations in each of these areas will be detailed in subsequent volumes. For example, in the next volume, The Order Controls Education, we will desc ribe how Daniel Coit Gilman, President of Johns Hopkins University, imported Wundt psychological me thods from Germany, then welded education and psychology in the U.S., established laboratories, brough t these educational laboratories into major Univer- sities and generated 100s of PhDs to teach the new educ ational conditioning system. One of the first of these Johns Hopkins doctorates was John Dewey. The result we well know. The educational morass of the '80s where most kids - not all - can't spell, read or write, yet can be programmed into mass behaviour channels. The Order's next move was to control the Foundations. They got all the big ones - Carnegie, Ford, Peabody, Slater, Russell Sage and so on. That's the topic of another volume. As in education, the modus operandi of The Order was to get in FIRST and set the stage for the future. The initial objective was to establish a direction in an organization. Selection of ma nagers, intuitive or amoral enough to catch on to the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"direction, kept the momentum going. In the case of Foundations, The Order has usually maintained a continuing presence over decades. When it comes to activities by individual members, at first sight the pattern is confusing and superficially inconsistent. Let's give some examples: • Andrew Carnegie profited from war through his vast steel holdings, but under the guidance of member Daniel Coit Gilman, Carnegie was also an enthusiastic president and financial backer of the American Peace Society. This is seemingly inconsistent. Could Carnegie be for war and peace at the same time? • The League to Enforce the Peace, founded by members William H. Ta ft and Theodore Marburg, was promoting peace, yet active in urging U.S. participation in World Wa r One. How could the League be for war and peace at the same time? • In the 1920s, W. Averell Harriman was a prime suppo rter of the Soviets with finance and diplomatic assistance, at a time when such aid was against Stat e Department regulations. Ha rriman participated in RUSKOMBANK, the first Soviet commercial bank . Vice-President Max May of Guaranty Trust, dominated by the Harriman-Morgan interests, be came the FIRST Vice President of RUSKOMBANK in charge of its foreign operations. In brief, an Am erican banker under guidance of a member of The Order had a key post in a Soviet bank! But we also find that Averell Harriman, his brother Roland Harriman, and members E.S. James and Knight Woolle y, through the Union Bank (in which they held a major interest) were prime fi nancial backers of Hitler. Now our textbooks tell us that Nazis and Soviets we re bitter enemies and :heir systems are opposites. How could a rational man support Soviets and Nazis at the same time? Is Harriman irrationa l or is the inconsistency explainable? • The Bundy family (we have a Memorandum on th em later) gives us another example of seeming inconsistency. William Bundy was with the Central Intelligence Agency for a decade. McGeorge Bundy was National Security Assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johns on. So the Bundys presumably support U.S.-European policy which is pro-NATO. Yet the Bundys have been linked to activities and organizations which are anti NATO and, indeed, pr o-Marxist - for example, the Institute for Policy Studies. Are the Bundys inconsistent? • Among individual members of The Order we find a wide variety of public ly proclaimed beliefs, ideologies and politics. William Buckely periodically chews out the Soviets. On the other hand, member John Burtt has been a member of a dozen communist front groups. Member William S. Coffin, Jr. spent three years with CIA and then became a leader of anti-Vietnam war activity through the National Conference for a New Politics and Clergy and Laym en Concerned about Vietnam. In fact, Coffin was one of the Boston Five charged and in dicted for conspiracy to violate Federal laws. And, of course, W. Averell Harriman is elder statesman of the Democratic Party. Quite a mixture of beliefs and activities. Do they reflect inconsistent philosophies? How can The Order have a consistent objec tive with this potpourri of individual actions? The answer is, they are not at all inconsistent: because the objective of The Order is above and beyond these actions and in fact needs these seeming contradictions. The State is Absolute How can there exist a common objective when members are apparently acting in opposition to one another? Probably the most difficult task in this work will be to get across to the reader what is really an elementary observation: that the objective of The Order is neither \"left\" nor \"right.\" \"Left\" and \"right\" are artificial devices to bring about change, and the extremes of polit ical left and political right are vital elements in a process of controlled change. The answer to this seeming political puzzle lies in Hege lian logic. Remember that both Marx and Hitler, the extremes of \"left\" and \"right\" presen ted as textbook enemies, evolved out of the same philosophical system:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Hegelianism. That brings sc reams of intellectual anguish from Marxis ts and Nazis, but is well known to any student of political systems. The dialectical process did not originate with Marx as Marxists claim, but with Fichte and Hegel in late 18th and early 19th century Germany. In the dialectical pr ocess a clash of opposites brings about a synthesis. For example, a clash of political left and political right brings about another political system, a synthesis of the two, neither left nor right. This conflict of opposites is essential to bring about change . Today this process can be identified in the literature of the Trilateral Commission where \"change\" is promoted and \"conflict management\" is termed the means to bring about this change. In the Hegelian system conflict is essential. Furthermore, for Hegel and systems based on Hegel, the State is absolute. The State requires complete obedience from the individual citizen. An individual does not exist for himself in these so-called organic systems but only to perform a role in the operation of the State. He finds freedom only in obedience to the State. There wa s no freedom in Hitler's Germany, there is no freedom for the individual under Marxism, neither will there be in the New World Order. And if it sounds like George Orwell's 1984 - it is. In brief, the State is supreme and conflict is used to bring about the ideal society. Individuals find freedom in obedience to the rulers. So who or what is the State? Obviously it's a self -appointed elite. It is interesting that Fichte, who developed these ideas before Hegel, was a freemason, almost certainly Illu minati, and certainly was promoted by the Illuminati. For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe (Abaris in the Illuminati code) pushed Fichte for an appointment at Jena University. Furthermore, the Illuminati principle that the end justifies the means. a principle that Quigley scores as immora l and used by both The Group and The Order, is rooted in Hegel. Even the anonymous Yale student who wrote the verse in Memorandum Three observed th is principle at work on the Yale campus. This, then, is a vital part of our explanation of The Order. When its co-founder, William Russell, was in Germany in 1831-2, there was no way he could have avoi ded Hegelian theory and di scussion. It was the talk of the campus. It swept intellectual Germany like a Pac Man craze. Most Americans haven't heard of it. And those who have don't want to hear any more about it. Why? Because its assumptions are completely at variance with our sense of individual freedom and Cons titutional guarantees. Most of us believe the State exists to serve the individual, not vice versa. The Order believes the opposite to most of us. That is crucial to understanding wh at they are about. So any discussion between left and right, while essential to promote change, is never allowed to develop into a discussion along the lines of Jeffersonian democracy, i.e., the best government is least government. The discussion and the funding is always towards more stat e power, use of state power and away from individual rights. So it doesn't matter from the viewpoint of Th e Order whether it is termed left, right, Democratic, Republican, secular or religious - so long as the discussion is kept within the framework of the State and the power of the State. This is the common feature between the seemin gly dissimilar positions taken by members - they have a higher common objective in which clash of ideas is essential . So long as rights of the individual are not introduced into the discussion the clash of idea s generates the conflict necessary for change. As the objective is also global control an emphasis is placed on global - _' - inking, i.e., internationalism. This is done through world organizatio ns and world law. The great contribution of the Tafts to Th e Order w as on the world court system and world law - to the internationalist aspe ct of the New World Order. Memorandum Number Seven:"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" How The Order Relates To The Council On Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission And Similar Organizations Organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations (C FR) do not fit the requirements for a conspiracy. They are simply too large and their membership is no t secret. The membership li st for The Order has never surfaced until now. Anyone can obtain a list of memb ers for the CFR and the Tril ateral Commission. Also, too many people are included as members in these organizations who are just not given to membership in conspiratorial groups. Certainly there is off-the-record discussion and certa inly the general direction of U.S. policy reflects majority thinking in these organiza tions - but they are not conspiracies. Moreover, the CFR and its sister organizations are not geared to action and implementation of policy. Compare, for example, the Brown Brothers, Harriman firm with nine members of The Order and the CFR. Obviously the first is more cohesive, yet more low profil e, more able to conceal its actions, yet more action oriented. The larger open organizations are a forum for discussion, a place where ideas can be kicked around, \"a rich man's club\", as someone commented, where pe ople can be assessed, where discrete comment and criticism can be made away from a nosy press and a possibly unsympatheti c public. They may not be elected bodies, but neither are they conspiracies; they fall in the shadow of a conspiracy. They are neither democratic or dictatorial. The Role Of The Order The Order is represented in these organizations but does not always dominate. David Rockefeller, a former chairman of the CFR, is not a member of The Order (only Percy Rockefeller has represented the family), but the present CFR chairman, Winston Lord, is. We can represent the relationship between The Order and the larger groups as a series of concentric circles. The CFR, etc. form an outer circle, i.e., a penumbra. They exist in a shadow cast by an inner organization. It is this inner organization that needs to be surfaced. The Order is the inner circle and Chapter 322 is a part of this inner circle because it is unlikel y Chapter 322 is the only chapter in the U.S. We suspect, but cannot yet prove, at least one other. How Chapter 322 Of The Order Relates To Other Organizations"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" In brief, it looks like three segments: (1) The outer circle , made up of large, open organizations with some membership coming from The Order. (2) The inner circle , made up of one or more secret societies like Chapter 322. We can only prove one chapter at this time. (3) The inner core , a secret society within a secret society. This is the inner decision-making core. We cannot prove it exists, but logic suggests that some members of the inner circle will form an executive committee, an action group, an inner core. While we cannot prove the existence of an inner core, there are some obvious candidates for membership and we could hazard a guess as to the identity of the Chairman. The Outer Circle The Council on Foreign Relations is the largest orga nization in the outer circle. It has about 2500 members at any one time, as many as The Order in its entire history. The Trilateral Commission has 200 members world wide, but only 70 in the United States. These are younger organizations. The CFR dates from 1922, The Pilgrims from 1900, The Trilateral Commission from 1973, and the Bilderbergers from the 1950s. How many members of The Order are in the CFR? This is not the place for an exhaustive analysis, but a general idea can be gained from looking at names in The Order beginning with the letter \"B\": The following are members of The Order and the Council on Foreign Relations: Jonathan Bingham (Congressman)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"William F. Buckley (Editor, National Review and The Order's house conservative) McGeorge Bundy (Foundati on executive) William Bundy (Central Intelligence Agency) George Herbert Walker Bush (President of the United States) The make-up of the Council on Foreign Relations reflec ts its purpose as a meeting ground, a discussion forum. The CFR mainly consists of government officials, industrialists and academics. The Order has a distinctly differe nt make-up, i.e., many more lawyers, for example, and a wider variety of declared occu pations with far fewer industrialists. The Trilateral Commission The Trilateral Commission was founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller and comprises 200 members world wide, of whom about 77 are American. There is no overlap among memberships; for example, lumber industrialist Frederick W eyerhaeuser was in The Order, but his son is in the Trilateral Commission and not The Order. Similarly, Robert Ta ft, Jr., is in the Tril ateral Commission but not The Order, even though The Order was co-founded by his great grandfather and eight Tafts have been members. The link is elusive, conc eivably there may not be a link. The Trilateral Commission is not a cons piracy. Its membership list is completely public - it costs a postage stamp to get one. The Commission publishes dozens of booklets. The organization is completely above ground. In fact, this author has openly debated with George Franklin , Jr., Coordinator of the Trilateral Commission on the radio. Mr. Franklin did show a rather ill-concealed dislike for the assault on his pet global New World Order - and made the mistake of attempting to disguise this objective, but evasion and hostilit y do not constitute conspiracy. Cons pirators just don't appear on radio talk shows to debate their objectives. Temporarily the following facts should be held in mind: ' J. Richardson Dilworth, at Room 3600 Rockefeller Pl aza, and the Rockefeller Family Associates' chief financial and administrative officer, is a member of The Order. ' Percy Rockefeller (1900) was a memb er of The Order, but no other Ro ckefeller name is on the list. It may be that the Trilateral Commission will prove to be a purely D avid Rockefeller personal endeavor rather than a broader establishment vehicle. However, Trilateral purposes, as portrayed in the literature, are almost identical to those of The Order. It may be a vehicle to attain an interim goal, i.e., three regional groupings. In this case J. Richardson Dilworth is the conduit and liaison. Bilderbergers So far as we can trace, only William F. Buckley is a member of the Bilder bergers and The Order. Pilgrim Society The Order does not show up directly on the Executive Committee of !he Pilgrim Society, but only through family names, i.e., Aldrich and Pratt. The Pilgrim Society is probably a rather harmless social club using its annual dinners to cement ties between the British and American establishment. The Inner Circle Chapter 322 of The Order differs from the CFR, the Tril ateral Commission and similar organizations in that it is truly a secret society. Its purposes and membership are not disclosed. It is paranoid about secrecy and in covering its trail. The circumstances that surround the founding of Scro ll & Key in the 1850s suggest this secret society may in fact be Chapter 323. But th is is pure speculation. So we have two s ecret societies that di ffer extensively from the CFR, Trilaterals and others and which ca n be seen as making up an inner circle. J"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Even this inner circle is too large for de cision making. No doubt it includes many active or just plain bored members, even many who have forgotten they were ever initiated and who might be shocked to read in this book that they belong to a subversive organization. So logically ther e is a secret society within the secret society. Again, we cannot pr ove it, but it's a logical de duction. This would be an executive committee that controls finances and makes basic decisions. Another important distinction between the outer core and the inner circle is in fu nding. This is important because funding controls everything . The families in The Or der are closer to more foundations and more sources of funding than the Rockefeller family. To be sure, the Rockefeller family has 1 percent of Chase Manhattan stock, enough for control, and it has infl uence in the Rockefeller Foundation, but this doesn't compare to the centuries long pervasive influence of Th e Order. Remember, it was The Order that got John D. Rockefeller off the ground with his General Education Board, not the other way round. It's an open question quite how the Trilaterals fit with The Order. It may be the international aspect of The Order, it may be a Rockefeller dominated group. Many of these old line families see th e Rockefellers as upstarts, as nouv eau riche, not quite on the outside looking in, but definitely not socially acceptable without some re servations - except for their money, of course. Anyone who heard Nelson Rockefeller speak and compar ed his syntax to the polished charm of a Boston Brahmin will understand. There's a Ne w England saying that \"the Lowells only talk to the Cabots and the Cabots only talk to God.\" The Rockefellers just are not in this league. And if we may be excused a little gossip: we have b een told by several establishment people that David Rockefeller is just \"not too bright,\" and Nelson Rockefeller was the only man in America who could torture the English language to the extent of plac ing two \"non sequiters\" in one sentence. If we were to look back to 1983 from the year 2083, it could be that the Rockefellers will have followed in the footsteps of the Carnegies and the Morgans. Names in dusty files but no longer represented in the power group. Memorandum Number Eight: The Chain Of Influence Initiates into The Order are assured of career ad vancement and success, even wealth, providing they follow the rule \"to get along you must 3o along\" Intermarriage consolidates the power of the families and expa nds their span of influence. Finally, a chain of influence spread over many year s guarantees continuity and must be extraordinarily impressive to any new initiate who doubts the power of The Order. We can identify two types of influence chains: a hori zontal chain and a vertical chain. Both types are duplicated many times, for the moment well give a single example. Horizontal Chains of Influence Members of The Order are to be found in every segment of society: in education, in foundations, in politics, in government, industry, law and financ e. Consequently, at any time The Order can tap influence in any ar ea of society. The occupational breakdown of The Order demons trates the great breadth of this horizontal chain of influence. The major occupations of member s are law, education, business, finance a nd industry. Approximately, the breakdown is as follows:   Percent of members Occupation   involved   (approximately)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Law    18    percent    Education   16   percent    Business    16    percent    Finance    15    percent    Industry 12 percent 77 percent "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"In other words, these five occupations account for over three quarters of the membership, and these are the key fields for control of society. Government and politics account for only about 3 percent at any one time. This is misleading, as any member in the above five fields can find himself temporarily in and out of government through the \"revolving door\" phenomenon. The Church accounts for only 2 percent of members. These are concentrated in the Union Theological Seminary (the so-called \"Red Seminary\") and the Yale School of Divinity. Notably the areas of society least represented are those with the least ability to influence the structural direction of society. They may give depth and richness to society, but are not essential to its control and direction. For example, very, very few engineers have ever been members of The Order - we only identified five engineers in the 150 year span. Yet engineering an d technology are key elements to the success of the material aspects of American society. Art, architecture, and music are under-represented. We can only identify 16 members in these three occu pations over 150 years. Again, these occupations are not influential in determining the structure of societ y. Farmers are under-re presented; only 16 in 150 years, but we suspect some took up farming to get away from The Order. In brief: at any one time The Order can call on members in any area of American society to do what has to be done. Vertical Chains of Influence A tribute to the success of The Order has been an ability to implement one of its principles. This principle is: \"That only he who wears upon his breast, Their embl em, he for every post shall be considered best.\" The practice of absolute preferment for members of The Order has worked to perpetuate its influence over time in a remarkable manner. Before we look at this chain of influence we need to look at some basic statistics. The Order has only initia ted about 2500 members in its history in the United States. Each year 15 new members are initiated, no more, no less. On th e other hand, between 800,000 and 1 million persons receive college degrees each year from an institute of higher learning, including about 30,000 doctorates. When you follow the chain of influence below, hold in mind that out of 30-40 million degree holders, a few hundred men (never women) or in this case less than a dozen men, are presumed to be the only ones fit to occupy top posts in government. No one else is even seriously considered. We are asked to believe that only a few hundred members of The Order ar e capable of guiding the United States. If we assume a random distribution of ability thro ughout the United States, then our evidence cannot be accounted for by chance. It must reflect, just on the basis of mathematical laws of average, a conscious series of choices. Unless you want to assume that a ll wisdom and a11 ability in the United States is generated solely by 15 Yale graduates each year. And that gets you back to the argument of this book. ON ACTIVE SERVICE"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" IN PEACE AND WAR BY HENRY L.

Are we to believe that only one of these institutions ca n generate the talent to lead the country? The Whitney-Stimson-Bundy-Ach eson Chain of Influence Four families provide an example of one such chain of influence. Multiply this chain by a few dozen and you readily see how control is perpetuate d by a small group. The families in this chain are Whitney, Stimson, Acheson and Bundy. The Acheson family is only partly in The Order. Dean Acheson was a member of Scroll & Key at Yale. This is an offshoot of The Order and at least influenced by it. Dean Acheson's daughter, Mary Acheson, married William Bundy (The Order). Dean Acheson's son, Davi d, is a member of The Order. (1) We start with the Whitneys in the late 19th century . Whitney The Order), along with Ryan and a handful of other capitalists, have been heavily cr iticized in several books on grounds of massive corruption and fraud. New York street railway franchises generated enormous prof its for the Whitney group. When Whitney was Secretary of the Navy he promoted a giant naval ship buildin g program - which didn't hu rt his friends who owned shipyards and steel mills. Whitney's attorney and close associat e was Elihu Root. Although not a memb er of The Order, Root has been called \"Whitney's artful attorney\" (Point \"A\" on our char t). Root, one of the sharpest legal minds n American history and a power in his own right, worked along with the purposes of The Order.

After a while , in 1897, it became mown as Root, Howard, Winthrop & Stimson and by 1901 it became Wint hrop and Stimson. In the meantime (\"C\"), Stimson married Mabel White daughter of Charles A. Whit e (The Order). Stimson proved he was capable in the law and when Taft (The Order) was looking for a Secretary of War in 1911, he appointed Stimson (The Order) . which brin gs us to Point \"D.\" Then Stimson's career went like this:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"• As Secretary of War Stimson comple ted a reorganization begun by his predecessor none other than Elihu Root. • From 1917 to 1922 Stimson was in the Army, with ranks up to Brigadier General. • In 1927 Coolidge appointed Stimson Gover nor-General of the Philippine Islands. •In 1929 Herbert Hoover appointed Stimson Secretar y of State Poin t \"E\" on the chart). • In 1940 Franklin D.

Special Assistant Harvey Bundy was the key Pe ntagon man on the Manhattan Project and was Stimson's constant companion to conferences in North Africa, Italy and Germany.

Th is was publis hed in 1948, entitled On Active Service In Peace And War. The joint authorship (see illustration) gave McGeorge Bundy a quick start in his career, as we shall describe in the ne xt Memorandum when we pick up the career of the two younger Bundys, both members of The Order. In a nutshell: • Stimson was appointed to government offices by ever y President, except Harding, from 1911 to 1946, i.e., Taft, Wilson, Coolidge, Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman. • Stimson used his office to advance the career of fellow members of The Order, in particular Harvey Hollister Bundy and his son, McGeorge Bundy. Memorandum Number Nine: The Bundy Operation If The Order had a reasonably \"normal\" life style, there would be no nece ssity for, and no substance in, this book. Unfortunately for us they do not have a normal life style. The Order does not just go to college, look for a secu re post with an establishment law firm, intermarry with the sisters and daughters of :):her me mbers, get noisily drunk at the countr y club and go to church on Sunday. These may be reasonably \"n ormal\" patterns, but certainly not topics for research and analysis. A proportion of The Order follows a life style which can best be described as: AMBITIOUS ACTIVISM TOWARDS A NEW WORLD ORDER GOAL. Let's select one family - the Bundy family - fairly typica l of another 2O or so families in The Order, and take a closer look. The Bundy family came to the United States from England before 1635 an d settled first in Boston, then in Taunton, Massachusetts. The family is one of lawyers and politicians with four members in The Order.

The other three Bundys - Harvey Hollister and two of his three sons, William Putnam and McGeorge - we key activists and the activism has a Hegelian patt ern, i.e., creation :r conflict to bring about change. Let's take a look at each of the activist Bundys: Harvey Hollister Bundy Born Grand Rapids, Michigan 1888, died 1963. His gr andfather was a lawyer an d Congressman, and his father was a lawyer too. Harvey Hollister described himself as lawyer and government official. Bundy was initiated into The Order in 1909. Afte r a Harvard law degree and some world travel he became law clerk to Supreme Court Associat e Justice Wendell Holmes (1914-1915). By co incidence, Alger Hiss, later convicted of perjury in the celebrated Chambers-Hiss trials involv ing Soviet espionage, was also a law clerk to Justice Holmes (1929-1930). Harvey Hollister Bundy senior had five children, of whom three linked them selves to The Order. The eldest son, Harvey Hollister, graduated Yale 1938, but was not initiated into Skull & Bones. He's a banker who, like Fred, keeps away from activism. The next eldest is William Putnam Bundy, initiated in 1939. The next son is McGeorge Bundy, initiated in 1940. The eldest daughter, Harriet Lowell Bundy, marr ied Gasper d'Andelot Belin, a partner in Covington and Burling and initiated with William Bundy in 1939 . The youngest daughter, Katherine Lawrence Bundy, married Hugh Auchincloss, Jr. The two Bund y boys have been the real activists. William P. Bundy Here's William Bundy's career in brief: • 1947-1951 Law firm Covington & Burling in Washington.  D.  C.  • 1951-1961 Central Intelligence Agency • 1960 Staff Director of Presidential Commission on Na  tional  Goals  • 1961-3 Deputy Assistant Secr etary of Defense for Inter national Security Affairs • 1964-9 Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Vietnam War period. • 1969-71 Visiting Professor at Center for International  Studies,  MIT  • 1972 Editor of Foreign Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) quarterly and the most pres tigious foreign affairs journal in the U.S. A guide for all policy makers. Winston Lord (The Order) is Chairman of CFR. . Bundy is a member of the American Assemb ly and the Council on Foreign Relations. Clearly, Mr. Bundy has been appointed to some very influential positions in the last 30 years. As the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling is intimately linked to Govern ment regulatory affairs, it's reas onable to presume that Bundy probably had CIA dealings in the 1947-51 period and then moved to CIA to expand on these projects. The firm of Covington & Burling represents more than 100 top U.S. firms in Washingt on. Former partner s have included William Bundy's father-in-law, De an Acheson, and brother-in-law , Gasper Belin, (The Order)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" An interesting aspect of this law firm, where the Bundy family consists of the single most influential element in the past few decades, is its creation of \"left wing\" political activity. This creative activity brings to mind the McCarthy Senate hearings on subversion of the 1953 era when Senator Joseph McCarthy wanted to call William Bundy as a witness before the Committee and found the establishment strongly arrayed against this idea (Bundy had given $400 to the Alger Hiss Defense fund). In retr ospect it may have been more than McCarthy's harsh treatment of witnesses - which is on the record - that prompted establishment horro r. There may indeed have been some skeletons in the closet (and perhaps some bo nes) that the Senator could have unwittingly unearthed, and these skeletons had nothing to do with domestic communism. In any event, as Quigley pointed out in Tragedy an d Hope, the J.P. Morgan firm had financed the non- communist left in the United States =or political c ontrol. It seems that Covington & Burling may well be another conduit. Some preliminary evidence: • Covington & Burling partner John Douglas is the so n of Paul H. Douglas - who was one of the most prominent radicals of the 30s and 40s and an ou tspoken member of the non-communist left. John Douglas was a key coordinator in the 1972 George McGovern campaign: McGovern, of course, being on the left end of the political spectrum. • Another former partner is Senator Charles Mathias, w hose political stance is more or less at the left end of the Republican Party and along the lines of George Bush's (The Orde r) internationalist line • Yet another partner is Michael Bo udin. son of Leonard Boudin and brother of Kathy Boudin. This should raise some eyebrows as Kathy was on the FBI \"Most Wanted\" list. Leona rd Boudin is the long time communist front lawyer and member of the National Lawyers Guild (\"The foremost legal bulwark of the Co mmunist Party'') , New Masses (\"a communist periodical\") and a dozen other Communist fronts. Kathy was a founder of Students for a Democratic Society and a leader in its terrorist Weathermen faction. A bomb manufacturing enterprise got the group into trouble with the law and Kathy onto the FBI list. In brief, we have the elements of a hypothesis that left wing activity in the U.S., down to bomb making and outright terrorism, may link to Covington and Burling - an d the CIA. This is not a new assertion. Statements have been made before that the CIA has funded the left in the U.S. Th is claim hasn't received too much publicity for two reasons: (a) it offends the establishm ent media, which prefers to pose the CIA as a \"right\" organization and (b) it doesn't make much sense. It certainly doesn't make any sense unless you throw your mind back to Memorandum Number Six and the Hegelian dialectic process. In this pr ocess change requires conflict, and c onflict requires the clash of opposites. You can't just have a \"right,\" you must have a \"right \" and a \"left.\" You can't have just a pro-Vietnam War policy, you must also have an anti-Vietnam War policy. Else the dialectical process won't bring about change. An interesting thought. To move on, in 1960 Bundy, while still at CIA, became Staff Director for the newly formed Presidential Commission on National Goals. Such a commission, even in its title, assumes conscious direction. If you have goals, you logically need a device to ac hieve these goals. In a so ciety like the U.S. it should be a superfluous sort of commission unless there is some \"guiding hand,\" something more than the voting booth and the market place at work. The Report of this Commission came up with some quotes which are almost pure Hegelianism: (a) \"a role of government is to stimulate changes of attitude\" (b) \"in the 1960s every American is summoned to extraordinary persona l responsibility, sustained effort, and sacrifice\" (c) \"The American citizen in the years ahead ought to devote a larger portion of his time and energy directly to solution of the nation' s problems ... many ways are open fo r citizens to participate in the attainment of national goals.\" Now the basic set of rules governing our society is th e Constitution and the Bill of Rights. There is nothing in these constitutional documents to support any of these demands. What the demands imply is that an American citizen has a DUTY to advance the will of th e State. But such an assumption is definitely NOT implicit in the philosophy under which the United States was founded and pr esumably operates today."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In 1972, after a stint of governme nt service, Bundy took over Foreign Affairs, the most prestigious and influential foreign affairs journal in the U.S.: the bible for policy makers. So William Bundy is a very influent ial man. Enough that three aspect s of his career require further investigation: • The Hegelian tinge, that a citizen has a duty to the State, • The operation of the Hegelian dialectic and whether any \"left\" operations can be traced more directly to Covington and Burling, • Whether Bundy's service in Government shows promot ion of \"right\" operations, ne eded to balance off the \"left\" operations. McGeorge Bundy Preferential treatment has been accorded McGeorge Bundy all the way along the line. Graduating Yale and joining The Order in 1940, Bundy spent a while at Harvard and then joined the U.S. Army \"as a private'' Within 12 months Bundy had rocketed to captain and staff officer working on Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily) and Operation Overlord (the invasion of Normandy). If there is one job in this world that requires experience , it must be a staff planning officer for an amphibious operation. Only experience can make the calculations of timing and logistics for personnel and supplies come out right. And men's lives depend on this experience. Can a 23-year-old, with no military experience, undertake planning for amphibious operations? The answer is obviously no even if his father (The Order) is in the Pentagon as an aide to the Se cretary of War (The Order). The war in Europe finished, Bundy now a veteran of 27 years, went straig ht to the Pentagon as assistant to the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. We have already noted Bundy worked on the manuscript of On Active Service In Peace And War and was rewarded with co-authorship, a definite leg up in his career. Then, in quick succession, Bundy became consultant to the Economic Cooperation Administration, although he presumably knew no more abou t economics than amphibious landing, then foreign policy analyst for Presidential candidate Thomas Dewe y, then analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations. By 1949 Bundy was invited to Harvard University and in four years (1953) was made Dean of the Facu lty of Arts and Sciences. We are asked to believe that out of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of experienced academics with decades of hard-won credentials, an assistant professor - who has been, skipping around the non-academic world for ten years is the most talented for the post of Harvard Dean ! We might accept the lack of experience in amphibious warfare planning and economic programs planning, but Dean of a prestigious Harvard de partment in four years! No, that's too much. It smells of \"pull\" and few readers will disp ute that conclusion. From 1961 to 1966 Bundy was Special Assistant for Nati onal Security Affairs to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. There is a significant aspect of this sensitive post which only surfaced under He nry Kissinger. The post can be used to screen information reaching the Presid ent: in fact, that is one of its major purposes, to stop a flood of paper reaching the Presidential desk. The other side to this screening process is that it could place the President in an artificial information environment. If the options presented to the President ar e controlled, so are the decisions. Selected information can control the options. McGeorge Bundy was National Security Adviser in the early years of the Vietnam debacle. While McGeorge Bundy (The Order) was in the White House his brother, William P. Bundy (The Order) was in key positions relating to the Far East in Defense and State Departments. By acting jointly, the Bundy brothers could have controlled absolutely the flow of information relating to Vietnam from Intelligence, State and DOD. We are not saying this happened. We believe it to be a hypothesis worthy of examinati on. As they are blood brothers in a secret organization of which we know very little - and no thing voluntarily - we have reason to make this further examination. In 1966 McGeorge Bundy was appointed President of th e Ford Foundation, a post he retained until 1979. While at Ford, Bundy brought in as Vice Pres ident in charge of Education and Research Divi sion another member of The Order - Harold Howe 11, Howe's qualifications, apart from a Yale undergradu ate degree, can be describe d in Howe's own words: "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"\". . . in the old scheme of things I would not have qu alifications to be a professor - I have no PhD degree, no scholarly research publications to my credit. 1 once applied to the Yale Graduate School but was turned down as academically unpromising.\" (A pparently The Order doesn't reac h everywhere, even at Yale). Some of the half-baked ideas Howe and Bundy promot ed with Ford Foundation money probably stem from Howe's philosophy. In Howe's own words, \"When in doubt, do it.\" For exam ple, we have this gem from Howe: \"... we will have to re-think American values re garding cooperation and competition . . . many schools (particularly secondary schools) would de fine as \"cheating\" the kinds of cooperative activities whereby students help each other instead of competing for pl aces on the ladder of academic success.\" This is pure Hegelian collectivism. It undoubtedly works to the advantage of The Order: this moves the citizen to a dependency role and away from reliance on individual faculties. It is noteworthy that both Fords on the board resi gned in disgust with Ford Foundation policies. Memorandum Number Ten: Keeping The Lid On The Pot The Order's control of history, th rough foundations and the American Historical Association, has been effective. Not so much because of outright censorship, al though that is an important element, but more because of the gullibility of the Amer ican \"educated public:' From time to time their plans go awry. The bubbling pot of political manipulation - it's called conflict management on the inside - threatens to spill over into public view. It is extraordi nary how newspaper editors, columnists, TV and radio commentators, and publishers eith er lack insight to see bey ond the superficial or are scared witless to do so. Even worse, the educated pu blic, the 30-40 million degree holders, lets these opinion molders get away with it. Outright censorship has not been too effective. There has certainly been a campaign to suppress revisionist interpretations of history. Witness Harry Elmer Barnes in The Struggle Against The Historical Blackout: It may be said, with great restraint, that, never sinc e the Dark and Middle Ages, have there been so many powerful forces organized and aler ted against the assertion and accepta nce of historical truth as are active today to prevent the facts about the responsib ility for the second World War and its results from being made generally accessible to the American pu blic. Even the great Rockefeller Foundation frankly admits (Annual Report, 1946, p. 188) th e subsidizing of a corps of histor ians to anticipate and frustrate the development of any neo-Revisi onism in our time. And the only di fference between this Foundation and several others is that it has been more candid and forthright about its politics. This author's personal experience of attempted outright censorship was at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, when the Director attempted to suppress pu blication of my then forthcoming National Suicide: Military Aid To The Soviet Union. The facts weren' t in question. Unfortunate ly, the book offended the Nixon-Kissinger program to aid the Soviets while they were aiding the North Vietnamese - so in effect, Americans were being killed by our ow n technology. In this case neither author nor publisher was in a mood to listen, and the Establishment put ta il between legs and called it a day. More effective than outright censorship is use of th e left-right political spec trum to neutralize unwelcome facts and ideas or just condition ci tizens to think along certain lines. The \"left\" leaning segm ent of the press can always be relied upon to automatically assault ideas and information from the \"right\" and vice versa. In fact, media outlets have been arti ficially set up just for this purpose: both Nation and New Republic on the \"left\" were financed by Willard Straight, using Payne Whitney (The Order) funds. On the \"right\" National Review published by William Buckley (The Order) runs a perpetual deficit. presumably made up by Buckley. Neither the independent right nor the independent left s ees the trap. They are so busy firing at each other they've mostly forgotten to look behind the scenes. An d The Order smugly claims control of the \"moderate\" center. A neat game, and it's worked like a ch arm. But the establishment has a problem . . ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"In Fact, It Has Several Problems They are on the inside looking out. We are on the outs ide looking in. They may ca ll us \"peasants\" but we have the advantage of knowing about the real world and its infinite diversity. Their global objectives are dreams based on skewed information. Dangerous dreams, but still dreams. (1) The Order Lives In A Cultural Straightjacket All the power in the world is useless without accurate in formation. If you meet these people as this author has more or less casually over 30 years, one impression comes to the forefront - they are charming but with a limited perception of the world. They may have global ambitions, they may act politically like miniature power houses, but their k nowledge of the world comes from an in-group and those who play along with the in-group. And the in-group lacks moralit y and diversity. It's a kind of jet Set Politburo. Charming, power-hungry and myopic simultaneously. All it can offer to the outsider is an invitation, almo st an ultimatum, \"You are part of the establishment.\" Which has as much interest for many as a Frederick Bund y fish fillet. Perhaps one of the exceptions is house conservative William Buckley, Jr. - at least his cynicism is marked by witty incisiveness. The rest are a pretty sad bunch. (2) An Easy Prey For the Ambitious Limited perception makes members of The Order a target and an easy prey for the ambitious outsider . . . who needs only the ability to say the right things at the right time to the right people, coupled with a sense of unscrupulousness. Henry Kissinger is a prime example - an outsider who wants desperately to stay on the inside. More devious than clever, bu t expert at using deviousness for his own ends. Conservative readers may not agree, but Secretary of St ate Dean Acheson, who defended a guilty Alger Hiss to the bitter end, was probably more st upid than culpable. Which leads us to, (3) Genetic Problems Extensive intermarriage among the families raises a se rious question of genetic malfunctions. Membership lists are heavily laced with Dodge, Whitney, Phelps, Perkins, Norton, Putnam used as middle (maternal) names. Cultural inhibitions are obvious, the intellectua l limitations from genetic factors are more difficult to analyze and describe. (4) Shallow Power Base It may be as Rosenbaum comments, that The Order is \"incredibly powerful\". On the other hand, it is also incredibly weak - there is no philosoph ic or cultural depth to The Order. Diversity is strength and The Order lacks diversity. The vast bulk of the American people, that giant melting pot of Anglo, Germanic, Slavic, Hispanic, black, yellow, and who knows what else has been suckered. Many of them know it. Some are now going to know by whom. When they've overcome the disbelief, the shock and pe rhaps some fear, they are surely going to say \"What do we do?.\" The great strength of individualism, an atomistic social order where the individual holds ultimate sovereignty, is that any counter revolution to an impo sed social order where the State is boss, can take a million roads and a million forms. No one is going to create an anti-The Order moveme nt. That would be foolish and unnecessary. It could be infiltrated, bought off, or divert ed all too easily. Much too easily. Why play by the rules set by the enemy? The movement that will topple The Order will be extr emely simple and most effective. It will be ten thousand or a million Americans who come to the conclusion that they don't want the State to be boss, that they prefer to live under the protection of the Constitution. They will make their own independent decision to thwart The Order, and it will take ten thousand or a million forms. The only weakness is communication. The Order has so wrecked education that reading comprehension is difficult for many - that's part of the brainwashing pr ogram. But there are more than enough readers. Most people prefer to talk, anyway."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The program of The Order might work in Russia, which has a history of obedience to the State; it's barely working in Poland, while in England \"The Group\" surv ives because enough of class structure and attitude remain. It can never work in the United States. Conclusions In the first introductory volume we have laid out th e preliminary groundwork and suggested some hypotheses we need to examine. An understanding of The Order, the havoc it has wreaked on American society, its plans for future havoc - perpetual war for perpetual peace - is a logical step by step process. The next step is to look at education. Our present educational chaos can be traced to three members of The Order: Daniel Coit Gilman (First President of Univer sity of California and First President of Johns Hopkins University), Timothy Dwight (twelfth President of Yale University) and Andrew Dickson White (First President of Cornell University). Gilman imported the experimental ps ychology of Hegelian physiologist W ilhelm Wundt from Germany. This psychology was grafted onto the Americ an education system through the ed ucational laborator ies at Columbia and Chicago University. And they mo ved a familiar name, John Dewey, a pure Hegelian in philosophy, along the fast track in his career. This ha s been aptly termed \"The Leipzig Connection\" by Lance J. Klass and Paolo Lionni. Then we shall look at the Foundati ons, how these were captured by The Order and their gigantic funds used to finance a Hegelian educational syst em designed to condition future so ciety. It is doubtful if John D. Rockefeller or Mrs. Russell Sage, and certainly the Ford family, ever quite understood how their philanthropies were used for a long-term conditioning plan. It is also doubtful if The Order forecast the public backlash of the 1970s and 1980s - not all children have succumbed to the social conditioning brainwashing, pare nts have more than once risen in part revolt, private schools have sprouted like spring flowers in the desert and perhaps enough academics have slipped through a net designed to contain and neutraliz e independent research and thinking. After we have looked at education and foundations we still have to wo rk our way through the system of \"perpetual war for perpetual peace.\" How The Order ha s financed revolution and profited from war. The objective? To keep the conflict boilin g because conflict for Hegel is e ssential for change and the forward motion of society. Then we have to look at the financ ial system and the Federal Reserve. The Order was there right from the start. In conclusion we must emphasize one point. An understand ing of The Order and its modus operandi is impossible unless the reader holds in mind the Hegelian roots of the game plan. Hege lianism is alien to grass roots America. The national character is straightforward and to the point, not devious and tortuous. The grass roots are still closer to the American Re volution, the Jeffersonian Democrats, the classical liberal school of Cobden and Brig ht in England, and the Austrian School of Economics where Ludwig von Mi ses is the undisputed leader. These schools of thought have been su bmerged in the public eye by pirate -like onslaught of The Order and its many minions, but they still very mu ch represent the daily operation of American society. From billionaire Bunker Hunt in Dallas, Texas to th e seventeen year old black trying to \"survive\" in the Los Angeles ghetto, individual initiative is still more than obvious in American society. A Statist system is the objective of Th e Order. But in spite of constant prattling about \"change\" by zombie supporters - such a system is foreign to deeply held belie fs in this country. Above all the reader must - at least temporarily while reading this work - put to one side the descriptive clichés of left and right, liberal and conservative, comm unist and fascist, even republican and democrat These terms may be important for self recognition, they do pr ovide a certain reassurance, but they are confusing in our context u nless seen as essential elements in a game plan. You will never understand The Order if you try to label it right or left. A Robert Taft and a William Buckley on the right are just as important -- the forward motion of society, the fundamental change desired by The Order, as a Willia m Sloan Coffin and a Harry Payne Whitney (who financed the left). Their conflict is essential for change."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Which brings us to HYPOTHESIS NUMBER THREE: THE ORDER U SES THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC PROCESS TO BRING ABOUT SOCIETY IN WHICH THE STATE IS ABSOLUTE, i.e., ALL POWERFUL. This hypothesis, of course, reflects the gulf between The Order and American society. The gulf stems from the differing views of the relationship between the State and the individual. Which is superior? Our whole way of life is based on the a ssumption -at the individual is superior to the State. That the individual is the ---mate holder of sovereignty. That the State is the servant of the people. It's deeply engrained within us. The Order holds the opposite - that the State is superior, that the common man (the peasant) can find freedom only by obedience to the State. Now, of course, the State is a fiction. So who or what controls the State? Obviously, The Order."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Memorandum Number One: It All Began At Yale The first volume of this series introduced The Order, presented three preliminary hypotheses with examples of the evidence to come. We also asserted that any group that wanted to co ntrol the future of American society had first to control education, i.e., the population of the future. This volume will outline the way in which education has been controlled by The Order. It all began at Yale. Even the official Yale history is aware of Yale's power and success: \"The power of the place remain(s) unmistakable. Yale was organized. Yale inspired a loyalty in its sons that was conspicuous and impressive. Yale men in after life made such records that the suspicion was that even there they were working for each other. In short, Yale was exasperatingly and mysteriously successful. To rival institutions and to academic refo rmers there was something irritating and disquieting about old Yale College.\" 1 \"Yale was exasperatingly and mysteriously successful,\" says the official history. And this success was more than obvious to Yale 's chief competitor, Harvard University. So obvious, in fact, that in 1892 a young Harvard instructor, George Santanyana, went to Yale to investigate this \"disturbing legend\" of Yale power. Santanyana quoted a Harvard alumnus who intended to send his son to Yale - because in real life \"all th e Harvard men are working for Yale men.\" 2 But no one has previously asked an obvious question - Why? What is this \"Yale power\"? A Revolutionary Yale Trio In the 1850s, three members of The Order left Yale and working together, at times with other members along the way, made a revolution that chan ged the face, direction an d purpose of American education. It was a rapid, quiet revolution, and emin ently successful. The American people even today, in 1983, are not aware of a coup d'etat. The revolutionary trio were:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"• Timothy Dwight ('49) Professor in the Yale Divinity School and then 12th President of Yale University. • Daniel Coit Gilman ('52), first President of the Un iversity of California, first President of the Johns Hopkins University and first Presid ent of the Carnegie Institution. • Andrew Dickson White ('53), first President of Corn ell University and first Pr esident of the American Historical Association. This notable trio were all init iated into The Order w ithin a few years of each other (1849, 1852, 1853). They immediately set off for Europe. AD three went to study philosophy at the University of Berlin, where post-Hegelian philosophy had a monopoly. • Dwight studied at the Universities of Berlin and Bonn between 1856 and 1858, • Gilman was at the University of Berlin between 1854 and 55 under Karl von Ritter and Friedrich Trendelenberg, both prominent \"Right\" Hegelians, and • White studied at the University of Berlin between 1856 and 1858. Notably also at the University of Berlin in 1856 (at the Institute of Physiology) was none other than Wilhelm Wundt, the founder of experimental psychology in Germany and the later source of the dozens of American PhDs who ca me back from Leipzig, Germany to start the modern American education movement. Why is the German experience so important? B ecause these were the formative years, the immediate post graduate years for these three men, the years when they were planning the future, and at this period Germany was dominated by the Hegelian philosophical ferment. There were two groups of these Hegelians. The ri ght Hegelians, were the roots of Prussian militarism and the spring for the unification of Germany and the rise of Hitler. Key names among right Hegelians were Karl Ritter (at the University of Berlin where our trio studied), Baron von Bismarck, and Baron von Stockmar, confidential adviser to Qu een Victoria over in England. Somewhat before this, Karl Theodor Dalberg 1744-1817), arch-chancellor in the German Reich, related to Lord Acton in England and an Illuminati (Baco v Verulam in the Illuminati code), was a right Hegelian. There were also Left Hegelians, the promoters of scientific socialism. Most famous of these, of course, are Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, H e inrich Heine, Max Stirner and Moses Hess. The point to hold in mind is that both groups use Hegelian theory of :he State as a start point, i.e., the State is superior to the individual. Prussian militarism, Nazism and Marxism have the same philosophic roots. And it left its mark on our trio. 1 George Wilson Pierson, YALE COLLEGE 1871-1922 (Yale University Press.

The Gilman family came to the United States from Norfolk, En gland in 1638. On his mother's side, the Coit family came from Wales to Salem, Massachusetts before 1638. 1 Fabian Franklin, THE LIFE OF DANIEL COIT GILMAN (Dodd, Mead. New York, 1910), pp. 28-9. Gilman was born in Norwich, Connecticut July 8, 1831, from a family laced with members of The Order and links to Yale College (as it was known at that time). Uncle Henry Coit Kingsley (The Order '34) was Treasurer of Yale from 1862 to 1886. James I. Kingsley was Gilman's uncle and a Professor at Ya le. William M. Kingsley, a cousin, was editor of the influential journal New Englander. On the Coit side of the family, Joshua Coit was a member of The Order in 1853 as well as William Coit in 1887. Gilman's brother-in-law, the Reverend Joseph Parrish Thompson ('38) was in The Order. Gilman returned from Europe in late 1855 and spent the next 14 years in New Haven, Connecticut - almost entirely in and around Yale, consolidating the power of The Order. His first task in 1856 was to in corporate Skull & Bones as a legal entity under the name of The Russell Trust. Gilman became Treasurer and William H. Russell, th e cofounder, was President. It is notable that there is no mention of The Order, Sk ull & Bones, The Russell Trust, or any secret society activity in Gilman's biography, nor in open records. The Order, so far as its members are concerned, is designed to be secret, and apart fr om one or two inconsequential slips, meaningless unless one has the whole picture. The Order has been remarkably adept at keeping its secret. In other words, The Order fulfills our first requir ement for a conspiracy - i.e., IT IS SECRET. The information on The Order that we are using surfaced by accident. In a way similar to the surfacing of the Illuminati papers in 1783, when a messenger carrying Illu minati papers was killed and the Bavarian police found the do cuments. All that exists publicly for The Order is the charter of the Russell Trust, and that tells you nothing. On the public record then, Gilman became assistant Librarian at Yale in the fall of 1856 and \"in October he was chosen to fill a vacancy on the New Haven Board of Education.\" In 1858 he was appointed Librarian at Yale. Then he moved to bigger tasks. The Sheffield Scientific School The Sheffield Scientific School, the science depa rtments at Yale, exemplifies the way in which The Order came to control Yale and then the United States. In the early 1850s, Yale science was insignificant, just two or three very small departments. In 1861 these were concentrated into the Sheffield Scient ific School with private funds from Joseph E. Sheffield. Gilman went to work to raise more funds for expansion. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Gilman's brother had married the daughter of Chem istry Professor Benjamin Silliman (The Order, 1837). This brought Gilman into contact with Professo r Dana, also a member of the Silliman family, and this group decided that Gilman should write a repor t on reorganization of Sheffield. This was done and entitled \"Proposed Pl an for the Complete Reorganization of the School of Science Connected with Yale College.\" While this plan was worked out, friends and me mbers of The Order made moves in Washington, D.C., and the Connecticut State Legislature to get st ate funding for the Sheffield Scientific School. The Morrill Land Bill was introduced into Congress in 1857, passed in 1859, bu t vetoed by President Buchanan. It was later signed by President Lincoln. This bill, now known as the Land Grant College Act, donated public lands for State colleges of agriculture and sciences .... and of course Gilman's report on just such a college was ready. The legal procedure wa s for the Federal government to issue land scrip in proportion to a state's representation, but state legislatur es first had to pass legislation accepting the scrip. Not only was Daniel Gilman first on the scene -o get Fe deral land scrip, he was first among all the states and grabbed all of Connecticut's share for Sheffield Sc ientific School! Gilman had, of course, tailored his report to fit the amount forthcoming for Connecticut. No other institution in Connecticut received even a whisper until 1893, when Storrs Agricu ltural College received a land grant. Of course it helped that a member of The Orde r, Augustus Brandegee ('49), was speaker of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1861 when the state bill was moving through, accepting Connecticut's share for Sheffield. Other members of The Order, lik e Stephen W. Kellogg ('46) and William Russell ('33), were either in the State Legislature or had influence from past service. The Order repeated the same grab for public funds in New York State. All of New York's share of the Land Grant College Act went to Cornell University. Andrew Dickson White, a member of our trio, was th e key activist in New York and late r became first President of Cornell. Daniel Gilman was rewarded by Yale and became Professor of Physical Geography at Sheffield in 1863. In brief, The Order was able to co rner the total state shares for Con n ecticut and New York, cutting out other scholastic institutions. This is the first exam ple of scores we shall present in this series - how The Order uses public funds for its own objectives. And this, of course, is the great advantage of Hegel fo r an elite. The State is absolute. But the State is also a fiction. So if The Order can manipulate the Stat e, it in effect becomes the absolute. A neat game. And like the Hegelian dialectic process we cited in the first volume, the Order has worked it like a charm. Back to Sheffield Scientific School. The Order now had funds for Sheffield and proceeded to consolidate its control. In February 1871 the School was incorporated and the following became trustees: Charles J. Sheffield Prof. G.J. Brush (Gilman's close friend) Daniel Coit Gilman (The Order, '52) W.T. Trowbridge John S. Beach (The Order, '39) William W. Phelps (The Order, '60) Out of six trustees, three were in The Order. In addition, George St. John Sheffield, son of the benefactor, was initiated in 1863, and the first Dean of Sheffield was J.A. Porter, also the first member of Scroll & Key (t he supposedly competitive senior society at Yale). How The Order Came To Control Yale University From Sheffield Scientific School The Order broadened its horizons. The Order's control over all Yale was evident by the 1870s, even under the administration of Noah Porter (1871-1881), who was not a member. In the decades after the 1870s, The Order tightened its grip. The Iconoclast (October 13, 1873) summarizes the facts we have presented on control of Yale by The Order, without being fully aware of the details: \"They have obtained control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be subject to their will. No doubt they are worthy men in themselves, but the many whom they looked down upon while in college, cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands. Men in Wall Street complain that the college"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"comes straight to them for help, instead of aski ng each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale's and America's first men: `Few will give but Bones men, and they care far more for their society th an they do for the college.' The Woolsey Fund has but a struggling existence, for kindred reasons.\" \"Here, then, appears the true reason for Yale's poverty. She is controlled by a few men who shut themselves off from others, and assume to be their superiors . . . \" The anonymous writer of Iconoclast blames The Order for the poverty of Yale. But worse was to come. Then-President Noah Porter was the last of the clerical Presidents of Yale (1871-1881), and the last without either membership or family connections to The Order. After 1871 the Yale Presidency became almost a fiefdom for The Order. From 1886 to 1899, member Timothy Dwight ('49) was President, followed by another member of The Order, Arthur Twining Hadley (1899 to 1921) . Then came James R. Angell (1921-37), not a member of The Order, who came to Yale from th e University of Chicago where he worked with Dewey, built the School of Education, and was past President of the American Psychological Association. From 1937 to 1950 Charles Seymour, a member of The Order was President followed by Alfred Whitney Griswold from 1950 to 1963. Griswold was not a member, but both the Griswold and Whitney families have members in The Order. Fo r example, Dwight Torrey Griswold ('08) and William Edward Schenk Griswold ('99) were in Th e Order. In 1963 Kingman Brewster took over as President. The Brewster family has had several members in The Order, in law and the ministry rather than education. We can best conclude this memorandum with a quotation from the anonymous Yale observer: \"Whatever want the college suffer s, whatever is lacking in her educational course, whatever disgrace lies in her poor buildings, whatever embarras sments have beset her needy students, so far as money could have availed, the weight of blame lies upon this ill-starred society. The pecuniary question is one of the future as well as of the present and past. Year by year the deadly evil is growing. The society was never as obnoxious to the coll ege as it is today, and it is just this ill-feeling that shuts the pockets of nonmembers. Never before has it shown such arrogance and self-fancied superiority. It grasps the College Press and endeavors to rule in all. It does not deign to show its credentials, but clutches at power with the silence of conscious guilt.\" APPENDIX TO MEMORA NDUM NUMBER ONE: THE ORDER IN TH E YALE FACULTY Date Member Initiate Position at Yale BEEBE, William 1873 Professor of Mathematics (1882-1917) BEERS, Henry A. 1869 Professor of English Literature (1874-1926) BELLINGER, Alfred R. 1917 Professor of Greek (1926 DAHL, George 1908 Professor Yale Divinity School (1914-1929) DARLING, Arthur B. 1916 Professor of History (1925-1933) DAY, Clive 1892 Professor of Economic History (1902-1938) DEXTER, Franklin B. 1861 Secretary, Yale University (1869-99) DWIGHT, Timothy 1849 President of Yale University (1886-98) FARNAM, Henry 1874 Professor of Economics (1880-1933) FARNAM, William 1866 Trustee Sheffi eld Scientific School (1894-1923) FRENCH, Robert D. 1910 Professor of English (1919-1950 GILMAN, Daniel C. 1852 See text.

For the educational system this may not be too distressing. As we shall see later, their prime purpose is no t to teach subject matter but to condition children to live as socially integrated citizen units in an organic society - a real life enactment of the Hegelian absolute State. In this State the individual finds freed om only in obedience to the State, consequently the function of education is to prepare the individu al citizen unit for smooth entry into the organic whole. However, it is puzzling that the educational system allowed reading to deteriorate so markedly. It could be that The Order wants th e citizen components of the organi c State to be little more than automated order takers; after all a citizen who cannot read and write is not going to challenge The Order. But this is surmise. It is not, on the ba sis of the evidence presently at hand, a provable proposition. In any event, the system adopted the look-say meth od of learning to read, originally developed for deaf mutes. The system has produ ced generations of Americans who are functionally illiterate. Yet, reading is essential for learning an d learning is essential for most occupations. And certainly those who can read or write lack vocabulary in depth and st ylistic skills. There are, of course, exceptions. This author spent five years teaching at a State Universi ty in the early 1960s and wa s appalled by the general inability to write coherent English, yet gratified that some students had not only evaded the system, acquired vocabulary and writing skills, but these exceptions had the most skepticism about The Establishment. The Order comes into adoption of the look-say method directly and indirectly. Let's start at the beginning. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Founder Of Deaf Mute Instruction Look-say reading methods were de veloped around 1810 for deaf mutes by a truly remarkable man, Thom as Hopkins Gallaudet. Thomas H. Gallaudet was the eldest son of Peter Wallace Gallaudet, descended from a French Huguenot family, and Jane Hopkins. Jane Hopkins traced her ancestry back to John Hopkins an d the Reverend Thomas Hooker in the seventeenth century, who brok e away from the Congregational Church to help found Hartford, Connecticut. This parallels the story of the Lord family (see Volume One). The Lords also traced their ancestry back to Hopkins and Hooker and the Lords founded Hartford, Connecticut. And it was in Hart ford, Connecticut in 1835 that a printer named Lord produced Thomas Gallaudet's first look-say primer, Mother's Primer. Gallaudet's original intention was to use the look-say method only for deaf mutes who have no concept of a spoken language and are therefore unaware of phonetic sounds for letters. For this purpose, Gallaudet founded the Hartford School for the Deaf in 1817. The Gallaudet system works well for deaf mutes, but there is no obvious reason to use it for those who have the ability to hear sounds. Anyway, in 1835 Mother's Primer was published an d the Massachusetts Primary School Committee under Horace Mann immediately adopted the book on an experi mental basis. Later we shall find that Horace Mann ties directly to The Order - in fact, the cofounder of The Order. On pages 73-74 we reproduce two pages from the second edition of 1836, with the following directions to the teacher: . . . pointing to the whole word Frank, but not to the letters. Nothing is yet to be said about letters...” "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Why did Horace Mann push a method designed for deaf mutes onto a school system populated with persons who were not deaf mutes? There are two possi ble reasons. The reader can take his or her pick. First, in 1853 Mann was appointed President of Antioc h College. The most influential Trustee of Antioch College was the co-founder of The Order - Alphonso Taft. Second, Mann never had a proper education and cons equently was unable to judge a good method from a bad method for reading. Here's a description of Mann's school days: \"The opportunities for the lad's schooling were extr emely meager. The locality enjoyed the reputation of being the smallest school district, with the poorest school house and the cheapest teacher in the State.\" Mann's teacher was Samuel Barratt and we quote: \"In ar ithmetic he was an idiot. He could not recite the multiplication table and could not tell the time of day by the clock ... Six months of the year he was an earnest and reliable teacher, tasting nothing stronger than tea, then for another six months he gave himself up to a state of beastly drunkenness . . .\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"By 1840 there was a backlash, and the look-say system was dropped in Massachusetts. The Second Attempt Towards the end of the 19th century The Order came on th e scene - and the look-say method was revived. The youngest son of Thomas Hopkins and Sophia Gallaudet wa s Edward Miner Gallaudet. Two of -is sons went to Yale and became members of The Order: • Edson Fessenden Gallaudet ('93), who became an instructor of physics at Yale, and • Herbert Draper Gallaudet ('98), who attended Uni on Theological Seminary an d became a clergyman. Then the method was adopted by Columbia Teachers' College and :he Lincoln School. The thrust of the new Dewey-inspired system of education was away fr om learning and towards preparing a child to be a unit in the organic society. Look-say was ideal for Dew eyites. It skipped one step in the learning process. It looked \"easy,\" and de-emphasized reading skills. The educational establishment rationalized look-say be cl aiming that up to the turn of the century reading was taught by \"synthetic\" methods, i.e., children were taught letters and an associated sound value. Then they learned to join syllables to make words. This wa s held to be uninteresting and artificial. Educational research, it was claimed, demonstrated that in read ing words are not analyzed into component letter parts but seen as complete units. Therefore, learning to read should start with complete units. Education Of course, there is a gigantic non-sequitur in this re asoning process. Certainly a skilled reader does see words as complete units. And a really skilled reader do es see lines and paragraphs at a glance. But the ac- curacy of perceiving the whole is based on the degree of understanding and knowledge of the component parts. The educational establishment argues today in the 19 80s that, based on further experimental testing, it is easier for a child to read the line \"the rocket zoomed into space\" than \"the cat sat on the mat.\" The first line has \"contrasting visual structure\" and the second quote has a \"similar visual pattern.\" What they have done now is to make a mountain out of a molehill, convert the relatively simple task of learning to read into an unnecessarily complex system. Why? That we shall see as the story progresses. How children are taught to read - and why they can't. Memorandum Number Three: The Illuminati Connection "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" We need to trace three historical lines in modern education: the first we l ooked at in Memorandum Number Two, the development of the look-say me thod of reading, its abandonment and its later adoption around the turn of the century. Another line is the import of the experimental psyc hology of Wilhelm Wundt into the United States by The Order. This we shall examine in Memorandum Number Four. For the moment we want to briefly trace the in fluence of Johann Friedrich Herbart, a major German philosopher of the early 19th centur y. There was at one time in the United States a National Herbart Society for the Scientific Study of Educat ion to adapt Herbartian principles to American education. Later, this became ju st National Society for the Study of Education. You don't hear too much about Johann Herbart today, but his influenc e survives in the so-called \"enriched\" school curricula and in current educational methodology. Our purpose in this memorandum is twofold: to show the Hegelian aspects of Herbartian theory and to trace the Illuminati connect ion. There is no direct connecti on to The Order. However, in a subsequent book, we will trace The Order to th e Illuminati and this section will then f a ll into a logical place. Herbart was an educational theorist as well as ph ilosopher and psychologist, and strongly influenced Wilhelm Wundt. For Herbart, education had to be pr esented in a scientifically correct manner, and the chief purpose of education for Herbart is to prepar e the child to live properly in the social order of which he is an integral part. Following Hegel, th e individual is not important. The mere development of individual talent, of individual fitness, mental power and knowledge is not .he purpose of education. The purpose is to develop personal character and social morality, and the most important task of the educator is to analyze the activities and duties of men within society. The function of instruction is to fulfill these aims and impart to the individual socially desirable ideas. Morality for Herbart, therefore, is what is good for society, following Hegelian theory. Herbartians favor grouping of subjects around a co re topic, i.e., the grouping of history, social science and English literature. This enables the teacher to more easily draw out those not ions useful to the objective. All of these ideas we can recognize in today's ed ucational philosophy came into American education through the Herbartian groups. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" The Illuminati Connection Johann Herbart studied at the University of Jena, and came under the influence of Johann Herder, Friedrich Schiller, Johann Fichte and Joha nn Goethe. Later, in Switzerland, Herbart came into contact with Johann Pestalozzi. What is interesting about these names, and they comprise the most important influence on Herbart, is that they are either known members of the Illuminati or reputed to be close to the Illuminati Order. Let's take each name in turn: • Johann Gottried Herder (1744-1803) was \"Damascus pontifex\" in the Illuminato. • Johann Fichte, we have already noted in the previous volume, was close to the Illuminati and pushed by Goethe (\"Abaris\") for the post at the University of Jena, where Johann Herbart was studying. • Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805) was known in the circle but not reliably recorded as an Illuminati member. • Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749-1832) was \"Abaris\" in the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"We have an even more precise connection for another prominent Illuminati, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827), a Swiss teacher of some re nown living at Interlaken, and known as \"Alfred\" in the Illuminati code. Before Herbart completed his doctorate, just after the turn of the 19th century, he spent three years at Interlaken in Switzerland. Out of his contact with Pestalozzi came a book on Pestalozzi's educational theories, much of which rubbed off on to Herbart. The book is PestaIozzi's Idee Eines ABC Der Anschaung Untersucht Und Wissenschaftlich Asugefuhrt (Pestalozzi's idea of an ABC of sense impression). This book has been translated and we reproduce a copy of .he title page of the 1896 New York edition. This is not insignificant. It is a commentary by a prominent influence on today's education upon an Illuminati book. Why Is The Illuminati Connection Significant? The Illuminati was founde d May 1, 1776 by Professor Adam W eishaupt of the University of Ingolsta dt. It was a secret society, but in 1785 and 1787 several batches of internal documents came to the Bavarian Government. Subsequent in vestigation determined that the aim of the Illuminati was world domination, using any methods to ad- vance the objective, i.e., the end always justifies the means. It was anti - Christian, although clergymen were found in the organization. Each member had a pseudonym to disguise his identity. During its time, the Illuminati had widespread an d influential membership. After suppression by the Bavarian Government in 1788 it was quiet fo r some years and then reportedly revived. The significance for this study is that the met hods and objectives parallel those of The Order. In fact, infiltration of the Illumina ti into New England is known and will be the topic of a forthcoming volume. So far as education is c oncerned, the Illuminati objective was as follows: \"We must win the common people in every corner. This w ill be obtained chiefly by means of the schools, and by open, hearty be haviour, show, condescension, pop ularity and toleration of their prejudices which we shall at leisure root out and dispel.\" As Rosenbaum has pointed out in his Esquire article, the Illuminati ceremony has similarities to The Order. For example, John Robison in Proofs Of A Conspiracy: l \"The candidate is presented for reception in the character of a slave; and it is de manded of him what has brought him to this most miserable of all conditions. He answers - Society - the State - Submissiveness - False Religion. A skeleton is pointed out to him, at the feet of whic h are laid a Crown and a Sword. He is asked whether that is the skeleton of a Ki ng, a Nobleman or a Beggar? As he cannot decide, the President of the meeting says to him, \"the character of being a man is the only one that is of importance.\" Finally, in conclu sion, we can trace the fo undation of three secret societies, in fact the most influe ntial three secret societies that we know about, to Universities. The Illuminati was founded at University of Ingols tadt. The Group was founded at All Souls College, Oxford University in England, an d The Order was founded at Yale University in the United States. The paradox is that institutions supposedly devoted to the search for truth and freedom have given birth to institutions devoted to world enslavement. 1 John Robinson, PROOFS OF A CONSPIRACY (Americanist Classics, Belmont, 1967), p. 110. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Four: The Leipzig Connection* The link between German experimental psychol ogy and the American educational system is through American psychologist G. Stanley Hall, in his time probably the foremost educational critic in the U. S. The Hall family is Scotch and English and goes back to the 1630s, but Hall was not a Yale graduate, and at first sight there is no connection between Hall and The Order. On the other hand, Hall is a good example of someone whose life has major turning points and on probing the turning points, we find The Order with its guiding hand. The detail below is important to link Hall with The Order. It is an open question how much Hall knew, if he knew anything at all, about Th e Order and its objectives. After graduation from Williams Co llege, Hall spent a year at the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Our \"Addresses\" books for The Order do no t give church affiliations for members citing the ministry as their occupation. We do know th at Rev. Henry Sloane Coffin ('97) was Associate Professor of Practical Theology at Union from 1904-1926 and President of Union Seminary from 1926 to 1945, but we cannot trace any members at Union before 1904. Fortunately, Hall was an egocentric and wrote two long, tedious autobiographies: Recreations Of A Psychologist and Life And Confessions Of A Psychologist. This is how Hall described his entry to Union in t he latter book (pp. 177-8): \"Recovering from a severe attack of typhoid fever the summer after graduation and still being very uncertain as to what I would be and do in the world, I entered Union Theological Seminary in September 1867.\" Later Hall adds, \"The man to whom t owe far more in this grou p than any other was Henry B. Smith, a foreign trained scholar, versed more or less not only in systematic theology, which was his chair, but in ancient and modern philosophy, on which he gave us a few lectures outside the course. Of him alone I saw something socially. He did me perhap s the greatest intellect ual service one man can render another by suggesting just the right reading at the right time. It was he, too, who seeing my bent advised me to go to Europe.\" 'The Leipzig Connection is the title of an excellent little booklet by Lance J. Klass and Paoli Lionni, published by The Delphian Press. Route 2, Box 195, Sheridan, Oregon 97378 ($4 00 postpaid), The book came out in 1967 and was the first to trace the Wundt link It has more detail on Wundt than this memorandum, but, of course, is not concerned with The Order. The Rev. Henry Boynton Smith cited by Hall was Professor of Church History at Union Seminary from 1850 to 1874, and in the \"liberal\" wing of the Presbyterian Church, he edited Theological Review from 1859-1874 and translated several Germ an theological works. Smith was not a member of The Order. How did Hall, who says he was broke, get from New York to Europe, specifically to Germany? Here's the interesting twist. Someone he didn't know (but whom today we can trace to The Order) gave him $1,000 - a lot of money in those days. Here's how it happ ened. While preaching in Pennsylvania in 1868, Hall received a letter from Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, whose church he attended in New York: \". . . asking me to call on him. I immediately took the train and Beecher told me that through the Manns (friends) he had learned that I wish ed to study philosophy in Germany but lacked the means . . . (he) gave me a sealed note to the lumber magnate Henry Sage, the benefactor of Cornell, which I presented at his office wi thout knowing its contents. To my amazement, after some scowling and a remark to the effect that his pastor took amazing liberties with his purse, he gave me a check for one thousand dollars. Taking my note to repay it with interest, he told me to sail for Germany the next day\" (Confessions, p. 182)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Who was \"lumber magnate Henry Sage, the benefactor of Cornell\"? The Sage family had several \"Henrys\" involved with Yale and Cornell Universi ties in those days. The \"Henry Sage\" cited is probably William Henry Sage (1844-1924) who graduated Yale 1865 and then joined the family lumber company, H.W. Sage & Company in New Yo rk. Henry Sage was a member of Scroll & Key - the sister Senior Society to Skull & Bones at Ya le. Furthermore, two of Henry Sage's nephews were in The Order, but well after 1868: • Dean Sage ('97) • Henry Manning Sage ('90) Both Sages entered the family lumber business, by then renamed Sage Land & Lumber. In brief: the funds to get Hall to Germany on his first trip came from a member of Scroll & Key, i.e., Henry Sage, while Sage's two nephews joined The Order later in the century. In Germany, Hall studied philosophy at the Univ ersity of Berlin for two years under Hegelians Trendelenberg (Gilman of The Order also studied under Trendelenberg) and Lepsius. There were few American students in Berlin at this time. So few that the American Minister George Bancroft could entertain them at the U.S. Embassy to meet German Chancellor von Bismarck. Hall At Antioch College Hall returned to the U.S. from Germany in 1871 and by design or accident found himself under the wing of The Order. Again, the detail is important. There are two versions of Hall's life immediately after returning from his first trip to Germany. According to Hall's Confessions, he became tutor for the Seligman banking family in New York and was then contacted by James K. Hosmer, Professor at Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio. Hosmer asked, and this is very unusual, if Hall would like his professorial post at Antioch. Said Hall , \"I gladly accepted.\" There is another version in National Cyclopaedia Of American Biography which states, \"In 1872 he (Hall) accepted a professorship at Antioch Colle ge, Ohio, that formerly was held by Horace Mann.\" In any event Hall went to Antioch , a \"liberal\" Unitarian college with a more than \"liberal\" view of education. And at Antioch College, G. Stan ley Hall was at the core of The Order. Horace Mann, whom we met in Memorandum Two as the promoter of \"look-say\" reading, was the first President of Antioch (1853-1860). The most prominent trustee of Antioch College was none other than the co-founder of The Order, Al phonso Taft. According to Hall, \"(I) occasionally spent a Sunday with the Tafts. Ex-President Taft was then a boy and his father, Judge Alonzo (sic) Taft was a trustee of Antioch College\" Confessions, p. 201). Furthermore, Cincinnati, Ohio, at that time was the center for a Young Hegelian movement including famous left Hegelian August Wil l ich, and these were well known to Judge Alphonso Taft. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" In brief, while at Antioch College in Yellow Spri ngs, Ohio, Hall came under the influence of four groups: (a) the legend of Horace Mann, a hero of the modern education movement. (b) the Unitarian Church, which will enter our later reports, (c) a Hegelian discussion group comprised of left Hegelians, and (d) the co-founder of The Order, Alphonso Taft. And Hall knew William Howard Taft, also a member of The Order ('78) and future President and Chief Justice of the United States. Hall stayed four years at Antioch, then took of f again for Europe, while Alphonso Taft went to Washington, D.C. as Secretary of War, then as Attorney General in the Grant Administration. Hall"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"paused a while in England and then went on to Germany, to Leipzig and Wilhelm Wundt. He became the first of a dozen Americans to receive a Ph.D. in psychology (a new field) under Wundt. The Hegelian Influence On Hall So between 1870 and 1882, a span of twelve year s, Hall spent six years in Germany. As Hall himself comments, \"I do not know of any other American student of these subjects (i.e., philosophy and psychology) who came into even the slight pers onal contact it was my fortune to enjoy with Hartmann and Fechner, nor of any psychologi st who had the experience of attempting experimental work with Helmholtz and I think I was the first American pupil of Wundt. The twelve years included in this span, more than any other equal period, marked and gave direc- tion to modern psychology . . .\"1 Who were these four German philosoph ers who so influen ced Stanley Hall? Eduard von Hartmann (1842-1906), a prominent philosopher. Hartmann's views on individual rights are entirely contrary to our own, i.e., \"The principle of freedom is negative . . . in every department of life, save religi on alone, compulsion is necessary ... What all men need is rational tyranny, if it only holds them to a steady developm ent, according to the laws of their own nature.\" There isn't too much difference between Hegel and Hartmann on the idea of social progress. Individual freedom is not accept able to these philosophers, man must be guided by \"rational tyranny.\" Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887). Fechner dislik ed Hegel, who Fechner said, \"unlearned men to think.\" However, Fechner was mainly intere sted in psycho-physics, i.e., parapsychology : 1 G. Stanley Hall. FOUNDERS OF MODERN PSYCHO LOGY. Appleton & Co., London, 1912, pp. v-vi. \". . . he was particularly attracted to the unexplored regions of the soul and so he became interested in somnambulism, attended sean ces when table tapping came into vogue.\" Herman L. F. von Helmholtz (1821-1894) was undo ubtedly Germany's greatest scientist in the 19th century and was rooted in Kant, the predecessor of Hegel. For Helmholtz: \"The sensible world is a product of the interaction between the human organism and an unknown reality. The world of experience is de termined by this interaction but the organism itself is only an object of experience and is to be understood by psychology and physiology.\" Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), Professor of Philosophy at University of Leipzig, was undoubtedly the major influence on G. Stanley Hall. Modern education practice stems from Hegelian social theory combined with the experimental psychology of Wilhelm Wundt. Whereas Karl Marx and von Bismarck applied Hegelian theory to the political fi eld, it was Wilhelm Wundt, influenced by Johann Herbart, who applied Hegel to education, which in turn, was picked up by Hall and John Dewey and modern educational theorists in the United States. Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt was born August 16 , 1832 at Neckarau, a suburb of Mannheim, Germany. His father Maximilian (1787-1846) was a minister. Wundt's grandf ather on the paternal side is of significant interest: Kirchenrat Karl Kasimir Wundt (1744-84) was Professor at Heidelberg University in the history and geography of Baden and pastor of the church at Wieblingen, a small neighborhood town. The Illuminati-Order documents show that \"Raphael\" in the IIluminati is identified as this same Professor Karl Kasimir Wundt and is referred to in the Illuminati Pr ovincial Report from Utica (i.e., Heidelberg) dated September 1782. 1 The magnum opus of Wilhelm Wundt, i.e., Volkerpsychologie, is also today a recommended book in Internationales Freimaurer Lexikon (page 50)."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Historical links aside, Wundt is important in th e history of American education for the following reasons: (1) He established in 1875 the world's first laboratory in experimental psychology to measure individual responses to stimuli. 'Richard van Dulman, Der Geheimbund Der Illuminaten (Stuttgart, 1977, p. 269). (2) Wundt believed that man is only the summation of hi s experience, i.e., the stimuli that bear upon him. It follows from this that, for Wundt, man has no self will, no self determin ation. Man is in effect only the captive of his experien ces, a pawn needing guidance. (3) Students from Europe and the United States came to Leipzig to le arn from Wundt the new science of experimental psychology. These students returned to their homelands to found schools of education or departments of psyc hology, and trained hundreds of Ph.D.s in the new field of psychology. The core of our problem is that Wundt's work was based on Hegelian philosophical theory and reflected the Hegelian view of the individual as a va lueless cog in the State, a view expanded by Wundt to include man as nothing more than an anim al influenced solely by daily experiences. This Wundtian view of the world was brought back from Leipzig to the United States by G. Stanley Hall and other Americans and went through wh at is known among psychologists as \"The Americanization of Wundt.\" Although Hall was primarily psychol ogist and teacher, his political vi ews were partially Marxist, as Hall himself writes: \". . . (I) had wrestled with Karl Marx and half accepted what I understood of him\" (Confessions, p. 222). In the next Memorandum, Number Five, we will link Hall with Gilman and trace their joint influence on American education. Memorandum Number Five: The Baltimore Scheme While G. Stanley Hall was in Leipzig working unde r Wilhelm Wundt, the revolutionary trio Gilman- Dwight-White were moving events back home - an d The Order ran into its first organized opposition. The protesting \"neutrals\" at Ya le had no hope of winning. Even under independent President Noah Porter in the 1870s, The Order had Yale University under its control. But wh ile Yale students were watching, protesting and writing bad verse, Daniel Gilman ran into opposition 3000 miles away - and if the leaders of this counter revolution had known the st ory we are recounting here, they might just have stopped The Order dead in its tracks. In 1867 Daniel Gilman received an offer as President of the Univ ersity of Wisconsin. This he declined. In 1872 Gilman was offered the Presidency of the newly established Un iversity of California. This offer he accepted. In California Gilman found a political hornets' nest. For some years there had been increasing popular concern about the railroad m onopolies, government subsidies to railroads and - oddly enough - the Morrill Bill which gave federal land grants to agricultural and scie ntific colleges. The reader will recall that in Connecticut and New York, The Order had grabbed the total stat e's share for Yale and Cornell respectively. Californians belie ved that the University of Californi a, a land grant college, should teach agriculture and science, wher eas Gilman had different ideas. Unrest over corruption, including corruption among University of Ca lifornia Regents and the railroads (in which members of The Order had widespread interests), led to format ion of a new California political party."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"In 1873 the party was known as the Patrons of Hu sbandry or the Grangers . Then members of the Republican Party broke away and joined with the Grangers to form the Peoples Independent Party (known also as the Dolly Varden Party). They won a decisive victory in the 1873 California elections and following investigations by the Grangers, a petition was sent to the Legislature concerning operation of the University of California under Daniel Giiman. At that time Henry George was editor of the San Francisco Daily Evening Post and George used his considerable journalistic skills to attack the Univ ersity, the Regents, Gilman, and the land grants. Although Henry George is known as a socialist, we cl assify him as an independent socialist, not part of the Hegelian right-left spectrum. His main target was land monopoly, whereas the \"scientific\" Hegelian socialism of Karl Marx is geared to establishing monopolies of all ki nds under state control, following the Hegelian theory of th e supremacy of the State. This populist furor scared Gilm an, as he freely admits: \". . . there are dangers here which I could not forese e. . . . This year the dangers have been averted but who can tell what will happen tw o years hence\"? I feel that we are building a supe rior structure but it rests over a powder mill which may blow it up any day. All these conditions fill me with perplexity.\" Reading between the lines, Daniel Gilman was not too anxious to =ace the populist west. He needed a more stable base where prying jo urnalists and independent politicians could be headed off. And this base presented itself in the \"Baltimore scheme.\" Daniel Gilman Becomes President Of Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins, a wealthy Baltimore merchant, left hi s fortune to establish a University for graduate education (the first in the United States along German lines) and a medical school. Hopkins' trustees were all friends who lived in Baltimore. How then did they come to select Daniel Coit Gilman as President of the new University? In 1874 the trustees invited three un iversity presidents to come to Baltimore and advise on the choice of a President. These were Charles W. Eliot of Harvard, Andrew Dickson White of Cornell, and James B. Angell of Michigan. Only Andrew Dickson Whit e was in The Order. After meeting independently with each of these presidents, half a dozen of the trustees toured several Am erican Universities in search of further information - and Andrew D. White accompanied the tour. The result . as in the words of James Angell: \"And now I have this remarkable statement to ma ke to you, that without the least conference between us three, we all wrote letters telling th em that the one man was Daniel C. Gilman of California,\"1 The truth is that Gilman not only knew what was going on in 3aitimore, but was in communication with Andrew White on the Baltimor e scheme,\" as they called it. In a letter dated April 5, 1874, Gilm an wrote as follows to Andrew D. W hite \"( could not conclude on any new proposition without conferring upon it with some of my family friends, and I have not felt at liberty to do so . I confess that the Baltimore (italics in original) scheme has often suggested itse lf to me, but I have no persona l relations in that quarter.\" 2 'John C. French. A HISTORY OF \"I HE UNIVERSITY FOUNDED BY JOHNS HOPKINS (The Johns Hopkins Press. Baltimore. 1946), p. 26. 2 LIFE OF DANIEL COIT GILMAN. p. 157. Here's the interesting point: the board appointed by Johns Hopkins to found a university did not even meet to adopt its by-laws and appoint committe es until four weeks before this letter i.e., March 7, 1874. Yet Gilman tells us \"the Baltimore scheme has of times suggested itself to me... In brief: Gilman knew what was happening over in Baltimore BEFORE HIS NAME HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO THE TRUSTEES! Gilman became fi rst President of Johns Hopkins University and quickly set to work."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Johns Hopkins had willed substantial amounts for both a University and a medical school. Dr. William H. Welch ('70), a fellow member of The Order, was brought in by Gilman to head up the Hopkins medical school. (Welch was President of th e Board of Directors of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research for almost 25 years, 1910-1934. This we shall expand upon later in the series when we examine how The Order came to control medicine). For the moment let's return to G. Stanley Hall who was in Leipzig while John s Hopkins was acquiring its new President. Gilman Starts The Revoluti on in American Education When he returned to the United States Hall was feeling pretty low: \"I came home, again in the depths because of debt and with no prospects, took a small flat on the edge of Somerville, where my two children were born, and waited , hoped and worked. On e Wednesday morning President Eliot (of Harvard University) rode up to the house, rapped on the door without dismounting from his horse and asked me to begin Saturday of that week a course of lectures on education . . .\" As Hall recounts it, he had a \"very impressive audience\" for these lectures. Sometime later, \"In 1881 I was surprised and delighted to receive an invitation from the Johns Hopkins University, then the cynosure of all aspiring young professors, to deliver a course of twelve semi-public lectures on psychology.\" At the end of the lecture series, Gilman offered Hall the chair of Professor of Psychology and Pedagogy. This puzzled Hall because others at John s Hopkins were \"older and abler\" than himself and \"Why the appointment for which all of them had been considered fell to me I was never able to understand unless it was because my stand point was thought to be a little more accordant with the ideals which then prevailed there.\" Hall was given a psychological laboratory, a thousand dollars a year for equipment and, with the encouragement of Gilman, founded Th e American Journal Of Psychology. And what did Hall teach? Again in his own words: \"The psychology I taught was almost entirely experimental and covered for the most part the material that Wundt had set forth in the later an d larger edition of Physiological Psychology.\" The rest is known. The chart demonstrates how doctoral students from Wundt and Hall fanned out through the United States, established departmen ts of psychology and education by the score; 117 psychological laboratories just in the period up to 1930. Prominent am ong these students were John Dewey, J.M. Cattell and E.L. Thorndike - all part of the founding of Columbia Teachers' College and Chicago's School of Education - th e two sources of modern American education. Their activities can be measured by the number of doctorates in educational psychology and experimental psychology granted in the period up to 1948. The following list includes psychologists with training in Germany under W ilhelm Wundt before 1900, and the number of doctorates they in turn awarded up to 1948: American Students of Wundt Teaching at U.S. Universities Career At Number of Doctorates They Awarded up to 1948 G.

Titchener Cornell University 112 doctorates H. Gale Minnesota University 123 doctorates G.T.W. Patrick Iowa University 269 doctorates C.H. Judd University of Chicago 196 doctorates Of these only E.B. Titchener at Cornell could be called a critic of the Wundt school of experimental psychology. The rest followed the pa rty line: an amalgamation of Hegelian philosophy and Wundtian animal psychology. So from the seed sown by Daniel Coit Gilman at Johns Hopkins grew the vast network of interlocking schools of education and department s of psychology that domi nates education today."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Memorandum Number Six: The Troika Spreads Its Wings Around the turn of the century The Order had made significant penetration into the educational establishment. By utilizing the power of members in st rategic positions they were able to select, groom and position non-members with similar philosophy and activist traits. In 1886 Timothy Dwight (The Order) had taken over from the last of Yale's clerical Presidents, Noah Porter. Never again was Yale to get too far from The Order. Dwight was followed by member Arthur T. Hadley ('76). Andrew Dickson White was secure as President of Cornell and alternated as U.S. Ambassador to Germany. While in Berlin, White acted as recruiting agent for The Order. Not only G. Stanley Hall came into his net, but also Richard T. Ely, founder of the American Economic Association. Daniel Gilman, as we noted in the last memorandum, was President of Johns Hopkins and used that base to introduce Wundtian psychology into U.S. education. Afte r retirement from Johns Hopkins, Gi lman became the first President of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. The chart overleaf summarizes the achi evements of this remarkable troika. Now let's see how The Order moved into more specialize d fields of education, th en we need to examine how The Order fits with John Dewey, the source of mo dern American educational philosophy, then how The Order spread Dewey throughout the system. Founding Of The American Economic Association Academic associations are a means of conditioning or even policing academics. Although academics are great at talking about academic freedom, they are peculi arly susceptible to peer group pressures. And if an academic fails to get the word through his peer group, there is always the threat of not getting tenure. In other words, what is taught at University levels is pa ssed through a sieve. The sieve is faculty conformity. In this century when faculties are larger, conformity cannot be imposed by a Pr esident. [t is handled equally well through faculty tenure committees and publicat ions committees of ac ademic associations. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" We have already noted that member Andrew Dick son White founded and was first President of the American Historical Association and therefore was able to influence the constitution and direction of the AHA. This has generated an official history and ensured that existence of The Order is never even whispered in history books, let al one school texts. An economic association is also of significance be cause it conditions how people who are not economists think about the relative merits of free enterprise and st ate planning. State economic pla nning is an essential part of State political control. Laissez fair e in economics is the equivalent of in dividualism in politics. And just as you will never find any plaudits for the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution in official history, neither will you find any plaudits for individual free enterprise. The collectivist nature of present day college faculties in economics has been generated by the American Economic Association under influence of The Order. Ther e are very few outspoken preachers of the Austrian School of Economics on American campuses today. They ha ve been effectively weeded out. Even Ludwig von Mises, undisputed leader of the school , was unable to find a teaching post in the United States. So much for"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"academic freedom in economics. And it speaks harshly for the pervasive, deadening, dictatorial hand of the American Economics Association. And the controlling hand, as in the Amer ican Psychological Association and the American Historical Association, traces back to The Order. The principal founder and first Secretary of the Amer ican Economic Association was Richard T. Ely. Who was Ely? Ely descended from Richard Ely of Plymouth, England who settled at Lyme, Connecticut in 1660. On his grandmother's side (and you have heard this before for members of The Order) Ely descended from the daughter of Rev. Thomas Hooker, fo under of Hartford, Connect icut. On the paternal side, Ely descended from Elder William Brewster of Plymouth Colony. Ely's first degree was from Dartmout h College. In 1876 he went to Universi ty of Heidelberg and received a Ph.D. in 1879. Ely then return ed to the United States, but as we shall describe below, had already come to the notice of The Order. When Ely arrived home, Daniel Gilman invited Ely to take the Chair of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins. Ely accepted at about the sa me time Gilman appointed G. Stanle y Hall to the Chair of Philosophy and Pedagogy and William Welch, a member of The Order we have yet to describe, to be Dean of the Johns Hopkins medical school. Fortunately, Richard Ely was an egocentric and left an autobiography, Ground Under Our Feet, which he dedicated to none other than Daniel Coit Gilman (see i llustration). Then on page 54 of this autobiography is the caption \"I find an invaluable friend in Andrew D. White.\" And in Ely's first book, French And German Socialism, we find :he following: \"The publication of this volume is due to the fr iendly counsel of the Hono rable Andrew D. White, President of Cornell University, a gentleman tireless in his efforts to encourag e young men and alive to every opportunity to speak fitting words of hope an d cheer. Like many of the younger scholars of our country, I am indebted to him more than I can say.\" Ely also comments that he never could understand why he always received a welcome from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, in fact from the Ambassador himself. But the reader has probably guessed what Ely didn't know - White was The Order's recruiter in Berlin. Ely recalls his conversations with White, and make s a revealing comment: \"I was interested in his psychology and the way he worked cleverly with Ezra Cornell and Mr. Sage, a benefactor and one of the trustees of Cornell University.\" The reader will remember it was Henry 5 age who provided the first funds for G. Stanley Hall to study in Germany. Then Ely says, \"The only explanation I can give for his special interest n me was the new ideas I had in relation to economics.\" And what were t hese new ideas? Ely rejected clas sical liberal economics, including free trade, and noted that free trade was \"particularly obnoxious to the German school of thought by which I was so strongly impressed.\" In other ,words, just as G. Stanley Hall had adopte d Hegelianism in psychology from Wundt, Ely adopted Hegelian id eas from his prime teacher Karl Knies at University of Heidelberg. TO THE MEMORY OF DANIEL COIT GILMAN First President of Johns Hopkins University, creative genius in the field of education; wise, inspiring and courag eous chief under whom I had the good fortune to begin my career and to whom I owe an inestimable debt of gratitude, I dedicate this book. And both Americans had come to the watchful attenti on of The Order. The staff of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin never did appreciate why a young American student, not attached to the Embassy, was hired by Ambassador White to make a study of the Berlin City Go vernment. That was Ely's test, and he passed it with flying colors. As he says, \"It was this report which se rved to get me started on my way and later helped me get a teaching post at the Johns Hopkins.\" "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The rest is history. Daniel Coit Gilman invited Ri chard Ely to Johns Hopkins University. From there Ely went on to head the depart ment of economics at University of Wi sconsin. Through the ability to influence choice of one's successor, Wisconsin has been a cen ter of statist economics down to the present day. Before we leave Richard Ely we should note that fina ncing for projects at University of Wisconsin came directly from The Order - from member George B. Co rtelyou ('13), President of New York Life Insurance Company. Ely also tells us about his students , and was especially enthralled by W oodrow Wilson: \"We knew we had in Wilson an unusual man. There could be no question that he had a brilliant future.\" And for those readers who are wondering if Colonel Edward Mandell House, Wo odrow Wilson's mysterious confidant, is going to enter the story, th e answer is Yes! He does, but not yet. The clue is that young Edward Mandell House went to school at Hopkins Grammar School, New Haven, Connecticut. House knew The Order from school days. [n fact one of Hous e's closest classmates at Hopkins Grammar School was member Arthur Twining Hadley ('76), who went on to become President of Yale University (1899 to 1921). And it was Theodore Roosev elt who surfaced Hadley's hidden philosophy: \"Years later Theodore Roosevelt would term Arthur Hadley his fellow anarchist and say that if their true views were known, they would be so misunderstood that they would bot h lose their jobs as President of the United States and President of Yale.\"1 House's novel, Philip Dru, was written in New Haven, Connecticut and in those da ys House was closer to the Taft segment of The Order than Woodrow Wilson. In fact House, as we shall see later, was The Order's messenger boy. House was also something of a joker beca use part of the story of The Order is encoded within Philip Dru! We are not sure if The Order knows a bout House's little prank. It's just like House to try to slip one over on the holders of power. American Medical Association Your doctor knows nothing about nu trition? Ask hom confidentially an d he'll probably confess he had only one course in nutrition. And there's a reason. Back in the late 19th century American medicine was in a deplorable state. To the credit of the Rockefeller General Education Board and the Institute for Medical Research, funds were made available to staff teaching hospitals and to eradicate some pretty horrible diseases. 1 Morris Hadley. ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY, Yale University Press. 1948, p. 33. On the other hand, a chemical-based medicine was intr oduced and the medical prof ession cut its ties with naturopathy. Cancer statistics tell you the rest. For the moment we want only to note that the impetu s for reorganizing medical education in the United States came from John D. Ro ckefeller, but the funds we re channeled through a single member of The Order. Briefly, the story is this . One day in 1912 Frederick T. Gates of Rockefeller Foundation had lunch with Abraham Flexner of Carnegie Institution. Said Gates to Flexner: \"What would you do if you had one million dollars with which to make a start in reorgani zing medical education in the United States?\" 1 As reported by Fosdick, this is what happened: \"The bluntness was characteristic of Mr. Gates, but the question about the million dollars was hardly in accord with his usual indirect and cautious approach to the spending of money. Flexner's reply, however, to the effect that any funds - a million dollars or otherwise - could most profitably be spent in developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School, struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. Wi!lia m H. Welch, the dean of the institution.\" Welch was President of the Rockefe ller Institute for Medical Research from 1901, and a Trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1906. Willia m H. Welch was also a member of the Order and had been brought to Johns Hopkins University by Daniel Coit Gilman. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Other Areas Of Education We should note in conclusion other educational areas where The Order ha d its influence. In theology we have already noted that The Order controlled Union Th eological Seminary for many years, and was strong within the Yale School of Divinity. The constitution for UNESCO was written largely by The Order, i.e., member Archibald MacLeish. And member William Chauvenet (1840) was \"l argely responsible for establishing the U.S. Naval Academy on a firm scientific basis.\" Chauvenet was director of the Obse rvatory, U.S. Na val Academy, Annapolis from 1845 to 1859 and then went on to become Chancel lor of Washington University (1869). Finally, a point on methodology. The reader will remember from Memorandum One (Voume One) that we argued the most \"general\" solution to a problem in scienc e is the most acceptable solution. In brief, a useful hypothesis is one that explains the most events. Pause a minute and reflect. We are not developing a theory that includes numerous superficially unconnected events. 1 Raymond D. Fosdick. ADVENTURE IN GIVING (Harper & Row. New York. 1962), p. 154. For example, the founding of Johns Hopkins University, the introduction of Wundtian educational methodology, a psychologist G. Stanley Hall, an economist Richard T. Ely, a politician Woodrow Wilson - and now we have included such disparate events as Colone l Edward House and the U.S. Naval Observatory. The Order links to them all . . . . and several hundred or thousand other events yet to be unfolded. In research when a theory begins to find support of th is pervasive nature it suggests the work is on the right track. So let's interpose another principle of scientific me thodology. How do we finally know that our hypothesis is valid? If our hypothesis is correct, then we should be able to predict not only future conduct of The Order but also events where we have yet to conduct research. This is still to come. However, the curious reader may wishto try it out. Select a major historical event and search for the guiding hand of The Order.

In fact, if the present state of education 7 had been brought a bout by legislation, it would have been challenged on the grounds of unconstitutionality. On the contrary, the philosophy and practice of today's system has been achieved by injection of massive private funds by foundations under influence, and some times control, of The Order. This implementation we will describe in a future volume, How The Order Controls Foundations. In fact, the history of the implementation of Dewey's objectives is also the hi story of the larger foundations, i.e., Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, Peabody, Sloan, Slater and Twentieth Century. How John Dewey Rela tes To The Order John Dewey worked for his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University f r om 1882-86 under Hegelian philosopher George Sylvester Morris. Morris in turn had his doctorate from University of Berlin and studied under the same teachers as Daniel Gilman, i.e., Adolph Trendelenberg and Hermann Ulrici. Neither Morris nor Dewey were members of The Orde r, but the link is clear. Gilman hired Morris, knowing full well that Hegelianism is a totally integrated body of 'knowledge and ea s y to recognize. It is a d ifferent from the British empirical school of John Stuart Mill as night and day. John Dewey's psychology was taken from G. Stanley Hall, the first American student to receive a doctorate from Wilhelm Wundt at Univ ersity of Leipzig. Gilman knew exactly what he was getting when he hired Hall. With only a dozen faculty members, all were hired personally by the President. In brief, philosophy and psychology came to De wey from academics hand-picked by The Order. From Johns Hopkins Dewey went as Professor of Ph ilosophy to University of Michigan and in 1886 published Psychology, a blend of Hegelian philosophy applied to Wu ndtian experimental psychology. It sold well. In 1894 Dewey went to University of Chicago an d in 1902 was appointed Director of the newly founded - with Rockefeller money - School of Education. The University of Chicago itself had been founde d in 1890 with Rockefeller funds - and in a future volume we will trace this through Frederick Gates (of Hartford, Connecticut), and the Pillsbury family (The Order). The University of Chicago and Columbia Teache rs' College were the key training schools for modern education. The Influence Of Dewey Looking back at John Dewey after 80 years of his infl uence, he can be recognized as the pre-eminent factor in the collectivization, or Hegelianization, of American Schools. Dewey was consistently a philosopher of social change. That's why his impact has been so deep and pervasive. And it is in the work and implementation of the ideas of John Dewey th at we can find the objective of The Order. When The Order brought G. Stanley Hall from Leipzig to Johns Hopkins University, John Dewey was already there, waiting to write his doctoral dissertati on on \"The Psychology of Kant .\" Already a Hegelian in philosophy, he acquired and adapted the experimental psychology of Wundt and Hall to his concept of education for social change. To illustrate this, here 's a quote from John Dewey in My Pedagogic Creed: \"The school is primarily a social institution. Educatio n being a social process, the school is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that w ill be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends. Education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.\" What we learn from this is that Dewey's education is not child centered but State centered, because for the Hegelian, \"social ends\" are always State ends. This is where the gulf of misunderstanding between modern parents and the educational system begins. Parents believe a child goes to school to learn skills to use in the adult world, but Dewey states specifically that education is \"not a preparation for future livin g.\" The Dewey educational system does not accept the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"role of developing a child's talents bu t, contrarily, only to prepare the child to function as a unit in an organic whole - in blunt terms a cog in the wheel of an organi c society. Whereas most Americans have moral values rooted in the individual, the values of the school system are rooted in the Hegelian concept of the State as the absolute. No wonder there is misunderstanding! The Individual Child When we compare Hegel, John Dewey, and today' s educational thinkers and doers, we find an extraordinary similarity. For Hegel the individual has no value except as he or she performs a function for society: \"The State is the absolute reality and the individual himself has objective existence, truth and morality only in his capacity as a member of the State.\" John Dewey tried to brush the freedom of the indivi dual to one side. In an article, \"Democracy and Educational Administration\" (School & Society, XVL, 1937, p. 457) Dewey talks about the \"lost individual,\" and then restates Hegel in the follo wing way: \"freedom is the participa tion of every mature human being in formation of the values that regulate the living of men together.\" This is pure Hegel, i.e., man finds freedom only in obedience to the State. As one critic, Horace M. Kallen stated , John Dewey had a \"blindness to the sheer individuality of individuals.\" In other words, for Dewey man has no individual rights. Ma n exists only to serve the State. This is directly contradictory to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution with the preamble \"We the people.\" They then go on to define the rights of the state which are always subordinate and subject to the will of \"We the people.\" This, of course, is why modern educationists have gr eat difficulty in introducing the Constitution into school work. Their ideas follow Hegel and Dewey and indirectly the objectives of The Order. For example: \"An attempt should be made to redress the present overempha sis on individualism in current programs . . . students need to develop a sense of community and collective identity.\" (Educational L eadership, May 1982, William B. Stanley, Asst. Professor, De pt. of Curriculum and Instruction, Louisiana State University). The Purpose Of Education What then is the purpose of education, if the individual has no rights and exists only for the State? There was no need for Hegel to describe education, a nd so far as we Know there is no statement purely on education in Hegel's writings. It is unnecessary. For Hege l every quality of an individual exists only at the mercy and will of the State. This approach is reflecte d in political systems based on Hegel whether it be Soviet Communism or Hitlerian national so cialism. John Dewey follows Hegel' s organic view of society. For example: \"Education consists either in the ability to use one's power s in a social direction or el se in ability to share in the experience of others and thus widen the individual consciousness to that of the race\" (Lectures For The First Course In Pedagogy). This last sentence is reminiscent of the Hitleria n philosophy of race (i.e ., right Hegelianism). And today's educators refl ect this approach. Here's a quote fr om Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of California, who also happens to be Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education and the Education Goals Committee for the California State Assembly - a key post: \"It is now time for a new vision of ourselves, of man, of human nature and of human potential, and a new theory of politics and instituti ons premised upon that vision. What is that vision of Man? That the natural, whole, organismic human being is loving . . . that man's basic thrust is towards community\" (quoted in Rex Myles, Brotherhood and Darkness, p. 347). What is this \"widen(ing) the indi vidual conscienceness\" (Dewey) and \"thrust . . . towards community\" (Vasconcellos)?"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Stripped of the pedantic language it is new world orde r, a world organic society. But there is no provision for a global organic order within the Co nstitution. In fact, it is illegal fo r any government officer or elected official to move the United States towards such an order as it would clearly be inconsistent with the Constitution. To be sure, Dewey was not a government official, but Vasconcellos has taken an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. The popular view of a global order is probably that we had better look after our problems at home before we get involved in these esoteric ideas. Political corrupt ion, pitifully low educationa l standards, and insensitive bureaucracy are probably of more concern to Americans. It's difficult to see what the new world order has to do with education of children, but it's there in the literature. Fichte, Hege l's predecessor from whom ma ny of his philosophical ideas originated, had a definite concept of a League of Nationas (Volkerbund) and the idea of a league to enforce peace. Fichte asserted \"As this federation spreads further and gradually embraces the whole earth, perpetual pe ace begins, the only lawful relation among states . . .\" The National Education Association, the lobby for ed ucation, produced a program for the 1976 Bicentennial entitled \"A Declaration Of Interdependence: Education For A Global Community. \" On page 6 of this document we find: \"We are committed to the idea of Education for Gl obal Community. You are invited to help turn the commitment into action and mobilizing world educ ation for development of a world community.\" An objective almost parallel to He gel is in Self Knowledge And Social Action by Obadiah Silas Harris, Associate Professor of Educational Management and Development New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico: \"When community educators say that community education takes into consideration the total individual and his total environment, they mean precisely this: the field of community education includes the individual in his total psycho-physical structure and his entire ecological climate with all its ramifications - social, political, economical, cultural, spiritual, etc. It seeks to integrate the individual within himself (sic) and within his community until the individual becomes a cosmic soul and the community the world.\" And on page 84 of the same book: \"The Cosmic soul ... the whole human race is going to evolve an effective soul of its own - the cosmic soul of the race. That is the future of human evolut ion. As a result of the emergence of the universal soul, there will be a great unification of the entire human race, ushering into existence a new era, a new dawn of unique world power.\" This last quote sounds even more like Adolph Hitler than Assemblyman John Vasconcellos. It has the same blend of the occult, the ethnic and absolutism. In conclusion we need only quote th e Constitution, the basic body of law under which the United States is governed. The generally held understanding of the Constitution on the relations hip between the individual and the State is that the individual is Supreme, the State exists only to serve individuals and the State has no power except by express permission of the people. This is guaranteed by Amendments IX and X of the Constitution. Amendment IX reads, \"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the People.\" Note, the \"retained\". And, Amendment X reads, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by th e Constitution, nor prohibite d by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" In brief, the proposals of John Dewey and his followers are un constitutional. They would never have seen the light of day in American schoolrooms unless they had been promoted by The Order with its enormous power."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" Mind Blank - The Order's Objective For Education Memorandum Number Eight: Summary Up to this point we have established the following: (1) By the 1870s The Order had Yale University under its control. Every President of Yale since Timothy Dwight has either been a member of The Orde r or has family connections to The Order. It also appears that some Yale graduates who are not members of The Order will act towards objectives desired by The Order. Some of these, for example Dean Acheson, we can identify as members of Scroll & Key, or with relatives in The Order. Othe rs yet to be brought into our discu ssion are members of Wolf's Head (for example, Reeve Schley, who worked for the Rockefelle rs). Still others, for exampl e Robert Maynard Hutchins (Fund for the Republic), are Yale graduates but not yet identified as members of any Yale senior society. It appears at this point that Ron Rosenbaum's assertion (in Esquire, 1977), that members of the Eastern Establishment who are not members of Skull & Bones will be members of either Scroll & Key or Wolf's Head is holding up. (2) So far as education is concerne d, look-say reading originated with Thomas Gallaudet and was designed for deaf mutes. The elder Gallaudet was not a member of The Order, but his two sons (Edson and Herbert Gallaudet) were initiated in 1893 and 189 8. Horace Mann, a significant influe nce in modern educational theory and the first promoter of \"look-say,\" was not a member . However, Mann was President of Antioch College, and the Tafts (The Order) were the most powerful trustees of Antioch. (3) We traced John Dewey's philosophy, that education is to prepare a pers on to fit into society rather than develop individual talents, to Herb art who was influenced by the Swiss Pestalozzi. Personal development cannot be achieved by developing individual ta lents, it must take the form of preparation to serve society, according to Herbart, Dewey and Pestalozzi. Pestalozzi was a member of the Illuminati, with the code name \"Alfred.\" This raises new perspectives for future research, specifically whether The Order can be traced to the illuminati. (4) The scene shifts in the late 19th century from Ya le to Johns Hopkins Univer sity. Member Daniel Coit Gilman is the first President of Johns Hopkins and he has handpicked either member s of The Orde r (Welch) or Hegelians for the new departme nts. G. Stanley Hall, the first of Wilhelm Wundt's American students, began the process of Americanization of Wundt, established the first experimental psychology laboratory for education in the United States with funds from Gilman, and later started the Journal Of Psychology. John Dewey was one of the first do ctorates from Johns Hopkins (under Hall and Morris), followed by Woodrow Wilson, who was Presi d ent of Princeton University before he became President of the United States."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"We noted that at key turning points of G. Stanley Ha ll's career the guiding hand of The Order can be traced. Hall also links to another member of The Or der, Alphonso Taft. We noted that Wilhelm Wundt's family had Illuminati connections. (5) The Order was able to acquire all the Morrill Act land grant entitlements for New York and Connecticut for Cornell and Yale respectively. However, member Gilman ran into trouble as President of University of California on the question of the Califo rnia land grants and corruption among the University regents. The first organized opposition to The Order ca me from the San Francisco Times, but editor Henry George was not fully aware of the nature of his target. (6) The core of The Order's impact on education can be seen as a troika: Gilman at Johns Hopkins, White at Cornell (and U.S. Minister to Germany) and Dwig ht, followed by member Hadley, at Yale. Andrew White was first President of the American Historical Associat ion. Richard T. Ely (not a member but aided by The Order) became a founder and first s ecretary of the American Economic Association. Members can also be traced into such diverse areas as the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Union Theological Seminary. (7) John Dewey, the originator of modern educationa l theory, took his doctorate at Johns Hopkins under Hegelians. Dewey's work is pure Hegel in theory and practice, and is totally inconsistent with the Con- stitution of the U.S. and rights of the individual . A comparison of German Hegelians, John Dewey and modern educational theorists demonstrates the paralle lism. Children do not go to school to develop individual talents but to be prepared as units in an organic society. Experimental schools at University of Chicago and Columbia University fann ed the \"new education\" throughout the United States. In brief, The Order initiated and controlled education in this century by controlling its CONTENT. The content is at variance with the traditional view of education, which sees each child as unique and the school as a means of developing this uniqueness. Criticism of the educational system today bypasses the fundamental philosophic aspect and focuses on omissions, i.e., that the kids can't read, write, spell or undertake simple mathematical exercise. If we look at the educational system through the eyes of The Or der and its objectives, then the problems shift. If teachers are not teaching basi cs, then what are they doing? They appear to be preparing children for a political objective which also happens to be the objective of The Order. The emphasis is on global living, preparing for a global society. It is apparently of no concern to the educational establishment that ch ildren can’t read, can’t write, and can’t do elementary mathematics...but they are going to be ready for the Brave New World. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Memorandum Number Nine: Conclusions And Recommendations A general conclusion is that The Order has been able to convert the educational system from one aimed at developing the individual child to one aimed at conditioning the child to be a unit in an organic, i.e., Hegelian, society. When we look at philanthropic foundations in the next volume we shall see the way this has been implemented by private foundation funds. There is not sufficient evidence to ar gue whether the decline in educati onal standards is an accidental by- product of this \"new education\" or a deliberate subsid iary policy. In any event, the Reagan Administration policy of merit pay will compound, not solve, the problem. Recommendations for reform have been forthcoming at intervals since the late 1950s when educational problems first surfaced. At the time of Sputnik there wa s a hue and cry about the backward nature of U.S. training in mathematics and science, which at the Un iversity level are not at all backward. Anyway the educational establishment recognized an opportunity and cried, \"more, more money.\" They got it, and there"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"was a massive expansion in the '60s. But the funds have been poured into social conditioning. Mathematics and sciences have taken back seat in the last 30 years. Then in 1981, James S. Coleman of the University of Chicago produced a study of public schools for the U.S. Department of Education. In this study Coleman used the National Opinion Research Center to contact 58,728 sophomores and seniors in 1,016 public, parochial, and private schools across the United States. His findings were: • private and parochial schools provide an education closer to the common school ideal than do public schools, • private school students learned more than public school counterparts, • Coleman wrote it was paradoxical that \"catholic schools function much closer to the American ideal of the common school . . . than do public schools.\" • private schools provide \"a safer, more discip lined and more ordered environment\" than public schools, • \"blacks and Hispanics perform better at private schools.\" The reason? Private schools are less under the influence of the Dewey educational philosophy. They still have to use accredited teachers, but these teachers - qu ite bluntly - have been ab le to survive the teacher training conditioning. Yet the educational establishment does not see the writing on the wall. In Fall 1983 a report by John Goodlad, Dean of the School of Education at University of Southern California, will be published. John I. Goodlad wrote the Foreword to Schooling For A Global Age (McGraw Hill, 1979) which includes these comments: \"Enlightened social engineering is required to face situations th at demand global action now\" (page xiii). \"Parents and the general public must be reached . . . otherwise children and youth enrolled in globally oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values assumed in the home.\" And more. Another 345 pages of globalony follows. Nothing about the child as an individual. Nothing about the child as a repository of talents that need to be encouraged. Nothing about basic education: the 3 R's. Yet this Goodlad report is being pushed in The New York Times July 19, 1983) as the most \"comprehensive report\" ever made on American schools. These are some Goodlad proposals: • education should start at 4 years old • schools should be smaller • head teachers with doctora tes should have more pay. And this does nothing, of course, to stop what a former Commissioner of Education called \"a rising tide of mediocrity.\" If the United States is to survive in the coming technologically intensive age, then certain recommendations follow. These are: • the function of the school is to develop individual ta lent. Social engineering as an objective has to be discarded. • A thorough grounding in the 3 R's is essential for a good education. In other words, \"content\" is all important. • It follows that Schools of Education should be a bolished (this is under serious discussion at Duke University and has been proposed at Univer sity of Michigan and even Cal Berkeley). • Teacher credentials should be based on subject matter entirely, not educational theory. • All restrictions on private schools should be abolis hed. • Public schools should be returned to local control."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" Preface The operational history of The Order can only be understood within a framework of the Hegelian dialectic process. Quite simply this is the notion that conflict creates history . From this axiom it follows that controlled conflict can create a predetermi ned history. For example: When the Trilateral Commission discusses \"managed conflict\", as it does extensively in its literature, the Commission implies the managed use of conflict for long run predetermined ends - not for the mere random exercise of manipulative c ontrol to solve a problem. The dialectic takes this Trilateral \"managed conflict\" process one step further. In Hegelian terms, an existing force (the thesis) generates a counterforce (the antithesis). Conflict between the two forces results in the forming of a synthesis. Then the process starts all over again: Thesis is. antithesis results in synthesis."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The synthesis sought by the Establishment is called the New World Order. Without controlled conflict this New World Order will not come about. Ra ndom individual actions of persons in society would not lead m this synthesis, it's artificial, therefore it has to be created.

This explains why the International b ankers backed the Nazis, the Soviet Union, North Korea, North Vietnam, ad nauseum, against the Unit ed States. The \"conflict\" built profits while pushing the world ever closer to One World Government. The process continues today. We apologize for the poor quality of some documents included in this volume.

Furthermore, the diverse conflicting nature of thes e efforts, commented upon even in letters between Patriarchs, can only be explained in the terms of the Hegelian dialectic. In brief, the existence of these documents is just as im portant as the nature of the contents. It demonstrates joint planned actions, ergo: A Conspiracy! Antony C. Sutton April, 1984 Memorandum Number One: Created Conflict And The Dialectic Process I. INTRODUCTION The first volume of this series (Introduction To The Order described in broad terms the nature and objectives of The Order. Our first hypothesis, that the U.S. was ruled by an elite, secret society . was supported by documentary evidence: such a secret soci ety does exist, its membership is concealed, and disclosure of membership is not a voluntary effort. Further, since publication of the first volume, the Sterling Library at Yale University which has major holdings of their _records has refused to allow researchers further access to Russell Trust papers (the legal name for The Order). We also argued in the first volume that the operations of The Order must be seen and explained in terms of the Hegelian dialectic process. Their operations can not be explained in terms of any other philosophy; therefore The Order cannot be described as \"right\" or \"left,\" secular or religious, Marxist or Capitalist. The Order, and its objectives, is all of these and none of these. In Hegelian philosophy the conflict of political \"right \" and political \"left,\" or thesis and antithesis in Hegelian terms, is essential to the forward movement of history and historical change itself. Conflict between thesis and antithesis brings about a synthesis, i.e., a new historical situation. Our descriptive world history in the West and Marxist countries consists only of description and analysis within a political framework of \"right\" or \"left.\" For ex ample, historical work published in the West looks at"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"communism and socialism either thro ugh the eyes of financial capitalism or Marxism. Historical work published in the Soviet Union looks at the West only through Marxist eyes. However, there is another frame for historical analysis that has neve r (so far as we can determine) been utilized, i.e., to use a framework of Hegelian logic, to determine if those elites who c ontrol the State use the dial ectic process to create a predetermined historical synthesis. Only tantalizing glimpses of any such creative proce ss can be found in modern historical works. The most convincing glimpses are in the late Carroll Quigley's Tragedy And Hope which we shall quote below. Rarely some politicians on the periphery of elitist power have allowed brief insights into the public eye. For example, President Woodrow Wilson made the revealing statement: \"Some of the biggest men in the U.S. in the fields of commerce and manufacturing know that there is a power so organized, so subtle, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" Who or what is this power? And how is it used? This series argues that the current world situation has be en deliberately created by this elitist power more or less by manipulation of \"right\" and \"left\" elements. We argue that the most powerful of all world elites has during the past 100 years or so developed both right a nd left elements to bring about a New World Order. There is no question that the so-called establishment in the U.S. uses \"managed conflict.\" The practice of \"managing\" crises to bring about a favorable outcome, that is, favorable to the elite, is freely admitted in the literature of, for example, The Trilat eral Commission. Furthermore, there is no question that decisions of war and peace are made by a few in th e elite and not by the many in th e voting process through a political referendum. This volume explores some major conflict deci sions made by the few in The Order and the way in which right-left situations have been deliberately create d and then placed in a conflict mode to bring about a synthesis. Finally, we will tie these decisions and operations back to the elit e and specifically to The Order. II. HOW THE DIALECTIC PROCESS WORKS Throughout the last 200 years, since the rise of Kant in German philosophy, we can identify two conflicting systems of philosophy and so opposing ideas of the State, society and culture. In the U.S., the British Commonwealth and France, philosophy is based on the indi vidual and the rights of the individual. Whereas in Germany from the time of Kant, through Fichte and Hege l up to 1945, the root philosophy has been universal brotherhood, rejection of individualism and general op position to Western classical liberal thought in almost all its aspects. German idealism, as we noted in earlier volumes of this series, was the philosophical basis for the work of Karl Marx and the Left Hegelians as well as Bismarck, Hitler and the Right Hegelians. This is the paradox: that Hegel gave a theoretical basis not only to the most conservative of German movements, but also to most of the revolutionary movements of the 19th century. Both Marx and Hitler have their philosophical roots in Hegel. From the Hegelian system of political thought, alien to most of us in the West, stem such absurdities as the State seen as the \"march of God through history,\" that the State is also God, that the only duty of a citizen is to serve God by serving the State, that the State is Ab solute Reason, that a citizen can only find freedom by worship and utter obedience to the State. However, we also noted in How The Orde r Controls Education that Hegelian absurdities have thoroughly penetrated th e U.S. educational system under pressure from such organizations as the National Education Association and major foundations. From this system of Hegelian philosophy comes the historic al dialectic, i.e., that all historical events emerge from a conflict between opposing forces. These emerging events are above and different from the conflicting events. Any idea or implementation of an idea may be seen as THESIS. This thesis will encourage emergence of opposing forces, known as ANTITHESIS. The final outcome w ill be neither thesis nor antithesis, but a synthesis of the two forces in conflict. Karl Marx, in Das Kapital, posed capitalism as thesis and communism as antithesis. What has been completely ignored by historians, including Marxists, is that any clash between these forces cannot lead to a society Which is either capitalist or communist but must lead to a society characterized by a synthesis of the two conflicting forces. The clash of opposites must in the Hege lian system bring about a society neither capitalist nor"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"communist. Moreover, in the Hegelian scheme of events, this new synthesis will reflect the concept of the State as God and the individual as totally subordinate to an all powerful State. What then is the function of a Parliament or a Congress for Hegetians? These institutions are merely to allow individuals to feel that opinions have some value and to allow a government to take advantage of whatever wisdom the \"peasant\" may accidentally demonstrate. As Hegel puts it: \"By virtue of this participation, subjective liberty an d conceit, with their general opinion, (individuals) can show themselves palpably efficacious and enjoy the satisf action of feeling themselves to count for something.\" War, the organized conflict of nations for Hegelians, is only the visible outcome of the clash between ideas. As John Dewey, the Hegelian darling of the modern educational system, puts it: \"War is the most effective preacher of the vanity of all merely finite interests, it puts an end to that selfish egoism of the individual by which he would claim his life and his property as his own or as his family's.\" (John Dewey, German Philosophy And Politics, p. 197) Of course, this war-promoting Dewey paragraph is c onveniently forgotten by the National Education Association, which is today busy in :he \"Peace Movement\" - at precisely that time when a \"peace\" movement most aids the Hegelian Soviets. Above all, the Hegelian doctrine is the divine right of States rather than the divine right of kings. The State for Hegel and Hegelians is God on earth: \"The march of God in history is the cause of the exis tence of states, their foundation is the power of Reason realizing itself as will. Every state, whatever it be, participates in the divine essence. The State is not the work of human art, only Reason could produce it.\" (Philosophy Of Right) For Hegel the individual is nothing, the individual has no rights, morality consists solely in following a leader. For the ambitious individual the rule is Sena tor Mansfield's maxim: \"To get along you have to go along.\" Compare this to the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States: \"We the people\" grant the state some powers and reserve all others to the people. Sepa ration of church and state is built into the U.S. Constitution, a denial of Hegel's \"the State is God on earth.\" Yet, compare this legal requirement to the actions of The Order in the United States, The Group in England, the Illuminati in Germany, and the Politburo in Russia. For these elitists the State is supreme and a self-appointed elite running the State acts indeed as God on earth. III. J.P. MORGAN USES THE DIALECTIC PROCESS The concept of the Hegelian dialectic is obviously beyond the comprehension of modern textbook writers. No historical or political theory te xtbook that we know of disc usses the possible use of the Hegelian dialectic in American politics. Yet its use has been recorded by Professor Carroll Quigley in Tragedy And Hope, a trade book based on documents of the Council on Foreign Re lations. Quigley not only describes banker J.P. Morgan's use of the \"right\" and the \"l eft\" as competitive devices for political manipulation of society, but adds an eye-opening comment: \"Unfortunately we do not ha ve space here for this great and untold st ory, but it must be remembered that what we do say is part of a much larger picture.\" (Tragedy And Hope, p. 945) This much larger picture is partly revealed in this book. First let's briefly note how J.P. Morgan used the dialectic process as a means of political control for financial ends. The only college attended by Morgan was 2-3 years in the mid-1850s at University of Gottingen, Germany, which was a center of Hegelian activism. We have no record that Morgan joined any secret so ciety, no more than the KONKNEIPANTEN, one of the student corps. Yet German Hegelianism is apparent in J.P. Morgan's approach to political parties - Morgan used them all. As Quigley comments: \"The associations between Wall Street and the Left, of which Mike Straight is a fair example, are really survivals of the associations between the Morgan Bank and the Left. To Morgan all political parties were simply organizations to be used, and the firm always was careful to keep a foot in all camps. Morgan himself, Dwight Morrow, and other part ners were allied with Republicans; Russell C. Leffingwell was allied with the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Democrats; Grayson Murphy was allied with the extreme Right; and Thomas W. Lamont was allied with the Left. Like the Morgan interest in libraries, museums, and art, its inability to distinguish between loyalty to the United States and loyalty to England, its recognition of the need for social work among the poor, the multi- partisan political views of the Morgan firm in domestic politics went back to the original founder of the firm, George Peabody (1795-1869). To this same seminal figur e may be attributed the use of tax-exempt foundations for controlling these activities, as may be observed in many parts of America to this day, in the use of Peabody foundations to support Peabody libraries and museums. Unfortunately, we do not have space here for this great and untold story, but it must be remembered that what we do say is part of a much larger picture.\" (Ibid) Quigley did not know of the link between the Morgan firm, other New York financial interests and The Order. As we have noted before, Quigley did publish a valuable expose of the British Establishment known as \"The Group.\" And we know from personal correspondence th at Quigley suspected more than he published, but identification of an American elite was not part of Quigley's work. The names Harriman, Bush, Acheson, Whitney - even Stimson - do not appear in The Anglo American Establishment. We can therefore take the above paragraph from Quigley's Tragedy And Hope and insert identification of The Order. The paragraph then becomes more revealing. Although Morgan himself was not a member of The Order, some of his partners were, and after Morgan's death the firm became Morgan, Stanley & Co. The \"Stanley\" was Harold Stanley (The Order 1908). In Morgan's time the influence of The Order came through partner Henry P. Davison, whose son H.P. Davison, Jr . was initiated in 1920. The elder Henry P. Davison brought Thomas Lamont and Willard Straight into the Morgan firm. These partners were instrumental in building the left wing of Morgan's dialectic, including the Communist Party U.S.A. (with Julius Hammer, whose son is today Chairman of Occidental Petroleum). Morgan partner Thomas Cochran was initiated in 1904. However, it was in the network of Morgan dominated and affiliated firms, rather than in the partnership it self, that one finds members of The Order. In firms like Guaranty Trust and Bankers Trust, somewhat removed fr om the J.P. Morgan financial center, although under Morgan control, we find concentrations of initiates (as we shall describe below). This practice by The Order of supporting both \"right\" and \"left\" persists down to the present day. We find in 1984, for example, that Averell Harriman (The Order '13) is elder statesman of the Democratic Party while George Bush (The Order '49) is a Republican Vice Pres ident and leader of the misnamed \"moderate\" (actually extremist) wing of the Republican Party. In the center we have so-called \"indepe ndent\" John Anderson, who in fact receives heavy financial support from the elite. IV. THE CREATION OF WAR AND REVOLUTION This manipulation of \"left\" and \"right on the domestic fr ont is duplicated in the international field where \"left\" and \"right\" political structures are artificially construc ted and collapsed in the drive for a one-world synthesis. College textbooks present war and revolution as more or less accidental results of conflicting forces. The decay of political negotiation into physical conflict comes about, according to these books, after valiant efforts to avoid war. Unfortunately, this is nonsense. War is al ways a deliberate creative act by individuals. Western textbooks also have gigantic gaps. For example, after World War II the Tribunals set up to investigate Nazi war criminals were careful to censor any materials re cording Western assistance to Hitler. By the same token, Western textbooks on Soviet economic development omit any description of the economic and financial aid given to the 1917 Revolution and subsequent economic development by Western firms and banks. Revolution is always recorded as a spontaneous event by the politically or economically deprived against an autocratic state. Never in Western textbooks will you find the evidence th at revolutions need finance and the source of the finance in many cases traces back to Wall Street. Consequently it can be argued that ou r Western history is every bit as distor ted, censored, and largely useless as that of Hitler's Germany or the Soviet Union or Communi st China. No Western foundation will award grants to investigate such topics, few Western academics can \"survive\" by researching such theses and certainly no major publisher will easily accept manuscripts reflecting such arguments. In fact, there is another largely unrecorded history an d it tells a story quite different than our sanitized textbooks. It tells a story of the deliberate creation of war, the knowing finance of revolution to change governments, and the use of confli ct to create a New World Order. In the following Memorandum Number Two we will de scribe the operational vehicl es used to create two revolutions and one world conflict. Then, in Memoranda Thr ee and Four, we will explore thesis and antithesis in one major historical episode - the development and construc tion of the Soviet Union (thesis) and Hitler's Germany (antithesis),"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"In Memorandum Five we will explore the continuation of this dialectic c onflict into the la st few decades, specifically Angola and China today. We will show that th e purpose of The Order is to create a new synthesis, a New World Order along Hegelian lines where the State is the Absolute and the individual can find freedom only in blind obedience to the State. Memorandum Number Two: Operational Vehicles For Conflict Creation I. A UNIVERSAL MIND SET Our first task is to break an almost universally held mind set, i.e., that commun ists and elitist capitalists are bitter enemies. This Marxist axiom is a false statement and for a century has fooled academics and in- vestigators alike. To illustrate this mind set, let's look at a report on revolutionaries in the U.S. compiled by the respected Scotland Yard (London) in 1919. London police investig ators were then tracking the Bolshevik Revolution and attempting to identify its Western supporters. When it came to men with long beards and even longer overcoats, most police departments had no problem - they looked like revolutionarie s, therefore, they must be revolutionaries. But when it came to respectable black-suited bankers, Scotland Yard was unable to rise above its mind set and recognize that bankers might equally be revolutionaries. Witness this extract from a Scotland Yard Intelligence Report. l \"Martens is very much in the limelight. There appears to be no doubt about his connection with the Guarantee (sic) Trust Company. Although it is surprising that so large and influential an enterprise should have dealings with a Bolshevik concern.\" Scotland Yard had picked up an accurate report th at the Soviets were deeply involved with Guaranty Trust of New York, but they couldn't believe it , and dropped this line of investigation. Even today the FBI has a similar mind set. For example, David Rockefeller has met regularly with a KGB agent in the United States - weekly lunch meetings is a close description. Yet the FBI presumably can't bring itself to investigate David Rockefeller as a potential Soviet agent, but if Joe Smith of Hoboken, N.J. was lunching weekly with the KGB, you can be sure the FBI would be on his tail. And, of course, our domestic U.S. Marxists find it absolutely inconceiva ble that a capitalist would support communism. Organizations like Scotland Yard and the FBI, and al most all academics on whom investigators rely for their guidelines, have a highly important failing: they look at known verifiable historical facts with a mind set. They convince themselves that they have the explanation of a problem even before the problem presents itself. The key to modern history is in these facts: that elitists have close working relations with both Marxists and Nazis . The only questions are who and why? The co mmon reaction is to reject these facts. 1 A copy is in U.S. State Department Decimal File, Microcopy 316, Roll 22, Frame 656. On the other hand, national security alone demands that we face these unwelcome relations before any more damage is done to our way of life. In this memorandum we will present the concept that world history, certainly since about 1917, reflects deliberately created conflict with the objective of bringing about a synthesis, a New World Order. The operation actually began before 1917. In later volum es we will explore the Spanish-American War and the Anglo-Boer War of 1899. The first was created by The Order, i.e., the U.S. elite, and the second by \"The Group,\" i.e., the British elite (with some U.S. assistan ce). We might aptly term these the First and Second Hegelian Wars, but this is another story. In this volume we are limited to the rise of Hitler in Germany and the rise of the Marxist state in the Sovi et Union. The clash between these two powers or the political systems they represent was a major source of World War II."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"After World War II the world stage was changed. After 1945 it became the Soviet Union on one side versus the United States on the other. The first dialectical clash led to the formation of the United Nations, an elementary step on the road to world government. The second dialectical clash led to the Trilateral Commission, i.e., regional groupings and more subtly to efforts for a merger of the United States and the Soviet Union. In Introduction To The Order we - established the existence of a secret society, The Order. We are now going to demonstrate how The Order created and developed two global arms needed for Hegelian conflict. Since 1917 the operational vehicles for this global battle have been: (a) Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the same firm cited in the 1919 Scotland Yard report, and (b) Brown Brothers, Harriman, private bankers of New York. Before 1933 Brown Brothers, Harriman consisted of two firms: W.A. Harriman Company and Br own Brothers. Numerous members of The Order have been in both firms, but one individual stands out above all others as the key to the operation of The Order: W. Averell Harriman (The Order ' 13) . "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" D. W. AVERELL HARRIMAN (THE ORDER'13) 1 The name William Averell Harriman turn s up behind world political scenes more frequently than any other member of The Order. Possibly as because Harriman is a remarkably active man. Bo rn in 1891, graduated Yale 1913, Harriman is still newsworthy in the 1980s. In Ju ne 1983 Harriman had a private meeting with Yuri Andropov in Moscow and in December 1983, at 92, broke hi s right leg while swimming in the sea off Barbados. Whatever else we say here about Averell, we must record his truly remarkable energy and longevity. In official Harriman biographies, however, there is no mention of The Order, Skull & Bones, or the Russell Trust. Like other initiates Harriman has carefully expung ed membership from the public record. We have not yet determined if this membership wa s ever made known to the FBI for use in background checks needed for government positions, or maybe no one ever bothered to ask for a background check on Averell Harriman. To understand Averell Harriman we need to go back to his father, Edward H. Harriman, the 19th century \"robber baron.\" Edward Harriman' s biography (E.H. Harriman: A Biography) is as self-serving as all hired biographies. It was written by George Kennan (published by Houghton Mifflin in 1922) who was active in the Dean Acheson State Department. The author of the famo us - some say infamous - National Security Council document 68 was none other than George Kennan. (See page 175) Edward Harriman started work at 14 with little education, but married Mary Averell, daughter of a New York banker and railroad president. At 22, Harriman bo ught a seat on the New Yo rk Stock Exchange and got lucky or smart with Union Pacific after the crash of 1893. Even the widely accepted Dictionary of American Biography states that Harriman was subsequently guilty of a combination in restraint of trade (1904 Northern Securi ties case), that his dubious financial activities netted him $60 million in a manner which led to investigation by the Interstate Commer ce Commission. This source cites Harriman as .. an example of how a road may be drained of its resources for the benefit of insiders.\" Harriman printed securities with a nominal value of $ 80 million to expand capitalization of his railroads. On the other hand, Harriman neglected to acquire improvemen ts and property for more than $18 million. In other words, $60 million of the securities was water, mostly sold through Kuhn Loeb & Co., his backers and bankers. The $60 million went in to Harriman's pocket. 1 Names of Brown Brothers, Haniman partners in 1972 were included in Introduction To The Drder, pages 20-21. About 100 Harriman r elated documents from the 1920s may be found in U.S. State Department Decimal File, Microcopy 316, Roll 138 (861.6364-6461). The 1904 ICC report stated: \"It was admitted by Mr. Harriman that there was abou t $60 million of stock and liabilities issued, against which no property had been acquired and this is undoubtedly an accurate estimate.\" 1 In brief, Mr. Edward H. Harriman was apparently a thief, a crook, and a felon, because fraudulent conversion of $60 million is a felony. Harriman stayed out of jail by judici ous expenditures to politicians and political parties. Biographer Ge orge Kennan relates how Harriman responded to President Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 plea for $250,000 for the Republican National Committee. 2 These funds were turned over to the Committee by Harriman's friend and attorney, Judge Robert Scott Lovett. Lovett was also general counsel for the Union Pa cific Railroad and could be described as Harriman's bagman. Judge Lovett's son, Robert Abercrombie Lovett (The Order '18) went to Yale and with the two Harriman boys, Roland and Averell, was initiated in to The Order. We shall catch up again with Robert Abercrombie Lovett in the 1950s as Secretary of Defe nse, partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman, and a key force to have President Harry Truman recall General Douglas MacArthur from Korea. By itself the Lovett family is incidental. When we link it to the Harriman family we have an example of how these families help each other along the way for a common objective. In any event, $250,000 hardly changed Theodore Roos evelt's view of Harriman. Two years after the gift, Roosevelt wrote Senator Sherman and described Harrim an as a man of \"deep seated corruption,\" an \"undesirable citizen\" and \"an enemy of the Republic.\" 3 Another description of Averell Harriman's father is in Concise Dictionary Of National Biography (page 402) : \"Self confident, dominant, cold and ruthless, he spared neither friend nor foe if they blocked his plans.\""},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Now we cannot visit the sins of the father onto his sons, but we should keep this background in mind when we look at the careers of the Harriman boys, Averell and Roland. At least we have reasons to probe behind the public relations facade and perhaps suspect the worst. 1 Gustavus Myers.

Superficially, Averell Harr i man's life has been quite different than his fathers Here's an official summary of Averell Harriman's long career: • Married three times - (1) 1915 Kitty Lanier Lawrence (2) 1930 Marie Norton Whitney 4 (3) 1971 Pamela Churchill Hayward 5 • Groton Prep School, then Yale.

Morgan voting trust in 1912 4 For Marie Norton Whitney, see Volume One, p 29 The Order, p. 29. 5 Pamela Hayward was formerly married to Randolph Churchill, thus linking Harriman to the British establishment. • 1920 established W.A. Harriman Company, with his brother Roland as Vice-President • 1923 formed Georgian Manganese Company"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"• 1933 W.A.

But in fact hi s writings suggest he is either rather stupid or one of the most deceptive men ever to walk the face of our earth. Let's take one example: an article written by Averell Harriman, published in Look. October 3, 1967 and entitled \"From Stalin to Kosygin: the myths and the realities.\" Here are two extracts: (1) \"Therefore in the early twenties my firm participated in credits to finance trade with Russia. We found as others did that the new government was most meticulous in meeting its financial commitments.\" In fact, the Soviets expropriated the concessions of the 1920s including Harr iman's, usually without reimbursement. Harriman was double-crossed by the Soviets in his Georgian manganese concession, then persuaded to take $3 million in Soviet bonds as compensation. (See documents printed on pages 154-155). This Soviet \"c ompensation\" in effect put Harriman in a position of making the first U.S. loan to Russia, so br eaching United States law against such loans. But this is what Harriman told John B. Stetson, Jr. of the State Departme nt (861.637-Harriman) \"Mr. Harriman said that they expect to drop about three milli on dollars which they would charge off to experience.\" This, Harriman calls \"most meticulous in meeting its financial obligations.\" (2) \"On the Russian side, one of the mo st troublesome myths is that Americ a is run by a `ruling circle,' made up of Wall Streeters and industrialists who have an interest in continuing the cold war and the arms race to prop up the 'capitalist' economy. Anybody who knows American politics knows what nonsense this is.\" Unfortunately, the Ru ssians are largely right on the political aspects of this one. In making the above statement Harriman not only confir ms Russian paranoia, i.e., that capitalists can't be trusted to tell the truth, but also deceives the American reading audience in Look that they do, in fact, have a participation in running political affairs. Compare th is paragraph to this series on The Order and you will see the devious way the Harriman mind works, perhaps not so different than Harriman senior. The previously described official Harriman biography suggests that Harriman, given his decades on the political inside, must be well aware of the dependence of the Soviet Union on Western technology: that the Soviet Union can make no economic progress without West ern enterprise technology. In fact, Stalin himself told Harriman as much back in 1944. Here's an extract from a report by Ambassador Harriman in Moscow to the State Department, dated June 30, 1944:"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"\"Stalin paid tribute to the assistance rendered by the United States to Soviet industry before and during the war. He said that about two-thirds of all the large industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union had been built with United States help or technical assistance.\" 1 Stalin could have added that the other one-third of Soviet industry had been built by British, German, French, Italian, Finnish, Czech and Japanese companies. In brief, Harriman knew first hand back in 1944 at least that the West had built the Soviet Union. Now examine Harriman's official biography with its string of appointments relating to. NATO, Mutual Security Agency, State Departme nt, foreign policy, and so on. In these pos ts Harriman actively pushed for a military build-up of the United States. But if the Soviet Union wa s seen to be an enemy in 1947, then we had no need to build a massive defense. 'Original in U.S. State Department Decimal File 033.1161 Johnston Eric/6-3044 Telegram June 30. 1944. What we should have done was cu t off technology. There was no Sovi et technology - and HARRIMAN KNEW THERE WAS NO SOVIET TECHNOLOGY. Furthermore, Harriman has been in the forefront of th e cry for \"more trade\" with the Soviet Union - and trade is the transfer vehicle for te chnology. In other words, Harriman has been pushing two CONFLICTING POLICIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. (a) a build-up of Soviet power by export of our technology, and (b) a Western defense against that power. Isn't this the Hegelian dialectic? Thesis versus antithesis , then conflict which leads to a new synthesis. In the following memoranda we will show how Harriman and his fe llows in the Brotherhood of Power went about this program of conflict creation. Moreover, Harriman is understandably highly sensitiv e when challenged on his pious \"I am always right about the Soviets\" attitude. One memorable occasion wa s back in 1971 when author Edward (Teddy) Weintal was at a dinner party with Harriman when Harriman trotted out his well worn line: \"I was the first to warn of Soviet dangers....” Weintal stopped him cold. In research for a book, We intal had found documents incriminating Harriman in the National Archives (similar to those reproduced later in this book). In particular, Weintal cited a State Department telegram da ted February 12, 1944 from Harrima n to Roosevelt. Said Weintal, \"You told Roosevelt that you were convinced that the Soviets did not want to introduce a Communist government into Poland.\" So up jumped 79-year-old Harriman from the dinner tabl e and waved his fists at 70-year-old Weintal. Shouted Harriman, \"If you print anything like that in your book, I'll break your jaw.\" Reportedly, the agitated host separa ted the two men, but not before a Washington Post reporter noted the details (See Washington Post, March 17, 1971, VIP Column by Maxine Cheshire). III. THE GUARANTY TRUST COMPANY Guaranty Trust was founded 1864 in New York. Over the next 100 years the banking firm expanded rapidly by absorbing other banks and trust companies; in 1910 it merged Morton Trust Company, in 1912 the Standard Trust Company, and in 1929 the National Bank of Commer ce. The J.P. Morgan firm has effectively controlled Guaranty Trust since 1912 when Mrs. Edward Harriman (mother of Roland and Averell Harriman) sold her block of 8,000 shares of the total outstanding 20,000 shares to J.P. Morgan. By 1954 Guaranty Trust had become the most important banking subsidiary of the J.P. Morgan firm and since 1954 the merged firms have been known as Morgan-Guaranty Company. The original capital for Guaranty Trust came from the Whitney, Rockefeller, Harriman and Vanderbilt families, all represented in The Order, and on the Boar d of Guaranty Trust by family members throughout the period we are discussing. Harry Payne Whitney (The Order'94) inherited two Standard Oil fortunes from the Payne and the Whitney families. H.P. Whitney was a director of Guaranty Trust, as was his father, William C. Whitney (The Order '63). Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (The Order '99) represented the Vanderbilt family until he drowned at sea in the sinking of the Lusitania :n 1915. (His si ster Gertrude married Harry Payne Whitney, above). The power of The Order is reflected in a bizarre incident as Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt boarded the Lusitania in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"New York on its fateful voyage. A telegram warning Va nderbilt not to sail was delivered to the Lusitania before it sailed - but never reached Vanderbilt. Consequently, Vanderbilt went down with the ship. The Harriman investment in Guaranty Trust ha s been represented by W. Averell Harriman. The Rockefeller investment in Guaranty Trust was represented by Percy Rockefeller (The Order '00). In brief, The Order was closely associated with Guaranty Trust and Morgan-Guaranty long before 1912 when Mrs. Edward Harriman sold her interest to J.P. Morgan. Averell Harriman remained on the Board of Guaranty Trust after the transfer. The following member s of The Order have also been officers and directors of Guaranty Trust Company: Harold Stanley (The Order 1908): Harold Stanley, born 1885, was the son of William Stanley, an inventor associated with General Electric Company. Stanley prep ared for Yale University at the elitist Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Connecticut. An excellent athlete, St anley graduated Yale in 1908 and was initiated into The Order. After Yale, Stanley joined National Bank of Albany and then, between 1913-1915, was with J.G. White (prominent in construction of the Soviet First Five Year Plan). In 1915 Stanley joined Guaranty Trust as Vice President. From 1921 to 1928 he was President of Guar anty Trust and then a partner in the firm of J.P. Morgan, replacing William Morrow. From 1935 to 1941 he was President of Morgan, Stanley & Company, then a partner from 1941 to 1955 and a limited partner after 1956, until his death in 1963. In brief, a member of The Order was Vice President, then President of Guaranty Trust Company in the years 1915 to 1928 - the years which record the Bolshe vik Revolution and the rise of Hitler to power in Germany. Joseph R. Swan (The Order '02). The Guaranty Company was a subsidiary of Guaranty Trust Co. Joseph Rockwell Swan (The Order '02) was President of the Guaranty Company as well as a director of Guaranty Trust Company. Percy Rockefeller (The Order '00) . Percy Rockefeller, born 1878, was the son of William D. Rockefeller (brother of John D. Rockefeller) and inherited part of the Standard Oil fortune. Percy was a director of Guaranty Trust in the 1915-1930 period.

BROWN BROTHERS, HARRIMAN The other operational vehicle used by The Order was the private banking firm of Brown Brothers, Harriman. Before 1933 W.A. Harriman Company was the vehicle, and Brown Brothers did not enter the picture. After 1933, the merged firm co ntinued Harriman Company activities. In Introduction To The Order we presented details of the merg ed firm (pp. 29-33). There is, however, one aspect we want to identify: the extraordinary role of the Yale Class of '17 in Brown Brothers, Harriman and the events to be described in Memoranda Three and Four. The following five members in the class of '17 (only fifteen were initiated) were involved: Knight Woolley (The Order '17) was with Guaran ty Trust from 1919-1920, Harriman Company from 1927-1931, then Brown Brothers, Harriman from 1933 to th e present time. Woolley was also a director of the Federal Reserve Bank. Frank P. Shepard (The Order '17) also joined Guaran ty Trust in 1919 and was a Vice President from 1920 to 1934, the period concerned with development of both Soviet Russia and Hitler's Nazi Party. From 1934 onwards Shepard was with Bankers Trust Company, a member of the Morgan group of banks. Ellery Sedgewick James (The Order '17) was a partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman. And finally, two interesting charac ters: Edward Roland Noel Harriman (The Order '17) and Sheldon Prescott Bush (The Order '17), the father of President George Herbert Walker Bush (The Order '49), and grandfather of President George Walker Bush (The Order '68). V. THE ORDER'S \"FRONT MAN\": MATTHEW C. BRUSH From World War I until well into the 1930s The Order's \"front man\" in both Guaranty Trust and Brown Brothers, Harriman was Matthew C. Brush. Brush was not Yale, nor a member of The Order, bu t through an accidental meeting in the 1890s his talents were used by The Order. Brush became a Knight Templar, a 32nd degree Mason and a Shriner, but not - so far as we can trace - more closely linked to the power center. Brush was born in Stillwater, Minnesota in 1877 and was a graduate of the Armour Institute of Technology and MIT. By accident his first job in the 1890s was as a clerk wi th Franklin MacVeagh & Company of Chicago. Franklin MacVeagh was a member (The Order '62) and later Secretary of the Treasury (1909-1913) under President Wi lliam Taft (The Order '78). MacVeagh himself, as distinct from Brush, is a little difficult to classify. In 1913 MacVeagh left the Treasury and resigned as trustee of the University of Ch icago. By 1919 he had become delinquent in his fees to Russell Trust. We have a copy of a dunning notice se nt to MacVeagh by Otto Bannard (The Order '76), President of New York Life and Treasurer for The Order in 1919. The notice asked MacVeagh to pay up his dues."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"While the trail of MacVeagh fades out after 1913, that of Matthew Brush, his one-time clerk, blossoms forth. After a series of posts in ra ilroad companies, Brush was made Vice President of American International Corporation in 1918 and President in 1923. He was al so Chairman of the Equi table Office Building, also known as 120 Broadway, illustrated on page 139. Moreover, Brush was President of Barnsdall Cor poration and Georgian Manganese Company; the significance of these posts will be seen in the next memorandum. The purpose of this memorandum has been to demonstrate control of two banking houses by members of The Order. Both Guaranty Trust and Brown Brothers, Harri man can truly be said to have been dominated and substantially owned by individuals identified as members. Furthermore, both Guaranty Trust and the original W.A. Harriman Company were established by members of The Order. Brown Brothers was not absorbed until 1933. Now, let's examine the evidence that these two banking firms have been vehicles for creation of war and revolution. Memorandum Number Three: Thesis – The Order Creates The Soviet Union In an earlier book, published in 1974, we presente d major evidence of Wall Street assistance for the Bolshevik Revolution. This assistance was mainly ca sh, guns and ammunition, and diplomatic support in London and Washington, D.C. Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution also introduced the concept which Quigley described, i.e., that Morgan and other financial in terests financed and influenced all parties from left to right in the political spectrum. This Memorandum continues the story, but now links The Order to the earlier evidence of Wall Street involvement. On the following pages we reproduce a map of the Wall Street area and a list of firms connected with the Bolshevik Revolution and financing of Hitler located in this area. We can now identify the influence, in fact the dominant influence, of The Order in these firms. Revolutionary activity was centered at Equitable Tr ust Building, 120 Broadway, in the building in the photograph on page 139. This had been E.H. Harriman's address. The Amer ican International Corporation was located at 120 Broadway. The Bankers' Club, where Wall St reet bankers met for lunch, was at the very top of the building. It was in this plush club that plans were laid by William Boyce Thompson for Wall Street participation in the 1917 Russian Revolution. Guaranty Se curities was in 120 Broadway, while Guaranty Trust was next door at 140 Broadway (the buildi ng can be seen to the left of 120). I. THE ORDER PUSHES FOR ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET ARMY Fortunately we have a copy of the memorandum writte n by a member of The Orde r, summarizing intentions for the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The memorandum was written by Thomas D. Th acher (The Order'04), a partner in the Wall Street law firm of Simpson, Thac her & Bartlett. Thacher's ad dress was 120 Broadway. Today this law firm, now in Battery Plaza, has the largest billing on Wall Street and has former Secretar y of State Cyrus Vance (Scroll & Key) as a partner. In 1917 Thacher was in Russia with William Boyce Thom pson's Red Cross Mission. After consultations in New York, Thacher was then sent to London to confer with Lord Northcliffe about the Bolshevik Revolution and then to Paris for similar ta lks with the French Government. The Thacher memorandum not only urges recognition of the barely surviving Soviet Government, which in early 1918 controlled only a very small portion of Russia, bu t also military assistance for the Soviet Army and intervention to keep the Japanese out of Si beria until the Bolsheviks could take over.

In the second place, the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet Go vernment in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary army. Thirdl y, the Allied Governments should give their moral support to the Russian people in their efforts to work ou t their own political systems free fr om the domination of any foreign power ... Fourthly, until the time when open confli ct shall result between the German Government and the Soviet Government of Russia there will be oppo rtunity for peaceful commercial penetration by German agencies in Russia. So long as there is no op en break, it will probably be impossible to entirely prevent such commerce. Steps should therefore be taken to impede, so far as possible, the transport of grain and raw materials to Germany from Russia.\" 1 The reader should note in particular paragraph two: \"In the second plac e, the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet Government in its efforts to organi ze a volunteer revolutionary army.\" This assistance has been recorded in my National Suicide: Military Aid To The Soviet Union. It was in fact the hidden policy adopted at the highest levels, in absolute secrecy, by the United States and to some extent by The Group (especially Milner) in Grea t Britain. Thacher apparent ly did not have too much success with the French Government. When President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops to hol d the Trans-Siberian railroad, secret instructions were given by Woodrow Wilson in person to General William S. Graves . We have not yet located these instructions (although we k'now they exist), but a close reading of the available files shows that American intervention had little to do with an ti-Bolshevik activity, as the Soviet s, George Kennan and other writers maintain. So grateful were the Soviet s for American assistance in the Revoluti on that in 1920 - when the last American troops left Vladivostok - the Bolshevi ks gave them a friendly farewell.

This is one report that got through intact. In fact, the United States took over and held the Siberian Railroad until the Soviets gained sufficient power to take it over. Both British and French mili tary missions in Siberia recorded the extraordinary actions of the United States Army, but neither mi ssion made much headway with its own government. So far as aiding the Soviet Army is concerned, th ere are State Department re cords that show guns and ammunition were shipped to the Bolsheviks.

THE ORDER PUSHES FOR THE SOVIETS IN THE UNITED STATES However, it was in Washington and London that The Order really aided the Soviets. The Order succeeded not only in preventing military actions agains t the Bolsheviks, but to so-muddy the po licy waters that much needed vital raw materials and goods, ultimately even loans, were able to flow from the United States to the Soviets, in spite of a legal ban. The following documents illustrate how members of The Order were able to encourage Soviet ambitions in the United States. While the Department of Justice was deporting so-called \"Reds\" to Russia, a much more potent force was at work WITHIN the U.S. Government to k eep the fledgling Soviet Union intact.

As we have noted, the United States intervened in Siberia along the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Histories of U.S. Intervention by George Kennan and the Soviets maintain this was an anti-Soviet intervention. In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The U.S. spread troops along the Si berian railroad only to keep out the Japanese, not to keep out the Soviets. When they left through Vladivostok, the Soviet authorities gave American forces a resounding send-off. But this is yet another untold story, not in the textbooks. The immediate problem facing the Soviets was to restore silent Russian factories. This needed raw materials, technical skills and working capital. The key to Russian reconstruction was the oil fields of the Caucasus. The Caucasus oil fields are a major segment of Russian natural resource wealth. Baku, the most important field, was developed n the 1870s. In 1900 it was producing more crude oil than the United States , and in 1901 more than half of the total world crude output. The Caucasus oil fields survived Revolution and Intervention without major structural da mage and became a significant factor in Soviet"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"economic recovery, generating about 20 percent of all exports by value; the largest single source of foreign exchange. The Bolsheviks took over the Cauc asus in 1920-1, but until 1923 oil field drilling almost ceased. During the first year of Soviet rule \". . . not one single new well has started giving oil\" and even two years after Soviet occupation, no new oil-field properties had been developed. In addition, deepening of old wells virtually ceased. As a result, water percolated into the we lls, and the flow of crude oil became a mixture of oil and water. Drilling records are an excellent indicator of the state of oil field main tenance, development, and production. The complete collapse after the Soviet takeover is clearly suggested by the statistics. In :900, Russia had been the world's largest producer and exporter of crude oil; almost 50,000 feet of drilling per month had been required in Baku alone to maintain this production. By earl y 1921, the average monthly drilling in Baku had declined to an insignificant 370 feet or so ,0.7 percent of the 1900 rate), although 162 rigs were in working order. Then, Serebrovsky, Chairman of Azneft (the Soviet oil production trust), put forward a program for recovery in a Prauda article. Th e plan :or 1923 was to increase oil well drilling to 35,000 Sazhens per year 245,000 feet). This would require 35 rotary drills (to drill 77,000 feet) and 157 percussion drills (to drill 130,000 feet). Serebrovsky pointed out that Azneft had no rotary drills, and that Russian enterprise could not supply them. Rotary drilling, however, was essential fo r the success of the plan. 1 U.S. State Dept. Decimal File, 316-137-221. He then announced: \"But just here American capital is going to suppo rt us. The American firm International Barnsdall Corporation has submitted a plan ... Lack of equipment prevents us from increasing the production of the oil industry of Baku by oursel ves. The American firm . . . will pr ovide the equipment, start drilling in the oil fields and organize the technical production of oil with deep pumps.\" 1 During the next few years International Barnsdall, together with the Lucey Manufacturing Company and other major foreign oil well equipment firms, fulfilled Serebrovsky's program. Massive imports of equipment came from the United States. International Barnsdall in augurated the rotary drilling program, initiated Azneft drilling crews into its operational problems, and reorganized oil well pumping with deep well electrical pumps. The first International Barnsdall co ncession was signed in October 1921, and was followed in September of 1922 by two further agreemen ts. There is no doubt that Barnsdall di d work under the agreements. Prauda reported groups of American oil field workers on thei r way to the oil fields, and a couple of months previously the United States, Constantinople Consulate, had reported that Philip Chadbourn, the Barnsdall Caucasus representative, had passed through on his way out of Russia. The U.S. State Department Archives contain an intriguing quotation from Rykov, dated October 1922: \"The one comparatively bright spot in Russia is the petroleum industry, and this is due largely to the fact that a number of American workers have been brought into the oil fields to superintend their operation.\" 2 Who, or what, was International Barnsdall Corporation? The Chairman of International Barnsdall Corporation was Matthew C. Brush whom we previously identified as The Order's \"front man.\" Guaranty Trust, Lee, Higginson Company and W.A. Harriman owned Barnsdall Corporation, and International Barnsdall Corporation was owned 75 % by the Barnsdall Corporati on and 25% by H. Mason Day. The Guaranty Trust interest was represented by Euge ne W. Stetson (also a Vice President of Guaranty Trust), whose son, Eugene W. Stetson Jr., was initiate d into The Order in 1934. The Lee Higginson interest was represented by Frederick Winthrop Allen (The Order '00). 1 Prauda, September 21, 1922. 2 U.S. State Department Decimal File, Microcopy 316, Roll 107, Frame 1167. In brief, The Order controlled In ternational Barnsdall Corporation."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" The second potentially largest source of Soviet fo reign exchange in the 1920s was the large Russian manganese deposits. In 1913, tsarist Russia supplied 52 percent of world manganese, of which about 76 per- cent, or one million tons, was mined from the Chiaturi deposits in the Caucasus. Production in 1920 was zero, and by 1924 had risen only to about 320,000 tons per year. The basic problem was: \"that further development was seri ously retarded by the primitive equipment, which was considered grossly inadequate even according to prewar standards.\" The Chiaturi deposits, situated on high plateaus some distance from Batum, were mined in a primitive manner, and the ore was brought on donkeys from the plateaus to the railroads. There was a change of gauge en route, and the manganese had to be transshipped between the original loading point and the port. When at the port, the ore was transferred by bucket: a slow, expensive process. The Soviets acquired modern mining and transportation facilities for their manganese deposits, acquired foreign exchange, and finally shattered American foreign policy concerning loans to the U.S.S.R., in a series of business agreements with W.A. Harriman Company and Guaranty Trust. l On July 12, 1925, a concession agreement was made between the W.A. Harriman Company of New York and the U.S.S.R. for exploitation of the Chiaturi mangane se deposits and extensive introduction of modern mining and transportation methods. Under the Harriman concession agreement, $4 million was spent on mechanizing the mines and converting them from hand to mechanical operation. A washer and reduction plant were built; and a loading Elevator at Poti, with a two-million ton capacity and a railroad system were constructed, together with an aerial tramway for the transfer of manganese ore. The expenditure was approximately $2 million for the railroad system and $1 million for mechanization of the mines. The Chairman of the Georgian Manganese Company, the Harriman operating company on the site in Russia, was none other than The Order's \"front man\" Matthew C. Brush. - The interested reader is referred to over 300 pages of documents in the U.S. State Dept. Decimal File 316-138-12/331, and the German Foreign Ministry Archives. Walter Duranty described the Harrimen contract as \"utterly inept\" and von Dirksen of the German Fore ign Office as \"a rubbe r contract.\" THE full contract was published [Vysshii sovet nardnogo kh oziaistva, Concession Agreement Between The Government Of The U.S.S.R and W.A.

THE ORDER TOO POWERFUL FOR STATE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE While The Order carried out its -plans to develop Russia, the State Department could do nothing. Its bureaucrats sat in Washington D.C. like a bunch of mesmerized jackrabbits. Firstly, in the 1920s loans to the Soviet Union were strictly against U.S. law. While American citizens could enter Russia at their own risk, there were no diplomat ic relations and no govern ment support or sanction for commercial activity. Public and government sentiment in the United States was overwhelmingly against the Soviets - not least for the widespread atrocities committed in the name of the Revolution. Secondly, the Harriman-Guaranty syndicate, which reflected The Order, did not inform the State Department of its plans. As the attached letter (pag e 152) from Washington to the London Embassy describes, the first information of the Harriman manganese deposit came from the American Embassy in London, which picked it up from London newspaper reports. In other words, Averell Harriman sn eaked an illegal project past the U.S. Government. If this is not irresponsible behavior, then nothing is. And this was the man who was later to become the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. The State Department letter to London is quite spec ific on this point: \"The memorandum transmitted by you embodies the first information received by the De partment concerning the concession other than that which has appeared in the public press.\""},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"A month or so later came a letter from Department of Commerce asking for confirmation and more information.

Yet this was clearly illegal and a move with obvious strategic conseq uences for the U.S. Neither was the U.S. Government able to pick up this information elsewhere; in thos e days there was no CIA. Econom ic intelligence was handled by the State Department. It is also obv ious that Government officials were interested in acquiring information, as they should have been. The truly extraordinary point is THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO PURSUE AN INVESTIGATION. We reproduce on page 155 a me morandum from Evan E. Young in Divi sion of Eastern European Affairs to Assistant Secretary of State Carr. Note this is a memorandum at the upper levels of the State Department. Young specifically writes: \". . . there are certain and very definite reasons why I consid er it very unwise for the Department to initiate any in vestigation with respect to th e reported manganese concession.\" And Assistant Secretary of State Carr scribbles on th e bottom, \"I defer to yo ur judgment upon this\" (presumably after the suggested oral communication). The distinct impression is that some behind -the-scenes power was not to be challenged. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" V. THE ORDER MAKES ITS OWN LAW The Order kept a hold on every non-government strategi c position related to the Soviet Union. Nothing appears to have escaped their atte ntion. For example, the Anglo-Russ ian Chamber of Commerce was created in 1920 to promote trade with Russia - desperately needed by the Soviets to restore idle Tsarist industry. The Chairman of its Executive Committee, the key post in the Chamber, was held by Samuel R. Bertron (The Order '85), a Vice President of Guaranty Trust and fo rmerly a member of the 1917 Root Mission to Russia. Elihu Root, Chairman of the Mission, was, of course, the personal attorn ey to William Collins Whitney (The Order '63), one of the key members of The Order. The letter from Bertron's Anglo-Russian Chamber of Com- merce to State Department, printed on page 158 is noteworthy because :: asks the question: \"What date trading in Russian credits was prohibited in the United Stat es by Federal authorities?\" This means that The Order was well aware in 1921 that \"c redits\" to the U.S.S.R. we re illegal and indeed were not made legal until President Roosevel t took office in 1933. However, illegal or not, within 18 months of this Bertron letter, Guaranty Trust established more than trad ing in Russian credits. Guaranty Trust made a joint banking agreement with the Soviets and installed a Guar anty Trust Vice President, Max May, as director in charge of the foreign division of this Soviet -Dank, the RUSKOMBANK (See document on page 157). In brief, while the U.S. pu blic was being assured by the U.S. Government that the Soviets were dastardly murderers, while \"Reds\" were being deported back to Russia by the Department of Justice, while every politician (almost without exce ption) was assuring the American public :hat the United States would have no relations with the Soviets - while th is barrage of lies was aimed at a gu llible public, behind the scenes the Guaranty Trust Company was actually running a division of a Soviet bank! And American troops were being cheered by Soviet revolutionaries for helping protect the Revolution. That, dear readers, is why governments need censorship. That's why even 50 years after some events, it is almost impossible for independent re searchers (not the bootlickers) to get key documents declassified. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" VI. THE ORDER'S LAW FIRMS New York establishment law firms, several founded by members of The Order, have close links to banks and specifically those operational ve hicles for revolution already cited. Take the example of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett which in the 1920s was located at 120 Broadway, New York. The firm was founded by Thomas Thacher (The Order '71) in 1884. His son Thomas Day Thacher (The Order '04) worked for the family law firm after leav ing Yale and initiation into The Order. The younger Thomas Thacher went to work for Henry L. Stimson (The Order'88), a very active member of The Order discussed in Volume One of this series. About this time Th a cher, who wrote The Order's statement on the Bolshevik Revolution (page 138), be came friendly with both Felix Frankfurter and Raymond Robins. According to extensive documentation in the Lusk Co mmittee files, both Frankfu rter and Robins were of considerable assistance to the Soviets. Another link between the 1917 Revolution and Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett is th rough the daughter of Thomas Anthony Thacher (The Order '35) who married William Kent (The Order '87) who we have linked to member Amos Pinchot in the case of interventi on on behalf of the Soviets in Washington, D.C."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Furthermore, readers of Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution will recall that member Samuel Bertron was on the Root Mission to Russia in 1917. Moreover, Thom as Thacher (The Order '04) was a member of the Red Cross Mission with Allan Wardwell, son of Thomas Wardwell, Standard Oil Treasurer and a partner in another Wall Street aw firm, Stat son, Jennings & Russell (the links of this firm to The Order will be described in a later volume). Eugene Stetson, Jr., for example, is ^. The Order ('34) . Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett represented the Soviet Stat e Bank in ::e U.S. and was the vehicle used by The Order to inform State Department of activities that might otherwise be blocked by low level b ureaucrats following the government rulebook. For example, in 1927 Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett informed the U.S. Government that the Soviets were in the process of substantially increasing deposits in the U.S. This increase was in preparation for the enormous outlays to be channeled to a few favored U.S. fi rms to build the Soviet First Five Year Plan. The letter read closely is definite; it puts words in th e mouth of the State Departme nt, i.e., this is what we are going to do and in spite of the U.S. Government, there is no reason why we should not go ahead. Note, for example, the last paragraph: \". . . it seems to us there is no reason why the Bank should not so increase its deposits notwithstanding our Government has not recognized the U.S.S.R.\" RUSSIA During the past four years the Government of the United States has maintained the position that it would be both futile and unwise to enter into relations with the Soviet Government so long as the Bolshevik leaders persist in aims and practices in the field of international relations which preclude the possibility of establishing relations on the basis of accepted principles governing intercourse between nations. It is the conviction of the Government of the United States that relations on a basis usual between friendly nations can not be established with a governmental entity which is the agency of a group who hold it as their mission to bring about the overthrow of the existing political, economic and social order throughout the world and who regulate their conduct towards other nations accordingly. The experiences of various European Governments which have recognized and entered into relations with the Soviet regime have demonstrated conclusively the wisdom of the policy to which the Government of the United States has consistently adhered. Recognition of the Soviet regime has not brought about any cessation of interference by the Bolshevik leaders in the internal affairs of any recognizing country, nor has it led to the acceptance by them of other fundamental obligations of international intercourse. Certain European states have endeavored, by entering into discussions with representatives of the Soviet regime, to reach a settlement of outstanding differences on the basis of accepted international practices. Such conferences and discussions have been entirely fruitless. No state has been able to obtain the payment of debts contracted by Russia under preceding governments or the indemnification of its citi zens for confiscated property. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that the granting of recognition and the holding of discussions have served only to encourage the present rulers of Russia in their policy of repudiation and confiscation, as well as in their hope that it is possible to establish a working basis, accepted by other nations, whereby they can continue their war on the existing political and social order in other countries. Current developments demonstrate the continued persistence at Moscow of a dominating world revolutionary purpose and the practical manifestation of this purpose in such ways as render impossible the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet government. The present rulers of Russia, while seeking to direct the evolution of Russia along political, economic and social lines in such manner as to make it an effective \"base of the world revolution\", continue to carry on, through the Communist International and other organizations with headquarters at Moscow, within the bo rders of other nations, including the United States, extensive and carefully planned operations for the purpose of ultimately bringing about the overthrow of the existing order n such nations. A mass of data with respect to the activities carried on in the United States by various Bolshevik organizations, under the direction and con trol of Moscow, was presented by the Department of State to a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in January 1924.

WHAT THE POLITICIAN S TOLD AMERICAN CITIZENS All this Soviet-building activity re corded in the Lusk Committee and St ate Department files was carefully concealed from the American public. What the public wa s told can only be described as a pack of lies, f rom beginning to end. To demonstrate the degree of falsehood, we reprint here a page on Russia\" from a document \"Excerpt from a statement entitled `Foreign Relations' by the Honorable Frank B. Kellogg, Secretary of State, published by the Republican National Committee, Bulletin No. 5, I928.\" Among the falsehoods promoted by Secretary Kellogg is the following: \". . . the Government of the United States has maintained the position that it would be both futile and unwise to enter into relations with t he Soviet Government.\" In fact, at this ver y time the United States, with implicit govern ment approval, was involved in planning the First Five Year Plan in Russia. The planning work was done actively by American firms. l Construction of the Soviet dialectic arm continued throughout the 1930s up to World War II. In 1941 W.A. Harriman was appointed Lend Lease Administrator to assure the flow of United States t echnology and products to the Soviet Union. Examination of- Lend -e ase records shows that U.S. law was violated. The law required military goods only to be shipped. In fact , industrial equipment in extraordinary amounts was also shipped and Treasury Department currency plates so that the Soviets could fr eely print U.S. dollars. Since World War II the United States has kept the Soviets abreast of modern technology. This story has been detailed elsewhere. In brief, the creation of the Soviet Union stems from The Order. The early survival of the Soviet Union stems from The Order. The development of the Soviet Union stems from The Order. But above all, this story has been concealed from th e American public --,\"politicians . . . more of this later. Now let's turn to the financing of the Nazi Party in Germany. 1 This story has been described in my We stern Technology And Soviet Economic Development 917-1930 and 1930-1945, published by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Memorandum Number Four: Antithesis - Financing The Nazis The Marxist version of the Hegelian di alectic poses financial capitalism as thesis and Marxist revolution as antithesis. An obvious puzzle in this Marxian statement is the nature of the synthesis presumed to evolve out of the clash of these opposites, i.e., the clash of financial capitalism and revolutionary Marxism. Lenin's statement that the State will wither away at the synthesis stage is nonsensical. In fact, as all contemporary Marxist states testify, the State in practice becomes all powerful. The immediate task of \"the revolution\" is to convey all power to the state, and mo dern Marxist states operate under a constant paranoia that power may indeed pass away from the hands of the State into the hands of the people. We suggest that world forces may be seen differently, although still i7, terms of the Hegelian dialectic. If Marxism is posed as the thesis and national socialism as antithesis, then the most likely synthesis becomes a Hegelian New World Order, a synthesis evolving out of the clash o: Marxis m and national socialism. Moreover, in this statement those who finance an d manage the clash of opposites can re main in control of the synthesis. If we can show that The Order has artificially enco uraged and developed both revolutionary Marxism and national socialism while retaining some control over the na ture and degree of the conflict, then it follows The Order will be able to determine the evolut ion and nature of th e New World Order."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" I. WHERE DID THE NAZIS GET THEIR FUNDS FOR REVOLUTION? In Wall Street And The Rise of Hitler we described several financial conduits between Wall Street and the Nazi Party. This was later supplemented by publication of a long suppressed book, Hitler's Secret Backers. l Still other books have emphasized the Fritz Thyssen financial connecti on to Hitler. After he split with Hitler, Thyssen himself wrote a book, I Paid Hitler. We are now in a position to me rge the evidence in these books with other material and our documentation on The Order.

WHO WAS THYSSEN\"? Fritz Thyssen was the German steel magnate who associated himself with the Nazi movement in the early '20s. When interrogated in 1945 under Project Dustbin, Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by General Ludendorf at the time of French evacuation of the Ruhr. Sh ortly after this meeting Thyssen was introduced to Hitler and provided funds for the Nazis through General Ludendorf. In 1930-31 Emil Kirdorf approached Thyssen and subsequently sent Rudolf Hess to negotiate further funding for the Nazi Party. This time Thyssen arrang ed a credit of 250,000 marks at the Ba nk Voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. (the Dutch name for the bank named by Thyssen in the attached document), at 18 Zuidblaak in Rotterdam, Holland. Thyssen was former head of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, The German 1 Wall Street And The Rise Of Hitler and Hitler's S ecret Backers are obtainable from Research Publications, P.O.

"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" steel trust, financed by Dillon Read (New York), and played a decisive role in the rise of Hitler to bower by contributing liberally to the Nazi Part y and by influencing his fellow industrialists to join him in support of the Fuehrer. In reward for his efforts, Thyssen was showered with political and economic favors by the Third Reich and enjoyed almost unlimited power and prestige under the Nazi regime unt il his break with Hitler in 1939 over the decision to invade Poland and precipitate the Second World War. This incident and Thyssen's subsequent publication, 1 Paid Hitler, has a parallel with the history of his father, August Thyssen. Through a similar c onfession in 1918 the elder Thyssen, desp ite his record as a staunch backer of pan-Germanism, succeeded in convincing the Allies that sole respon sibility for German aggression should be placed on the Kaiser and German indu strialists should not be blamed fo r the support they had given to the Hohenzollerns. Apparently influenced by August Thyssen and his as sociates, the Allies ma de no effort to"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"reform German industry after World War I. The result was that Thyssen was allowed to retain a vast industrial empire and pass it on intact to his heirs and successors. It was against this background that Fritz Thyssen took over control of the family holdings following the death of his father in 1926. The new German steel baron had already achieved fame throughout the Reich by his defiance of the French during their occupation of the Ru hr in 1923. Like Hitler, Thy ssen regarded the Treaty of Versailles as \"a pact of shame\" which must be overthrown if the Fatherland were to rise again This is the story in Hitler's Secret Backers. Thyssen set out along the same road as his father, aided by ample Wall Street loans to build German industry. August Thyssen had combined with Hugenbur g, Kirdorf, and the elder Krupp to promote the All- Deutscher Verband (the Pan-German League), which su pplied the rationale for the Kaiser's expansionist policies. His son became an active member of the Stahlhelm an d later, through Goring, joined the Nazis. Finally, after the crash of 1931 had brought German industry to the verge of bankruptcy, he openly embraced national socialism. During the next 2 years Thyssen dedicated his fortune and his influence to bring Hitler to power. In 1932 he arranged the famous meeting in the Dusseldorf Industrialists' Club, at which Hitler addressed the leading businessmen of the Ruhr and the Rhineland. At the close of Hitler's speech Thyssen cried, \"Heil Herr Hitler,\" while the others applauded enthusiastically. By the time of the German Presidential elections later that year, Thyssen obtained contributions to Hitler 's campaign fund from the industrial combines. He alone is reported to have spent 3,000,000 marks on the Nazis in the year 1932. III. THE UNION BANKING CONNECTION This flow of funds went through Thyssen banks. The Bank fur Handel and Schiff cited as the conduit in the U.S. Intelligence report was a subsidiary of the August Thyssen Bank, and founded in 1918 with H.J. •: Kouwenhoven and D.C. Schutte as ma naging partners. In brief, it was Thyssen's personal banking operation, and affiliated with the W.A. Harrima n financial interests in New York. Thyssen reported to his Project Dustbin interrogators that: \"I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed up with German banks in my position, and because I thought it was better to do business with a Dutch bank, and I thought I would have the Nazis a little more in my hands.\" H i tler's Secret Backers identifies the conduit from the U.S. as \"von Heydt,\" and von Heydt's Bank was the early name for Thyssen's Bank. Furthermore, the Thyssen front bank in Holland - i.e., the Bank voor -iandel en Scheepvaart N.V. - controlled the Union Banking Corporation in New York. The Harrimans had a financial interest in, and E. Roland Harriman The Order 1917), Averell's brother, was a director of this Union Bank n g Corporation. The Union Banking Corporation of New York City wa s a joint Thyssen-Harriman operation with the following directors in 1932: E. Roland Harriman Vice President of W.A. Harriman & Co., New York (The Order 1917) H.J. Kouwenhoven Nazi banker, managing partner of August Thyssen Bank and Bank (Nazi)  voor Handel Scheepvaart N.V. (the transfer bank for Thyssen's funds) Knight Wooley Direct or of Guaranty Trust, New York and Director Federal Reserve (The Order 1917) Bank of N. Y.

Look at the following: • Four directors of Union Banking are members of The Order: a:: initiated at Yale in 1917 - members of the same Yale class. A:: four were members of the same cell (club) D 115. • E. Harriman was the brother of W. Averell Harriman and a Vice-President of W.A.

V on Heydt was the intermediary between Guaranty Trust and Hitler named in Hitler's Secret Backer. • Ellery S. James and Prescott S. Bush were pa rtners in Brown Brothers, later Brown Brothers, Harriman. Out of eight directors of Thyssen's bank in New York , we can therefore identify six who are either Nazis or members of The Order. This private bank was formerly named Von Heydt Ba nk and von Heydt is named by Sharp in Hitler's Secret Backers as the intermediary from Gu aranty Trust in New York to Hitler between 1930 and 1933. Above all, remember that Shoup was writing in 1933 when this information was still only known to those on the inside. Out of tens of thousands of banks and bankers, Shoup, in 1933, names those that evidence surfacing decades later confirms as financing Hitler. In brief, when we merge the information in PROJECT DUSTBIN with Sh oup's Hitler's Secret Backers, we find the major overseas conduit for Nazi financing tr aces back to THE ORDER and specifically cell D 115 . IV. PROFIT FROM CONFLICT Out of war and revolution co me opportunities for profit. Conflict can be used for profit by corporations un der control and influence of The Order. In World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnamese War we can cite examples of American corporations that traded with \"the enemy\" for profit. This \"blood trade\" is by no means sporadic or limited to a few firms; it is general and reflects higher policy decisions and philosophies. Corporations - even large corporations - are dominated by banks and trust companies, and in turn these banks and trust companie s are dominated by The Order and its allies. (This will be the topic of a forthcoming volume). Although the U.S. did not officially go to war with Germany until 1941, legally, and certainly morally, the U.S. was at war with Nazi Germany after the Destroyer deal with Great Britain in December 1940, :.e., the exchange of 50 old U.S. destroyers for strategic bases in British territory. Even before December 1940 the MS \"Frederick S. Fales\" owned by Standard Vacuum Co mpany was sunk by a German submarine on September"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"21, 1940. Yet in 1941 Standard Oil of New Jersey (now EXXON) had six Standard Oil tankers under Panamanian registry, manned by Nazi officers to carry fuel oil from Standard Oil refineries to the Canary Islands, a refueling base of Nazi submarines. A report on this dated July 15, 1941 from Intelligence at Fifth Corps :n Columbus, Ohio is reproduced on page 172. The report is in error recording that no St andard Oil ships had been sunk by the Nazis; Major Burrows apparently did not know \"Frederick S. Fales\" in 1940. Another example of profit from war is recorded in the document on page 173. This records the association of RCA and the Nazis in World War II. RCA was essentia lly a Morgan-Rockefeller firm and so linked to The Order. Yet another example is that of Chase Bank. Chase wa s linked to The Order throu gh the Rockefeller family (Percy Rockefeller, The Order 1900) and Vice-President Reeve Schley (Yale, Scroll & Key). Directors of Chase in The Order included Frederick Allen (The Order 1900), W.E.S. Griswold (The Order 1899) and Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose brother Gwynne Vanderbilt (The Order 1899) represented the family before his death. President of Chase was Winthrop Aldrich. This was :he Harvard branch of the Aldrich family, another branch is Yale and The Order. Chase Manhattan Bank is not only a firm that plays both sides of the political fence, but with Ford Motor Company, was selected by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for post-war i nvestigation of pro-Nazi activities: These two situations [i.e., Ford and Chase Bank] convin ce us that it is imperative to investigate immediately on the spot the activities of subsidiari es of at least some of the larger American firms which were operating in France during German occupation . . . The extent of Chase collaboration with Nazis is staggering - and this was at a time when Nelson Rockefeller had an intelligence job in Washington aimed AGAINST Nazi operations in Latin America. In December 1944 Treasury Department officials examin ed the records of the Chase Bank in Paris. On December 20, 1944 the senior U.S. examiner sent a memorandum to Treasury Secret ary Morgenthau with the preliminary results of the Paris examinati on. Here's an extract from that report: "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" a. Niederman, of Swiss nationa lity, manager of Chase, Paris, was unquestionably a collaborator; b. The Chase Head Office in New York was informed of Niederman's collaborat ionist policy but took no steps to remove him. Indeed there is ample evid ence to show that the Head Office in New York viewed Niederman's good relations with the Germans as an excellent means of preserving, unimpaired, the position of the Chase Bank in France. c. The German authorities were anxious to keep the Chase open and indeed took exceptional measures to provide sources of revenue. d. The German authorities desired \"to be friends\" with the importa nt American banks because they expected that these banks would be useful after the war as an instrument of German policy in the United States. e. The Chase, Paris showed itself most anxious to pl ease the , German authorities in every possible way. For example, the Chase zealously maintained the a ccount of the German Embassy in Paris, \"as every little thing helps\" (to maintain the excellent rela tions between Chase and the German authorities). f. The whole objective of the Chase policy and op eration was to maintain the position of the bank at any cost. In brief, Chase Bank was a Nazi colla borator, but the above preliminary re port is as far as the investigation proceeded. The report was killed on orders from Washington, D.C.

As early as 1922 Chase was trying to export military LIBERTY aircraft engines to the Soviet Union! In conclusion, we have seen that the two arms of the dialectic described in Memoranda Three and Four clashed in World War II. Furthermore, the corporate segment of the elite profited from Lend Lease to the Soviets and by underground cooperation with Nazi interests. The political wing of The Or der was at the same time preparing a new dialectic fo r the post World War 11 era. Memorandum Number Five: The New Dialectic - Angola And China THE NECESSITY FOR A NEW DIALECTIC PROCESS World War II was the culmination of the dialecti c process created in the 1920s and 1930s. The clash between \"left\" and \"right,\" i.e., the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, led to creation of a synthesis - n otably the United Nations, and a start towards regional groupings in - :,e Common Market, COMECON, NATO, UNESCO, Warsaw Pact, SEATO, CENTO, and then the Trilateral Commission. A start towards New World Order. World War II left The Order with the necessity to create a new dialectical situation to promote more conflict to achieve a higher level synthesis. The source of the current process may be found in Na tional Security Memorandum No. 68 of 1950, with its extraordinary omissions (analyzed in The Phoenix Le tter, January 1984). NSC 68 opened up the road for Western technology to build a more advanced Soviet Union - which it did in the 1960s and 1970s with computerized space-age technology. At the same time NSC 68 presented the argument for massive expansion of U.S. defenses - on the grounds of a future Soviet threat . The omission in NSC 68 was quite elementary, i.e., that :he Soviets could not progress without Western technology. NSC 68 allowed that technol ogy transfer to go on. In other words, by allowing Western firms to expand the Soviet Union, NSC-68 also pari passu created the argument for a U.S. defens e budget. We identified in our 'Phoenix Letter article the link between NSC-68 and The Order. Unfortunately for The Order, but not surprisingly, give n their limited perception of the world, the dialectic plan based on NSC-68 misfired. The principal devices used to control the dialectic process in the past two decades have been (a) information, (b) debt and (c) tech nology. These have become d iluted over time. They just don't work as well today as they did in the 1950s. By and large, control of information has been successf ul. The intellectual world is still locked into a phony verbal battle between \"left\" and \"right,\" whereas the real struggle is the battle between individual freedom and the encroaching power of the absolute State. The Soviet Union, with its tight censors hip, presents a strictly Marxist (i.e., \"left\") orientation to its citizens. The enem y is always the \"fascist\" United States. The West is a little more complicated but not much more so. Quigley's argument in Tragedy And Hope, that J.P. Morgan used financial power to control politics, ha s been extended to The Order's contro l of information. In the West the choice is basically between a controlled \"left-orie nted\" information and a controlled \"right-oriented\" information. l The conflict between th e two controlled groups keeps an appa rent informational conflict alive. Unwelcome facts that fall into neither ca mp are conveniently forgotten. Books that fall into neither camp can be effectively neutralized because they will in cur the wrath of both \"right\" and \"left\". In brief, any publication which points up the fallacy of the Left-Right dichotomy is ignored ... and citizens keep trooping down to the polling booths in the belief they have a \"choice\". The second control mechanism is debt. If Marxist countries have to im port technology, they need to earn or borrow Western currencies to pay for it. Loans have to be repaid. So to some extent, debtors are under control of creditors, unless they default. Default is the weakness The third control mechanism is technology. If technology to advance to more efficient production levels has to be imported, then the recipien t is always kept away from the \"state of the art\". The weakness for The Order is that military technology does not require a market system. The dialectic plan therefore misfired fo r several reasons. Firstly, the info rmational blackout has not been as successful as The Order expected. We shall describe la ter how control of Time and Newsweek gave The Order dominance over weekly news summaries. The TV networks have been able to orchestrate viewer reactions - to"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"some extent For example, the thr ee ABC blockbusters in 1983 were The Day After. Thornbirds, and Winds Of War, all with a common propaganda theme But The Order was un able to restrict individuals and relatively small non-academic groups, almost always outside Universities, from expl oring obvious inconsistencies in establishment propaganda. These groups often mistakenly termed \"left\" or \"right\" are outside the generally manipulated left-right spectrum. Secondly, the debt weapon was over-used. Communist countries are now saturate d with debt to Western bankers. Thirdly, while technology is still a us eful weapon, there are distinct sti rrings among independent analysts of the danger posed for the Western world by building enemies. Consequently, in today's world we can identify two fact s in construction of a new di alectic. First, cautious reinforcement of the Marxian arm (the thesis presented in Memorandum Three), i.e., Marxist Angola gets a green light, but a Marxist Grenada got a red light. Second, the construction of a completely new arm, that of Communist China, itself Marxist, but with conflict potential for the Soviet Union. Major efforts by The Order are in progress, only partly revealed in the press, to create a new superpower in a conflict mode with the Soviet Union. This is the new antithesis, replacing Nazi Germany. 1 There are exceptions. Obviously Review Of The News, American Opinion and Reason are large outside the c ontrolled right' frame. To some extent the U.S. Labor Party is outside the left frame but includes so much spurious material that its publications are hardly worth reading. He nry George sit clear-cut left exception. THE ORDER CREATES A MARXIST ANGOLA Angola, a former Portuguese province on the southw est coast of Africa, is a contemporary example of continued, but more cautious, creation of the Marxist arm of the dialectic process. The official establishment view of Angola is that Angola was a Portug u ese colony and oppr essive Portuguese rule led to an independence movement in which the Marxists won out over \"democratic\" forces. This view cannot be supported. If th e Portuguese were colonists in Angola, then so are the Boston Brahmins in Massachusetts. Luanda, t he chief town in Angola, was settled by th e Portuguese in 1575 - th at's half a century before the Pilgrims landed in Ma ssachusetts. The in digenous population of Angola in 1575 was less than the Indian population of Massachusetts. Ov er three centuries the Portuguese tr eated Angola more as a province than as a colony, in contrast to British, French and Belg ian colonial rule in Africa. So if Angola belonged to non-existent indigenous natives, then so does Massa chusetts logically belong to American Indians. In the early 1960s the United States was actively aiding the Marxist cause in Angola. This is clear from former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. The following extracts are from a memorandum recording a conversation between Dean Acheson (Scroll & Key), McGeorge Bundy The Order '40), and President Kennedy dated April 2, 1962: \"He [Kennedy] then turned to the negotiations with Po rtugal over the Azores base. He said that not much seemed to be happening and that he would be grateful to have me take the matter over and see if something could be done. I asked him for permission to talk about the situation for a few minutes and said about the following: \"The Portuguese were deeply offended at what they believed was the desertion of them by the United States, if not the actual alignm ent of the United States with their enemies. The problem, it seemed to me, lay not so much in negotiations with the Portuguese as in the determination of United States policy. The ba ttle would be in Washington, rather than in Lisbon.\" Then Dean Acheson comments on a topic apparently already known -D President Kennedy, that the United States was supporting the revoluti onary -nary movements in Angola: \"The President then asked me why I was so sure that there was no room for negotiations under the present conditions. I said that, as he perhaps knew, we had in fact been subsidizing Portugal's enemies; and that they strongly suspected this, although they could not prove it. He said that the purpose of this was to try to keep the Angolan nationalist movement out of the hands of the communist Ghanians, etc., and keep it in the most moderate hands possible. I said that I quite understood this, but that it did not make what the Portuguese suspected any more palatable to them. We were also engaged in smuggling Angolese out of Angola and educating them in Lincoln College outside o• Philadelphia in the most extreme nationalist views. Furthermore the head of this college had secretly and illegally entered An gola and on his return had engaged in violent anti-Portuguese propaganda. We voted in the United Nations for resolutions \"condemning\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Portugal for maintaining order in territory unquestiona bly under Portuguese sovere ignty. I pointed out that the Portuguese were a proud people, especially sensitive because they had declined to such an impotent position after such a glorious history. They would rather proceed to the ruin of their empire in a dignified way, as they had in Goa, than be bought or whee dled into cooperating in their own destruction.\" There is an extremely important, although seemin gly minor, point in Presid ent Kennedy's comments. Kennedy apparently believed the U.S. was financing Nati onalists, not Marxists, wherea s the U.S. was actually aiding Marxists, as it was later to do in South Africa, following a pattern going back to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. There is a point well worth following up in the Kennedy files, i.e., just how much Ken- nedy knew about CIA and State Department operations, where The Order was in control. The Marxists under Neto's MPLA obtained control of Angola. The Order with powerful allies among multinational corporations has exerte d pressure on successive Administra tions to keep Angola as a Cuban- Soviet base in Southern Africa. Back in 1975 the U.S. in conjunction with South Africa did indeed make a military drive into Angola. At a crucial point, when South African forces could have re ached Launda, the United St ates called off assistance. South Africa had no choice but to retr eat. South Africa learned the hard way that the U.S. is only nominally anti-Marxist. In practice the U.S. did to South Africa what it had done many times before - the elite betrayed its anti-Marxist allies. By the early 1980s The Order's multinat ional friends came out of the wood work while carefully coordinating public actions with Vice President Bush (The Order 1948). For example, in March 27, 1981 The Wall Street Journal ran a revealing article, including some nuggets of reality mingled with the Es tablishment line. This front page article viewed U.S. multinational support for th e Angolan Marxists under the headline \"Friendly Foe: companies urge U.S. to stay out of Angola, decline ai d to rebels\" (these rebels being anti-Marxist Savimbi's UNITA forces aided by South Africa). The leader of the pro-Marxist corpor ate forces in the U.S. is Melvin J. Hill, President of Gulf Oil Exploration & Production Company, a unit of Gulf Oil which operates Gu lf Cabinda. This is a refinery complex in Angola, protected from Savimbi's pro-Wester n rebels by Cubans and Angolan Marxist troops. Hill told the WSJ \"Angola is a k nowledgeable, understanding and reliable bu siness partner.\" Hill not only appeared before Congress with this pro-Marxis t line, but met at least several times with then Vice President Bush. PWJ Wood of Cities Service added more to the Gulf Oil mythology. Said Wood: \"The Angolans are more and more development orient ed. They aren't interested in politicizing central Africa on behalf of Cubans or the ' Soviet Union. Our people aren't persona non grata in Angola.\" Hill and Wood, of course, are no more than public relations agents for Marxist Angola, although we understand they have not registered as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. Angola is very much a Cuban-Soviet base for the take-over of Southern Africa, yet 17 western oil companies and other firms are in Angola. They include Gulf, Texaco, Petrofina, Mobil, Cities Service, Marathon Oil and Union Texas Petroleum. Other firms include Allied Chemical, Boeing Aircra ft, General Electric - and Bechtel Corporation. It should be remembered that both Secretary of State Schultz and Secretary of Defense Weinberger are on loan from Bechtel Corporation. Gulf Oil Corporation is controlled by the Mellon interest s. The largest single shareholder of the outstanding shares. The Mellon Bank is represented on the Board of Gulf Oil by James Higgins, a Yale graduate but not, so far as we can determine, a member of The Order. The next largest shareholder is the Mellon Family comprising the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Richard King Foundation, and the Sarah Scaife Founda tion. This group, which thinks of itself as \"con- servative,\" holds about 7 percent of the outstanding shares. Morgan Guaranty Trust (a name we have encountered before) holds 1.8 million shares or about 1 percent of th e outstanding shares. To a great extent these corporations with Angolan interest s have themselves out on a limb. It is surprising, for example, that South Africa has not moved to take co unter action against Angolan based firms, especially General Electric, Boeing, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Gulf Oil and Cities Service. After all, the South Africans are directly losing men ~Dm the massive support given to the Angolan Marxists by these firms. It would be cheaper in South African lives to direct retaliatory action against the corporations rather than against Cubans and Angolans. After U. S. betrayal of South Africa in 1 975, when South African forces could"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"have reached Luanda, it is a tribute to South Africa's caution that it has not used this rather obvious counter weapon. After all, a South African surg ical strike on Cabinda would neatly remove the Angolans' largest single source of foreign exchange, and give multinational Marxis ts a little food for thought. We are not, of course, recommending any such action, but it does remain an option open to South Afri ca. And the possible U.S. reaction? Well the State Department and CIA had best be ready with an explanation for the U.S. Embassy plane caught photographing South African military installations! We cite the above only to demonstrate the dangerous nature of The Order's conflict management scenarios. III. THE ORDER BUILDS A NEW DIALECTIC ARM IN CHINA Just as we found the Bush family involved with the ea rly development of the Soviet Union, then with financing the Nazis, and vaguely behind the scenes in Angola, so we find a Bush active in construction of the new dialectic arm: Communist China. In 1971 Mr. Nixon appointed George \"Poppy\" Bush (The Order 1948) as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, irrespective of the fact that Bush had no prev ious experience in diplomacy. As chief U.S. delegate, Bush had responsibility for defense agai nst the Communist Chinese attack on th e Republic of China, an original free enterprise member of the United Nations. With the vast power of the United States at his disposal, Bush failed miserably: the Repub lic was expelled from United Nations and Communist China took its seat. Shortly after that fiasco, Bush left United Nations to take over as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. This is not the place to tell the whole story of Americ an involvement in China. It began with Wall Street intervention into the Sun Yat Sen revolution of 1911 - a story not yet publicly recorded. During World War II the United States helped th e Chinese Communists into power. As one Chinese authority, Chin-tung Liang, has writte n about General Joseph W. Stilwell, the key U.S. representative in China from 1942 to 1944: \"From the viewpoint of the struggle agai nst Communism . . . [Stilwe ll] did a great disservice to China.\"' Yet Stilwell only reflected orders from Washington, from General George C. Marshall. And as Admiral Cooke stated to Congress, \". . . in 1946 General Mars hall used the tactics of st oppage of ammunition to invisibly disarm the Chinese forces. 'Chin-Tun Liang, General Stilwell In Chino, 1942-1944: The Full Story. St. John's University 1972, p. 12. 2 Ibid., p. 278. But when we get to General Marshall we need to reme mber that in the U.S. the civilian branch has final authority in matters milit ary and :',at gets us to then Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Marshall's superior and a member of The Order (1888). By an amazing coincidence, Stimson was al so Secretary of War in 1911 - at the time of t h e Sun Yat Sen revolution. The story of the betrayal of China and the role of The Order will have :o await yet anothe r volume. At this time we want only to record the decision to build Commu nist China as a new arm of the dialectic - a ,decision made under President Richard Nixon and placed into operation by Henry Kissinge r (Chase Manhattan Bank) and George \"Poppy\" Bush (The Order). As we go to press (early 1984) Bech tel Corporation has established a new company, Bechtel China, Inc., to handle development, engineering and construction contra cts for the Chinese government. The new ?resident of Bechtel China, Inc. is Sydney B. Fo rd, formerly marketing manager of Bech tel Civil & Minerals, Inc. Currently Bechtel is working on studies for the China National Coal Development Corporation and he China National Offshore Oil Corporation - both, of co urse, Chinese Communist organizations. It appears that Bechtel is now to play a similar role to that of Detroit based Albert Kahn, Inc., the firm that in 1928 undertook initial studies and planning for the First Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union. By about the year 2000 Communist China will be a \"super power\" built by American technology and skill. It is presumably the intention of The Order to place this power in a conflict mode with the Soviet Union. There is no doubt Bechtel will do its job. Former CI A Director Richard Helms works for Bechtel, so did Secretary of State George 5hultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. That's a powerful, influential combination, if any Washington planner concerned with nati onal Security gets out of lin e sufficiently to protest. Yet, The Order has probably again misc alculated. What will be Moscow's re action to this dialectic challenge? Even without traditional Russian paranoia they can be excu sed for feeling more than a little uneasy. And who is"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"to say that the Chinese Communists will not make th eir peace with Moscow after 2000 and join forces to eliminate the super-super-power - the United States?

Communist revolutionary cells are an obvious example. In fact, such revolutionary organizations could only function if their existence was secret. In brief, secrecy in matters political is historically associated with coercion. Furthermore, the existence of secrecy in organizations with political ambitions or with a history of political action is always suspect. Freedom is always associated with open political actio n and discussion while coercion is always associated with secrecy. There are numerous historical examples to support this premise. Back in the late 17th century the Elector of Bavaria, the constitutional government of Bavaria, banned the Illuminati or ganization. Accident al discovery of Illuminati documents demonstrated that a secret organization was devoted to the overthrow of the Bavarian state and establishment of a world society run by elitist Illuminati. More recently in England there have been startling discove ries involving use of th e Masonic movement by the Soviet KGB to subvert and infiltrate British inte lligence. True freemasonry is an establishment con- servative organization, but its organizational structure ca n be - and has been - used for revolutionary purposes. Masonic aims are publicly stated to be fraternity and charity, but it is also well known that masons help each other in areas supposedly based on talent. In The Brotherhood 1 Stephen Knight comments that many ha ve suffered because freemasonry has entered segments of society where it has no place: . . . there can be no doubt that many . . . have suffered because of freemasonry entering into areas of life where, according to all its publicly proclaimed principles, it should ne ver intrude. The abuse of freemasonry causes alarming miscarriages of justice\" (p. 4). 1 Stephan Knight, The Brotherhood: The secret Wo rld of the Freemasons, Granada, London, 1984. In England at any rate freemasonry has become a self-serving organization always discriminating in favor of its own members when it comes to contracts, jobs, careers and promotions. Moreover, we now know that the masonic movement in England was used by the Russian KGB to infiltrate, take over and finally head British intelligence organizations. In September 1984 Scotland Yard in L ondon advised all its police officers not to join the freemasons lest its reputation for impartiality be lost. Given this background, The Order, a secret society also known as Skull & Bones, is a clear and obvious threat to constitutional freedom in the Un ited States. Its secrecy, power and use of influence is greater by far than the masons, or any other semi-secret mutual or fraternal organization. How secret is Skull & Bones? The most careful analysis of the society is by Lyman Bagg in Four Years At Yale1 published in 1871, but still the only source of documented information on the cultic aspects of The Order. According to Bagg, The Order is intensely secret: • \"They (the senior societies at Yale) are the only Ya le societies whose transactions are truly secret.\" • \"Their members never mention their names, nor refe r to them in any way in the presence of anyone not of their own number, and as they are all seniors, there are no old members in the class above them to tell tales out of school.\" This intense secrecy even extends to documents printed for internal use. On the next page we reprint an internal circul ar distributed among Patriarchs which has disguised references as follows: \"P\" i.e., Patriarch \"P---s\" Patriarchs If The Order has this intense secrecy, then how are we able to reproduce its documents and memberships rolls? Simply because secrecy attracts atte ntion. Secrecy creates suspicion of intentions. This in turn generates action to break the secrecy. This series of books is based on se veral sources, including contemporary \"m oles.\" However, information on the cultic aspects comes from a century-old Yale con cern about the operations and intentions a= Skull & Bones. This concern generated two pamphlets, one issue of a journal and a chapter in a book, as follows:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"(1) An anonymous pamphlet entitled Skull & Bones. This is an account of the 1876 break-in at the \"Bones\" Temple on the Yale campus 1 Lyman Bagg, Four Years at Yale, Henry Holt & Co., New York, 1871. Th e chapter \"Senior Societies\" is reprinted in full as an app endix to this book. An extremely rare document, it is reprodu ced in full as an appendix to this book. The pamphlet begins:"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"\"As long as Bones shall exist the night of September 29th (1876) will be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their temple was invaded by neutrals , their rarest memorabilia confiscated and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the eyes of the uninitiated.\" This is reference to a break-in by a group of Yale stude nts, and the pamphlet describes in minute detail the contents of the Temple. For example, it describes the walls, e.g., \". . . the walls are adorned with pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale and of the members of the Society in Germany when the Chapter was established here in 1832.\" This sentence becomes of interest when the Illuminati aspect is discussed in Memorandum Five below. Here's another interesting pa ragraph from this pamphlet: \"Bones is a chapter of a corps in a German University. It should properly be called, not Skull & Bones Society but Skull & Bones Chapter. Ge neral R------ (Russell), its founder, wa s in Germany before Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society. He brought back with him to college, authority to found a chapter here. Thus was Bones founded.\" Think about this: Skull & Bones is not American at all. It is a branch of a FOREIGN secret society . Presumably this is one reason why intense secrecy is vital. It also raises the question of just who and what this foreign organization is and whether its objectives are compatible with those of the Constitution of the United States. (2) The Order, The Fall of Skull and Bones (New Haven, 1876) This is an anonymous satire published 1876 apparently in New Haven, Connecticut by a group calling itself The Order. The subtitle reads \"Compiled from the minutes of the 76th regular meeting of The Order of the File and Claw.\" The opening paragraphs are as in Skull & Bones cited above (1). however, the text continues with considerably more detail and appears to have b een written by another member of the break-in crew. In particular, this book gives the identification of the owner of the human skull found in one of the rooms of the Temple: \"A light is always kept burning in the Jo (D) which is ornamented with a dilapidated human skull . . . here is also a tombstone marked SPERRY, seemingly taken from the same grave as the skull.\" In brief, it appears this \"respected\" Order of Yale gentlemen is no more than a coven of grave robbers hoarding skulls, skeletons and tombstones. Then further down is the following: \"In the Pantry (F) are large quantities of dishes, each piece of crockery ornamented with a picture of a skull and crossbones, each spoon and fork marked S.B.T.\" (Skull and Bones Trust). This suggests a preoccupation with skulls and human bones is built into the cultic structure of The Order. Then on page 4 we learn that each member of Skull & Bones (as well as Scroll & Key) has an \"inside name\" and these names bear a remarkable resemblance to those used by the Illuminati, e.g., Chilo, Eumenes, Glaucus, Prisaticus and Arbaces. The conclusion of this pamphlet is: \" . . . we will say that a thorough examination of every part of the Temple leads us to the conclusions that the most powerful of college societies is nothing more than a pleasant convivial club.\" This conclusion ignores other evidence presented elsewhere. It is acceptable given only the findings of the break-in crew. (3) The Iconoclast, New Haven 1873 Only one issue of this journal has been found, and only a single copy of that issue exists. It is reproduced as an appendix below. The editor of The Iconoclast cons idered Skull & Bones \"a deadly evil\" and emphasized their interest in political control. Moreover, the Iconocla st states that The Order obtained control of Yale, and its members care more for their society than for Yale: Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men. They have gone out into the world and have become, in many instances, leaders in society. They have obtaine d control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be subject to their will."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"(4) Chapter \"Senior Societies\" in Lyman Bagg, Four Years at Yale. This is the reference cited above at the beginning of this chapter. Other sources include an ar ticle in Esquire Magazine by Ron Rosenbaum entitled \"The last secrets of Skull and Bones\" (September 1977). From this article we learn such tidbits as: \"Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart ... dressed up in a skeleton suit, howled wildly at an initiate in a red velvet room inside the tomb „ \"McGeorge Bundy wrestled naked in a mud pile as part of his initiation.\" According to a dossier obtaine d by Ron Rosenbaum, the 1940 initia tion ceremony went like this: New man placed in coffin - carried into central part of building. New man chanted over and reborn into society. Removed from coffin and given robes with symbols on it (sic). A bone with his name on it is tossed into bone heap at start of evening. Initiates plunged naked into mud pile. Again, we have a sordid preoccupation with coffins, skeletons and death. This about summarizes sources of information. Strangely enough, the long-time proponent of conspiracy theories, the John Birch Society, has made little contribution to our knowledge of The Order. Apparently JBS recognizes its existence but considers it merely a \"recruiting ground,\" which, of course, it is. This \"recruiting ground\" interpretation suggests several points. Firstly, the documentary evidence is quite clear: Knights, i.e., the just recruited initiates, spend only one year as Knights. They become Patriarchs after leaving Yale and spend a lifetime as Patriarchs. Seco nd, continual correspondence and meeting as Patriarchs continues after leaving Yale. In fact, the Deer Hand Club is specifically for annual meetings of Patriarchs and the Russell Trust Association is run entirely by Patriarchs. In brief, the JBS \"recruiting ground\" theory just doesn't match all the facts. Furthermore, The Order is the ONLY fully documented exam ple we have of a secret society within the U.S. establishment. JBS has never produced membership lists of any other society and yet seems unwilling to recognize the existence of The Order. Similarly, New Solidarity, i.e., the Lyndon LaRouche outfit, claims to have exposed The Order back in 1979. Unfortunately, neither Lyndon LaRouche nor any one else can produce documents dated 1983 and 1984 in 1979. In any event, the degree of documentation in our volumes on The Order has not been matched elsewhere. The answer is that this author does have - and fully admits to having - clandestine sources within The Order. We understand th at for specific reasons these sources are not available to either JBS or Lyndon LaRouche. At that point we will leave our discussion of sources and move on to the ritual aspects of The Order. Memorandum Number Two: The Organization of The Order The Yale Senior society system is unique to Yale University. There is nothing like it elsewhere in the United States or for that matter in the entire world. According to Lyman Bagg in Four Years at Yale, \"the senior societies are such peculiarly Yale institutions that it will be difficult for an outsider fully to appreciate their significance\" (Bagg, p. 142, see page following fo r full context). Nothing like them exists elsewhere and according to Bagg, \"Harvard is th e only college where, under similar c onditions they possibly could exist.\" There are three senior societies, Skull & Bones, Scroll & Key and Wolfs Head. Each year 15 male Yale juniors are tapped for admission. They spend only one year in the society, an entirely different procedure to fraternal organizations found on other campuses, Skull & Bones was founded in 1833 and has initiated 15 members each year since 1833 (except for 1945 when only 10 were tapped). Every year during commence ment week 15 Yale junior s receive an invitation \"Skull & Bones. Accept or reject?\" Those who accept, pres umably the greater number, are invited to attend the Bones Temple on campus to undergo an initiation ceremony. (See next page)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Tap day in modern times is a private, almost concealed operation; it was not always that way. Before 1953 juniors were herded into a yard and re presentatives from senior societies would circulate among assembled students, selecting those wanted for initiation. In those days rejection by a senior society was consid ered social suicide, so Yale ordered tapping a private affair, to avoid the traumatic wait and fear of rejection by the assembled juniors. For the ambitious, \"tapping\" is the magic password to a future career. Wherever he turns, the success of the Yale senior society system is obvious. Yale University President, A. Bartlett Giam atti, was a member of Scroll & Key, while George Bush, Vice Pr esident of the United States wa s a member of Skull & Bones. The Yale campus student is well aware that the senior society system is geared to the affluent outside world, to the worl d after graduation. Money and connections flow from membership. Reportedly, Skull & Bones donates $15,000 and a grandfather clock to each initiate. Certai nly alumni pay for everything associated with society meetings. In one case reported by New York Times (April 16, 1983), the alumni paid for a three-hour phone call from Colorado to Yale by two members of Scroll & Key unable to attend a meeting in the Scroll & Key tomb.

"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Although the John Birch Society, the long time conservative promoter of conspiracy theory, emphasizes that these senior societies are merely recruiting grounds, in effect the societies are the source of a vast establishment network, a formalized \"old boy\" network that effectively shuts out the newcomers and the non-Yale talented from the halls of pow er. Because these are senior societie s, the emphasis is not on campus activities but on post graduation ambitions. That is the fundamental difference to all other campus societies in the U.S. As Bagg points out: \"The statement is therefore again repeated that Bones and Keys are peculiarly Yale institutions, genuine outgrowths of a system that flou rishes nowhere else, the only organizations of the kind existing in - he country\" (p. 183) and the senior society \"is an association with no weak members whatever and the history of the matter shows that unless -his ideal is adhered to with reasonable closeness, such a society cannot live long at Yale\" (p. 144). CLUBS OF THE ORDER Each annual class of new initiates forms a club consis ting of 15 members. Initiates are called Knights in the first year and thereafter Patriarchs. The annual announcement of new initiates has not vari ed over the ears. We reproduce on page 194 the announcement of new members =or 1917 and on pages 195-196 those for 1984 and 1985. Each club has a number. This is locate d in the top right hand corner Of the announcement sheet (i.e., D 115 for 1917 and D 183 for 1984).

Miller) Alexandr ia Bay on the St. Lawrence River, New York. The island was donated in 1906 by Patriarch Miller and renovated over the years, but particularly in the 1950s and 1980s. Here's an extract from the latest February 29, 1984, report to Patriarchs: Deer Iland had another successful year in 1983, the 76th season of the Club since its establishment under the direction of George Douglas Miller, D. 68' in 1907. Was it the best year ever? Maybe. They're getting better and better. The results of the past five or six years have seen the Club become a much more viable enterprise from the years of the late '60s and early '70s when its future was much in doubt. The positive response made by Patriarchs is seen in the following paragraph from the same annual report: Increased use of the island is not the only factor in its present sound financial footing. Your generosity through your contributions to our annual fund drives has kept the Club going through lean times and supports it today. Most recently, the splendid response to the special capital fund drive in 1981-82, com- memorating the 75th anniversary of the Club, has enabled us to make major capital improvements to our facilities - a process which is still underway. I should add that those special contributions are not being used to meet current operating expenses but are sp ecially designated for capital improvements. Current income from all sources - guest receipts, the G.D. Miller trust, and the annual appeal - has met or exceeded our expenses for seven y ears, giving us both welcome secu rity and the means to improve further the island's classi c river-style structures. (I don't want to use the word \"modernize\" except perhaps in reference to the plumbing. You may so inform your wives.) In brief: the organization of The Order both as Russell Trust Association and Deer Iland Corporation is essentially geared towards the post graduation world, the outside world. It is a senior society. Knights spend only one year as Knights. The rest of their lives are sp ent as Patriarchs in an active influential organization able to guarantee wealth and ambition. * D. 68 - It is a practice for members to place their Club identification after their name in writing each other."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Three: The Ritual of The Order The ritual of The Order is a closely held secret. The most that anyone can do at this stage is piece together some elements of the ritual and their probable meaning. The extraordinary secrecy is itself part of a ritual. Members are sworn not to discuss the organization, its procedures or its objectives. Presumably, only an FBI or Congressional investigation could break this code of \"omerta\" (Mafia = silence). The secrecy is carried to extraordinary lengths. Memb ers may not remain in the room if The Order is under discussion. Words spoken within The Order may not be pl aced on paper, even in letters to fellow members. For example, witness the following extract from a letter circulated to members by W. lain Scott (D. 171), President of Deer Iland Club Corporation: But beyond these mere quantitative me asures of success, it is the quali ty of the Deer Iland experience that commends the Club to your atte ntion. There are few, if any, pla ces where the B-n-s life thrives in such luxuriance outside the thick and tomblike walls in New Haven. Our Order is, to use an economic term, very much horizontally integrated. That is, our ties to it are strongest through a very narrow slice of time - one special year. Deer Iland, for me and I believe many others , has expanded these ties vertically through contact with younger and older me mbers. Visitors to the island last summer ranged from D. 124 to D. 182, twelve of them. It serves as prelude to the music of the B-n-s for the \"newly fledged exalted K---- ts\" and as an endlessly rising canon on that wonderful theme to the p-tr--rchs.\" Notice three abbreviations to conceal internal use of words from any possible outsider who may stumble on a copy of the letter: B-n-s =Bones (cited twice) k---- ts = Knights p-tr--rchs = Patriarchs The reader may consider this juvenile, and it may well be. On the other hand, these \"juveniles\" are the men today running the United States. Chapter meetings of Patriarchs are announced using a format which has not changed since the early 19th century. An interesting and significant aspect of thes e announcements is the manner in which they reflect elements of the ritual: the skull and bones, the periods into which The Order has placed its history and the club numbers. We reproduce below announcements for the following years: 1. July 28, 1859 - the earliest year for which we have a copy. Note the Roman letters VI in the center of the sheet. 2. July 23, 1868 - the last year for which we have a record of the VI appearing. We understand that 1869 was actually the last year with VI. 3. July 21, 1870 - the first year with VIII in the cen ter. Note that VII appears to have been skipped completely. 4. June 17, 1936 - note that the format remains almost the same. This one was signed by Potter Stewart, later (1958-1981) Supreme Court Justice. 5. May 31, 1984 - the latest announcement notice. Note that the Club number D. 183 now appears, but in essence the sheet remains exactly as in 1859. It appears they even used the same skull and bones. The initiation ceremony itself has been partially de scribed in both the 1876 documents (reproduced below) and a century later by Ron Rosenbaum in \"The Last Secrets of Skull & Bones\" (Esquire, September 1917). Each year 15 newly tapped members are put through what has been described as a \"harrowing\" ordeal - presumably to test their manhood - a manner traditional with fraternity hazing. According to Rosenbaum, \"one can hear strange cr ies and moans coming from the bowels of the tomb\" during initiation. Four elements of the initiation ceremony are recorded: • that the initiate has to lie naked in a sarcophagus, • that he is required to tell the \"secrets\" of his sex life to fellow initiates, • that Patriarchs dressed as skeletons and acting as wild-eyed lunatics howl and screech at new initiates."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"• that initiates are required to wrestle naked in a mud pile. Undoubtedly there is more. However, the above is enough to warrant branding The Order as based on behavior more suited to juvenile delinquents. Undoubtedly the more serious part of the initiation process is peer pressure, the conversion of juveniles into presumably responsible -embers of an unelected elite. As Rosenbaum comments, \"the real purpose of the institution was . . . devoted to converting the idle progeny of the ruling class into morally serious leaders of the establishment.\" What happens in the initiation process is essentially a variation of brain-washing or encounter group processes. Knights, through heavy peer pressure, become Patriarchs prepared for a life of the exercise of power and continuation of this proc ess into future generations. In brief, the ritual is designed to mold establishment zombies, to ensure continuation of power in the hands of a small select group from one generation to another. But beyond this ritual are aspects notably satanic. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"  "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Memorandum Number Four: Satanic Aspects of The Order Even with our limited knowledge of the internal ritual of The Order we can make three definite statements about the links between The Order and satanic beliefs. These observations should be seen as a start poi nt for further research and consideration. The first link is through photographic evidence of the association of Skull & Bones with satanic devices, i.e., the skull and crossed bones. The second link is through satanic symbolism. The third link is through the association of The Order with the New Age Movement, well documented in a remarkable new book by Constance Cumbey, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow (Huntington House, Inc., Suite G, 1200 North Market Street, Shreveport, LA 71107). THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE Photographic evidence exists of the use of the satanic devices of a skull and crossed bones in ceremonies of The Order. We reproduce on the following page a photograph of the \"Class of 1869.\" Fifteen members of the Club, thirteen standing and two seated, are grouped around crossed thigh bones and a skull. A handwritten list of these men is also reproduced. In the background is a grandfather clock. From 1833 to th e present time a grandfather clock is presented to each Knight upon initiation and stays wi th him throughout his life as a mement o of what is called \"the Bones experience.\" We also reproduce two other photographs of other clas ses seated around a skull and bones. According to other evidence, at least three sets of skulls and asso rted bones are kept within the Bones Temple on the Yale campus. An obvious point is that these bones and skulls are former human beings. Instead of sacred treatment, they are exhibite d and used for ceremonial purposes. Where the bones should be resting decently in a gr ave, they have become the center of a secret ceremony. In brief, the photographs reveal the men portrayed as grave robbers who reject human dignity a nd decency and use satanic devices. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" THE SATANIC SYMBOLISM OF THE SKULL Artist Elizabeth Stucki 1 has commented on the mask and the skull in modern art and the symbolic meaning. Says Stucki: \"The Skull - Mortality Unmasked The opposite of the mask is the skull. The face of the person is a fleshy skin worn between the two. People who deny the person as made in the image of God directly, and individually created and loved by Him, will seek either of these exits to being truly human - the mask which covers the mortal man or the skull which is left after mortal man has depart ed. Primitive minds who have not yet found God and sophisticates who have rejected Him, desire the mask and the skull.\" Collectivist artist Picasso, darling of New York establishment elitists. was also preoccupied with skulls in a manner very similar to members of Skull and Bones. The preoccupation is portrayed by Leo Steinberg in Art News, October 1971. Artist Stucki comments on Picasso's morbid interest in skulls as follows: In 1945, Picasso painted \"Skull and Pitcher.\" Leo Steinberg st ates that in it \"the light's character is consistently altered.\" The light is as hard as an axe-blade, not sof tly spiritual. Steinberg also gives the painting a Freudian interpretation of sexuality and interprets the pitcher to be the \"receiving part in a Satanic annunciation.\" He refers to Morgenstern's poetry on sex and the skull. In th is article he feels that Pi casso projected himself into the skulls. He made eight skulls in one week as a meth od of mastering his fear o: death. In 1930, Picasso was self-projecting into the Minotaur monsters he painted. He had painted skulls all along; an earlier one in 1907, is in a still-life now in Leningrad. In the same year, he discarded the idea of using a skull in his \"Demoiselles d'Avignon.\" In the mid-1940s, he used it as a mask, on an owl, or on a horse face.\""},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF THE RAINBOW Constance Cumbey in The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow identifies several organizations linked to The Order and the objectives of The Order. Cumbey identifies Benjamin Creme and the Tara Cent er based in New York, Los Angeles, Amsterdam and London as a New Age phenomenon. To Creme are linked Unity and Unitarian Church leaders. Unknown to Cumbey, The Order has long-standing and significant links to the relatively small Unitarian Church. In fact, former President William Taft, whose father co-founded The Order, was Pres ident of the Unitarian Association in his time. Cumbey identifies the link between Hitler and the New Age movement and former research by this author linked The Order to the founding and growth of Naziism. Most significantly, Cumbey states that the New Age movement plans to bring about a New World Order \"which will be a synthesis between the U.S. S.R., Great Britain and the United States.\" Finally, Cumbey points out that the anti-Christ and sata nic aspects are woven into the cult of the New Age movement. The period is constant at \"2\" while the Decade increases by one each ten years, i.e., decade 3, 4, 5, etc. The \"D\" number is always less than the class number. Up to 1970 by 2 and after 1970 by 1. In other words the first list of members - the class of 1833 was designated \"P. 231-D.31.\" In brief, the organization started in the United States was in the third decade of the second period . So a sensible question is - where does that place the start? Presumably in Germany. The first decade of the second period would then begin in 1800 and the first period would have ended in the decade 1790 to 1800.

As long as Bones shall exist, the night of September 29th will be to its members the anniversary of the oc casion when their temple wa s invaded by neutrals, their rarest memorabilia confiscated and th eir most sacred secrets unveiled to th e eyes of the uninitiated. We have thought a description of how this was done might be of interest to the collegeworld. The back cellar windows of the eulogian temple were fortified as follows: First, to one seeking entrance from the outside was a row of one inch iron bars; behind them was a strong iron netting fastened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars 1 1 /a inches thick; and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter. Formidable as these defenses appear, we determined to effect an entrance. The work pro ceeded slowly and it was only after many hours of patient work that one of the outside iron bars was cut into. Next, by means of a powerful claw, the long nails that fastened the iron netting to the wooden frame were drawn out. Then the bar was refastened in it place by means of a little putty, and we retired to wait a fa vorable nigh: for completing the undertaking; 8 o'clock, Friday evening, Sept. 29. was the time selected. First, one of our number proceeded to remove the iron bar and netting; and then, for the sake of more room, he, with considerable difficulty, got out the strong wooden frame to which the latter had been fastened. Pushing head and shoulders into the opening thus made, there still remained a strong row of 1 1 /a inch iron bars. Fortunately, there was no need to file these through. They were fastened above in a thick joist, but below, ran into a brick \"damp-wall\" that was built up inside and two inches from the stone foundation of the building By the aid of a hatchet, it was the work of but a very few moments to dig away about twenty inches of this wall and thus loosen an iron plate through which the lower ends of the bars ran. Upon pushing this plate inward, the bars all fe ll out of their own weight; the flimsy wooden shutter was then wrenched from its position, and, at just half-pas t ten, a-: entrance was effected. Passing in through the window, we broke open the wooden door at the top of the cellar stairs, opened the two iron shutters which close the back windows of the main hall and pro ceeded to examine the te mple at our leisure. A WARM SUMMER'S NIGHT witnessed the other entrance and the fuller investigation which enables us to enlighten the hitherto mystified college world about the interior of the recent addition. It also supplied the missing links in the history of the society and the mode of working it, which the previous investigators neglected to secure. One day in the Spring, a young man happened to be pa ssing Bones hall, late Thursday night, and noticed a gleam of light from the skylight in the roof. Reasoning that where that ray appear ed there must be some entrance, sometime afterwards several public spirited under-graduates made the exploration we chronicle. They got a ladder, which the painters who were rejuve nating the old brick row were using, some stout rope, a dark lantern, a small crow bar, a hatchet, cold ch isel and jimmy. One Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, they carried the ladder across the campus and placed it ag ainst the rear of the building. One man was stationed across High Street to act as watchman. The others as cended the ladder; previously, however, they took the precaution to remove their shoes and went up in their stoc king feet, to avoid all noise. Going over the roof to the skylight, they easily pried it open with the crow bar. The opening would admit them, one at a time. The"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"rope was tied to the skylight.. Separately, with joy and trembling, the investigators slide down. They were now in the mystic recesses of Bones. As the result of their investigations is summarized with the result of prior research, we need not go into it more at length here. Suffice to say that shortly before dawn they climbed the rope, refastened the skylight, descended to the ground and put the ladder back where they had got it. It may be safely said that no hearts in the whole college were more Joyful and no sincerer tha nks went up in chapel that morning, than from chose daring men, who had taken such great risks to disc lose the inner parts of our Yalensian Juggernaut.

A glass case here holds quite a quantity of memorabilia - among which may be seen a hat said to belong to Pret. Pierson, a number of base balls a nd several textbooks. G contains two si de-boards of mahogany and one large table in the center. Besides these the walls are adorned w ith pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale, and of the members of the Society in Germany, when the Chap ter was established here in 1832' There are also two smaller tables. The glassware, decan ters; &c., on the side-board, all have the skull and the bones blown into the glass. Ascending to the next floor, we come into a long hall (F) . Entering room A immediately on the left is seen a book-case which contains the Bones library and which is very complete, containing about every book of note ever published at Yale. Hanging on the wall toward High street was a handsomely-framed cushion of velvet on which were fastened the pins of every society ever in Yale University. On the south side of the room is a handsome open fireplace and above this a marble mantel a: and a mirror. On the mantel were two casts of the pin; one in silver and the other in bronze - the first about two inches in diameter, the second about three. Several mystical engravings hung on th e walls. The room a handsomely fu rnished. Tobacco, pipes and cards are abundant. Room B, called 322, is the \"sanctum sanctorum\" of the temple. Its distinguishing feature is a facsimile of the Bones pin, handsomely inlaid in the black marble hearth, just below the mantel, and also inlaid in marble is the motto: \"Rari Quippe Boni,\" in old English text. Th is room is ~ furnished in red velvet, and is very luxurious. On the wall is a star with a finger pointed towards it. On the walls of the long hall F are hung groups of pictures of each Bones' crowd. H is an old plain lock safe. but c ontained nothing save a knife covered with blood stains. C is memorabilia room, and contains the old college bell, old boating flags old mss.,&c. D contains two Brunswick & Balke combination tables (billiard) and a `bou ffe', beside cue racks &c. E is a Jo and toilet room. PART III - HISTOLOG Y OF THE SOCIETY Bones has no constitution. Its grip &c., are handed down from fifteen to fifteen. The records though, which are made at each meeting, show all anybody could want to know. These records are profusely illustrated, making an interesting memo rial to future Eulogians. Some well -skilled amateur has evidently spent much time illustrating them. The motto \"B oni bonis adpacunt\" constantly appears."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Bones is a chapter of a corps in a German University. It should properly be called, not Skull and Bones Society, but Skull and Bones Chapter. General R--, its founder, was in Germany before Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society. He brought back with him to college authority to found a chapter here . Thus was Bones founded. The 322 on the pin has been commonly supposed to mean, founded in '32 and 2nd chapter. But the Bones man has a pleasing fiction that his fraternity is the descendant of an old Greek patriotic society, dating back to Demosthenes 322, B.C. .he Bones records, 1881 for example, with huge pride, ar e headed Anno-Demostheni 2 203. A secondary date is from the time of the fire in t he hall or annoconflagrationis, as the records style it. Immediately on entering Bones, the neophyte's name is changed. He s no longer known by his name as it appears in the college catalogue, but, like a monk or knight of Malta or St. John, becomes Knight so and so. The old Knights are then known as Patriarch so an d so. The outside world are known as Gentiles and vandals. We have tried to prepare this brief sketch without injuri ng the feelings :r susceptibilities of any PERSON. It has been done through an earnest belief that Bones, as at present conducted, is a blight on Yale College. It makes bitter the time when all should be pleasing. It fo rms emities and creates discussions when all should be harmony. But, above all, it lowers our standard of hono r and detracts from that manliness which is our pride.

At any rate there were those who observed that during the church services their eyes suspiciously scanned the faces of one neutral after anothe r, and invariably dropped if their glance was returned. The reason for this is a simple one. As long as Skull and Bones Society shall exist, the night of September 29th will be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their Temple was invaded by neutrals, some of their rarest memorabilia confiscated, and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the vulgar eyes of the uninitiated. We have thought that a description of how this was done might be of interest to the college world. The back-cellar windows of the Eulogian Temple were fortified as follows: First, to one seeking entrance from the outside, was a row of one inch iron bars; behind them a strong iron netting fastened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars, one and one quarter inches thick; and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter.

Next, by means of a powerful claw, the long nails that fastened the iron netting to the wooden frame were drawn out. Then the bar was re-fastened in its place by means of a little putty, and we retired to await a favorable night for finishing the job. Eight o'clock Friday evening, September 29th, was the hour selected. First, one of our number proceeded to remove the iron bar and the netting, a nd then, for the sake of more room, he, with considerable di f ficulty, got out the strong wooden frame to which the latter had been fastened. Pushing head and shoulders into the opening thus made there still remained a strong row of one and one quarter inch iron bars Fortunately there was no need to file through th ese.

Passing in through the window, we broke open th e wooden door at the top of the cellar stairs, opened the two iron shutters which close the back windows of the main hall, and pr oceeded to examine the Temple at our leisure. For the benefit of future explorers, and as a directory for new-fledged Bones men for all time, we will now give a brief description of THE INTERIOR OF SKULL AND BONES HALL Besides the cellar, the Temple is divided into two stories. Fig. 1 is a rough plan of the cellar: A light is always kept burning in th e Jo (D), which is ornamented with a dilapidated human skull and a framed set of \"Directions to Freshmen,\" signed Thomas Clap, and dated Yale College, 1752. Here is also a tombstone marked Sperry, seemingly taken from the same grave as the skull. On the we st wall of the kitchen (E), which contained the ordinary conveniences, hangs a picture of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the Pantry (F) are large quantities of dishes, each piece of crockery ornamented with a picture of a skull and crossbone and each spoon and fork marked. S.B.T. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" On ascending the stairs from the cellar, you find yourself , after bursting open the door C, Fig. 2, in an entry (A), from which a winding staircase (K) leads to the ne xt floor. The door C, which is of wood, we found locked, but broke open without difficulty. H is the outside iron door, covered on the inside with a pair of light frame doors. B is a small toilet room. The door D, which is without a lock, opens into the main hall (F), called by the initiated \"324\". The fl oor is of colored tiles; the walls are rath er gaudily frescoed, mainly in red and black, somewhat like those of D K hall. A few settees, resembling those in Linonia Hall, and a table, make up the furniture of the room. The wood work is painted white, and, like the walls, is in many places scratched and dirty. EE are two narrow windows, guarded by strong iron shutters. The latter are concealed from view by some light wooden blinds stained to look like walnut. The only objects of interest in the room were a glass case in the southeast corner containing a large number of gilded base-balls, each inscribed with the date, score, etc., of a university game, and a well-thumbed text-book, either a Physics or a Human Intellect, on the fly-leaf of which was inscribed the autograph of Bone s' irrepressible annoyer, Arjayjay of '76. Thus far we had found little to compensate us for our trouble, but on ascending to the next floor, and passing, on our right a little store-room and draw-bridge which extend over the front entrance from High Street, our pains was rewarded. Entering the room C, Fig. 3, immediately on the left is seen a bookcase, which contains the Skull and Bones library, including a complete set of the Yale Lit ., handsomely bound college catalogues and books published by Bones men. Here, too, was the Constitution of the Ph Beta Kappa and a catalogue of Scroll and Key Society, containing a list of members down to 1868. It was bound in black, and had on the front cover the letters C.S.P. and on the back C.C.J. In Old English text. For -he year LI only eleven names are given, and for XLII only twelve. It contains several typographical e rrors, as for instance; D. Cady Eaton's first name is printed Samuel. Opposite the names of the first two Keys men for LXII, some one has written, in a bold hand, the mystic symbol \"Ass\". And at the top of the page which give the men of LII, is written, \"Croud packed by Boies,\" and Boies is the name of a Keys ma n of that :ear. From the cat alogues we learn that the President and Secretary of Scroll and Key are known \"ins ide\" as Chilo and Eumenes, and that, as n Bones, each member has a nickname given him. Some of thes e are handed down from class to class, of these Glaucus, Prisaticus and Arbaces appear to be the favorites. Hanging on the wall towards High street was a handsom ely-framed cushion of dark velvet, on which were fastened the pins of all the societies which have existed in college, including Spade and Grave, Bull and Stones, and the like. On the south si de of the room is a fireplace, and above this a mantel and mirror. Upon the mantel were a Skull and Bones of silver, the skull about two inches in diameter, and engraved \"32 from the S.E.C. of 1858;\" another of bronze, a little larger than the silver one, and various other insignia relating to Skull and Bones. On the west wall hung, among other pictures, an old engraving representing an open burial vault, in which, on a stone slab, rest four human skulls, grouped about a fool's-cap and bells, an open cook, several mathematical instruments, a beggar's scrip, and a royal crown. On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words, :n Roman letters, \"We War Der Thor, Wer Weiser, Wer Bettler Oder Kaiser?\" and below the vault is engraved , in German characters, the sentence;"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"\"Ob Arm, Ob Beich, im Tode gleich,\" The picture is accompanied by a card, on which is written, \"From the German Chapter.

The pipe-bowls, which are representations of skulls, and bear the stamp of M. Gambier, Paris, nave the Eulogian name of the owner and his decade written upon .hem with red ink; for instance the one belonging to the present Member from Bath\" was marked \"Trim, D. 75.\" Room D, the Bones name of which is \"322,\" is the sanctum sanctorum of the Temple. Its distinguishing feature is a life-size facsimile of the Bones pin handsomely inlaid in the black marble hearth. Just below the mantel, and also inlaid in marble, is the motto: Bari Quippe Boui in old English text. This room is even more richly furnished than \"323\", but contains no book-case, and no pictures of special significance. On the walls of the long hall B are hung a couple of score of photographs, about 12x20 inches, each representing fifteen Bonesmen grouped around a table, on which rest a human skull and crossbones. As the finish of these pictures is poor and of an antiquated style, it is probable th at they are taken each year with the apparatus belonging to the society. H is an old-fash ioned plain-lock safe, size about 20x26 inches, and 15 inches deep, set in the wall. It is probably used as a place of deposit for money and valuables, but on the night of the 29th contained only a bunch of keys and a sm all gold-mounted flask half filled with brandy. K is a small closet in which are kept unbound sheets of the Bones Society catalogues and a set of handsome memorable books, one for each year. Some of the old memorable is quite curious, and the collections relating to recent years are very complete. The Bones catalogue is essentially as described in Four Years at Yale. The doors to E and F, which are used as general storer ooms, are protected by plates of sheet-tin, but the locks were not \"what we may call\" proof against skeleton keys. The memorabilia in these rooms was noteworthy for amount rather than quality. However, in the midst of a good deal of rubbish we found four or five boating flags, and a number of old Greek, Latin a nd German works in MS. None of these were society records, but works of well-known authors; into the genuine antiquity of the MSS. We have not as yet been able to examine. In conclusion, we will say that a thorough examinati on of every part of the Temple leads us to the conclusion that \"the most powerful of college societies\" is nothing more than a pleasant convivial club. The kitchen contains the materials for serving refreshments for the inner man; there are neither billiard tables nor any kind of musical instrument in the building; there is a total absence of all the \"machinery\" which we had been led to expect; the bell heard on initiation nights is not \"the old college bell;\" Skull and Bones has no secrets beyond a few that may be handed down annually by word of mouth, and no written constitution beyond -a few directions similar to the suggesti ons appended to the Delta Kappa by-laws. Before leaving the hall, it was asked whether we should inform other members of the college of what we had done, and throw open the hall to the public. We think no one will deny that we had it in our power at one stroke not only to take away forever all the prestige wh ich her supposed secrecy has given this society, but to make her the laughing-stock of all college, and render her future existence extremely doubtful. But while we had no consideration for the mysterious poppiecock of S kull and Bones Society, we nevertheless remembered that some of the Bones men of '77 are our warm pers onal friends, and therefore we preferred a less radical course. To Bones as a pleasant convivial club, we have no objections. Let her live on as long as men enjoy good suppers and quiet whist. But her mystery and her secrecy are at an end, and we hope her absurd pretensions and her poppiecock are dead also. The burglary was not discovered until the following evening, at about eight o'clock. All day Saturday the great Skull and Bones lay at the mercy of any one who might notice the back window. How thoroughly the society was frighten ed can be seen by the way they have sealed up the window through which we entered, as well as more recently all of the other five basement openings. We have no idea that Skull and Bones will deny that their hall ha s been entered, for we are not without proofs that our tale is true. We have above spoken of different manuscripts, trinkets a nd memorabilia as existing in the Temple. In several"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"cases we should have written \"existed\" for the place that knew them shall know them no more forever. In short, while robbery was not our errand, on the principl e that the second thief is the best owner we helped ourselves to a few pieces of memorable, which can be put on exhibition, and a few documents which can be printed, should any authoritative denial be made to any essential point in this statement. Nor will Bones usual policy of silence avail to throw discredit upon our story. Part of our memorable has been seen by Senior neutrals, and the remainder will be put where it will do the most good, as soon as the protection of a sheepskin has been placed between us and the Faculty and the law.

The societies of the first three years, though possessed of special characteristics, have yet such a general resemblance to one another and to those of other college s, that their position in the system can be readily comprehended by any reader of these pages, - at least, if he be college-bred. But the senior societies are such peculiarly Yale institutions, that it will be difficult for an outsider fully to appreciate their significance. Nothing like them exists in other colleges; and Harv ard is the only college where, under similar conditions, they possibly could exist. In the first place, they ar e the only Yale societies whos e transactions are really secret. Their members never even mentio n their names, nor refer to them in any way, in the presence of anyone not of their own number; and, as they are all Seniors, there are no \"old members in the :lass above them\" to tell tales out of school. There is no electioneering nor pledgi ng for these societies, and no Junior is approached upon the subject in any way un til an election is actually offered him. Th e number of elections given out to each class is small and never varies, and no -lass nor honorary elections are ever allowed. Both societies combined comprise but little more than one fourth the members of an average :lass, and the part played by them in politics is simply a negative one. A ma n's chances for office are never better ed because he belongs to a senior society, but are frequently, for that simple reason, inju red or destroyed altogether. The societies do not take their names from the initials of a Greek motto, but from the peculiar emblems adopted as a badge. This badge is constantly worn by active members; by day upon the shirt bosom or neck-tie, by night upon the night dress. A gymnast or coating man will be sure to have his seni or badge attached to what little clothing he may be encumbered with while in practice; a nd a swimmer, divested of all garments whatever, will often hold it in his mouth or - and, or attach it to his body in some way, while in the water. Only graduate members wear the badge upon the vest, where for the first few years they display it quite regularly. Old graduates seldom \"swing out\" except on special occasions, or while visiting New Haven; and members of the faculty, except may be young"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"freshman tutors, never display a society badge when en gaged in their official duties. Members who have ceased to show the badge openly, nevertheless may wear it about them pretty consta ntly, perhaps by night as well as day, for quite a number of years. The senior so cieties, in theory, are com posed exclusively of \"big men\"; of those who, for whatever reason, have become preeminent above their fellows in college repute. In this they differ from those of the two preceding years, which of necessity are half made up of comparatively second-rate men. There are a certain nu mber - say twenty - in each class, w ho, at the end of the third year, may be picked out as the confessed superiors of the others in popular esteem. Were it possible to do this a year or more earlier, and were one junior society preeminently \"t he best\", it is doubtful if the twenty could all be per- suaded to join it, or the society to elect them all; for it is plain that their individual political influence would be greater in separate societies, partly made up of less important men. The senior-society type, on the other hand, is an association with no weak member s whatever; and the history of the matt er shows that unless this ideal is adhered to with reasonable closeness such a society cannot live long at Yale. There are two of these societies, but as one takes its tone from the othe r it may be well to describe them separately, and treat first of the oldest and most famous member of the modern system. Its name is \"Skull and Bones,\" - formerly printed \"S cull and Bone,\" - and its badge, of solid gold, consists of the face of a skull, supported by the crossed thigh bones, with a band, bearing the number \"322,\" in place of the lower jaw. Its original badge was a rectangular gold plate, about the si ze and shape of the present Beta Xi pin, whereon the skull-and-bones design and the numeral were simply en graved. Its wood-cut vignette merely represents the emblems, and is identical with that employed for gene ral purposes in college pape rs elsewhere. The number \"322\" is always printed below it, though the size of the type is not invariable. In the cut formally used, the design was smaller than that now than in vogue, but there never has been added to the simple emblems anything in the way of ornament or embellishment. Popularly the society !s known as \"Bones,\" and its members as \"bones men\". The pin 'sometimes called a \"crab\" from its supposed resemblance to that animal. The hall, erected in 1856, is situated on High street, near the corner of Chapel, about opposite the Yale Art Building. It is a grim looking, windowless, tomb-like structure, of brown sandstone, rectangular in shape, showing a front of about 35 and a length of 44 feet is, at a guess 35 feet in height. The entrance in front is guarded by a pair of massive iron doors, a dozen feet high, finished off in panels, and of a dark green color; while heavy clasps of brass close over the keyholes a nd are secured by padlocks, beneath one of which the bell-pull is concealed. Previous to 186 4, when these doors were put in positi on, their places we re occupied by commoner ones of iron, upon which the society emblems were displayed. The roof is nearly flat, and is covered with half-inch plates of iron, which in 1867 to ok the place of the tin before employed. There is a skylight, similarly protected, and the chimneys and vent ilators are ranged along the edges of the roof. Behind, are a pair of small windows barred with iron, and close to the ground are two or three scuttle holes, communicating with the cellar. The building is rapidly becoming covered with the \"Virginia creeper,\" first planted there in 1864, and stands back a rod or more from the street, being separated from it by a post-and- chain fence. The dimensions of the lot upon which it st ands are about 40 feet (front ) by 70 (deep); and total value of the premises must be upwards of $30,000. Before taking possession of its present quarters, the society for many years, - perhaps from its original organization, - occupied a low-studded back room in the third story of what is now the Courant building, opposite. the college yard. At the May, 1856, session of the State Legislature the society was incorporat ed as the \"Russell Trust Association,\" with the same legal formulas as those quoted in the case of Psi U. The names mentioned in the act were William H. Russell of '33, John S. Beach of '39, Henry B. Harrison of '46, Henry T. Blake of '48, Henry D. White of '51, and Daniel C. Gilman of '52; - the first of whom has since acted as president, the one next to the last as treasurer, of the association. All are residents of new Haven. The society was originated in 1832 by fifteen members of the class wh ich graduated the following year. General Russell, the valedictorian of that class, is its reputed founder, and the best known of his associates is Judge Alphonso Taft of Cincinnati. Some injustice in the conferring of Phi Beta Kappa elections seems to have led to its establishment, and apparently it was for some time regarded throughout coll ege as a sort of burlesque convivial club. It is said that the faculty once broke in upon one of its meetings, and from what they saw determined upon its abolishment, but by the intercessions and explanations of its founder, then serving as tutor among them, were finally induced to spare it. The popular college tradition, that it was transplanted from a German university, is scouted by old ne utral graduates as absurd. But, whatever be the facts as to its origin, the mystery now attending its existence is genuine, and forms the one great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing. Its catalogue is a unique affair, ha ving a page six inches by four, printed upon one side only.

A title page, bearing the soci ety cut and the words \"Period 2. Decade 3,\" precedes the list of the founders, and a similar one, \"Period 2. Decade 4,\" stands before the class of '43, and so on for every successive ten years, the \"Period\" being always \"2\", but the \"Deca de\" increasing each time by one. At the top of the first list of names - the class of '33 - and separated from them by a broad line of black, are the characters, \"P.231.- D.31,\" which regularly increase by one with each succeeding class, and are therefore, for the class of 7 1, \"P.269-D.69.\" The first page of the boo k displays, in full-faced old-English capitals, the letters. \"Otirunbeditf,\" arranged in a semi-oval, between two black lines. The ca talogue is black-edged, and is bound in black- leather, with the owner's name and \"D.\", stamped in gilt upon th e cover, - though of late the \"D.\" is less often indicated. It will be observed that the \"D.\" is always two less than the class; thus, a catalogue labeled \"John Smith. D.62\", would belong to a member of the class of '64, and so on. What these \"Periods\" and \"Decades\" and \"P.'s\" and \"D.'s\" may signify is known only to the in itiated; but, as the catalogue is never shown to out- siders, they were probably not put there for mystifica tion solely. That the founders are put down as belonging to the \"third decade of the second period\" may seem to make in favor of the German university theory, in the minds of many; and the blank space in place of the el eventh man's name in th e list of the founders, may perhaps be thought a straw in the same direction. The la st edition of the catalogue was prepared in December, 1870, and was as usual sent out in unbound sheets to each surviving member of the society. The total membership of the 39 classes represented was of course 585. The elections to this society are always gi ven out on the Thursday evening which precedes Presentation Day. Since no Junior is eve , pledged or spoken to in advance, the excitement which prevails among the \"likely men\" is intense, though suppressed, as the hour of fate draws nigh. All college, too, is on the alert, to find what the result ma y be. It is said that formerly the fifteen Bones men, at midnight, silentl y moved from their hall to the rooms of the chosen ones, when the leader, in each case displaying a human skull and bone, said simply. \"Do you accept?\" and, whatever was the reply, the proce ssion as silently departed. As the neutrals got into the way of tagging about, insulting and annoying the society on its march, this plan was abandoned in favor of the less formal one now in vogue. According to this, at an early hour of the appointed evening, a Bones Senior quietly calls at the room of a Junior, and having been assured that \"we are alone,\" says: \"1 offer you an election to the so-called Skull and Bones. Do you accep t? If the answer is affirmative the Senior - and perhaps the graduate member who someti mes accompanies him - shakes hands with the neophyte, and bidding him to keep to his room for the present, hurries back to the hall to report the result. If the election is refused, the result is likewise reported to headquarter s, and influential members are sometimes sent back to argue the case; but, as a rule, the few men who refuse elections are not offered a chance to repent. Bones will not be dictated to, and when a man says, \"I accept, in ca se So-and-So is elected with me,\" or \"in case Such-a- One is kept out,\" he is never allowed to carry his poi nt; Yes or No is the only answer recognized. Suppose the elections begin to be given out about seven, in case there are no refusals the whole number will be made up before nine o'clock; if there are refusals it may take an hour longer. In anticipation of this possibility, a half- dozen extra men are chosen in Bones, in addition to the regular fifteen, and in case any of the latter fail to say Yes,, elections are offered to a co rresponding number of these \"second choi ces,\" in the order in which they were elected. By going quickly and qui etly about their business the Bones men manage to elude in great part the attentions of the rabble, which ranges about the colle ge yard on the night in question, - barring up the entry doors, raising false alarms, and otherwise disporting it self. The names of the chosen men, however, are known about as quickly as the elections are conferred, and ma ny in the crowd make out complete lists of them, for circulation at the breakfast table or in the division-room upon the following morning, when they form the sole topic of discussion throughout the college. Usually, the names are first printed in the Courant of the Wednesday following; though for a year or two past some of the city dailies have had the tact to secure them for their next morning's issue. The initiation begins, after the close of the Wooden Spoon Exhibition, at midnight of the following Tuesday, and lasts till about daybreak. The candidates for the ceremony are assembled in a room of the college Laboratory, which is guarded by Bones men, and are singly escorted thence, by two of the latt er, to the hall. As the grim doors open fo r each new member, there are sounds of a fish horn, as of many feet hurrying up an uncarpeted stairway, as of a muffled drum and tolling bell, - all mingling in a sort of confused uproar, like that from a freshman initiation a good many miles away. Perhaps, while being led to the hall, a candidate may pass between rows of neutral Juniors or other college men, some of whom may \"bid him good bye,\" with expressions of congratulation and good will, if they think his election deserved, or insult and revile him, if their belief goes in the contrary direction. There is usually someone to flash a dark lantern upon each approaching candidate, and, if he makes no other personal comments, to at least shout forth his name, for the edification of the rest. To all this the Bones men of course pay no attention. It"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"perhaps takes an hour or more thus to initiate the fift een candidates; and when the self-constituted leader of the outside hangers on announces that \"the last man's in\", his followers agree that the fun is over, and sullenly disperse. If they stayed longer perhaps they might hear songs sung to strange old tunes, and the tones of the orator's voice, and the applause which follows it, and the prolonged cheers for \"the Skull and the Bones\". And of course there is a supper. Every resident graduate at tends the initiation, as well as many from New York and elsewhere, some of whom come to town as early as election night; and the initiation itself, at least the outside part of it, is conducted by gradua tes alone. Long ago, it is said, the initiation took place on the evening of Presentation Day. \"The annual convention of the Order\" is held on the evening of Commencement. Three weeks previous to this, - which, of late years, is therefore at the time of the first regular meeting, two nights after initiation, - a printed invitation is sent to every living member of \"the Club “, whose whereabouts are known. This invitation is upon the first page of a sheet of note paper. Below the society cut is the date - for example. \"Thursday evening, July 22, 1869\" - of Commencement night: followed by VI. S.B.T.;\" a Latin quotation, playing upon the word \"Bones\"; the signature of the secretary, and th e date. Upon the third page is the list of new members, printed alphabetically in old-English text, and surrounded by the black borders, exactly as in the catalogue. of which it in fact constitutes a new \"P.\" and \"D.\" Each one who receives it, by fitting the new leaf to his catalogue, thus keeps the same perfect from year to ye ar. These pages are doubtless stereotyped, and preserved by the society, whose entire catalogue is thus always kept in readiness for the printer. With this invitation and catalogue-page, is also sent a printed slip specifying the exercises of Commencement week. A card-size photograph of the new members, grouped - in front of an antique clock whose hands point to the hour of eight - about a table on which lies a skull, is also sent to graduates, at this time or afterwards. In the picture, the thigh bones are held by certain members, - sometime_ the tablecloth has the emblems embroidered upon it, and the whole arrangement of the group is a pparently signifi cant. Official notes to old members are written upon black bordered paper of the catalogue size. with or without the society cut at the head; and society communication= sent through the mails are often enclosed in black-edged e nvelopes. - bearing at the end a printed request to the postmaster to return them to the society's post-office box if not delivered within a certain time. - sealed with a skull and bones and the letters \"S.C.B.,\" impressed upon bl ack wax. Bones men never display in their college rooms any posters or other reminders of their society, - though it is rumored that actual skulls were formerly used for this purpose, - but graduates often keep on the walls before them a richly-framed photographic group of th e classmates who made up their own special \"D.\", - th e picture being simply an enlargement of the card photograph before noted. As specimen jokes from the convention invitations the following may be quoted: \"Nisi in bonis amicitia esse non potest\" (Cic. de Am. 5.1); \"Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris\" (Virg. Georgs. 1497); \"Quid dicam de ossibus? Nil nisi bonum\"; and, in 1856, at the time of erecting the hall, \"Quid dicam de ossibus? (Cir. de Nat. Decorum. II. 55.) O fortunati, quorum jam moenia surgunt!\" (Virg. A.En. I. 430). At the head of the editorial column of the city dailies, on Commencement morning, was usually displayed the \"322 VI. S.B.T.\" notice, between parallel black rules, but for the past few years the practice has been abandoned. Up to about th e same time printed announcements of the place and time of the Commencement meeting, headed by the cut, were posted about college, and upon the notice-boards of the different churches, a few days in advance. Formerly, too, similar warnings were printed, in connection with the society cut, among the advertisement of the city papers. As their hall is called \"the Temple\" by Bones men, a current guess - and a wrong one - inte rprets \"S.B.T.\" as \"Skull and Bone s Temple\". A more likely reading makes \"T.\" stand for \"time\", and so interprets the noti ce, \"Six minutes before eight\", - the hour eight being \"Bones time\". The meetings are held on Thursday evening, commencing exactly at eight o'clock, and every acting member is obliged to be in attendance from that time until the adjournment, at two or three in the morning. The society formerly had a way of marching from its hall in dead silence, - tramp, tramp, tramp, - to the north entry of North College, where it might leave a man or two, and so on, silently, in front of the row, growing smaller as it passed the different buildings, until at the sout h entry of South the few who were left disbanded. Formerly, too, it was customary, before breaking up, to sing a college song whose refrain was, \"And I shall be his dad\"; but this practice, for lack of voices perhaps, was abandoned some years ago. A Bones Senior is never seen about New Haven after eight o'clock of a Thursday evening. Nothing but actual sickness ever keeps him from his society, except it be absence from town, - and those who have been absent are apt to appear for the first time at Friday morning chapel. A good share of the fresh graduates who are residents, and many of the older ones, are also ordinarily in attendance at the re gular weekly meetings. Aside from the annual convention on Commencement night, there are two other \"bums\" held during the year, - one each at about the middle of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the first and second terms - which bring many graduates from out of town. These usually reach the city just before the meeting, and leave it on the midnight trains, so that their coming and going is not known to out- siders, except from the hotel registers or a chance contact upon the street. Each Bones man has a nick-name by which he is known to his initiated classmates. One or two of these names, probably official titles. are retained from year to year, but most of them change with the classes, and are apparently conferred according to individual peculiarity or caprice. A ll members of the society are also spoken of among themselves by a certain general title; another is conferred upon members of the other senior society, and a third is bestowed upon the neutrals. As these titles, especially the latter, might convey a wrong impression if generally known, they are not mentioned here. The society - itself, among its members, is known as \"Eulogia,\" or the \"Eulogian. Club\". It is believed to have little or no regard to any formal, written constitution, but to be governed chiefly by tradition in its customs and usages. The hall is reputed to be a sort of repository for old college mementos; like the \"first college bell\", the original \"bully-club\", the constitutions of defunct societies, etc., which are all said to be pr eserved there; and when anything of the kind disappears, this is surmised to be its final destination. Though Thursday night is the regular time of meeting, when attendance is compulsory, the hall is generally frequent ed on Saturday and other nights also, and is often visited in the day time besides. An old member often go es there as soon as he reaches town, especially, if in quest of information in regard to classmates who were formerly associated there with him. At convention time, the members who cannot in person attend, send to the society such facts as to their whereabouts and occupations for the year, as may interest old classmates and friends; and their letters are filed away for future reference. Every book or pamphlet written by a member is also preserved in the society archives; and its collection of printed and manuscript \"Yalensia\" is said to be very complete. To discover the exact meaning of the inevitable nu meral \"322,\" has long been a problem for college mathematicians. According to some, :: signifies \"1832,\" or the year the society was founded; others make :c \"3 + 2 + 2\" or \"7,\" which is said to be the number of \"foun ders\" in the class of '33, who persuaded the other eight to join them in making up the original fifteen; still another surmise sets it at \"3X2X2\", or \"12.\" which might refer to the midnight hour of breaking up, or something equally mysterious; while a fourth guess interprets it to mean \"the year 322 B.C.\", and connects it with the name s of Alexander or Demosthenes. What these heroes may have in common with the Skull and Bones society, asid e from departing this life on or just before the year in question, is not very plain; but it is pretty well established that Bones \"322\" refers to that year B.C., whatever may be its additional significance. While the clas s of '69 were in college the hall, according to report, was twice broken into by neutrals, and strange storie s were circulated of the wonderful mysteries there discovered by the interlopers. It is probably a fact that these men did really enter the hall, through the skylight in the roof; but there is no reason for trusting their own account of their exploits any further than this, since, if, as is not unlikely, the ar- rangement of things inside prevented their making any important discoveries, they would of course invent a sufficient number of suppositious mysteries, to clear themselves of the reproach of having ven t ured upon a fool's errand. None of their statements, therefore, have been thought worth repeating here. A surreptitious visit, real or pretended, was hardly necessary as a preliminary to assuring the college - .hat \"Bones keeps its most valuable documents locked up in an iron safe,\" since the same fact holds good for every society after sophomore ,.'ear. \"Scroll and Key\" is the name of the other senior soci ety, which was founded nine years later than its more famous rival, that is to say, in 1841, by a dozen members of the class of '42. Popularly it is known as \"Keys,\" though this abbreviation has only come into general use within .he last half-dozen years. Its pin, of plain gold, represents a key lying across a scroll, and its wood-cut simply copies it. The design is such that t is difficult to tell the right side from the wrong, and the cut, when printed bottom upwards, as it often is, is rarely noticed as possessing other than its ordinary look. The original badge was a rectangular gold plate, of the same size and shape as the old Bones pin, whereon were engraved an eagle, poised above, suspending a scroll, and a right hand below, grasping a key. This is still worn, by a singl e member at a time, in :)lace of the usual scroll and key, presumably as a mark of office, like society pr esident or something of the sort. The letters \"C.S.P.,\" 'C.C.J.,\" are always printed with the society cut, - the former above, t he latter below it, - and with it usually serve as the only introduction to the lists of members printed in the Banner and elsewhere, though the name"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"\"Scroll and Key\" is sometimes prefixed. The Bones lists, on the other hand, are always headed with the full name of the society. The posters which, until within a few years, were put up about the college yard and elsewhere at Commencement s eason, for the benefit of g raduates, displayed an eagle poised above the ordinary emblems, with -o print - in addition to the inevitable letters - except the day and our of the meeting, - \"9 P.M.,\" perhaps, - or the numeral \"142,\" A small, seal-like wood-cut of the society, displays the clasped hands upon an open scroll, with \"Adelphoi\" in Green capitals at the top, 1852\" below, and at the bottom two hieroglyphic characters, the one like a Gothic \"T,\" the other like an old style Greek \"T,\" while the only --ace of the key is its head, which projects from the top of the scroll. Anothe r, steel-engraved, seal, represents the eagle, looking down from above upon the central scroll and key, upon which the letters are indicated, while an open right hand reaches up from below. The framework of the devi ce is made up of fifteen oblong links, and its shape cannot be better described than by saying that if there we re sixteen links it would be an eight-pointed star; as it is, the ten lower links make up five points, but the uppe r five - in place of the six, which would make the remaining three - are simply rounded together. This, too, was the shape of the inner frame-work of the old gold plate badge. The present pin has been said to be plai n, because the eagle and hand, faintly outlined upon it, do not change this general appearance. Neither of the senior badges have th eir owners' names or anything of the sort engraved upon their backs. The invitations to the \"Z.S.\" - or; \"bum\" held at the middle of the first and second terms - are printed within a scroll like design from which the key is absent; or else with the ordinary cut at the head of the note. The company of the \"brother\" is simply requested upon the appointed evening, and he is directed to answer the secretary. which officer is designated by the letter \"G,\" and is his \"in truth.\" Aside from these initial letters, there is no mystery about the affa ir, which is either printed in gilt, or, if in black, has mourning bands about the edges of the page. All societ y communications are also forwarded in black edged \"return\" envelopes, as in the case of Bones, sealed in black wax with the society emblems and letters. There have been several editions of the society catalogue; a nd it is probable that a printed list of the elections is forwarded each year to every old member, in conn ection with the invitation to the celebration of Commencement night. A card-size photograph of each new gr oup of fifteen is doubtle ss similarly distributed, either then or afterwards. In this pi cture, the central figure holds a large gilt model of the society badge, - the six letters being indicated on the sc roll, - and each of the end men grasps a large key pointed towards the center of the group. Eight are seated, including the three mentioned, and the remainder are standing, but the position of each individual is probably not significant. Enlarg ed photographs of the same sort are handsomely framed and hung in the rooms of graduate= The annive rsary of Commencement night used to be announced among the ordinary advertisements of the city papers, in connection with the society cut. More recently, at the head of their editor, - &' columns of Commencement morning, \"C.S.P. - P.V.S. P .M. - C.C.J.,\" or something of the sort, appeared, between double rules of black. But this practice has now been abandoned. The hall hitherto (since 1847, when the house where it stayed was destroyed by fire) occupied by the society is in the fourth story of the Leffingwell Building, corner of Church and Court streets, across from the Tontine Hotel. The headquarters of the Yale \"law depa rtment\" are upon a lower floor of the same building, and a Masonic lodge-room divides the upper story with Keys. Judged from the outside, this hall must at the most be limited to two not very large rooms, and the Keys me n, when assembled in force, be cribbed, cabined and confined together in uncomfortably cl ose proximity. This old order of thi ngs, however, has recently come to an end, and Keys is now in possession of a hall, far supe rior in costliness and archite ctural beauty, not only to Bones hall, but to any college-society hall in America. It stands on the north-west corner of College and Wall streets, and its erection had been planned and talked a bout for a dozen years or more. At midnight of Thursday, Nov. 25, 1869, - the date of the fall \"Z.S.,\" - the soci ety, graduates and all, marched to the vacant lot, round which they formed a ring, while prayer was offered, and a society-song sung, after which, a graduate with a silver spade formally broke ground for the new edifice. Then came the singing of the \"Troubadour\" song, and the procession, dangling its keys, silently moved back to the old quarters on Church street. Only the foundation of the building was laid before the setting in of winter; but the work was resumed the following May, and rapidly pushed to completion; and it is presumed that the formal ceremonies of entering and taking possession will be celebrated at the next Commencement. The struct ure has a front of 36 feet on College street, with 6 feet of ground each side, and is 55 feet long, with an open space of about 20 f eet before and behind, in other words, it stands in the center of a lot 48 by 92. Its height is perhaps 35 feet. The light yellow Cleveland stone is the chief material of which it is composed. This is set off by thin layers of dark blue marble, while four pillars of Aberdeen granite, with marble cappings, sustain the thr ee projecting arches in front . Each arch surrounds a narrow opening, provided with three bu ll's eyes for the admission of air. Be low the central arch are a pair of paneled, massive iron doors, to which entrance a flight of half-a-dozen stone steps leads up from either side."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Five similar arches, though w ithout projections or support s, serve to adorn and ve ntilate each side, and a corresponding number of closely protected scuttle-windows communicate with the cellar below. Rows of short pillars - four at each end, six at each side - surround the top, - the central two at the rear end serving to hide the chimneys, - and a couple of stars are cut out in the stone between every pair of them. The architect was Richard M. Hunt of New York, and the builders were Perkins & Chatfield of New Haven. The value of the entire property cannot be much less than $50,000, and it is to be presumed that a good share of that amount has already been raised by the society. The \"Kingsley Trust Association,\" which is the legal style thereof, was incorporated at the May, 1860, session of the State Legislature, in the names of John A. Porter, of '42, William L. Kingsley of '43, Samuel C. Perkins of '48, Enos N. Taft of '51, Lebeus C. Chapin, George E. Jackson, and Homer B. Sprague of '52, Charlton T. Lewis of '53, Calvin G. Child and Josiah W. Harmar of '55, and Edward G. Mason and Mason Young of '60. These comprise it s best known names, and were perhaps chosen on that account, since only the president, Mr. Kingsley, is a resident of the city. In the Yale Banger of 1845, published by the Sigma Theta Sophomores, is a burlesque of the Keys cut, representing the Scroll as a \"Declaration of Independence from the Scull and Bone,\" signed by the \"great seal\", which consists of a view of the historical fox reachi ng after the equally celebrated sour grapes. This probably represents, with substantial accuracy, the motive which originated Keys. Its founder, not being lucky enough to secure elections to Bones, determin ed to start in business upon their ow n account, and hence the society. Its ceremonies, customs, hours of meeting, etc., have all be en patterned after those of Bones, and the nearer it approaches to its model the more of a success it is judged to be, both by its own members and by the college at large. Its existence for the first dozen years was appare ntly a precarious one. In only three classes before 1852 did it obtain the regular number of members (15), which Bones has never varied in electing, but ranged from nine - the lowest, in '51 - to fourteen. Since that tim e exactly fifteen names for each class have always been printed in its public lists, and since 1860 exactly fifteen men and no more have joined the society from each class. Previous to the latter date, it was a common thing to give out one or two or more class or secret elections, so that in some classes there have been se venteen or eighteen members, and almost all the classes which at first fell below the regular number, now appear in the catalogue with their full complement of fifteen names apiece. The men who accepted these after-elections to the society usually disp layed their badge like the others, though sometimes the fact of their membership was kept a secret and they were not allowed to wear them about the college, not until after graduation Hence in every class to the pres ent day there are almost always one o• two men, who are believ ed by many to be \"secret members\" of Keys. because, being friends of the \"crowd,\" they naturally associate with :as they would were there no such society in exis tence. It is also rumored, with less probability, that notable men are sometimes chosen as honorary members. George Vanderhoff, the reader, is one of them, according to the authority of the Banger, which, however, may have meant the statement for a joke . Similar rumors are also sometime; starte d in regard to Bones, but are far less generally credited, and are probably altogether groundless. Ce rtain it is that the fact of there being a secret or honorary member, of there being more or less than fifteen members from each and every class since 1833, has never been in a single case authenticat ed. Up to as recent a date as 1860, Keys had great di fficulty in making up its crowd, rarely being able to secure the full fift een upon the night of giving out elections, but, by dint of electioneering and \"packing\" in the interval between that time and initiation night. managed - after 1851 - to swing out the orthodox number of new badges upon Pres entation morning. Probably it would have given pledges in advance, like the lower-class societies, save that in those days any one standing the slightest chance for Bones preferred it to a . 'sure thing on\" the other society. The true Caesar-or-no-one sentiment seems to have had full sway, and the best men of the class who di d not secure Bones elections apparently preferred to go through senior year as neutrals rather than as members of a confessedly inferior society. The proportion of \"big men\" among the neutral Seniors was cons equently much greater then than in these latter days. Keys, in fact, up to the time when it attained its twenty-first birthday, occupied a position in college regard very much analogous to that more recently held by the Diggers' society, to be described hereafter. It is only within the last lustrum that it has come to be a rival of Bones, and that the half-loaf sentiment has grown common, which prompts a man when his chances for the latter ar e spoiled, to \"lay\" diligently for the former. The Keys mode of giving out elections - as well as the rest of its customs - corresponds as nearly as possible to the practice of Bones. Formerly the fifteen members, each carrying a key some two feet in Length, in a body silently marched to the rooms of the men who had . b e en chosen; and then the leader - possibly displaying the large gilt scroll-and-key model before mentioned - ma y have said simply, \"Do you accept?\" Of late, however, the practice is for two members, - one s Senior, the other a graduate, - each carrying one of the exaggerated"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"keys, to proceed together to the room of each chosen man. The Senior ra ps sharply with his key upon the door, and, both stepping in, says, \"I offe r you an election to the so-called Scroll and Key. Do you accept?\" If t he answer is Yes, both Keys men shake the Junior by the hand, and --amp back to their hall, where the result of the first election is r eceived before the party start out to confer th e second, and so on for the others. On this account the elections progress much more slowly than in the case of B ones, and more opportunities are given to the rabble in the yard to yell \"Keys! Keys! Keys!\" and surge about the bearers of those implements, whose approach is usually announced, by self-stationed outposts, in the neighborhood of the State House steps. In 1868, all the Bones elections had been given out for more than an hour, and the packed Keys crowd\" of '69; had begun to feel a trifle nervous, when t he first key-bearers appeared in th e yard. There seems to be no very great significance in the order in which the elections are conferred, except that the one first received is perhaps to be interpreted as especially h onorable; but on the other hand this is sometimes offered to a man, who is by no means the society's first choice, in order if possible to anticipate Bones in securing him. The initiation takes place at the same time as the other one, and like it lasts till morning. The rendezvous for the candidates is probably some room in the neighborhood of the hall, at all events is outside the college yard, and as the hall is not so convenient to the colleges as that of Bones the neutrals pay less attention to what takes place there on initiation night . Visitors who may be stopping at the Tontine Hotel on the night of Wooden Spoon, however, seldom sleep very soundly, if their room s chance to be situated upon the north side of the building. Resident and other graduates attend the initia tions, and the regular meetings also. - though to a less extent than in Bones, - and the rule requiring the presence of active members on Thursday nights from eight o'clock till two, is also strictly enfor ced. An absent member of '68, suspected of make-believe sickness, was one time forcibly hurried off to the meeting by two classmates, who rushed up from the hall for that purpose, with a great display of crossed keys; and the procedur e may be gone through with in other instances which excite less attention than did that, - though the cases where it is necessary to enforce discipline are of course uncommon. At the close of its meetings, the society was in the habit of marching up through the green, past the State House, to the college yard, singing on the way, or just before disbanding, the well-known song, \"Gaily the Troubadour touched his Guitar.\" T hough this was always finely done, a nd very acceptable to all who heard it, the faculty - induced, it is said, by the discordant howlings of the \"Stones men\" - included Keys in the general edict promulgated last year against society : singing, and ordered its discontinuance. The current traditions in regard to Keys are not very numerous, nor is the belief in its mysterious origin wide-spread, as in the case of Bones. Its letters are supposed to signify: \"Collegium Sanctum Pontificum; Collegium Conservat Jupiter.\" Bone; having set up Demosthenes as its patron sa int, Keys seemed deter-mined to \"go one better\" and claim the recognition of great Zeus himself. \"Zen ome\" is one the society words supposed to possess mysterious significance. According to rumor, a magnificent stuff eagle forms one of the chief decorations of its hall; though as this report originated with a '66 neutral who professed to have \"been there,\" not much reliance should be placed upon it. Keys, like B ones, also keeps the photographs of its members, a library, paintings, pictures, obsolete society badges, old colle ge mementos, and general memorabilia. A third senior society also existed during the time that the class of '6g was in college. Its name, taken from its badge, was \"Spade and Grave.” The spade, partly thrust into the grave, rested upon the footstone of the same, and upon the headstone was represented a crown, - gold of course being the material of the entire pin. The grave was perhaps a Little more than an inch in length, and the badge had one or two variations in size and shape. The \"Bed and Broom,\" it was at first called by outsiders; and, by the more respectful ones, the society was known as \"Graves,\" and its members as \"Graves men. \" None of these -names were ever popular, however, and \"Diggers\" soon came to be the on.\" , , : , title by which the society or it s members were referred to.

The Bones editors meanwhile issued the February number, - with an explanation of their action printed in pl ace of the obnoxious \"leader,\" but otherwise unchanged, - and duly pub lished the two remaining numbers of their term, still keeping the five original names at the head of the ti tle-page, as if nothing had happened.

The immediate cause which banded them together in the scheme was a quarrel in the class of '64. Of the five Yale, Lit. editors in that class, three had been chosen to Bones and two were neutrals. One of these two published, as a leading article in the magazine fo r February of that year, a piece called \"Collegial In- genuity,\" reflecting on the mode by which men may worm their way into Bones, and, it was claimed, making personal insinuations against a particular member of that society; and on this latter ground the Bones editors, who formed a majority of the five, voted to suppress the article, and requested its writer to produce another to take the place of it, - themselves meanwhile seizing upon all the printed copies.

Thus, for three months, there were two issues of the Lit. each of which claimed to be the \"re gular\" one. The Bones editors were rea lly in the right, as the class had no legal power to interfere in the matter, and the three magazines issued by the other editors have been known as the '`second issue.\" The five members of that se cond editorial board of '64 have the credit of founding Diggers,' and they with ten other classmates first sw ung out the Spade and Grave badge at the beginning of the summer term of that year. On the Thursday before Pr esentation Day, elections were given out to fifteen members of '65, who were the first Diggers to have their names in print (in the Banner of the following autumn). The grave scene in \"Hamlet,\" wherein the digge r tosses up the skull and bones with his spade, is said to have suggested the badge as a fit emblem to typify the hostility of the new society to the old one and its power ultimately to work the overthrow of the haughty Skull and Bones itself. Its hall was in the Lyon Building, on Chapel street, on the same floor with that of Gamma Nu; was supplied with common iron doors without and a billiard table within; and was reputed to be elegantly furnished, and among other things to have one of its rooms entirely covered with black velvet. In February, 1870, as already stated, its premises were taken possession of and have since been occupied by the sophomore society of Theta Psi. Its wood cut was simply a copy of its badge; and the same design, enlarged, carved in black-walnut and mounted in a frame of the same wood, was displayed in the rooms of members, as a sort of poster; though the practice was not much in vogue after the first year or two. The society started under a cloud, and never emerged from it, but rather seemed to fall deeper and deeper into its shade the older it grew. It was always despised and looked down upon. Even those who joined it, in many cases cursed and ridiculed it by turns, up to th e very moment of accepting their elections. In spite of careful packing and electioneering in advance, it always had difficulty in making up its crowd on the same"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"night with the other societies and it always had elections refused. No one standing the least chance for Bones or Keys could be got to go to it, and the best of those left out by these societies preferred to remain neutrals altogether. Psi U men used to boast that no member of their society ever became a Digger; and the four classes between the first and last were certainly composed exclusively of Delta Phi and DKE men. There was, however, one member of Psi U among the founders, and four in '69 accepted elections, - much to the chagrin of their comrades. Everyone sneered at the society, including many of course who would gladly have joined it had they been able; but the scrubbiest neutral of them all would affect to take offense were such an idea hinted at, and stoutly assert, that, \"had the Diggers ventured to offer him an election, he would have indignantly hurled back the insult in th eir faces!\" This show of independence afte r election time is past is quite a common thing; but the men of '69, even as Juniors, used to shout a sort of chorus, \"Todtengraber ist gut,\" to the tune of \"Truncadillo;\" they equipped a burlesque `spade and grave\" in the college yard one day; and in other ways so defied the powers above them that it became a probl em whether the Diggers of '68 could secure any successors. There was the usual amount of electioneering and packing, but on election night only three men could by the most entreaties be secured, from the indefi nite number to whom elections were offered; so these three were released and no new Digger pins were swung forth upon the morning of Presentation Day. The next public appearance of the society was on the first Friday morning of th e following October, when fifteen senioric shirt bosoms were adorned by as many ne w badges, the design being a crown from within which projected the ends of a crossed sword and scepter. This was superseded th e following term by a larger sized pin of the same pattern. By a pretty thorough canvassing of the class, in the three months' interval, these new members had been raked together, and induced to \"run\" the society for a year, in the hope that under a changed name the same old story could not be told concerning th em. At least half of them were secretly pledged and initiated before Commencement, and wore the old Grave badge during vacation, in lo calities where they would be unlikely to meet with Yale undergraduates. From the headstone of this old badge, it will be observed, the crown itself was taken. Above the old cut, in the Ba nner, :he name \"Spade and Grave\" was printed in full; while above the new crown design were simply the letter s, \"S.L.M.\" (popularly translated \"Slim\" or \"Slimy\"), which had not before been made public, though reckoned among the original mysteries of Diggers'. Freshmen spoke of - _he society as \"Crown and Scepter,\" or \"Sword and Crown,\" but upper-class men clung relentlessly to the old title, and the doom of Diggers' was sealed. Its usual arts were wasted upon the class of '70 not one of them would pledge, either before, on, or after, election night; and so, after a precarious existence of five years, it was forced to give up the hopeless fight and the ghost. Like Keys', its customs were all modeled as closely as possible after :hose of Bones, which it was to spade out of existence so quickly. Three men always came up from the hall to give out each election, two of the trio walking abreast in front, and the third following close upon their rear. A dark lantern or a club was often carried by one of them. The yell and outcries with whic h the rabble greeted the appr oach of Digger election carriers were far more prolonged and uproarious than in the case of the other societies. The Juniors upon whom they called would be invoked with such cries as \"Kick 'em out, Jim!\" \"Oh Tom! Don’ be a Digger!\" \"Shut your door on 'em Jack! Don't let 'em fool you!\" and so on; while the Diggers themselves would be treated to all manner of compliments and personal attentions, such as were never bestowed upon the other election carriers. \"How can I leave Thee,\" was the song sometimes sung out side at the close of the meetings, either while marching, or on arriving at the college yard; otherwise the procession silently tramped up Chapel street to South College, and so on in front of the row, dropping its men at each entry until none we re left. It was believed to have had a good many secret members, - even including some from the Scientific School, - and several '63 men are known to have belonged to it. After the change of base in 1868, the graduate members ceased to wear the old Grave badge. The society was unincorporated, and had neve r printed any catalogue. Its letters were supposed to represent the motto, Sceptrum Ligonibus Mors. Not only do senior-society men never mention their own so ciety in the presence of others, but then never even refer to the existence of a rival societ y, and when an outsider mentions this in their presence, even to a third party, they appear to take offense, and perhaps withdr aw. So, too, they are offended if a man sings, or even hums the air, of the songs which they sometimes sing in public; though these are familiar melodies, and have long been procurable in the form of sheet music. This same fact holds true, to a lesser extent, in the case of the junior and sophomore societies. A certain air gets in a measure identified with a particular society song; and as members of the society never use it except in singing together, they dislike to hear it whistled by an outsider. A Sophomore, for instance, a few years"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ago, by persistently whistling, \"AI on a summer's da y,\" would probably have injured his chances of a DKE election; and, in the case of Psi U, perhaps the same would still be true of one who should be constantly humming, \"In a few days.\" Senior society men may also refuse to speak when passing in front of their hall, and in some cases to notice a neutral classmate whom they may chance to meet after eight o'clock of a Thursday evening. An instance is related in the class of '67 of two Bones men who brought from their meeting a sick classmate and put him to bed in his room, without paying any attention to his neutral chum who was there present, though he was also a classmate with whom they were on friendly terms. This exaggerated display of secrecy is quite a modern ou tgrowth, however, being altogether unknown to the old members of fifteen or twenty years ago. and it attained its highest pitch in the class just mentioned, - since when, senior-society men have conduc ted themselves much more sensibly. For many evident reasons, the costs of membership in a senior society are much greater than in any other, though most of their money is raised by voluntary contributions, and a man eligible in other respects is not kept out on account of his poverty. On the other hand, a man's wealth of course ad ds to his chances of election in senior years more than in any other. The annual running expenses of a so ciety, in which graduates take so prominent a part, cannot and ought not to be borne by fifteen men alone, and there are doubtless permanent funds whose income is available for such purposes, - at least in Bones, whose proper ty is fully paid for. To increase this fund, almost every old member sends in an annual contri bution, according to his means, for five or ten years after graduation day. It is in senior year alone that the neutrals largely out number the society men, that they have nothing to hope for in the way of class elections. and that they are not overawed by the presence of upper-class men. These three circumstances combine to foster in some of them a sort of reckless hostility towards these societies, such as is not felt towards those of the earlier years. This displays itself in a variety of ways. The conduct of the neutrals when the senior elections are given out has been already described, and the fact notice, at least by implication, that they never in the least interfere with the similar ceremonies of the other societies. Nor yet do they ever attempt to break into the halls of the latter. It was in the class of '66 that this hostility-first definitely displayed itself, in the institution of a sort of a mock \"society\" called \"Bowl and Stones,\" - the name being a take-off on that of Bones, and the duties of its members being simply to range about the colleges at a late hour on Thursday night, or early on Friday morning when the senior societies disbanded, singing songs in ridicule of the latter, blocking up the entries, and making a gene ral uproar. The refrain of one song, to the tune of \"Bonnie Blue Flag\" was \"Hurrah! Hurrah! for jolly Bowl and Stones;\" of another, to the tune of \"Babylon,\" \"Haughty Bones is fallen, and we gwine down to occupy the Skull.\" Another function of the `Stones men\" was to offer bogus elections to simple minded classmates , or even to under-class men, - whom they were sometimes able to \"sell.\" In the class of '67 they were at their worst, and wantonly smashed bottles of ink upon the front of Bones hall, and tore the chains from it s fence. On the Thursday morning which preceded the Presentation Day of 1868, the Stones men of that class posted up a comic handbill, purporting to show the \"order of exercises\" which would be observed by the seni or societies in giving out their elections that evening. There was some little wit employed in the composition of this notice, and it was the only thing emanating from the \"society\" that was not at once weak and discreditabl e. The modified name, \"Bull and Stones,\" then first ap- peared; which form has since been reta ined. Some members of the class of ' 70 even went so far as to procure a small gilt representation of \"a bull\" standing upon \"stone s,\" which was worn as a burlesque badge pin, even in public, and in some cases quite regularly, during the first term of their senior year. Of course there is nothing to this \"society\" except what has been told; its \"members\" are few or many according to the state of the weather; and any neutral senior who is ready to join a crowd for making an uproar on Thursday night is, from that fact only, a good and regular \"Stones man.\" Indeed , the name has of late come to be accepted as a synonym for any senior-society neutral whatever; and ever y one not elected to either of the two societies is said to \"belong to Stones.\" At the time of the last initiation, the Stones men seized upon and confiscated for their own use the ice-cream and other good things whic h the confectioner was engaged in taking into Bones hall. Since then, one or two projected \"raids\" of the sa me sort have been frustrated by the presence of a policeman. Now-a-days, Thursday night is the favorite time for the more depraved Stones men to \"go off on a bum\" together, and afterwards wake the echoes of the college yard with their discordant howling. That this \"society\" showed no signs of existence in the class of '69 was perhaps due in great measure to the existence of another more creditable organization, some of whose members would probably, save for it, have been leading \"Stones men.\" On the morning of Presentation Day, 1868, fourteen men, who had been neutrals since freshman year, were noticed to wear upon their shirt bosoms, gilt coffin lids, about an inch in length."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Their names were printed in the annuals of the next term, under the \"senior-society\" heading, beneath a wood- cut of the badge, above which appeared the letters \"E .T.L.,\" but no name. They were spoken of as `Coffin men,\" or \"ETL's,\" when mentioned at all. and, so far as known, met quite regularly on Thursday nights, perhaps in some room rented for the purpose. They said nothing in regard to themselves or the regular senior societies, and they attempted to give no elections in the class of'70. The society passed in the class for a jokes but, for the negative benefit it effected in restraining some who would otherwise have been uproarious, as well as for the positive advantages it may have conferred upon all its members, it deserves to be held in grateful recollection. Perhaps somewhat similar to this was the \"TeaKettle\" society, established in the class of '53, which has left nothing behind it save the announcement of its birth in the Lit. Another short lived association was the \"Sword and Crown\" which was existing :n 1843 with fifteen members. Its badge was a rectangular gold plate, upon which, within an ornamental border, the appropriate emblems were engraved. These did not much resemble the last badge of the Diggers, as the crown was a much more elaborate and highly ornamented affair, and the sword and scepter were crossed behind rather than within it. An existing poster showing a wood-cut of the simple emblems bears the direct, \"S.T.G. 8.30 a.m.\" Another poster, which perhaps had no connection with this or any other society, shows the th ree letter= \"Iota Kappa Sigma,\" printed in heavy black type, with \"24 D\" appended. Still another, represents a naked figure just trundling over - precipice a wheelbarrow in which are loaded a skull and some bone` a nd a scroll and a key and a star and a dart. The \"Star and Dart\" society was established in 1843, and appare ntly occupied a position somewhat analogous to the present one of Bull and Stones, though it really had a7 organization of some sort. The frame-work of its rectangular gold-plate badge was an exact copy of that of the Bones pin, and the emblems of the two societies now existing formed the chief part of the engraved central design. The eag le of Keys, that is to say, was represented as fiercely picking to pieces the Skull and Bones at its feet, while a Da rt. appearing in the right upper corner, was about to destroy the eagle, an: a Star in the left upper corner was supposed to denote \"the prosper.-; and final success of the society over its ri vals.\" A woodcut copy of this design surmounted the following notice printed among the advertisements of a Ne w Haven newspaper: \"Nos in vita fratres sumus. C 2954a F. 8 dd Z DL. There will be a general meeting in New Haven on Thursday evening, Aug. 15, 1944. Yale College, Aug. 10.\" Possibly there were other Commencement times at which a similar notice was printed, and doubtless posters to the same effect used also to be disp layed about the college buildings at such seasons. After a period Cc suspended animation, the society was revived in the class of '49, and the members belonging to it in the classes of '50 and '51 (fifteen in one case, eleven in the other) had their names published in the Banner, in connection with the society cut and the numeral \"2954.\" Fr om this publicity, as well as the character of many of the members, it is to be inferred that there was really a little something to the society, and that its existence was not altogether contemptible. Whether it had a hall of its own, and regular weekly meetings and exercises; whether it made any pretensions to equality with the two reputable societies; whether it was so hostile to them as its badge would imply; whether its crowd was made up before, at the same time, of after the other elections were given out; and whether it died by choice or by necessity, - all these things, on the other hand, must remain uncertainties, until some traitorous ex-member th ereof shall reveal to an anxiously expectant world the real history and mystery of the late Star and Dart. Among the many Bones men worthy of mention are: Henry C. Kingsley of '34, treasurer of the college; Prof. Thomas A. Thacker of '35; Col. Henry C. Deming of '36; Attorney General William M. Evarts, Profs. Chester S. Lyman and Benjamin Silliman, of '37; Rev. Dr. Joseph P. Thompson of '38; Provost Charles J. Stille of '39; Prof. James M. Hopping of '40; Gen. William T.S.

The most prominent Keys men have already been mentioned in naming its twelve incorporators, but additional names to be noticed are: Gen. Theodore Runy on of '42; Rev. Dr. Gordon Hall of '43; Robert P. Farris of '47, editor of the Missouri Republican; Rev. John E. Todd of '55; son of Rev. Dr. Todd, the opponent of college secret societies; Sidney E. Morse of '56, publisher of the N.Y. Observer; Gen. John W. Swayne of '56; Dr. Daniel G. Brinton of '58; Prof. Daniel C. Eaton of '60; and Joseph L. Shipley of '61 editor of the Scranton Republican. Five Keys me n and one Digger make up the famous \"Wilbur Bacon crew\" of 1865. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Formerly, when Seniors took a more active part than now in the junior societies, men who did not belong to these were often chosen to the senior societies, but of late a membership in the fo rmer is a necessary stepping stone for admission to the latter; not confessedly, of course, but by the rule which is sure to force a junior society into electing every ma n eligible for election a year later, and to compel every such man to accept such election. It has been noticed of late years that Psi U generally has a majority in Bones, and DKE in Keys, though in '71 Psi U had six men in Bones and nine in Ke ys, to DKE's nine and six. It should not be inferred from this that senior-society men allow their junior year or earlier society connections to prejudice them in electing their successors. They apparen tly have regard for the interest of their senior society simply, and choose those whom they think will most benefit it, without much regard to outside considerations. Much of the excitement over the election of Cochs and Lit. Editors tu rns upon the question of senior societies. Each one of these officers is supposed to \"stand a chance,\" and shortl y after their election the two \"crowds\" begin definitely to be made up. There are always some \"sure men\" to form a nucleus, - the Spoon Man for instance, is always certain of receiving a Bone selection, - and about these the \"Likely\" ones who are not quite so \"sure\" try to \"pack\" themselves. Thus a \"crowd\" is made up in the in terest of each society. Its members \"run\" together constantly, call one another by their first names, and ma ke a great display of familiarity, - especially in the presence of \"their\" Seniors, - as much as to say, \"We can' t be separated. Take all of us or none.\" This sort of thing is practiced chiefly by prospective Keys men, who can make up their crowd with a tolerable certainty that their evident wishes will be respec ted by the society. It is seldom that Keys ventures to keep out more than a single man from a well defined pack , and substitute one of their own choosing in his place. Such a pack really has the power in its own hands, and should the members of it agree to \"stand by one another\" they could of course carry their point; but the refusal of a senior-society election, even conditionally, seems so terrible a thing, that they have rarely the courage to make a di rect demand. Keys, however, has in some instances been obliged to submit to such dictation. The society undoubtedly winks at \"packing,\" and indirectly gives it on occasions its official aid, - though not as frequently nor as extensively as is sometimes reported. There are so many conflicting elements in the Bones crowd that it is never organized into a regular pack, and there is always more doubt as to the way its elections will turn. The nearest approach to a pa ck is when two or three \"sure men\" take it upon themselves to persistently \"run\" another, and make such a display of their fondness for him as to secure his election also. However Bones may allo w its action to be affected indirectly, it will not be dictated to when once its elections have been made up, a nd it is useless for a man to attempt to alter the result by conditionally refusing his election, in favor of or against some particular classmate. Though the Bones crowd may be pretty accurately guessed at for some days before the elections are issu ed, it is the chance of its individuals which are estimated, not of the crowd as such, as in the case of Keys. There is no such general collusion of all the members of the Bones crowd; it is rath er made up of separate cliques of two and threes, and single individuals, who hope for Bones elections, but have not much else in common. The fact that elections to this latter society have been refused in favor of Keys is hence not very difficult of explanation. A man whose chances for Bones are rather doubtful may be willing to throw them away altogether for the sake of the comparatively \"sure thing\" which he gains by joining a p ack for Keys. So, receiving an election to Bones, he is in honor bound to decline it, and cling to the men with whom he had joined his fortunes. It will be found that all the Bones refusals in '67 and '70, over which so much ado was made, came in every case from men previously packed for Keys. Thus, Bones' greater i ndependence and ceremoniousness sometimes work to its own disadvantage. A man may go to Keys for the sake of taking a friend or two with him whose companionship he could not be sure of were he to become a Bones man; and in general one has less uncertainty as to whom he will have to fratern ize with when he packs for the former society. In a direct comparison of the societies, it is seen that Bones in reputation, influence and prestige is altogether superior to its rival; and it seems almost as certain that it must always retain this preeminence. It is, in its main features, essentially unique. No other college society can show so large a proportion of distinguished and successful members. It is probably not too much to add that of the Yale graduates of the past generation who have attained a fair degree of worldly eminence, nearly half will be found to have been included within the mystic fifteens of this organization. Its apparent aim is to secure at once the best of the good scholars, good literary men, and good fellows; the former to bring it dignity and \"tone,\" the latter to preserve its social and convivial character; and its suc cess in equalizing these three elements - one of which is apt to predominate in a society - has been remarkable. It develops in its members, too, a genuine pride and affection, such as they feel in or towards no other society. Men who are careless and frivolous and selfish as to everything else, manifest an earnestness and a generosity where Bones is concerned, that is really surprising. And this, too, in a way not calculated to attract attent ion, nor suggest an appearance of exaggeration or make-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"believe. Keys men, on the other hand, are rather given to displaying their society zeal as much as possible. Old members who come from abroad to attend the \"bums\" are apt to make their presence generally known, and take pains to exhibit the extent of their \"interest.\" Their affection for the society is no doubt genuine enough, but their carefulness in displaying it suggests the idea that its inspiration comes quite as much from an oppressive self-consciousness of the need of \"going one better\" than Bones, as from the simple force of pleasant associations. Since the time, say about 1860, when Keys ca me to be recognized as a reputable society, settled upon an invariable membership of fifteen, and ceased to give out any class, secret , or honorary elections, its policy has seemed to be the making prominent of the social elements, the choosing of good, jolly fellows, - men of ability if possible, but at all events congenial and in the college sense of the word gentlemanly. Ability in the absolute, that is to say, has been accounted of secondary importance as a qualification for membership. Upon a strict and more rigorous adherence to this policy in the future - if it be worth while to express a prevalent college opinion - the success of the society will in great measure depend. In the latter's own chosen field, it can never hope to seriously rival Bones. To th e \"solid,\" thoughtful men of the class - the big scholars and writers - Bones will always be the more attractive, and if Keys enters into competition for them it will as inevitably have to take up with second-rate representativ es of the \"heavy,\" \"respect able\" element, at the same time that, by this very action, it renders itself less al luring to the \"popular men,\" who are and should be its \"best hold.\" If, on the other hand, it has the tact to depart for once from its Bones model, and set up an independent standard of qualifications of its own, it ma y in time gain in its own particular field a recognized pre-eminence. Keys' real \"mission,\" as it seems to an outsi der, is to draw together a genial. gentlemanly crowd, rather than an \"able\" one. If a pleasant, agreeable fellow chances to be possessed of something more substantial than popularity, - if besides being a gentlema n, he be also a scholar, a writer, and energetic worker, - he should of course be all the mo re desirable; yet the first mentione d, more trivial, qualities should be regarded as the essential ones, after all, which recommend him for election. Ability, real or reputed, should never of itself elect a man to Keys. The prestige the society may gain by taking a man simply for his reputation cannot make up for what it thereby loses in attracti veness for \"popular men.\" Keys' great opportunity is, by excluding all others, to make itself the most desirable society for the agreeable, jo lly fellow in every senior class. If it resolutely adopts this \"lay,\" it may, with the help of its hall, ere many years, leave bones in the lurch, so far as \"popular\" men are concerned; and, by occupying an independent field, prevent the possibility of direct comparisons which must always be to its own disadvantage. This seems so manifest that nothing but a foolish overconfidence in its own strength can induce it to engage in a \"straight fight\" on Bones' own chosen field, where, with all the odds against it, it must ever suffer defeat. Bones, on the other hand, would do well to consider whether it will be worth its while much longer to take in men for their popularity and agreeableness simply. It is just here that it has met with its most humiliating rebuffs hitherto, and that it is likely to meet with worse ones hereafter, unless it changes its policy. Four of the five '70 men who rejected; Bones in favor of Keys, were simply \"good fellows,\" who would have been somewhat out of .their element in the crowd of the former society; and the case in the class of %7 was very similar. If Bones should insist more strongly than now upon ability as a prime essentia l in all its members, and upon this basis, modified by a reasonable regard for social qualities and harmoniousness, elect them, it woul d secure itself almost absolutely from having an election rejected, as well as add to its own lasting reput ation, - even at the sacrifice of one of its cherished traditions, which it has managed to perpetuate thus fa r on the whole with a fair share of success. Whether Bones makes this concession with good grace at the outset, or waits to be forced into it by the success of Keys, when the latter shall turn all its energies upon this one point, remains to be seen. But appearances certainly point to the coming, at no distant day, of what may be termed a senior society millennium, when Bones and Keys shall each occupy an undisputed fi eld of its own, and each be recognized as in its own sphere preeminent; and when the only question in a man's mind shall be, \"In which field, on the whole, is supremacy the more desirable?\" Then shall the Death's head be, even more ce rtainly than now, the badge of intellectual superiority in college repute, and the unfolded Scroll be, even more invariably, the emblem of gentlemanly good fellowship and social popularity. It was remarked at the beginning of the chapter that societies like Bones and Keys would be possible only at one other college than Yale, and that as a matter of fact they are peculiar to the latter institution. They are not, however, without imitators. At Columbia College is an \"Axe and Coffin;\" at Michigan University an \"Owl and Padlock;\" and at Wesleyan Univer sity are a \"Skull and Serpent\" and an \"Owl and Wand.\" None of them are of any importance, and with the possible exception of the second, are in every way inferior to the Greek- letter societies connected with their respective institutions. There is no special difficulty in imitating the peculiar names and mummeries of the Ya le senior societies; but the gaining of a similar prestige and influence"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"is quite another matter. It is the high character of their members, not their names and forms and ceremonies, which give the Yale societies their fame. It was a belief in the power of these latter non-essentials that induced the Diggers to persist so long in a worse than hopeless fight. At Yale, the strictly class societies of the first three years supply the machinery by which every class is carefully sifted and its best men are \"brought out\" in readiness for the senior societies. Yet even here, with from one hundred to one hundred and twenty men to pick from, and the three years' sifting process reduced almost to an exact science, it has been absolutely demonstrated that no more than two societies, of fift een men each, can exist. Indeed, it was for a long time a problem whether more than one could live, and even now the two, to be at their best, must occupy somewhat different fields. But at other colleges, where no such cl ass system prevails, where the numbers to select from are much smaller, where the competing societies are mo re numerous, the attempt to ape Bones and Keys can succeed in nothing save in making the w ould-be societies ridicul ous. In view of their real worth, people may be willing to overlook the silly practices of the Yale senior societies; but when mock mystery and cheap ceremonials are the only things which a society has to boast of, it cannot well help falling into contempt. The statement is therefore again repeated that Bones and Keys are peculiarly Yale institutions, genuine out-growths of a system that flourishes nowhere else, the only organizations of the kind existing in the country. In concluding this account of the class societies, it may be well to add a few addi tional facts that are true alike of many or all of them, and to compare directly their general character in the different years. Each society, save Gamma Nu, has a \"grip\" of its own, but society men, in either of the four years, do not generally employ it in greeting one another. It is not a popular de vice with them, and comparatively few would be able, a year or two after graduation, to give the four different grips correctly, were they to try. Many of the active members, even, of these societies cannot remember their grips without an effort, and in junior year, when visitors from other chapters are expect ed, there is need of some prelimin ary practice before the guests can be welcomed in true mysterious fashion. At other colleges the society grips are constantly made use of, and when a Yale man who has forgotten his grip meets an outsi de brother he extends his hand with all the fingers separated, and returns the grip that he receives, in full faith that he has given \"the right one\" and concealed his ignorance. It is easy enough for an outsider to find out from someone or other the reputed grips of the dozen or less societies, and it is more than likely that these are really the true ones in many cases. But the whole matter is made so little of by Yale men that none of thes e peculiar hand shakings are worth describing. In the published report of a recent DKE convent ion, that society announced that it had adopted a new grip and motto, - presumably on account of the discovery of its old ones, a nd probably at the instance or - the outside chapters. Whether the changes were really made, or the announ cement offered simply as a \"blind,\" the result was of course the same. The only two Yale society mottoes that seem to be unknown to outsiders are, oddly enough, those of Delta Kap and Theta Psi. That or the former used to be, aavpo; Kevqw;, and was as well known as Sigma Eps' is at present, but the one which superseded it and is now invogue has been by some miracle prevented from leaking out. Every junior society man can find out without much difficulty the mottoes and \"secrets\" of the other societies in his class, but he feels in duty bound not to make public his knowledge, and the neutrals are generally in ignorance of these matters. At Yale, one society never thinks of breaking into the hall of another, and making public all its mysteries, as is the practice at some of the smaller colleges. It is through these that some of the Yale junior-society secrets are divulged. Chapters which think it a fine thing to steal the constitution and documents of as many rival soci eties as possible, when they chance to gain those of societies which are also rivals at Yale, may forward to their brothers at the latter place their ill-gotten knowledge: knowledge which the latter are usually honorable enough to keep to themselves. It is only in the songs of the first two years that the societies mention the names of their rivals - to ridicule them, of course, but in a good natured way. A secret ballot, upon each candidate separately, in which a singl e blackball rejects, is the mode of election in all these societies. Every society has a janitor whom it allows to wear its badge. While '69 was in college the same individual was at once janito r of Delta Kap, Theta Psi and Psi U, and wore either one of the badges indifferently, though never displaying tw o at a time. A senior-society janitor is not allowed to serve for under-class organizations. The present Bone s janitor is a negro named Robert, who assists the professors in the experiments at the philosophical lectures, and is a sort of college supernumerary. His predecessor, also a black man, died in the service, and was followed to hi s grave by the whole Bones society, resident graduate, solemn professors, and all. The soci eties of the two upper years have boxes at the post office wherein is placed all mail matter directed either to their popular or official, trust association, titles. A letter directed to either of the lower-cla ss societies is exposed to view be side the general-delivery window, until discovered and called for by one of the members. Society men as a rule preserve all their badges, - sometimes, in senior year, mounting their previously gained insignia in a velvet-lined, ornamental frame or case. Quite a"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"number of freshman pins are disposed of, however, when the time for wearing them is past, and some sophomore and a very few junior badges go the same way, but a senior-society pin is kept by its owner until death doth them part. By other college men their junior-s ociety badge, usually the only one they ever possess, is as a rule always preserved, and is in many cases st eadily worn for some years after graduation. Yale men, who were senior neutrals, sometimes display their j unior badge, on special occasions, after graduation, but never the pin of lower society. When a Freshman leaves college he usually takes off his society pin, but a Sophomore, if a society man, is likely to wear his badge for some time after his withdrawal. In taking a general look at the societies of the four years, the first seems a working ground where Freshmen may display their abilities, and induce the Juniors to pledge them; the second, a place where these pledged men as Sophomores may be kept quiet until they are further inspected, and the poor ones got rid of; the third, another working ground of narrower limits, where the select Juniors who have passed safely through two sifting processes may, by making the most of their talents before the Seniors, prevail upon the latter to spare them in the last grand turn of the sieve, and elect them into the fourth, beyond which there is nothing higher. It is a fault of the system that each soci ety save the last is only a stepping stone to the next, and when the last is reached the time left to en joy it in is short indeed. The size of th e classes, and the class feeling thereby engendered, makes any other system impossible, while the system in turn tends to strengthen and perpetrate the class feeling. From his freshman society, a man usually gains considerable solid advantage, and a fair amount of pleasure. The direct benefit of a sophomore-society experience is not very great, and a man loses less by being a neutral this year than any other, - sophomore neutrals being often elected to senior societies, - but still. he does lose something, both in a peculiar sort of \"fun,\" and in general social position. In a third-year society the advantages are many, and are of a general as well as local character. The o ccasions thus afforded for members of different colleges to fra ternize together, the opportunities gi ven for making pleasant acquaintances at unexpected places, are evidently of cons iderable value. A man's interest in his junior society is not as intense or as lasting at Yale as at other colleges, yet it is a ltogether greater than that wh ich he feels toward any lower- class society. One Yale graduate would not be apt to claim introduction to another on the score of belonging to the same junior society, yet, once acquainted for some other reason, this fact would form a sort of bond between them. The attempt to make an outsider realize the overwhelming fascination. which a senior society exerts upon the mind of the average Yale undergraduate, would probably be useless. An election thereto is valued more highly than any other college prize of honor ; and in fact these honors derive a good part of their attractiveness from their supposed efficacy in helping to procure the coveted election. There is nothing in the wide world that seems to him half as desirable. It is the one thing needful for his perfect happiness. And if he fails in gaining it. the chances are that he becomes a temporary misanthropist, that is to say, an ardent \"Stones man.\" Though the advantages of membership are no doubt exaggerated in anticipation, the real benefit gained in belonging to a senior society is cer tainly considerable, - far more valuab le in fact, than that which accrues from membership in any other. Quite aside from the enjoyment of the senior year itself, the facts that in after life a man is thus introduced to the best graduates of the college. wherever he may meet them, and that, whenever he visits New Haven, he is sure of being en tertained by the best of the oldest undergraduates. and instructed as to the doings and whereab outs of the best of his former cla ssmates, - these facts, other things being equal, of themselves make membership in a seni or society especially desirable. College friendships do not at Yale run very closely in society lines. A pair of friends may be brought together or separated by almost numberless society combinations. They may belong to the same society in each of the four years, or in the first and last, or in the second and third, or in none at all, or one may be a society man and another a neutral for all the course, and so on through all the possible permutations. Still, it is pleasant for fri ends to keep in the same societies, and a general tendency of certain crowds to go together, year after year, has been already remarked upon. No neutral as such is looked down upon or avoided by society men. If the latter usually \"run\" together, it is because of similar tastes and proc livities, which would induce them to do so, were no societies in existence. In senior year there is hardly a society man without one or two special friends who are neutrals, and with whom he has quite as much to do as with his own regular associates. Such pairs ofte n chum together than do - two from rival societies; though this sometimes happens a nd previous to senior year is not at all uncommon. Aside from a man's real or reputed ability, good nature, and popularity, a thing which often helps to elect him is his relationship to a former or active member of the so ciety. If a father or an uncle or a brother has preceded him, the fact helps him to follow in their footsteps, especially if they were in any way famous. An older brother in the class above, or even one or two classes re moved, is almost certain to secure the election of a younger one, unless the latter is peculiarly unqualified or obnoxious. This species of favoritism attracts the most attention in the case of the senior societies, into which nearly every year, by his relationship with an older"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"and worthier member, is dragged one man at least who is without other qualifications sufficient to recommend him. The cases of poor men taken in are, by the bye, a good deal more common and noticeable than those of desirable men left out. Every year almost there is a great show of indignation over the injustice in the senior- society elections which bring several big men to grief, yet it rarely happens that the good policy of the society in leaving them out is not vindicated within a twelve month. When fifteen men are to be shut up together for six successive hours, every week, and be thrown in with each other constantly , it is essential that they should be reasonably harmonious if not congenial; and an or ganization whose members should be chosen for their reputation and ability simply, could not be in the right sense of the word a society. Without now discussing whether college opinion always aw ards men the positions they deserve, it may be said, in conclusion, that the society system, viewed as a means for separating those who, for whatever reason, are high in college esteem, from those who, for whatever r eason, are not, must be admitted to be in the main a fair and successful one. No one can reasonably deny that it has this effect, and that the society men of every year are as a class superior in college repute to the neutrals. It would of course be foolish to judge an individual solely by his society connections, but it would be far less foolish than to judge him solely by the number of prizes, or scholarships, or honors he could lay claim to, as is not infrequently the practice. To set up any one arbitrary standards whereby to judge character is ma nifestly unfair, yet, if it is to be done, there is no single test which embraces so many, in making an estimate of a Yale man's importance, as his share in the society system. Blockheads and simpletons certainly find their way into the senior societies, yet there are few generalities of the sort deserving of more confidence than these, that in a Bones man you will find ability and force of character, in a Keys man politeness and genialit y, and in both the most favorable samples of the Yale graduate of the period.
