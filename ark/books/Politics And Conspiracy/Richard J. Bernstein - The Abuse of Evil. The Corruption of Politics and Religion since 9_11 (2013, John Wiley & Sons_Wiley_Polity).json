Elevendays later, the most dramatic terrorist attack in history took place. No one nowdoubts that the world changed on that infamous day. Overnight (literally), wewere bombarded with images and talk of evil. My book Radical Evil was an attemptto comprehend the horrendous evils experienced in the twentieth century. Iwanted to see what we might learn about the meaning of evil from the modernphilosophical tradition. I subtitled the book “A Philosophical Interrogation,”and I interrogated Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Freud, Nietzsche, Levinas, Jonas, andArendt in order to learn what they teach us about the nature of evil. Iconcluded the work with a series of theses. Here is my ﬁrst thesis:“Interrogating evil is an ongoing, open-ended process. Throughout I haveindicated my skepticism about the very idea of a theory of evil, if this isunderstood as a complete account of what evil is. I do not think that such atheory is possible, because we cannot anticipate what new forms of evil orvicissitudes of evil will appear.” I did not realize, at the time, just howprophetic my claim would be.After 9/11, I considered whether I wanted to revise my book, but I decided tolet it stand as I had written it. Since 9/11, evil has become a popular, “hot”topic. Politicians, conservatives, preachers, and the media are all speakingabout evil. Frankly, I have been extremely distressed by the post-9/11 “eviltalk.” I argue that the new discourse of good and evil, which divides the worldaccording to this stark and simplistic dichotomy, is an abuse of evil.Traditionally, the discourse of evil in our religious, philosophical, andliterary traditions has been intended to provoke thinking, questioning, andinquiry. But today, the appeal to evil is being used as a political tool toobscure complex issues, to block genuine thinking, and to stiﬂe publicdiscussion and debate. I argue that what we are now confronting is a clash ofmentalities, not a clash of civilizations. A mentality that is drawn toabsolutes, alleged moral certainties, and simplistic dichotomies stands incontrast to a mentality that questions the appeal to absolutes in politics, thatargues that we must not confuse subjective moral certitude with objective moralcertainty, and that is skeptical of an uncritical rigid dichotomy between theforces of evil and the forces of good. I call this mentality “pragmaticfallibilism.” I also challenge what I consider to be the unjustiﬁed andoutrageous claim that without an appeal to absolutes and ﬁxed moral certaintieswe lack the grounds to act decisively in ﬁghting our real enemies. There is noincompatibility between fallibilism and a passionate commitment to opposeinjustice and immorality. I also argue that the post-9/11 abuse of evil corruptsboth democratic politics and religion. There is no place for absolutes indemocratic politics. And we violate what is most vital in the world religionswhen we uncritically assume that religious faith is a sufﬁcient basis forknowing what is good and evil. There are religious and nonreligiousfundamentalists and fanatics. And there are religious believers and nonreligioussecularists whose beliefs, deeds, and emotions are informed by a robustfallibilism. The clash of mentalities cuts across the religious/secular divide.The stakes are high in this clash of mentalities in shaping how we think and actin the world today – and in the future.I want to thank John Thompson for encouraging me to write this book and Jean vanAltena for her splendid editing. I also want to acknowledge my gratitude toLouis Menand and Farrar Straus Giroux for permission to cite passages from TheMetaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------IntroductionToday our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature.George W. Bush, Address to the Nation,September 11, 2001America has shown its evil intentions and the proud Iraqi people cannot acceptit.Moktada al-Sadr, April 7, 2004What do we mean when we call an event, an intention, a deed, or a human personevil? What are we referring to when we use evil as a noun, when we say “Todayour nation saw evil.” There is something chilling and powerfully emotional whenwe speak of evil. We feel that we know precisely what we intend. There is noambiguity or confusion about what really is evil – even if we are at a loss todeﬁne what we mean. And we also feel that there can be no compromise with evil.We must ﬁght to eliminate it. When challenged to clarify what we mean by evil,we may appeal to other expressions, such as unjust, immoral, wrong, sinful,horrible, wicked, malevolent, sadistic, vicious, etc. But none of these is asstrong, terse, or compact as evil. To add emphasis – to the name the worst – wespeak of absolute, pure, or radical evil. Although we sometimes compare evilsand use expressions such as “the lesser of two evils,” more often we think ofevil in absolute terms. Evil is evil; there are no gradations here.The concern with evil is as old as civilization itself. It is fundamental forall the major religions. Our greatest philosophers, theologians, poets, andnovelists have struggled with the meaning and consequences of evil. It is acentral theme in Plato, St Augustine, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dostoevsky.Theologians and philosophers speak of “the problem of evil,” or the problem of“theodicy” – a word invented by the eighteenth-century philosopher Leibniz. Ifone believes that there is a God who is omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent,then the question arises as to how we can reconcile the appearance of evil withthe existence of such a God. The reason I stress appearance is because somethinkers have denied the reality of evil. Evil is a lack or privation of what isgood; it lacks real existence. Others afﬁrm the reality of evil, but claim thathuman beings, by misusing their free will, are responsible for the evil thatexists in the world: free will, a gift from God, involves the choice of good orevil. Still others have challenged the idea that God is really omnipotent. If wesurvey the historical literature dealing with the “problem of evil,” we ﬁnd thatalmost every possibility has been explored which would reconcile the idea of abenevolent Creator with the existence of evil in this world. There are even somereligious doctrines (considered to be heretical by Christianity) that deny thebenevolence of the Deity. Actually, the traditional “problem of evil” is notconcerned primarily with deﬁning or characterizing the meaning of evil. Rather –whatever we take to be evil – the question is how we can reconcile the existenceof evil with a belief in a loving God. The task is to “explain” or “justify”evil in a way that does not make God responsible for it. Sometimes, the problemof evil is used to challenge the existence of such a God. Dostoevsky’s IvanKaramazov argues passionately that the gratuitous murder of innocent childrencannot be reconciled with a belief in a benevolent God.Evil has been closely associated with suffering – especially suffering for whichthere does not seem to be any meaning or justiﬁcation. This is why the Book ofJob is frequently cited as one of the earliest discussions of how the apparentevil of Job’s suffering can be reconciled with faith in a just God. It would bea serious mistake to think that the “problem of evil” is exclusively a religiousproblem. Secular thinkers have raised similar questions. They too want to knowhow to make sense of a world in which evil seems to be so intractable. Nietzschedeclared that human beings do not repudiate suffering as such: it is meaninglesssuffering that is so intolerable. And the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinashas argued that any attempt (religious or secular) to justify or rationalize thehorror of evil is a form of theodicy; we must resist the temptation of theodicy.At the beginning of the modern age, many thinkers classiﬁed evils as eithernatural or moral. Natural evils are those that occur without direct humanintervention. Perhaps the most famous example was the devastating Lisbonearthquake that struck the city on the morning of November 1, 1755, and buriedthousands of persons in the rubble. The question – debated throughout Europe –was whether such a terrible event was compatible with a faith in the ChristianGod. What kind of God would allow the death of so many innocent people? The bestminds in Europe, including Voltaire, Rousseau, and Kant, struggled with thequestion. And it caught the popular imagination in pamphlets and sermons of thetime. Today, most of us do not think of such terrible natural events asearthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, and hurricanes as manifestations of evil. Theentire category of natural evils has been called into question, in part becauseof what Max Weber calls the “disenchantment of nature.” Susan Neiman claims thatthe Lisbon earthquake marked the birth of modernity because “it demandedrecognition that nature and morality are split” (Neiman 2004: 267).The discourse about evil in the twentieth century has been extremelyparadoxical. There are some philosophers and theologians who have continued tostruggle with the classic problem of evil. But these discussions have becomespecialized and esoteric; they are remote from the concerns of everyday life.Moral philosophers tend to focus on what is just and unjust, right and wrong,moral and immoral. Kant, who many think of as the greatest of modern moralphilosophers, argued that the justiﬁcation of moral claims ought to beindependent of our religious beliefs. We may learn our morality – our sense ofwhat is right and wrong, good and bad – from our religious upbringing, but thisdoes not mean that the justiﬁcation of our morality is based on religiousbeliefs. Even those moral philosophers who disagree sharply with Kant’s claimsabout the foundations of morality generally accept the claim that moralityshould be clearly distinguished from religion.1 [Notes.html#Intn1] Consequently,many moral philosophers have avoided discussing evil, because evil is sointimately tied to religious discourse.But at the same time, ever since we have become aware of the full horrors of theNazi period and the perverse cruelty of the Shoah, Auschwitz has come tosymbolize the most extreme evil of our time – an evil unprecedented in history.Hannah Arendt is one of the very few thinkers who sought to comprehend what isdistinctive about the new form of evil that burst forth with twentieth-centurytotalitarianism. Appropriating Kant’s expression radical evil, she tells us:Evil has proved to be more radical than expected. In objective terms, moderncrimes are not provided for in the Ten Commandments. Or: the Western Traditionis suffering from the preconception that the most evil things human beings cando arise from the vice of selﬁshness. Yet we know that the greatest evils orradical evil has nothing to do any more with such humanly understandable, sinfulmotives. (Arendt and Jaspers 1992: 166)But what is radical evil? Radical evil is making human beings superﬂuous ashuman beings. This happens as soon as all unpredictability – which, in humanbeings, is equivalent to spontaneity – is eliminated. We can understand morefully what she means by turning to the description she gives of totaldomination. She presents a three-stage model of the “logic” of total domination.It is in the concentration and death camps that we ﬁnd the “laboratories” oftotalitarian regimes. And it is in the camps that we ﬁnd the most radicalexperiments for changing the character of human beings.“The ﬁrst essential step on the road to total domination is to kill thejuridical person in man” (Arendt 1968: 447). This started long before the Nazisestablished the death camps. Arendt is referring to the legal restrictions thatstripped Jews (and other groups such as homosexuals and gypsies) of theirjuridical rights. “The aim of an arbitrary system is to destroy the civil rightsof the whole population, who ultimately become just as outlawed in their owncountry as the stateless and the homeless. The destruction of man’s rights, thekilling of the juridical person in him, is a perquisite for dominating himentirely” (Arendt 1968: 451). Inmates in concentration camps have no rights.“The next decisive step in the preparation of living corpses is the murder ofthe moral person in man. This is done by making martyrdom, for the ﬁrst time inhistory, impossible” (Arendt 1968: 451). The SS, who supervised the camps, wereperversely brilliant in corrupting all forms of human solidarity. They succeededin making questions of conscience questionable and equivocal.When a man is faced with the alternative of betraying and thus murdering hisfriends or of sending his wife and children, for whom he is in every senseresponsible, to their death; and when even suicide would mean the immediatemurder of his own family, how is he to decide? The alternative is no longerbetween good and evil, but between murder and murder. Who could solve the moraldilemma of the Greek mother, who was allowed by the Nazis to choose which of herthree children should be killed? (Arendt 1968: 452)But this is not yet the worst. There is a third step on the road to totaldomination – and it is here that we come face to face with the core of radicalevil.After the murder of the moral person and annihilation of the juridical person,the destruction of individuality is almost always successful . . . For todestroy individuality is to destroy spontaneity, man’s power to begin somethingnew out of his own resources, something that cannot be explained on the basis ofreactions to environment and events. (Arendt 1968: 455)The camps served the ghastly experiment of eliminating, under scientiﬁcallycontrolled conditions, spontaneity itself as an expression of human behavior andof transforming the human personality into a mere thing. There was a systematicattempt to transform human beings into “living corpses,” to fabricate humanbeings who were not quite human – who were at once human and inhuman. This iswhat Arendt takes to be the quintessence of radical evil; this is what she meansby making human beings as human beings superﬂuous. Arendt is referring to thoseliving corpses who were called Muselmann – so graphically described by PrimoLevi, a survivor of Auschwitz.Their life is short, but their number is endless; they the Muselmänner, thedrowned, they form the backbone of the camp, an anonymous mass, continuallyrenewed and always identical, of non-men who march and labor in silence, thedivine spark dead in them, already too empty to really suffer. One hesitates tocall them living: one hesitates to call their death death, in the face of whichthey have no fear, as they are too tired to understand.They crowd my memory with their faceless presence, and if I could enclose allthe evil of our time in one image, I would choose this image which is familiarto me: an emaciated man, with head dropped and shoulders curved, on whose faceand in whose eyes not a trace of thought is to be seen. (Levi 1986: 90, emphasisadded)2 [Notes.html#Intn2]When Arendt described radical evil in The Origins of Totalitarianism, shefocused on describing the phenomenon – the systematic transformation of humanbeings into something less than fully human. She didn’t explicitly explore themotivations of the Nazi perpetrators, although she did speak of the absolutelycold and systematic destruction of human bodies. This was the clear intention ofthose who administered the camps. But the question of motives and intentionsbecame much more problematic for her when she reported on the trial of AdolphEichmann. Arendt called into question one of our most central and entrenchedmoral and legal convictions: namely, that people who do evil deeds must haveevil motives and intentions. They are vicious, sadistic, or wicked. She claimedthat Eichmann was not a sadistic monster. He was “terrifyingly normal”; he was“a new type of criminal who commits his crimes in circumstances that make itwellnigh impossible to know or feel that he is doing wrong” (Arendt 1965: 276).His deeds were monstrous, and he deserved to hang, but his motives andintentions were banal. One of the clearest statements of what Arendt means bythe “banality of evil” is in her 1971 lecture “Thinking and MoralConsiderations.”Some years ago, reporting the trial of Eichmann in Jerusalem, I spoke of the“banality of evil” and meant with this no theory or doctrine but something quitefactual, the phenomenon of evil deeds, committed on a gigantic scale, whichcould not be traced to any particularity of wickedness, pathology, orideological conviction in the doer, whose only personal distinction was perhapsextraordinary shallowness. However monstrous the deeds were, the doer wasneither monstrous nor demonic, and the only speciﬁc characteristic one coulddetect in his past as well as in his behavior during the trial and the precedingpolice examination was something entirely negative: it was not stupidity but acurious, quite authentic inability to think. (Arendt 1971: 417)Susan Neiman sums up why Eichmann in Jerusalem makes such an importantcontribution to understanding evil in our time – and why it is still socontroversial.Auschwitz embodied evil that confuted two centuries of modern assumptions aboutintention.Those assumptions identify evil and evil intention so thoroughly that denyingthe latter is normally viewed as a way of denying the former. Where evilintention is absent, we may hold agents liable for the wrongs they inﬂict, butwe view them as matters of criminal negligence. Alternatively, anyone who deniesthat criminal intention is present in a particular action is thought toexonerate the criminal. This is the source of the furor that still surroundsArendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem, the twentieth century’s most importantphilosophical contribution to the problem of evil. The conviction that guiltrequires malice and forethought led most readers to conclude that Arendt deniedguilt because she denied malice and forethought – though she often repeated thatEichmann was guilty, and was convinced that he ought to hang. Her main point isthat Eichmann’s harmless intentions did not mitigate his responsibility. (Neiman2004: 271–2)Historians have raised many questions about the factual accuracy of Arendt’sportrait of Eichmann, but this does not diminish the signiﬁcance of her mainpoint – that normal people with banal motives and intentions can commithorrendous crimes and do evil deeds.3 [Notes.html#Intn3] But despite the lack ofevil intentions, they are fully responsible for their acts. Furthermore,Arendt’s warning is as relevant for us today as it was when she wrote it: “Thesad truth of the matter is that most evil is done by people who never made uptheir minds to be or to do either evil or good” (Arendt 1977b: 180).Auschwitz has come to epitomize the evil of the Nazi regime. But, unfortunately,it is only one of the many genocides that have occurred in the twentieth century– and continue to take place in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Despite such slogans as“Never Again,” genocides continue to break out in different parts of the world.Each one is distinctive in its circumstances, methods, and character, but eachbrings forth new manifestations of evil. There is a protean quality about evil.It changes its shape and takes on ever new forms. This is why it is so difﬁcultto deﬁne or characterize. What is so frightening is that once some new evil isintroduced, it sets a precedent for what may happen again.When we survey historical attempts to comprehend evil, there is onecharacteristic that stands out. The confrontation with evil provokes thinking.St Augustine draws on all his imaginative, emotional, and intellectual powers toreconcile the appearance of evil with his ﬁrm belief in a loving God. Leibnizthought we needed a new discipline – theodicy – to explain rationally whyeverything happens for the best. Shakespeare explores the intricacies of themoral psychology of evil in such characters as Iago, Lady Macbeth, and RichardIII. No one poses the questions about evil more brilliantly than the charactersin Dostoevsky’s novels. And Hannah Arendt returned over and over again toconfront anew the evils of the twentieth century.But something different happened on 9/11. Overnight (literally) our politiciansand the media were broadcasting about evil. We were ﬂooded with headlines aboutevil and images displaying evil – from the repetitive TV images of the crumblingof the towers of the World Trade Center to the smirking faces of Osama bin Ladenand Saddam Hussein. Suddenly the world was divided in a simple (and simplistic)duality – the evil ones seeking to destroy us and those committed to the waragainst evil. There have been other times in recent history when politicians –especially in the United States – have used the rhetoric of good and evil togain support from their constituencies. Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union“The Evil Empire.” But, despite this rhetoric, Reagan was ﬂexible and pragmaticin his diplomatic negotiations when Gorbachev became the leader of the Kremlin.What is so disturbing about the post-9/11 evil talk is its rigidity and popularappeal. Few stop to ask what we really mean by evil. What are we saying when welabel our enemies “evil”? And who precisely are our enemies? It is presumablyself-evident. In a world where there is fear and anxiety about unpredictablethreats of terrorism that can strike at any place and any time, it ispsychologically reassuring to label the enemy “evil.”I want to examine this new fashionable popularity of the discourse of good andevil. I will argue that it represents an abuse of evil – a dangerous abuse. Itis an abuse because, instead of inviting us to question and to think, this talkof evil is being used to stiﬂe thinking. This is extremely dangerous in acomplex and precarious world. The new discourse of good and evil lacks nuance,subtlety, and judicious discrimination. In the so-called “War on Terror,” nuanceand subtlety are (mis) taken as signs of wavering, weakness, and indecision. Butif we think that politics requires judgment, artful diplomacy, and judiciousdiscrimination, then this talk about absolute evil is profoundly anti-political.As Hannah Arendt noted, “The absolute . . . spells doom to everyone when it isintroduced into the political realm” (Arendt 1963: 79). Our proclamations aboutevil and the “axis of evil” are matched by fanatical talk of a jihad committedto eliminating evil inﬁdels. Consider the statement that I cited as my secondepigraph to this introduction. If we substitute the phrase “Moktada al-Sadr andhis militant cohorts” for “America,” and “the proud American people” for “theproud Iraqi people,” then we have the type of statement that we hear sofrequently from Washington. “Moktada al-Sadr and his militant cohorts have showntheir evil intentions and the proud American people cannot accept it.”Before 9/11 many fundamentalists and conservative Christian evangelicalsexhibited restraint in condemning Islam. But since 9/11 this has changed.Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son and heir to his ministry, declared thatIslam is a “wicked and evil religion.” This is the type of inﬂammatory rhetoricthat is matched by the diatribes of Islamic fundamentalists against Christianityand Judaism as evil religions.Samantha Power succinctly and eloquently describes the contrast between morethoughtful responses to evil and the new stark opposition of black (evil) andwhite (good) in her recent comment about Hannah Arendt.Arendt used the phrase “radical evil” to describe totalitarianism, and this ideahas been brought back in circulation. Yet while Arendt did not allow suchbranding to deter her from exploring the sources of that evil, the less subtleminds who invoke the concept today do so to mute criticisms of their responses.(Who, after all, can be against combating evil?)But sheltering behind black-and-white characterizations is not only questionablefor moral or epistemological reasons. It poses a practical problem because itblinds us from understanding and thus undermines our long-term ability toprevent and surmount what we don’t know and most fear. “Evil,” whether radicalor banal, is met most often with unimaginativeness. Terrorism is a threat thatdemands a complex and elaborate effort to distinguish the sympathizers from themilitants and to keep its converts to a minimum. Terrorism also requiresunderstanding how our past policies helped give rise to such venomousgrievances. (Power 2004: 37)We need to probe the mentality that neatly divides the world into the forces ofevil and the forces of good, to understand its sources and its appeal. For thisis an outlook that is currently widespread in American culture, from Hollywoodto Washington, although it has a much longer history, reaching back to ancientforms of Gnosticism and Manichaeism. It stands in sharp opposition to anothermentality that is more open and fallible, and has a robust sense of theunpredictability of contingencies – an outlook that demands questioning andinquiry along with ﬁrm resistance to concrete evils. I want to expose andchallenge the claim frequently made by those who ﬁnd simple stark contrasts andoppositions so appealing. The champions of the new “evil” discourse claim thatthe only alternative to such a ﬁrm and clear understanding of good and evil is awishy-washy (secular) relativism that lacks the serious commitment to oppose andeliminate evil. This is the way in which many neo-conservatives characterizetheir political opponents. They are weak and vacillating; they lack the moralconviction, realism, ﬁrmness, and fervor to do what is required to ﬁght andeliminate evil. We are told that if we give up on “moral certainties,” we willlack the backbone to ﬁght our enemies. Nietzsche spoke about the desire for“metaphysical comfort.” He meant the smugness and selfrighteousness – the falsesense of security – that arises when we delude ourselves into thinking that wehave ﬁrm and absolutely certain foundations for our moral convictions. But wecan (and must) learn to live without “metaphysical comfort,” to live with arealistic sense of unpredictable contingencies – and at the same time to have apassionate commitment to understand, resist, and ﬁght concrete evils and opposeinjustices. Questioning the new superﬁcial discourse of good and evil requiresdigging into the foundations of what is rarely critically examined – thedualistic outlook that underlies this mentality. It also requires questioningone of the most pernicious assumptions made by the champions of the newdiscourse. This is the assumption that ﬁrm moral convictions and actions restupon moral certainties and absolutes.Let me clarify what I will criticize. We frequently appeal to “certainty” inperfectly legitimate ways. If I am asked whether I saw John yesterday, I mayreply that “I am absolutely certain that I saw him.” But if I discover that Johnwas actually in another city yesterday, I do not hesitate to admit that I wasmistaken. “Certainty” is used to express our certitude, our subjective personalconviction that something is so-and-so. But all too frequently there is a slidefrom this subjective sense of certitude to an objective sense of certainty –where we act as if the strength of our personal conviction is sufﬁcient tojustify the objective truth of what we are claiming. Subjective certitude orpersonal conviction by itself is never sufﬁcient to justify objective truth. Thementality that I will be criticizing is one that thinks that afﬁrming one’scertitude and the depth of one’s sincere conviction is sufﬁcient to justify theclaim of objective certainty.There are also appeals to absolutes that may be perfectly legitimate. Manyreligious believers will appeal to God as their absolute. But it is alwaysappropriate to ask what the person of faith means thereby. What is herunderstanding of what she calls the absolute? Once we realize that any appeal toan absolute requires understanding and interpretation, then there is an openingfor critical reﬂection on the truth and adequacy of one’s claims. We enter whatWilfrid Sellars has called the “logical space of reasons,” of asking for andgiving reasons – and this may include religious reasons. But there are those whorefuse to enter this space. They do not think that any further justiﬁcation,discussion, or understanding is necessary. To put the point in a slightly moretechnical way, I am denying that there are any self-authenticatingepistemological episodes – episodes where the mere having of such episodesyields genuine knowledge. This is what Sellars calls “the myth of the given”(Sellars 1963: 140).Finally, when I challenge a rigid dualistic mentality – one that divides theworld into the “forces of good” and the dark “forces of evil” – I am not callinginto question the importance of making sharp distinctions. We cannot think oract in the world without doing so. At times, we do need to make a cleardistinction between friends and enemies. But there is a danger that distinctionsbecome reiﬁed and rigid in ways that obscure complex issues. This is what hashappened with the popular post-9/11 dichotomy of good and evil. I agree with The9/11 Commission Report when it asserts: “But the enemy is not just ‘terrorism,’some generic evil. This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat atthis moment in history is more speciﬁc. It is the threat of Islamist terrorism –especially the Al-Qaeda network, its afﬁliates, and its ideology” (p. 362). Inshort, I intend to criticize the uncritical or unreﬂective appeal to objectivecertainty, absolutes, and rigid dualisms.We also need to explore the relation of this new discourse of good and evil topolitics and religion. I have already suggested that it is anti-political. Theappeal to absolutes is disastrous for politics. But there are also questionsabout religion and morality. The popular discourse about good and evil –especially in the United States – is permeated with an aura of religious piety.It is commonly believed that the justiﬁcation for dividing the world into goodand evil is supported by fundamental (Christian) religious beliefs. Almighty Godis invoked as the source and justiﬁcation for ﬁrm moral convictions. There isalso a disparity and a dissonance between the philosophical understandings ofmorality and the widespread popular view. Philosophers may tell us that when itcomes to matters of justiﬁcation, our morality – our sense of what is right andwrong, or good and bad – is autonomous. We do not need to appeal to religion tojustify or warrant moral beliefs. They may tell us that the great achievement of(Western) modernity has been to distinguish morality from religion. But this isnot the prevailing view of many religious believers. They believe that it istheir religion that is the source and justiﬁcation for their morality. The Bibletells us that God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai. In theWest, religion generally means the Judaic-Christian tradition. But, of course,Muslims believe that Allah is the source of all morality. When they speak of aholy war, or jihad, it is a religious war against evil inﬁdels justiﬁed by God.Does it make sense to speak of the Christian, Judaic, or Muslim conception ofgood and evil? Many believers who invoke God or Allah do not think that there isany ambiguity and uncertainty about this. I will argue that there is no singlereligious conception of good and evil. And furthermore, that there is nounivocal Christian, Judaic, or Muslim conception of good and evil. Statedpositively, living religious traditions are rich, complex, and always undergoinghistorical transformation. They contain different, competing, conﬂicting, andeven contradictory historical conceptions of good and evil. Thus, for example,Christians today condemn the Spanish Inquisition’s “religious” justiﬁcation oftorture. We now condemn this as a perversion of “authentic” Christianity – asbeing thoroughly unchristian. Indeed, Pope John Paul II explicitly condemnedtorture as an intrinsic evil. We distort and do violence to religious traditionswhen we fail to appreciate their changing historical character. Consequently, wemust be wary and extremely skeptical about any form of religious reiﬁcation oressentialism. When we examine the world religions, we ﬁnd that there arecompeting conceptions of good and evil that are internal to these traditions. Weshould be critical of those who appeal to their religious beliefs as if theyprovided unambiguous and univocal justiﬁcation for their moral certainties. Thisdoes not mean that the world religions lack moral content. But it does mean thatinterpretation and questioning of religious doctrines is always required. In aliving religious tradition, there is always a conﬂict of interpretations. I wantto show that when we unmask the current popular discourse of good and evil,which is saturated in religious language, it turns out to be anti-religious. Itviolates what is best and most vital in the living world religions.The battle that I see taking place is not between religious believers with ﬁrmmoral commitments and secular relativists who lack conviction. It is a battlethat cuts across the so-called religious/secular divide. It is a battle betweenthose who ﬁnd rigid moral absolutes appealing, those who think that nuance andsubtlety mask indecisiveness, those who embellish their ideological prejudiceswith the language of religious piety, and those who approach life with a moreopen, fallibilistic mentality – one that eschews the quest for absolutecertainty. Such a mentality is not only compatible with a religious orientation;it is essential to keeping a religious tradition alive and relevant to newsituations and contingencies. What we are confronting today is not a clash ofcivilizations, but a clash of mentalities. And the outcome of this clash hassigniﬁcant practical consequences for how we live our everyday lives – for ourmorality, politics, and religion."},{"pageContent":"1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Clash of MentalitiesThe Craving for Absolutes versus Pragmatic FallibilismIn the Introduction I spoke about the clash of mentalities. In this chapter Iwant to explain what I mean, and why I think this clash is so consequential. Bya mentality, I mean a general orientation – a cast of mind or way of thinking –that conditions the way in which we approach, understand, and act in the world.It shapes and is shaped by our intellectual, practical, and emotional lives.Mentalities can take a variety of concrete historical forms. We never encountera mentality in the abstract, but only in a particular historical manifestation.To fully understand a speciﬁc historical manifestation of a mentality, we needto locate its context, its distinctive character, and its sources. We need topay careful attention to its historical particularity – although we canrecognize its similarities (and differences) with other historical examples ofthe same or similar mentalities. Mentalities also arise at different stages inhistory – and their concrete manifestations can pass away. So we also need toinquire about why they arise at a certain time and why they fade away. I want tobegin with a speciﬁc historical example, one that has had a great inﬂuence onthe character of the United States in the late nineteenth century and the ﬁrstpart of the twentieth century. After examining this important example of what Icall pragmatic fallibilism, I will then, in the next chapter, reﬂect on its moregeneral signiﬁcance – and its relevance to our current situation.Several years ago, Louis Menand published a fascinating book, The MetaphysicalClub: A Story of Ideas in America. It explores the intellectual history ofAmerican pragmatism and seeks to situate this movement in the context ofAmerican history. (The Metaphysical Club was an informal discussion group ofintellectuals who met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during the 1870s to discussphilosophical issues.) Pragmatism as a philosophical movement arose in theUnited States just after the Civil War. This was a time when the idea of aresearch university – modeled on the German university – began to take holdthroughout the United States. Before the Civil War, most private institutions ofhigher learning were colleges founded by different religious groups. The primarypurpose of these colleges was to educate citizens and clergy rather than toengage in research. But during the latter part of the nineteenth century, therewas a ﬂourishing of independent scholarship in the natural sciences, socialdisciplines, and humanities. It was during this period that American thinkerssought do develop a distinctive philosophical orientation.William James ﬁrst popularized the expression “pragmatism” in a famous addressthat he delivered at the University of California, Berkeley, in l898. In hisaddress, “Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results,” James generouslyacknowledged his debt to Charles S. Peirce, “one of the most originalcontemporary thinkers,” and James refers to “the principle of practicalism – orpragmatism as he called it when I ﬁrst heard him enunciate it at Cambridge inthe early ’70s” (James 1977: 348). James ﬁrst heard Peirce discuss his pragmaticprinciple at meetings of the Metaphysical Club. James introduces “Peirce’sprinciple” with a metaphorical description: “the soul and meaning of thought, hesays, can never be made to direct itself towards anything but the production ofbelief, belief being the demicadence which closes a musical phrase in thesymphony of our intellectual life.” James tells us that “beliefs, in short arereally rules of action; and the whole function of thinking is but one step inthe production of habits of action” (James 1977: 348). In 1898, Peirce wasbarely known as a philosopher (except to a small group of admirers such asJames). Peirce, the son of a famous Harvard mathematician, was a scientist and alogician, but his intellectual curiosity spanned the entire range of humandisciplines. As James’s popular version of pragmatism spread, Peirce was soappalled and outraged that he renamed his own doctrine of meaning “‘pragmaticism’ which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers” (Peirce 1931–5:5. 414). There is a famous quip that pragmatism is the movement that was foundedon James’s misunderstanding of Peirce. Peirce and James were lifelong friends –although at times their friendship was a stormy one. Another young member of theCambridge circle who joined the discussions of the Metaphysical Club was OliverWendell Holmes, Jr., who later became one of the most famous justices of theUnited States Supreme Court. John Dewey, born in 1859 (the year of publicationof Darwin’s Origin of Species), was 20 years younger than James. He came from abackground that was very different from that of Cambridge intellectuals. He wasborn in Burlington, Vermont, the son of a shopkeeper, and was educated at theUniversity of Vermont. Dewey was among the ﬁrst American philosophers to get aPh.D. degree at the newly founded graduate school, Johns Hopkins University.Peirce brieﬂy taught at Johns Hopkins when Dewey was a graduate student. WhenDewey joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1890, he was already agreat admirer of James. Dewey claimed that James’s magnum opus, The Principlesof Psychology, had an enormous inﬂuence on his own intellectual development. AndJames himself was enthusiastic about the philosophical orientation beingdeveloped by the “Chicago School” centered on Dewey. In one of Dewey’s mostimportant books, Experience and Nature, Dewey praised Holmes as “one of ourgreatest philosophers,” and quoted a long passage from Holmes’s essay on“Natural Law.” Holmes admired Experience and Nature – a book that shared his ownconception of experience and existence. With his typical charming wit, Holmeswrote: “Although Dewey’s book is incredibly ill written, it seemed to me . . .to have a feeling of intimacy with the universe that I found unequaled. Somethought God would have spoken had He been inarticulate but keenly desirous totell you how it was” (quoted in Menand 2001: 437).One of Menand’s major contributions was to show how the origins of the pragmaticmovement could be understood as a critical response to the horrors and excessesof the Civil War – the war that split the nation. Menand focused attention onfour persons, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., William James, Charles S. Peirce, andJohn Dewey, although he also discussed many of their contemporaries. Menand madea bold claim about the inﬂuence of these four men. He declared:Their ideas changed the way Americans thought – and continue to think – abouteducation, democracy, liberty, justice, and tolerance. And as a consequence theychanged the way Americans live – the way they learn, the way they express theirviews, the way in which they understand themselves, and the way in which theytreat people who are different from them. We are still living, to a greatextent, in a country these thinkers helped to make. (Menand 2001: p. xi)What is the bond that unites these very diverse thinkers? Menand afﬁrms thatthey shared a common attitude toward ideas.What was that attitude? If we strain out the differences, personal andphilosophical, they had with one another, we can say that what these fourthinkers had in common was not a group of ideas, but a single idea – an ideaabout ideas. They all believed that ideas are not “out there” waiting to bediscovered, but are tools . . . that people devise to cope with the world inwhich they ﬁnd themselves. They believed that ideas are produced not byindividuals, but by groups of individuals – that ideas are social. They believedthat ideas do not develop according to some inner logic of their own, but areentirely dependent, like germs, on their human careers and environment. And theybelieved that since ideas are provisional responses to particular situations,their survival depends not on their immutability but on their adaptability.(Menand 2001: p. xi)This “single idea” did not develop in an intellectual vacuum. It emerged inresponse to the violent extremism of the American Civil War. These thinkers werereacting against the entrenched opposition, the absolute certainty by theopposing forces of the righteousness of their cause, the sheer intolerancetoward those who held opposing convictions – an intolerance that frequently setmembers of the same family against each other. This rigid mentality led tobloody violence. It was a mentality in which there were stark oppositions, ablack-and-white world in which there was no possibility of compromise ornegotiation. Holmes fought in the Civil War and was seriously wounded severaltimes. James had a brother who nearly died in the war. Dewey was a young childduring the war, but his father fought in the war. (Peirce, however, dreaded thedraft. Through his father’s inﬂuence, he secured a position in the US CoastalSurvey and managed to avoid conscription.) But the consciousness of the CivilWar shaped an entire generation. Menand’s thesis is that the pragmatic thinkersundertook to develop a more ﬂexible, open, experimental, and fallible way ofthinking that would avoid all forms of absolutism, stark binary oppositions, andviolent extremism. And in their individual and collective way of doing this,they helped to reshape the ways in which Americans thought and acted.I believe that Menand is essentially correct in the way in which he approachesthe historical situatedness of the pragmatic movement. We tend to think thatphilosophers are somehow completely divorced from history – as if they weresimply engaged in a timeless conversation with each other across the centuries.There have been philosophers who have characterized philosophy in this manner,but the pragmatic thinkers rejected this ahistorical conception of philosophy.Dewey, for example, always maintained that philosophy is (and ought to be)responsive to the deepest conﬂicts of its own time. Menand has written the typeof intellectual history that reﬂects Dewey’s own understanding of the culturalrootedness of philosophical speculation, and he presents a far more dramatic andvivid understanding of role played by this movement in reshaping the mentalityof American life. There is another virtue in Menand’s approach. He helps us tosee that when the pragmatists critically attacked absolutism, when they soughtto expose the quest for certainty, when they argued for an open universe inwhich chance and contingency are irreducible, they were not concernedexclusively with abstract metaphysical and epistemological issues. They wereaddressing profound ethical, political, and practical questions that ordinarypeople confront in their everyday lives. They were haunted by the memory of theway in which the conﬂict of absolutes led to so much bloody violence. Theywanted to develop a new way of thinking – a new mentality – that would be analternative to, and would overcome, all forms of entrenched ideologicalextremism.In all the pragmatic thinkers there is a sustained multifaceted attack on whatDewey called “the quest for certainty.” It is not just ideologists and fanaticswho claim to live by absolute certainty. Dewey thought that this quest had beenone of the most basic goals of the Western philosophical tradition. Deweyrelated this quest for certainty to a quest for security, an attempt to ﬂee fromthe contingency, uncertainty, and ambivalence of everyday life. Many traditionalphilosophers had tended to valorize what is eternal, ﬁxed, unchanging, andnecessary, and to denigrate what is changing, becoming, contingent, andperilous. But there is no “escape from peril,” from the vicissitudes ofexistence. Furthermore, we are neither playthings of forces that are alwaysoperating behind our backs; nor can we ever completely control our destinies.Dewey, like the other pragmatic thinkers, sought to expose the arrogance ofthose who think that they can anticipate, manipulate, and control all unexpectedcontingencies. All the pragmatists rejected doctrines of mechanical determinismthat allow no place for genuine human agency and freedom. But they were just asrelentless in their critiques of gratuitous voluntarism – the belief that we caninitiate signiﬁcant changes in the world simply by willing them. The importantpragmatic task is to develop those ideas – and even more important – thoseﬂexible critical habits and practices that will enable us to cope with what isunexpected and unpredictable in a reﬂective intelligent manner.Dewey coined the phrase “the spectator theory of knowledge.” He argued that manytraditional and modern philosophers were dominated by ocular metaphors, and thatthey tended to approach knowing as a form of passive seeing, or contemplation.Integral to the change in mentality that he and the other pragmatists sought todevelop was the intellectual experiment of situating human beings as agents, notas passive spectators – agents who are always already undergoing and shapingtheir experience in transactions with their world. Dewey, like the otherpragmatists, was skeptical of radical utopian “solutions,” and he was suspiciousof the idea of total revolution. But he was committed to ongoing radical socialreform. Throughout his long life, his central concern was the character and fateof democracy. He felt that the greatest threats to American democracy wereinternal ones – threats in which the public was being manipulated by powerfulspecial interest groups. He was concerned about “the eclipse of the public” –the eclipse of an informed public where there is open communication, debate, anddeliberation. Dewey warned about the threat to democracy that resulted from thegrowth and spread of the “corporate mentality” – a mentality that has taken onglobal dimensions in our time.The business mind, having its own conversation and language, its own interests,its own intimate groupings in which men of this mind, in their collectivecapacity, determine the tone of society at large as well as the government ofindustrial society. . . . We now have, although without formal or legal status,a mental and moral corporateness for which history affords no parallel. (Dewey1930: 41)Democracy, according to Dewey, does not consist exclusively of a set ofinstitutions, formal voting procedures, or even legal guarantee of rights. Theseare important, but they require a culture of everyday democratic cooperativepractices to give them life and meaning. Otherwise institutions and proceduresare in danger of becoming hollow and meaningless. Democracy is “a way of life,”an ethical ideal that demands active and constant attention. And if we fail towork at creating and re-creating democracy, there is no guarantee that it willsurvive. Democracy involves a reﬂective faith in the capacity of all humanbeings for intelligent judgment, deliberation, and action if the proper social,educational, and economic conditions are furnished. When Dewey was celebratinghis eightieth birthday he presented a talk entitled “Creative Democracy – TheTask Before Us,” in which he outlined his vision of a true democratic society:Democracy as compared with other ways of life is the sole way of living whichbelieves wholeheartedly in the process of experience as end and as means . . .and which releases emotions, needs, and desires so as to call into being thethings that have not existed in the past. For every way of life that fails inits democracy limits the contacts, the exchanges, the communications, theinteractions by which experience is steadied while it is enlarged and enriched.The task of this release and enrichment is one that has to be carried on day byday. Since it is one that can have no end till experience itself comes to anend, the task of democracy is forever that of creation of a freer and morehumane experience in which all share and to which all contribute. (Dewey 1988:229–30)Dewey understood that at times of deep uncertainty, anxiety, and fear, there isa craving for moral certainty and absolutes. At such times there can be adesperate search for metaphysical and religious comfort. But this is preciselywhat we must resist. For such comfort is based on illusions. Furthermore, asPeirce had already emphasized, such an appeal to absolutes blocks the road toopen inquiry and genuine thinking. The pragmatists exposed and sharply attackedthe seductive but misleading appeal to absolutes, certainty, speciousfoundations, and simplistic oppositions. But their main positive achievement wasto develop a viable critical and fallible alternative.Hilary Putnam, a leading contemporary philosopher who strongly identiﬁes withthe pragmatic tradition, claims that pragmatism is a “way of thinking” thatinvolves “a certain group of theses, theses which can and indeed were arguedvery differently by different philosophers with different concerns.” Hesummarizes these key theses as(1) antiskepticism; pragmatists hold that doubt requires justiﬁcation just asmuch as belief . . .; (2) fallibilism; pragmatists hold that there is never ametaphysical guarantee to be had that such and such a belief will never needrevision (that one can be fallibilistic and antiskeptical is perhaps the uniqueinsight of American pragmatism); (3) the thesis that there is no fundamentaldichotomy between “facts” and “values”; and the thesis that, in a certain sense,practice is primary in philosophy. (Putnam 1994: 152)Peirce consistently challenged the idea of epistemological and metaphysicalfoundationalism that he took to be so basic for many philosophers – the dream ornightmare of discovering once and for all an incorrigible foundation that couldserve as a basis for building the ediﬁce of knowledge. There are deepphilosophical, religious, social, and psychological reasons for this search forsolid foundations and incorrigible truths. Descartes, more than any otherthinker, vividly portrayed what he took to be the grand Either/Or that weconfront: Either solid foundations and indubitable knowledge Or a swamp ofunfounded and ungrounded opinion. I once called this “the Cartesian Anxiety”(Bernstein 1983: 16–24). Descartes’ search for an Archimedean point is much morethan a device to solve metaphysical and epistemological problems. It is thequest for some ﬁxed ground, some stable rock upon which we can secure our livesagainst the vicissitudes that constantly threaten us. The specter that hovers inthe background of the journey of the soul that Descartes undertakes in hisMeditations is the dread of chaos and madness where nothing is ﬁxed anddeterminate, where – to use his own chilling metaphor – we are in a sea where wecan neither touch bottom nor support ourselves on the surface. This anxiety hashaunted intellectual and popular thinking right up to the present. It can takemany different forms. And indeed, I believe that those today who claim religiousor moral certainty for dividing the world into the forces of good and the forcesof evil are shaped by this Cartesian Anxiety. For they are claiming the type ofcertainty for their moral and political convictions that Descartes claimed forhis indubitable foundation. They also make use of the grand Either/Or when theyattack their opponents. For they claim that the only alternative to solidfoundations and moral certainties is to be lost in a quagmire of relativisticopinions.Now what is distinctive about the pragmatic thinkers is that they rejected thisgrand Either/Or. The exclusive disjunction: “absolute” certainty or “absolute”relativism is specious. We need to exorcize the Cartesian Anxiety, or, to switchmetaphors, engage in a form of philosophical therapy that will release us fromits constraining grip. Beginning with Peirce, the pragmatists sought to developthe idea of fallibilism as a genuine alternative to the Cartesian Either/Or.Fallibilism is the belief that any knowledge claim or, more generally, anyvalidity claim – including moral and political claims – is open to ongoingexamination, modiﬁcation, and critique. Peirce originally argued thatfallibilism is essential for understanding the distinctive character of modernexperimental science. Scientiﬁc inquiry does not have any absoluteepistemological starting-points or end-points. Inquiry is a self-correctiveenterprise that – in the words of Wilfrid Sellars – “can put any claim injeopardy, though not all at once” (Sellars 1997: 79). The phrase “though not allat once” is crucial, because we could not even engage in any inquiry unless wetake some claims and beliefs to be basic and unquestioned. But the key word hereis “take” because further inquiry may teach us that what we have taken to bebasic may need to be questioned and revised. Consequently, there is anuncontroversial sense in which we start from foundations and “takens.” These arebeliefs and “truths” that we take for granted in order to conduct an inquiry.These are warranted claims that have been established by previous inquiries. Inthe course of the self-corrective process of inquiry, these may also bequestioned, revised, and even abandoned. And the self-corrective process ofinquiry requires a critical community of inquirers. Peirce extended this notionof self-corrective inquiry to philosophy itself. But it was James, andespecially Dewey, who sought to show the full signiﬁcance of fallibilism formoral, social, and political inquiry in a democratic society. And Holmes’sapproach to the law is pervaded by a fallibilistic ethos that eschews all formsof absolute principles. In the Common Law, Holmes declared, “The life of the lawhas not been logic; it has been experience”(quoted in Menand 2001: 341).Fallibilism, in its robust sense, is not a rariﬁed epistemological doctrine. Itconsists of a set of virtues – a set of practices – that need to be carefullynurtured in critical communities. A fallibilistic orientation requires a genuinewillingness to test one’s ideas in public, and to listen carefully to those whocriticize them. It requires the imagination to formulate new hypotheses andconjectures, and to subject them to rigorous public testing and critique by thecommunity of inquirers. Fallibilism requires a high tolerance for uncertainty,and the courage to revise, modify, and abandon our most cherished beliefs whenthey have been refuted. Robust fallibilism requires what Karl Popper (who wasinﬂuenced by Peirce) called the “open society.” Consequently, fallibilisminvolves more than a minimal tolerance of those who differ from us and challengeour ideas. We must confront and seek to answer their criticisms and objections –and this requires mutual respect.This fallibilistic mentality helps us to appreciate what Putnam means when heascribes to the pragmatists “the thesis that there is no fundamental dichotomybetween ‘facts’ and ‘values’; and the thesis that, in a certain sense, practiceis primary in philosophy.”1 [Notes.html#ch-01n1] To reject the idea of afundamental dichotomy between “facts” and “values” is not to reject the ideathat there are facts – and that objective facts are all important in anyinquiry. Rather, Putnam seeks to emphasize the ways in which our interests andvalues shape what we take to be the facts in a given context. Furthermore, afallibilistic mentality becomes meaningful and effective only when it becomesconcrete in our everyday practices.The pragmatists knew how difﬁcult it is to cultivate and sustain a fallibilisticmentality. It does not come into being simply by talking about it or willing it.Fallibilism becomes a concrete reality only if we succeed in developing theproper critical habits and practices in a democratic society. This is an ongoingtask that is never completed. Dewey’s lifelong interest in education, especiallyin the education of the young, was motivated by his conviction about theimportance of the role of the schools in nurturing a fallibilistic mentality.We can now better understand what Putnam means when he underscores the pragmaticinsight that one can be fallibilistic and anti-skeptical. When Putnam speaks ofskepticism, he is referring to the philosophical doctrine that calls intoquestion the very possibility of knowledge. But fallibilism is not skepticism inthis sense. It does not raise skeptical doubts about the very possibility ofknowledge. On the contrary, it is intended to bring out the essentialcharacteristics of what constitutes legitimate knowledge – including both commonsense and scientiﬁc knowledge. But fallibilism does raise doubts about the verypossibility of absolute incorrigible knowledge. The pragmatists are not sayingthat the idea of such absolute knowledge is a desirable goal, but that we ﬁnitehuman beings can never achieve it. They are making a much more forceful andchallenging claim: the very idea of absolute incorrigible knowledge isincoherent. Consequently, fallibilism does not lead to despair about thepossibility of gaining knowledge, but seeks to illuminate how we can securewarranted knowledge claims and make progress in our inquiries.In contrast to the philosophical doctrine of epistemological skepticism, thereis a more commonsense concept of “skepticism,” such that we can even speak offallibilistic skepticism. Menand succinctly describes the liberating quality ofthe fallibilistic skepticism advocated by the pragmatic thinkers.The belief that ideas should never become ideologies – either justifying thestatus quo, or dictating some transcendent imperative for renouncing it – wasthe essence of what they taught.In many ways this was a liberating attitude, and it accounts for the popularityof Holmes, James, and Dewey (Peirce was a special case) enjoyed in theirlifetimes, and for the effect they had on a whole generation of judges,teachers, journalists, philosophers, psychologists, social scientists, lawprofessors, and even poets. They taught a kind of skepticism that helped peoplecope with life in a heterogeneous, industrialized, mass-market society, asociety in which older human bonds of custom and community seemed to have becomeattenuated, and to have been replaced by more impersonal networks of obligationand authority. . . . Holmes, James, Peirce and Dewey helped to free thought fromthe thralldom to ofﬁcial ideologies, of the church or the state or even theacademy. There is also, though, implicit in what they wrote, a recognition ofthe limits of what thought can do in the struggle to increase human happiness.(Menand 2001: p. xii)There is another motif that is characteristic of a pragmatic fallibilisticmentality. William James was the ﬁrst philosopher to dignify the word“pluralism” when he entitled one of his last books A Pluralistic Universe. Thereis no single system, no single all-encompassing philosophy, that stands for alltime. The universe is pluralistic, and we as ﬁnite agents have multiple andlimited perspectives in coping with this universe. He argued that philosophersfrequently tend to substitute their rariﬁed neat abstractions for the thicktangled plurality of life itself. Few philosophers have equaled James in hisability to describe, elicit, and celebrate the concrete plurality and varietiesof human life.The pragmatists also anticipated the importance of what has become theoverwhelming fact of contemporary life: the plurality of cultural, ethnic, andreligious differences. When James delivered his Oxford lectures in 1908, whichwere later published as A Pluralistic Universe, two young Americans were in theaudience: Horace Kallen, a Jewish American, and Alain Locke, the ﬁrst AfricanAmerican to be a Rhodes scholar. They had already formed a friendship duringtheir student days at Harvard. Both were deeply inﬂuenced by James’s vision ofpluralism, and sought to apply James’s ideas to articulating the notion of“cultural pluralism.” Horace Kallen coined the expression “cultural pluralism.”And Kallen’s own defense of cultural pluralism led to a lively discussion amongmany who had been shaped by the pragmatic mentality, including Alain Locke, W.E. B. Du Bois (another student of James), and Randolph Bourne. Becauseanti-Semitism and racism were so prevalent in the United States at the time,there was a strong practical motivation in the pragmatic effort to develop aviable conception of cultural pluralism. The pragmatic thinkers advanced“cultural pluralism” as a norm and an ideal when there was an outbreak ofxenophobia in the United States. In the 1920s Congress passed extremelyrestrictive immigration laws to keep out “undesirable foreigners.” These lawswere “justiﬁed” by pseudo-scientiﬁc appeals to eugenics, in order to keepAmerica “racially pure.”2 [Notes.html#ch-01n2] Once again, the pragmatists foundthemselves ﬁghting a pernicious absolute mentality – one that divided the worldinto “we Americans” and “undesirable foreigners.”Because there are not only different shifting individual and group identitiesbut also conﬂicting and clashing ones, the problem of the tolerance ofdifferences has become especially acute in contemporary life. We live at a timewhen there are powerful tendencies toward globalization. But this globalizationincreases our awareness of heterogeneity and differences. Throughout the worldtensions and hostilities ﬂare up among different cultural, religious, and ethnicgroups. During the past 50 years many thinkers have been acutely aware of thesigniﬁcance of difference, otherness, alterity, and incommensurability. There issomething extremely important in this new consciousness, but also something thatis excessive and disturbing. There is a legitimate reaction to what James calls“intellectualism,” and to what is sometimes called “abstract universalism,” atype of universalism that is insensitive to particularity and pluralism. Ethnic,cultural, and religious groups who feel that their very identity is threatenedin the name of some presumably universal ideal have strongly resistedassimilation. These so-called universal ideals turn out – so it is claimed – tomask the prejudices of a dominant and powerful group. In the name of “openness”and “tolerance,” there is a disguised intolerance. We expect others to be and toact just like us, and we expect them to adopt and accept our norms and values.Emmanuel Levinas is right when he claims that there has been a deep tendency inWestern thought to try to assimilate the “other” to the “same” – to obliteratethe singularity of the otherness of the other. He speaks of this tendency as“ontological imperialism,” and when he does so, he is not using a dead metaphor.For the same logic is at work in political, economic, and cultural imperialism.But we must also be alert to the excessive celebration of difference, otherness,and alterity. Not all forms of difference are desirable or to be welcomed. Someof these we must strongly oppose – especially those that seek to undermine oreliminate genuine plurality. Consequently, we need to develop a criticalfallibilistic attitude toward cultural differences, distinguishing those thatare to be welcomed and embraced in a pluralistic society from those thatthreaten the very existence of such a society. And here too, I believe that apragmatic mentality is helpful in overcoming the specious dichotomy betweenabstract universalism and an uncritical celebration of singularity anddifference. Although the pragmatists emphasize plurality, difference, andotherness, they were never guilty of what Karl Popper once called “the myth ofthe framework.” This is the myth that we are prisoners caught in the frameworkof our own theories, cultures, values, and language – so much so that we cannotcommunicate with those who are encased in “radically” different, incommensurableframeworks. The “myth of the framework” leads straight to the type of relativismthat undermines the critical evaluation of plural cultural practices. Thepragmatists consistently advocated an engaged pluralism – an orientation whereinwe acknowledge what is different from us, but seek to understand and criticallyengage it.3 [Notes.html#ch-01n3]In opposition to the myth of the framework, which treats different cultures andlanguages as if they were completely closed and self-contained, the pragmatistsargued that it is always possible to move beyond and enlarge our limitedhorizon. We do this through the dialogical encounter with what is other anddifferent. Failure to engage with what is strange and alien is a practicalfailure, a failure of imagination, and a failure to make an effort to understandwhat is different from us. Pluralism is not relativism. As a corollary toPutnam’s claim that the pragmatists elaborated a fallibilism that isanti-skeptical, I would add that they also developed a pluralism that isanti-relativistic. Engaged pluralism is the very opposite of relativism. Itdemands that we make a serious effort to really understand what is other anddifferent from us. It requires that we engage in the critique of our own viewsas well as those of the people we encounter.To complete this portrait of the mentality of pragmatic fallibilism, I want toexplore one ﬁnal theme that is necessary for grasping its essential character.This is the centrality of the notions of chance and contingency. Peirceintroduced a positive conception of chance. During his lifetime – before thediscovery of quantum physics – many philosophers and scientists accepted someversion of mechanistic determinism that left no room for chance. Presumably, thelaws of nature are such that everything that ever happens is completely ﬁxedaccording to these laws. From this perspective, “chance” is just a name for ourignorance of these laws. If we had full knowledge of these laws, then we wouldsee that what appears to be a chance event is really fully determined. TheFrench scientist Pierre–Simon Laplace, who declared that “we must . . . imaginethe present state of the universe as the effect of its prior state and the causeof the state that will follow it,” put forth one of the most famous statementsof this philosophy of determinism.An intelligence which, for a given instant, could know all the forces by whichnature is animated, and the respective situation of the beings who compose it,if, moreover, it was sufﬁciently vast to submit these data to analysis, if itcould embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies in theuniverse as well as those of the lightest atom – nothing would be uncertain forit, and the future, like the past, would be present to its eyes. (Quoted inMenand 2001: 196)Peirce argued that this notion of determinism was neither a presupposition nor awarranted conclusion of actual scientiﬁc inquiry. It is an unwarranted a prioriprejudice – one that is completely unjustiﬁed by the actual practice ofexperimental science. Indeed, Peirce argued that actual scientiﬁc laws are notabsolutely precise and determinate. As Menand tells us:If scientiﬁc laws are not absolutely precise, then scientiﬁc terminology has tobe understood in a new way. Words like “cause” and “effect,” “certainty” and“chance,” even “hard” and “soft” cannot be understood as naming ﬁxed anddiscrete entities or properties; they have to be understood as naming points ona curve of possibilities, as guesses or predictions rather than conclusions.Otherwise, scientists are in danger of reifying their concepts – of imputing anunvarying essence to phenomena that are in a continual state of ﬂux. Peirce wasthe ﬁrst scientist to perceive all the implications of this problem, and hisphilosophy . . . is obsessed with it. The problem boils down to this question:What does it mean to say that a statement “true” in a world is alwayssusceptible to “a certain swerving”? (Menand 2001: 223)This “swerving,” this positive reality of chance is a basic element of theuniverse. Peirce called it “tychism” – based on the Greek word for chance. Inone of his most speculative essays, “A Guess at the Riddle” (unpublished duringhis lifetime), he declares:We are brought, then, to this: conformity to law exists only within a limitedrange of events and even there is not perfect, for an element of purespontaneity or lawless originality mingles, or at least, must be supposed tomingle, with law everywhere. Moreover conformity with law is a fact requiring tobe explained; and since Law in general cannot be explained by any law inparticular, the explanation must consist in showing how law is developed out ofpure chance, irregularity, and indeterminacy. . . . According to this, threeelements are active in the world: ﬁrst chance; second law; and thirdhabit-taking.Such is our guess of the secret of the sphinx. (Peirce 1992: 276–7)Peirce consistently argued that we can’t understand the laws of nature unless weappreciate the positive role of chance – that it is a basic irreducible“element” active in a dynamic world. Typically, Peirce – in his speculationsabout the role of chance in the universe – was primarily concerned withclarifying the character of experimental science and the role of statisticalprobability in scientiﬁc explanation. James and Dewey sought to humanizePeirce’s insight, and to bring out its rich ethical and political implications.The world in which we live is an “open universe” in which there is real chance,luck, and contingency. Contingency is a source of both joy and tragedy; itpresents us with an opportunity and a challenge. Human agents can make adifference in shaping the world, although to do so intelligently requiressustained, rigorous inquiry. The reality of chance and contingency also meansthat we can never anticipate fully what will happen. This reinforces thenecessity of developing critical ﬂexible habits and practices that can help uscope with unexpected contingencies.The pragmatists, Dewey in particular, are sometimes accused of being naïvelyoptimistic about what we can do and achieve. But when Dewey himself turned towhat he called metaphysics, as the study of “the existential world in which welive,” he told us that there is good reason to appeal to misfortunes andmistakes as evidence of the precarious nature of the world.Man ﬁnds himself living in an aleatory world; his existence involves, to put itbaldly, a gamble. The world is a scene of risk; it is uncertain, unstable,uncannily unstable. Its dangers are irregular, inconstant, not to be countedupon as to their times and seasons. Plague, famine, failure of crops, disease,death, defeat in battle, are always just around the corner, and so areabundance, strength, victory, festival and song. Luck is proverbially both goodand bad in its distribution. (Dewey 1981: 278)We can never control our destinies completely or fully anticipate unexpectedcontingencies, but we can learn how to respond to them intelligently.Consequently, the mentality of pragmatic fallibilism is neither optimistic norpessimistic; it is practical and realistic."},{"pageContent":"2--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Anticipations and Legacy of Pragmatic FallibilismIn the epilogue to his book, Menand concludes his historical narrative bydeclaring “that a movement of thought that had grown out of the experience ofthe Civil War appeared to reach an end with the Cold War” (Menand 2001: 438).Before examining critically what he means by this, I want to return to a claimthat I made in the previous chapter about mentalities. I suggested thatmentalities take a variety of historical forms. Thus far I have explored thementality of pragmatic fallibilism and its contrast with a mentality thatappeals to absolutes, certainties, and stark oppositions of good and evil. Thepragmatists never claimed to be completely original. On the contrary, when Jamesspoke of “pragmatism,” he characterized it as a new name for an old way ofthinking. The pragmatic thinkers are rich and varied, because they drew upondifferent philosophical traditions in working out their ideas. Peirce initiallydrew his inspiration from Kant. He claimed to have studied the Critique of PureReason so thoroughly that he knew it virtually by heart. He appropriated theexpression “pragmatic” from Kant’s anthropological writings. As a young man,Dewey was inspired by Hegel – although Dewey’s Hegel was a thinker whoanticipated Dewey’s own pragmatic experimentalism. Dewey “drifted away” fromHegel, and Darwin replaced Hegel as his hero. But Dewey recognized that Hegel’sdynamic organic conception of experience left a permanent deposit in his ownthinking. James was always drawn to the British empiricists, even though hesharply criticized their tendency to think of experience as an aggregate of bitsof discrete, atomic impressions. In his essay “What Pragmatism Means,” hedeclared that pragmatism is continuous with the empiricist attitude inphilosophy.Pragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy, theempiricist attitude, but it represents it, as it seems to me, both in moreradical and less objectionable form than it has ever yet assumed. A pragmatistturns his back resolutely and once and for all upon a lot of inveterate habitsdear to professional philosophers. He turns away from abstraction andinsufﬁciency, from verbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from ﬁxedprinciples, closed systems, and pretended absolutes and origins. He turnstowards concreteness and adequacy towards facts, towards action and towardspower. That means the empiricist temper regnant and the rationalist tempersincerely given up. It means open air and possibilities of nature, as againstdogma, artiﬁciality, and the pretence of ﬁnality in truth. (James 1977: 379)The pragmatists borrowed freely and appropriated what they found intellectuallycongenial, while ignoring or rejecting what they thought should be discarded.They recognized themes and insights in previous philosophers that anticipatedwhat they emphasized. They also recognized themselves as belonging to, andfurthering the development of, an American tradition. This was especially trueof James, Holmes, and Dewey. “Pragmatism belongs to a disestablishment impulsein American culture – an impulse that drew strength from the writings ofEmerson, who attacked institutions and conformity, and from the ascendancy,after the Civil War, of evolutionary theories, which drew attention to thecontingency of all social forms” (Menand 2001: 89). Cornel West, in his ownnarrative of the development of pragmatism, begins with Emerson as the key ﬁgurewho initiated many of the themes that the pragmatists developed (West 1989: ch.1). Dewey deeply admired Emerson. He declared: “Emerson stands for restoring tothe common man that which in the name of religion, philosophy, of art andmorality, has been embezzled from the common store and appropriated to sectarianand class use” (Dewey 1981: 29). But Dewey reaches back further in Americanhistory and looks upon his own pragmatic defense of creative democracy as havingits roots in Jefferson’s vision of democracy. Jefferson was always one ofDewey’s heroes, because Jefferson’s conception of democracy is moral through andthrough: in its foundations, its methods, and its ends. Like Jefferson’s notionof the wards as “small republics,” Dewey felt that democracy requires a vitallocal community life – an active civil society – in which there is debate,deliberation, and dialogue. In The Public and its Problems, he wrote:Unless local communal life can be restored, the public cannot adequately solveits most urgent problem, to ﬁnd and identify itself. But if it is reestablished,it will manifest a fullness, variety and freedom of possession and enjoyment ofmeanings and goods unknown in the contiguous associations of the past. For itwill be alive and ﬂexible as well as stable, responsive to the complex andworldwide scene in which it is enmeshed. While local, it will not be isolated.(Dewey 1927: 216)I have been focusing on the historical situatedness of pragmatic fallibilism inthe American context because I believe it represents what is best in thistradition. But this fallibilistic mentality stands in sharp conﬂict to anotherAmerican tradition, which dates back to the Puritans – one that is drawn toabsolutes, moral certainties, and sharp dichotomies of good and evil. Atdifferent stages in our history, the conﬂict of mentalities has broken out withrenewed vigor. And today, in a post-9/11 world – a world in which there are allsorts of new unanticipated dangers – we are once again engaged in a ﬁerce battleof clashing mentalities. But there is nothing uniquely American about pragmaticfallibilism; it has a more universal and global reach. The pragmatists were“rooted cosmopolitans.” They were rooted in, and responsive to, the conﬂicts inAmerican life, but they were cosmopolitan in their aspirations and vision.In the ﬁrst lecture of A Pluralistic Universe, James makes an extremelyperceptive remark. He tells us:If we take the whole history of philosophy, the systems reduce themselves to afew main types which, under all the technical verbiage in which the ingeniousintellect of man envelopes them, are just so many visions, modes of feeling thewhole push, and seeing the whole drift of life, forced on one by one’s totalcharacter and experience, and on the whole preferred – there is no othertruthful word – as one’s best working attitude. (James 1977: 489)This dovetails with what James writes about the role of temperament inphilosophy.The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of humantemperaments. Undigniﬁed as such a treatment may seem to some of my colleagues,I shall have to take account of this clash and explain a good many of thedivergences of philosophers by it. Of whatever temperament a professionalphilosopher is, he tries, when philosophizing, to sink the fact of histemperament. Temperament is no conventionally recognized reason, so he urgesimpersonal reasons only for his conclusions. Yet temperament really gives him astronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premises. (James 1977:363)Some philosophers have been scandalized by these claims. They accuse James of arampant “subjectivism” – a denial of the neutrality and objectivity thatphilosophy ought to strive to achieve. But I believe that James is beingbrutally honest and extremely insightful. What James means by “vision” and“temperament” is close to what I am calling “mentality.” James certainly doesnot denigrate the role of argument in philosophy. It is all important. Visionwithout argument becomes sentimental, and arguments without vision are pedanticand sterile. When James speaks of these visions being forced on one by one’stotal character and experience, he is certainly recognizing that they are not“merely” subjective or arbitrary. But if we approach different philosophers inthis manner, with focus on their “visions, modes of feeling the whole push, andseeing the whole drift of life,” then we can see how the mentality embodied inpragmatic fallibilism has a much broader, deeper, and universal signiﬁcance.Philosophers working in very different traditions and historical contexts sharea similar vision and exhibit a similar temperament in their approach tothinking, action, and feeling.I want to illustrate this by considering brieﬂy two inﬂuential contemporaryphilosophers whose work is congenial to pragmatic fallibilism: Charles Taylorand Jürgen Habermas. I am not claiming that Taylor and Habermas are pragmatists.Some of their differences from the pragmatic thinkers are as striking asanything that they have in common with them. And the differences between Taylorand Habermas are also consequential. In philosophy and social theory, it isfrequently the differences that make all the difference in the world. But I amsuggesting that if we take the kind of approach suggested by James, we canrecognize how close they are to the pragmatic thinkers – how they exhibit thesame mentality – the same philosophical temperament and vision.We can see this by turning again to the theses that Putnam enumerated asconstitutive of the pragmatic “way of thinking”: anti-skepticism, fallibilism,the denial of a dichotomy of fact and value, and the primacy of practice. Taylorand Habermas would endorse all of these theses. They have elaborated them inways that enrich pragmatic fallibilism. Thus, for example, Charles Taylor hasbeen one of the sharpest critics of a positivist conception of the socialsciences based on the rigid dichotomy of fact and value. And Habermas, from hisown early comments on the “positivist debate” through his theory of cognitiveinterests to the elaboration of his theory of communicative action, haschallenged the fact – value dichotomy and the separation of facts and norms.Both Taylor and Habermas have consistently afﬁrmed fallibilism. Taylor draws onthe phenomenological and hermeneutical tradition to develop his version offallibilism and the openness of dialogue. And Habermas has been a relentlesscritic of total systems that claim completeness and necessity. His idea of“postmetaphysical thinking” is a version of fallibilism that must be responsiveto ongoing public criticism. Both Taylor and Habermas have a vital sense of aworld of unexpected contingencies. This shapes their understanding of therelation of theory and practice. Both are sharp critics of all forms ofdogmatism and ideologies, and both have criticized some of the excesses of a“postmodernism” that denies objective validity and celebrates relativism. Theyhave sought to defend the role of open dialogical communication as fundamentalto a democratic deliberation. The issue of cultural pluralism has been centralfor both of them. What is fascinating about their own debates concerningmulticulturalism is the way they echo the tensions that were prominent in thepragmatic debates in the 1920s. Taylor is closer to Horace Kallen’sunderstanding of cultural pluralism, with its emphasis on the need to protectthe rights of different groups in order to secure their continued existence. AndHabermas is closer to Dewey, who worries about the dangers of reifying culturalseparatism.1 [Notes.html#ch-02n1]But there is another dimension of their understanding of the relation of theoryand practice that brings them even closer to the pragmatists – especially JohnDewey. Both have been public intellectuals very much in the spirit of Dewey.Taylor is the leading Canadian public philosopher of his generation, just asHabermas is the leading German public intellectual. Like Dewey, they have notonly contributed to professional philosophical concerns, but have consistentlyaddressed the critical political and social issues of their time in the publicmedia. As with Dewey, their theoretical concerns grow out of their awareness ofconcrete social and political conﬂicts. At the core of their vision stands theproject of rethinking what democracy means in a complex technological globalworld – a world in which there are powerful forces distorting and underminingthe ﬂourishing of democracy. Taylor and Habermas, like Dewey before them, havesought to identify and probe the most serious threats and dangers that democracyfaces in a global world dominated by instrumental and technological thinking.Taylor, a native of Montreal, grew up in a bilingual and bicultural home, withan English-speaking Protestant father and a French-speaking Catholic mother. Hehas always been concerned with the problem of political fragmentation and theeclipse of public life. For more than 40 years, he has sought to elaborate anunderstanding and ideal of “deep diversity” that is at once sensitive to therecognition of different cultural identities yet strives to achieve a genuinecommonality. And if one wants to understand Habermas’s philosophical project andthe vision that stands at the heart of his thinking, then one must relate it tothe central intellectual and emotional crisis of his life. It was his discoveryjust after the Second World War – when he was still in his teens – of the fullscope of the horrors of the Nazi period. All of Habermas’s thinking can berelated to his lifelong attempt not simply to understand what happened toGermany at that dark time, but to articulate and defend a deliberativedemocratic alternative. Both Taylor and Habermas have also been cosmopolitanthinkers. They draw upon different philosophical traditions in developing theirown philosophical visions of a global democracy that is sensitive to culturaland national differences. In philosophical terms, they seek to combine a respectfor difference and otherness within a context of concrete universality. It isnot surprising that Habermas’s vision is so close to pragmatic fallibilism,because Peirce, Dewey, and Mead have deeply inﬂuenced his philosophicalinvestigations. Habermas has always recognized how close his temperament andoutlook are to those of the pragmatic thinkers. And recently, Charles Taylor hascome to recognize his intellectual afﬁnities with William James.2[Notes.html#ch-02n2]I want to reiterate what I stated earlier. My intention is not to show thatTaylor and Habermas are “really” pragmatists. Rather, I want to show how thementality that informs their work exhibits a profound afﬁnity with pragmaticfallibilism. Both Taylor and Habermas share Dewey’s democratic faith “in therole of consultation, of conference, of persuasion, in the formation of publicopinion which is in the long run self-corrective” (Dewey 1939: 227). This basicconviction animates the thinking of Dewey, Habermas, and Taylor.If we consider once again what William James says about temperament and visionin determining one’s way of thinking and acting, then we can see how closeHabermas and Taylor are to the pragmatic thinkers. They exhibit and share thementality of pragmatic fallibilism. And this commonality exempliﬁes my basicclaim that the same mentality informs philosophical projects that arise indifferent historical settings.I want to return to Menand’s narrative of the fate of the pragmatic thinkers inthe United States. Although his remarks are sketchy, Menand suggests that it wasthe Cold War that was primarily responsible for their demise.Holmes, James, Peirce, and Dewey wished to bring ideas and principles andbeliefs down to a human level because they wished to avoid the violence they sawhidden in abstractions. This is one of the lessons the Civil War had taughtthem. The political system their philosophy was designed to support wasdemocracy. And democracy, as they understood it, isn’t just letting the rightpeople have their say: it’s also about letting the wrong people have their say.It is about giving space to minority and dissenting views so that, at the end ofthe day, the interests of the majority may prevail. (Menand 2001: 440)But the Cold War represented a very different style of thinking and mentality,one that displaced the open, experimental, fallibilistic attitude of thepragmatic thinkers.The Cold War was a war over principles.. . . A style of thought that elevatedcompromise over confrontation therefore did not hold much appeal. Even theopponents of the Cold War mounted their opposition on principle. The notion thatvalues of the free society, for which the Cold War was waged were contingent,relative, fallible constructions, good for some purposes and not good forothers, was not a notion compatible with the moral imperatives of the age.(Menand 2001: 441)And in a ﬁnal coda, Menand tells us:And once the Cold War ended, the ideas of Holmes, James Peirce and Dewey emergedas suddenly as they had been eclipsed. The writers began to be studied anddebated with a seriousness and intensity, both in the United States and in othercountries, that they had not attracted for forty years, For in the post-Cold Warworld, where there are many competing belief systems, not just two, skepticismabout the ﬁnality of any particular set of beliefs has begun to seem to somepeople an important value again. And so has the political theory this skepticismhelps to underwrite: the theory of democracy is the value that validates allother values. Democratic participation isn’t the means to an end, in this way ofthinking; it is the end. The purpose of the experiment is to keep the experimentgoing. (Menand 2001: 441)Menand wrote these words shortly before 9/11 – and since that infamous date,there has been a radical shift in the dominant ways of thinking. One must notunderestimate the consequential differences of the American Civil War, the ColdWar, and the new “War on Terror.” Each of these occurred in radically differenthistorical circumstances, with very different origins and causes. Yet there aresome disturbing similarities in the mentality that gained dominance in thesedifferent times and circumstances. There is an appeal to rigid principles, moralcertainties, and confrontation. There are no nuances here, but only thewhite-and-black opposition of good and evil. This is a quasi-Manichaean world.It is quasi-Manichaean, because the original Manichaeans believed that God iscoeternal with Satan. Consequently there can be no ﬁnal victory over evil. Buttoday we are told that ultimately Good will triumph over Evil. We hear this notonly from our own political leaders, but also from those militant Islamicfanatics who are convinced of the righteousness of their cause. Both sides areconvinced that God is on their side, and will vindicate their cause. Anydeviation from this stark opposition is interpreted as a sign of vacillation andweakness. And there is also a pernicious sexual subtext here. The “masculine”virtues of toughness, strength, decisiveness, determination to stay the course,are accentuated. Those who oppose this are “feminized.” They are sensitive,indecisive, and weak. They are “girlie-men.”It is true that the absolute low point – the nadir – of the inﬂuence ofpragmatism in America coincided with the origins of the Cold War, and that agreat revival of interest in pragmatism has taken place since the passing of theCold War. But the full story of the demise and resurgence of pragmatism is – asMenand himself notes – more complicated. Many factors contributed to themarginalization of the pragmatic thinkers. During the decades preceding theSecond World War, there was a rapid growth of professionalism in academicphilosophy departments. There was a new emphasis on technical, logical, andargumentative ﬁnesse among philosophers, with little concern for broaderpolitical and social issues. At the height of his popularity, Dewey calledpassionately for philosophers to enlarge their vision, to turn away from anexclusive concern with the traditional problems of philosophy and to focus theirattention on the “problems of men” – the problems that human beings face intheir everyday lives. But by the 1950s, many academic philosophers wereobsessively concerned with the “problems of philosophy” – and with dissolvingthem. The very idea of the philosopher as a public intellectual who wouldaddress the “problems of men” was ridiculed. The discipline of philosophy becameso specialized and so esoteric that few persons outside the discipline saw thatit had much relevance. During the past few decades, however, there has been aresurgence of pragmatism.3 [Notes.html#ch-02n3] But this interest is still beenprimarily limited to academic circles. There is no intellectual ﬁgure in Americatoday who has the inﬂuence and appeal of thinkers like Holmes, James, or Dewey.4[Notes.html#ch-02n4]But there is another way to understand the vicissitudes of a fallibilisticpragmatic orientation. As a historical philosophical movement, there is much inthe classical pragmatic thinkers that is dated and irrelevant for us today. Thismakes perfect sense from a pragmatic point of view. As strong advocates ofongoing self-corrective inquiry, the pragmatic thinkers would be the ﬁrst toclaim that this also applies to the claims advanced by the pragmatiststhemselves. With their consciousness that philosophical speculation is alwaysgrounded in its concrete historical context, they would also insist philosophymust be rethought in light of the new problems and conﬂicts that emerge indifferent historical contexts. But there is a vital core of the pragmatic ethosthat is enduring and transcends the historical context in which it emerged.Peirce, James, and Dewey did think – for the most part – that once the quest forcertainty was exposed, once the craving for absolutes was challenged, once welearned that there is no permanent metaphysical comfort and that we must copeintelligently with unexpected contingencies and dangers, then there would be nogoing back – no return to a world of simple binary oppositions of Good and Evil.But they were wrong. They underestimated the appeal of the mentality theyopposed – especially in times of perceived crisis, anxiety, and fear. But withthe hope that a pragmatic fallible mentality would prevail, there was always therealization that it requires constant and persistent effort to make the virtuesand practices of a fallibilistic mentality a living reality. It is not easy tolive with contingency and uncertainty. There is a deep craving for security andcertainty – and there is always the possibility of a regression to a moresimpliﬁed world of black-and-white dichotomies – a simpliﬁed world in whichthere is no ambiguity about Good and Evil. To institute a fallibilistic ethos asliving reality in people’s everyday lives requires passionate commitment andpersistence, because this ethos is always under threat. And today the threatsare more serious and more ominous than they have ever been. We are told that weare engaged in a new kind of war that is different from all other wars – a “Waron Terror.” And to win this war, we do not have the luxury of being pragmaticfallibilists.What we are confronting today – since 9/11 – is a clash of mentalities. And thisis a clash that cuts across morality, politics, and religion. It manifestsitself in all areas of human experience. It is fashionable today to associatethe quest for certainty and the craving for absolutes with religion. When thepresident of the most powerful nation in the world appeals to the Almighty tojustify controversial political and military decisions, and sees himself as theleader of the battle against Evil, when he adopts an apocalyptic rhetoric, it isnot difﬁcult to understand why his critics are so skeptical of these “religious”claims. And without underestimating the crucial differences, it is alarming tosee parallels with those militants who appeal to God to justify a jihad – a holywar – against the evil in ﬁdels. But the problem is not religion. Rather, it isthe mentality that prevails in religion. Within the great world religions, weﬁnd the same clash of mentalities. The mentality of pragmatic fallibilism is notanti-religious; it is anti-dogmatic and anti-ideological.The point that I want to emphasize goes beyond pragmatism. In the greatreligious traditions there have always been believers who have argued that agenuine religious faith is one that is open to questioning. We must not confusereligious faith with ideological fanaticism. And we must passionately opposeideological fanaticism wherever it arises – regardless of whether it takes areligious or a nonreligious form. We must passionately oppose the abuse of evilwherein we demonize the enemy, oversimplify a complex reality by imposing faciledichotomies, make specious claims of certainty, and denigrate critical thinking."},{"pageContent":"3--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Moral Certainty and Passionate CommitmentIn the previous chapters I described the mentality of pragmatic fallibility andcontrasted it with the appeal to absolutes, moral certainties, and ablack-and-white world of good and evil. But the objection might well be raisedthat I have ignored some tough issues. A critic might object that I am guilty ofpresenting a new misleading Either/Or: either pragmatic fallibility or theappeal to absolutes. But such an Either/Or masks the real situation that weconfront today. Fallibilism may well be the preferred ethos in those situationsin which we can expect deliberation – where we are dealing with reasonablepersons who are open and willing to engage in critical dialogue. But this is notour situation today. It is a world in which terrorism, which has becomeincreasingly sophisticated, poses radically new threats. We have to face therealistic possibility that terrorists may soon have the chemical, biological,and even nuclear weapons to carry out mass murder. It may well be that there isno single essence or deﬁnition of what we take to be evil, but the deliberatemurder of innocent victims has always been an exemplar of evil. The critic mightpoint out that I have already conceded that new forms of evil have burst forthin the twentieth century. Why not recognize that we are now facing a new form ofevil? The trouble with the pragmatists is that they have always feltuncomfortable with facing up to evil. “Evil” is not really a part of theirvocabulary. They speak of contingencies and dangers, but they are unrealisticabout the real dangers that now exist. Deliberation, diplomacy, and persuasionare, of course, desirable. But we have to realize that – to use a pragmatic turnof phrase – they do not work in the extreme circumstances that exist today inthe “War on Terror.” We are dealing with ruthless fanatical murderers. We haveto be decisive, forceful, steadfast, and fully committed to ﬁghting this newevil. The real weakness with pragmatism is that it lacks the resources tojustify decisiveness and passionate commitment. Such a commitment depends on aﬁrm conviction – the moral and political certainty that one’s cause is just.Otherwise we will lack the will and persistence to make the sacriﬁces requiredfor ﬁghting the enemy. The primary issue is the eminently practical one of doingwhat is required to ﬁght this new evil. Pragmatists are always telling us thatwe should judge ideas by their consequences. Despite the well-intentioned claimsof the pragmatists, the real consequences of this mentality are indecisivenessand a ﬂuctuating equivocation that undermines principled commitment and cleardecisive action.The objection is a serious one, and it needs to be confronted squarely. It is avariation of the familiar charge that pragmatism is naively optimistic and doesnot fully appreciate the tragic dark side of human life, the sinfulness of humanbeings, and the intransigence of evil. During Dewey’s lifetime, Reinhold Niebuhrpressed this criticism against him. More recently, it has been reiterated byJack Diggins. Even Cornel West, who thinks of himself as working in thepragmatic tradition, worries about whether pragmatists really have the resourcesto deal with evil.1 [Notes.html#ch-03n1]Sidney Hook has given one of the sharpest and best responses to the caricatureof pragmatism as being naively optimistic and lacking the resources to deal withtragedy and evil. Hook was a student and a close associate of John Dewey. As ayoung man, before his pragmatic turn, he identiﬁed himself with a Hegelian–Marxist tradition, but he became one of the most penetrating and forcefulcritics of communism at a time when many American liberals were still fellowtravelers. He was known as the “bulldog” of the pragmatists. His 1974 book,Pragmatism and the Tragic Sense of Life, provides a strong critical response tothe recurring objection that pragmatism is superﬁcial and naive. The essayscollected in that volume exhibit a vitality and a freshness that make themhighly relevant to our contemporary situation.2 [Notes.html#ch-03n2] Hooksuccinctly summarizes the familiar caricature of pragmatism “as a superﬁcialphilosophy of optimism, of uncritical adjustment and conformity, of worship ofthe goddess of success.” This distortion, based on a tendentious reading ofPeirce, James, and Dewey, misses what is most central to the pragmatic temper.Pragmatism was not only a method of clarifying ideas by exploring theirconsequences in behavioral use. It was also a temper of mind towards the vitaloptions which men confront when they become aware of what alternative proposalscommit them to. It stressed the efﬁcacy of ideals and actions and at the sametime their inescapable limitations. It foreswore the promise of total solutionsand wholesale salvation for piecemeal gains. Yet far from embracing easyformulae of the ultimate reconciliation of conﬂicting interests and values, itacknowledged the reality of piecemeal losses even when we risk our lives toachieve the gains. (Hook 1974: 4–5)We are frequently faced with hard choices and conﬂicting options where there isno possibility – even after careful deliberation – of reconciling “conﬂictinginterests and values.” And in making these choices we need to be acutely awareof our limitations.No matter how intelligent and humane our choices, there are, as William Jamesinsists, “real losses and real losers.” We live in a dangerous and adventurousand serious world and “the very ‘seriousness’,” James goes on to say, “weattribute to life means that the ineluctable noes and losses form part of it,that there are genuine sacriﬁces, and that something permanently drastic andbitter always remains at the bottom of the cup.” (Hook 1974: 5)This is the aspect of pragmatism that has been ignored by its critics, but it isstands at the heart of pragmatism. Pragmatism, Hook claims, is grounded in arecognition of “the tragic sense of life,” an expression that he appropriatedfrom the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. What, precisely, does Hook meanby the tragic sense of life?Every genuine experience of moral doubt and perplexity in which we ask “Whatshould I do?” takes place in a situation where good conﬂicts with good. If wealready know what is evil, the moral inquiry is over, or it never really begins.“The worse or evil,” Dewey says, “is the rejected good,” but until we reject it,the situation is one in which apparent good opposes apparent good. “All theserious perplexities of life come back to the genuine difﬁculty of forming ajudgment as to the values of a situation; they come back to a conﬂict of goods.”No matter how we resolve the situation, some good will be sacriﬁced, someinterest, whose immediate craving for satisfaction may be every whit as intenseand authentic as its fellows, will be modiﬁed, frustrated or even suppressed.(Hook 1974: 13)There are “small tragedies” in life, but the tragic quality of moral dilemmasemerges most dramatically when the conﬂicts and choices we face are – to useWilliam James’s expressions – momentous and forced. As Dewey tells us, “only theconventional and the fanatical are always immediately sure of right and wrong[or good and evil] in conduct.”We not only have to make difﬁcult choices, but, as Hook emphasizes, we arefrequently faced with moral and political dilemmas where there are incompatibleand irreconcilable values. This is precisely why pragmatists place so muchemphasis on deliberation, inquiry, and the careful evaluation of consequences ofour decisions and actions. The pragmatists do not underestimate the role ofconﬂict in human life – even irreconcilable conﬂicts. Dewey makes the perceptiveobservation that if we already know what is evil, then moral inquiry is over, orit never really begins. Simply labeling something or some person as evil is notmoral inquiry. For all the emotional appeal of this labeling, it obscures anddistorts our choices. The pragmatists stress the agent’s perspective – theperspective of those who have to make choices and decisions. The primaryquestion is always how to respond to what we take to be dangerous, threatening,or unjust situations. And when we conclude that someone or something is evil, weshould be prepared to explain and justify what we mean, because we still have todecide how we will respond to this concrete evil. In making moral or politicalchoices there is always the need for deliberation and questioning, and there isalso always the possibility of disagreement. Reasonable persons can and dodisagree about what is to be done. Furthermore, we frequently have to actwithout the opportunity to engage in full deliberative inquiry. This is why thepragmatists stress the need to cultivate those habits, dispositions, andpractices that will enable us to act decisively. It is a misleading caricatureof the pragmatic mentality to suggest that it calls for endless debate. It isdifﬁcult to think of another philosophical orientation that has placed so muchemphasis on conduct, practice, and action. There is no incompatibility betweenbeing decisive and recognizing the fallibility and limitations of our choicesand decisions. On the contrary, this is what is required for responsible action.We must recognize that whatever we do, there will always be unintended andunpredictable consequences. Acknowledging and intelligently assessing theseconsequences may require altering our conduct. Fallibilism takes seriously thecommonsense realization that we learn – or ought to learn – from our mistakes.And because of human ﬁnitude and limitation, we cannot avoid making mistakes. Ittakes imagination and courage to acknowledge our mistakes. “Steadfastness” and“staying the course” are not virtues but vices when they involve ignoring theundesirable consequences of our choices and actions. “Aside ... from the crueltyof those who glory in the personal harm they can inﬂict, the possibility ofcruelty is the ever-present converse fact of human limitation. We are allcrueler than we know, not because we are evil, but because our senses andimagination have such a limited range” (Hook 1974: 29).One must not confuse ﬂexibility and reﬂective intelligence with indecisiveness.The appeal to evil is being used today to “justify” deeply problematic andquestionable courses of action. In the abuse of evil there is a manipulative –and sometimes cynical – fusing together of widely disparate phenomena into asingle, reiﬁed evil enemy. Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Palestinian suicidebombers, and Chechnyan rebels are lumped together as if they were a single evilenemy – or part of a single global conspiracy.3 [Notes.html#ch-03n3] And thefactual evidence making it clear that this is just not so-and that it ispolitically disastrous to think that there is a single “evil force” threateningour security – is ignored or deliberately suppressed. The very expression “Waron Terror” is deeply misleading. Terror is not an enemy; terror is a complex oftactics and strategies used by different groups for different purposes. Butthose who are all too eager to label the enemy as evil or as part of the “Axisof Evil” are impatient with this obvious fact. The abuse of evil – thereiﬁcation of evil – also blocks serious inquiry into why so many peoplethroughout the world sympathize with terrorists. It blocks inquiry into aphenomenon that is taking on global signiﬁcance – the rage expressed by thosewho believe that they are constantly and systematically being humiliated.Humiliation is one of the primary social and political forces in this globalworld – and there is still little real understanding of its power to motivatepeople. There are not only the evils of fanatical terrorists, but also the evilsof those whose actions inﬂict humiliation. There are “great ranges of cruelty inmodern history, involving the fate of millions, that ﬂow from the limitations ofhuman imagination and sensitivity, of cruelty men do because it is easy to standwhat is out of sight, and still easier to stand what is out of mind” (Hook 1974:29). There is also a failure to raise questions about whether the tactics andstrategies employed in combating our “evil enemies” may have the unintendedconsequence of creating an environment in which terrorists will continue toﬂourish. Like Proteus, terrorism takes on ever new forms. And if we are honest,there is good reason to believe that we can never completely eliminate terroristinitiatives. What we can do is try to eliminate known terrorists, and, asSamantha Power reminds us, “undertake the complex and elaborate effort todistinguish sympathizers from militants and keep its converts to a minimum.Terrorism also requires understanding how our past policies helped to give tosuch venomous grievances” (2004: 37). But today those who seek to raise anddebate such issues are frequently accused of being unpatriotic.“Realization of the evil men can do and have done to men is integral to anyintelligent appraisal of human history” (Hook 1974: 30). We must recognize thevariety of sources of concrete evils. They can ﬂow from “ignorance,insensitiveness and imaginative dullness of even conventionally good men.” Thepost-9/11 discourse about evil is regressive because it is based on one of themost primitive conceptions of evil. We demonize the enemy, think of the enemy aspossessed by Satan – as someone who does evil for evil’s sake. But the lessonthat we should have learned from the twentieth century, from the writings ofHannah Arendt, Primo Levi, and many others is that the worst evils we experiencecannot be adequately understood if we think of them as exclusively the actionsof vicious demonized individuals.There is intelligent and unintelligent fear . . . Intelligent fear arms usagainst real dangers and enables us, by modifying the environment or alteringour behavior, to reduce the incidence of terror and pain. Intelligent fear mustbe proportionate to the dangers. It is the absence of any proportion between thedanger and the fear which marks the panicky and hysterical response. Politicalthinking is often distorted by a failure to distinguish between fears that areill-grounded or well-grounded. (Hook 1974: 58)“The grim fact, however, is that there is sometimes no desire to reason, no wishto negotiate except as a holding action to accumulate strategic power, nothingbut the reliance of one party or the other upon brute force even when otheralternatives may exist” (Hook 1974: 23). The pragmatist mentality recognizesthat there are limits to tolerance. We cannot tolerate those who are activelyintolerant – those who seek to undermine the very possibility of discourse,dialogue, and rational persuasion. But how are we to decide when these limitshave been reached? What is the criterion for deciding when there is a legitimateuse of force? From a pragmatic perspective, these questions cannot be answeredin an abstract manner. They demand speciﬁcity, inquiry into the historicalcircumstances, and risky choices. But if the virtues and practices of robustpragmatic fallibilism prevail, there will be a willingness to listen todissenting voices and an openness to modifying our conduct in light of theintelligent evaluation of the consequences of our choices and actions. Therewill also be a strong resistance to the curtailment of civil liberties.Still, it may be objected that however noble the pragmatic appeal to discussion,dialogue, and persuasion, it fails to grasp the character of fanaticism that ismotivated by irrational passions. This is also an objection that ReinholdNiebuhr pressed against John Dewey. Niebuhr accused Dewey of being a rationalistwho rested his hopes on self-sufﬁcient reason. But Dewey rightly responded thatthis was a caricature of the pragmatic conception of social intelligence. Deweypreferred to speak of intelligence rather than reason because he objected to theway in which many traditional philosophers had characterized reason – as if itwere a special faculty that had intrinsic power. Intelligence is not anautonomous faculty, but consists of a set of habits, dispositions, and virtuesthat are not innate but need to be cultivated. In response to Niebuhr, Deweyafﬁrmed that “intelligence has no power per se.” It becomes powerful “only as itis integrated into some system of wants, of effective demands.” Pragmatism doesnot deny the strength of human emotions and passions. The point is to informthese passions with intelligence, to make them more humane.The critics of a pragmatic temper frequently present themselves as “tough-mindedrealists,” who mock their opponents as “tender-minded sentimentalists.”4[Notes.html#ch-03n4] But Hook gives a piercing rejoinder to this charge. What hewrote in 1947 might well have been written in 2005.This “tough-mindedness” is another expression of the abdication of intelligence.It refuses to discuss the speciﬁc problems and the speciﬁc ways of handlingthem, smothering all problems under a blanket allegiance to some vaguely deﬁnedgoal. It wraps itself up in the blind faith, essentially religious, that nomatter what is done, things will come right in the end. It is impatient with anyattempt to judge verbal professions by consequences in fact. It is really not anattitude of tough-mindedness at all, for it cannot face or live with the truth.It cannot bear to see its assumptions put into the crucible of doubt. Rather itis a tender-minded sentimentalism that reads its pious wishes into themysterious “workings” of history. (Hook 1974: 35)We come here to the heart of the matter – to what is implicitly presupposed inthe objection that I rehearsed at the beginning of this chapter. It is theunspoken assumption that “tough-minded realism,” strength, forcefulness,decisiveness, and persistence are based upon unwavering moral certainty. Forwithout a ﬁrm, absolute, moral conviction, we will lack the determination to dowhat is required to ﬁght evil. But here is where we detect the gross fallaciousslide from subjective moral certitude to alleged objective moral certainty. Thestrength of one’s personal conviction is never sufﬁcient to justify the truth orcorrectness of one’s claims. This is the primary lesson of pragmaticfallibilism. Furthermore, we need to expose the vulgar form of the CartesianAnxiety that corrupts so much of current political rhetoric. We are presentedwith the alternatives of either steadfast moral certainty or a wishy-washyvacillating relativism. And the not-so-hidden implication is that pragmaticfallibility is effeminate and tender-minded; it lacks the guts to cope with theevil of terror. Over and over again, so-called tough-minded realists afﬁrm thisin conscious and subliminal ways. We need to bring this attitude out into theopen and expose it. It is based on confusion between subjective certitude andobjective certainty. Ideologists, fanatics, and fundamentalists are alwaysclaiming certainty. History is full of instances of discarded certainties. AsPeirce noted long ago, we are confronted with conﬂicting, contradictory claimsabout certainty. The fervor with which one asserts the possession of moralcertainties is no evidence whatsoever for the truth or validity of one’s claims.One of the original motivations for the development of pragmatism was therealization that tenacious professions of certitude are never sufﬁcient tojustify the truth of our beliefs. Peirce called this the method of tenacity forﬁxing belief. And what he wrote in 1877 is still – perhaps even more – relevantfor us today.The instinctive dislike of an undecided state of mind, exaggerated into a vaguedread of doubt, makes men cling spasmodically to the views they already take.The man feels that, if he only holds his belief without wavering, it will beentirely satisfactory. Nor can it be denied that a steady and immovable faithyields great peace of mind ... And in many cases it may well be that thepleasure he derives from his calm faith overbalances any inconveniencesresulting from its deceptive character. (Peirce 1992: 116)Earlier I mentioned the rather innocuous situation in which I declare that I amabsolutely certain that I saw someone only to discover that I was mistaken. Butthere are horrendous situations where professions of absolute certainty areextremely dangerous and systematically misleading – if not deceitful. Injustifying the “preventive war,” the US administration bombarded us with theirabsolutely certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of massdestruction.5 [Notes.html#ch-03n5]The supposition that the Bush people truly believed in their WMD nightmare wasindicated by the unconditional quality of their prose. Phrases like “we do know,with absolute certainty,” uttered with majestic authority, abounded in VicePresident Cheney’s speeches. He was also a “no doubt” man in, “There is no doubtthat Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.” The president wasanother “no doubt” man: “Intelligence gathered by this and other governmentsleaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some ofthe most lethal weapons ever devised.” Asked about the location of the WMDs,Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said conﬁdently: “We know where they are.”(Schlesinger 2004: 29)But we now know that all these “no doubt” statements and “absolute certainty”claims were false. Moreover, we also know that doubts about the reliability ofthis intelligence information were systematically discounted. There has beenextensive discussion of whether Bush and his administration genuinely andsincerely believed what they claimed to know with absolute certainty or whetherthey were deliberately lying. Defenders of the administration claim that ourleaders genuinely believed that there were weapons of mass destruction and thatSaddam Hussein did pose on “imminent threat.” But the question must be asked:why were our leaders so ready and eager to believe that Hussein possessed theseweapons? One cannot underestimate the power of the mentality that gripped theadministration – especially the president’s tendency to see the world in thestark terms of good and evil. Greg Thielmann, a member of the State Department’sBureau of Intelligence and Research, claims that the Bush administration had a“faith-based intelligence attitude: ‘We know the answers, give us theintelligence to support these answers.’“ Peter Singer adds:It seems probable that it was not faith in general that gave Bush and his aidesa misplaced conﬁdence that they knew the answers. It was the idea that Saddamwas evil. Writing in Newsweek on how Bush justiﬁed going to war with Iraq,Howard Fineman observed, “He decided that Saddam was evil, and everythingfollows from that.” That alone made it intuitively obvious that Saddam must bebuilding weapons of mass destruction. But it is a mistake to divide the worldneatly into good and evil, black and white without shades of gray, in a mannerthat eliminates the need to learn more about those with whom one is dealing. Foran unreﬂective person, having a sense of “moral clarity” that disregards theshadings in human motivation and conduct can be a vice, not a virtue. (Singer2004: 211–12)But why is the appeal to certainty so seductive when it comes to issues ofchoice, decision, and action? It is because of the belief that unless we dopossess this certainty, we will not have any basis for justifying our choices,decisions, and actions. This is the faulty inference that must be exposed andrejected. When we are acting intelligently, we appeal to reasons to justify ouractions – or we should be prepared to do so if challenged. But when we appeal toreasons, we are operating in a space where there can be better and worsearguments based upon concrete evidence. If we give reasons to justify ouractions, then we must admit that however plausible and convincing we ﬁnd thesearguments, they are always open to further inquiry and critique. There is noescape from fallibility. But does acknowledging the fallibility of our reasonsand justiﬁcations mean that we will lack the conviction and passionatecommitment to choose and act decisively? The answer is clearly No! We should acton what we take to be our best reasons and strongest convictions. We should beprepared to die for what we ultimately cherish. None of this requires anycompromise or weakening of fallibilism – the belief that no matter how ﬁrmly wehold some fundamental beliefs, they are in principle open to criticism andself-correction. To use a different idiom, to acknowledge our fallibility is torecognize our human ﬁnitude. In his famous essay “Two Concepts of Liberty,”Isaiah Berlin quotes a wise saying by Joseph Schumpeter, who wrote: “To realisethe relative validity of one’s convictions and yet stand for them unﬂinchingly,is what distinguishes a civilized man from a barbarian.” And Berlin comments:“To demand more than this is perhaps a deep incurable metaphysical need; but toallow it to determine one’s practice is a symptom of an equally deep, and moredangerous, moral and political immaturity” (Berlin 1969: 172).6[Notes.html#ch-03n6]There is a residual belief that, ideally, it would be most desirable to achievethe type of indubitable certainty that could provide the foundation for ourepistemological and moral judgments; but, as fallible human beings, we can neverachieve such certainty. We have to settle for what is second best – fallibleknowledge. But this really misses the central point of the pragmatists’ insight.They are making a much stronger and more important claim. The very idea ofepistemological or moral certainty is incoherent. In everyday life, we arepractically certain about all sorts of things – even though we may discover thatwe are mistaken in our beliefs. But if we mean by “certainty” something that isincorrigible – something that can never be questioned, modiﬁed, or corrected,then the pragmatists are telling us that there is no such thing! That is why wehave good reason to be skeptical with regard to anyone who tells us that theyare absolutely certain that they know what is truly evil. Once we give up thespecious idea of absolute moral certainty, then we have to think of ourconvictions and commitments in a different way. They ought to be based on ourbest and strongest reasons for acting. And the most effective way of testingthese is by opening them to public discussion, debate, and criticism.In short, we need to be critical of those who claim to know with absolutecertainty what is good and evil, and who think that such moral certainty is thebasis for decisiveness and passionate commitment to ﬁght injustices and concreteevils. Our commitments and convictions will be stronger if they are informed byintelligent deliberation and tested by public discussion. Contrary to those whothink that unless we achieve objective moral certainty, we will lackdecisiveness and ﬁrm commitment to ﬁght for what we believe is right and just,the reverse is true. Our passionate commitment to just causes is strengthenedand deepened when we are prepared to justify them by an appeal to reasons andevidence that are subject to open, public, critical discussion. This isessential for a democracy that truly cherishes freedom."},{"pageContent":"4--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evil and the Corruption of Democratic PoliticsIn my introduction, I claimed that the post-9/11 discourse of good and evil isanti-political and anti-religious. This might seem to be counter-intuitive andperplexing. After all, whether we like it or not, there are frequent referencesto evil in the speeches of politicians, especially in the United States.1[Notes.html#ch-04n1] And it certainly appears to be extremely politicallyeffective – in arousing deep emotions and political support. Furthermore, Bushand those in sympathy with him, are constantly “justifying” their discourse ofgood and evil by an appeal to their religious convictions and faith in theAlmighty. So, it may well be asked, what does it mean to say that this newappeal to good and evil is anti-religious? I want to argue that when we probethe meaning of both democratic politics and religious faith, we see how the newdiscourse of good and evil corrupts both politics and religion. In this chapterI will focus on democratic politics, and in the following chapter on religionand faith.In exploring the meaning of politics, I begin by drawing on the insights ofHannah Arendt. Arendt is now recognized as one of the most perceptive andchallenging political theorists of the twentieth century, and I believe thatmany of her insights must be incorporated in any fully adequate conception ofdemocratic politics.2 [Notes.html#ch-04n2] She once claimed that all thinking“arises out of the actuality of incidents, and incidents of living experiencemust remain guideposts by which it takes its bearings if it is not to loseitself in the heights to which thinking soars, or in the depths to which it mustdescend.” The horrendous experience that profoundly shaped her thinking was herencounter with totalitarianism, especially Nazi totalitarianism. In an interviewin 1964, Arendt was asked: “Is there a deﬁnite event in your memory that datesyour turn to the political?” Without hesitating, she answered: “I would sayFebruary 27, 1933, the burning of the Reichstag, and the illegal arrests thatfollowed during the same night.” From that moment on, she “felt responsible.”“That is, I was no longer of the opinion that one can simply be a bystander”(Arendt 1994: 4). In the following months, Arendt helped others to escape fromNazi Germany. She also aided her Zionist friends. This activity led to theincident that forced her to ﬂee Germany. She was asked by her German Zionistfriends to help document Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda. Despite the danger, shereadily agreed to help. Working in the Prussian State Library in Berlin togather information, she was apprehended, arrested, and interrogated, but shenever admitted what she was doing. Arendt was fortunate. She might have beenmurdered in the cellars of the Gestapo, but she was released after eight days ofinterrogation. Shortly afterward, she ﬂed from Germany. Like many German Jews,Arendt made her way to Paris, where, despite being a “stateless person,” shefound work with Zionist organizations. In May 1940, “enemy aliens” living inParis (mainly German Jews) were rounded up to be sent to detention camps. Shewas separated from her husband and sent to the women’s camp in Gurs. Arendt’sgood luck continued. When the Nazis marched on Paris, there was a desperate fearthat Gurs would be taken over by the victorious Nazis. But there was a shortperiod of confusion when communication broke down. The quick-witted Arendtescaped from the camp with only her toothbrush. (Many of the women who remainedin Gurs were eventually sent to Nazi death camps.) She rejoined her husband in a“safe” region of France. After securing visas to enter the United States, theymade the perilous journey from Vichy France through Spain to Lisbon, where theyﬁnally sailed for New York in the spring of 1941.I have told this story of Arendt’s ﬂight from Germany, from France, and ﬁnallyfrom Europe, for several reasons. We can readily imagine what might havehappened had she been interrogated by a less sympathetic German ofﬁcial, had shenot escaped from Gurs, had she not received a visa to enter the United States,or had she been turned back at the Spanish border (as was her close friend,Walter Benjamin, who subsequently committed suicide). These contingencies meantthe difference between life and death. The radical contingency of events that sodeeply marked her own personal experience inﬂuenced all her thinking. Herencounter with Nazi totalitarianism became the central experience for herthinking about politics. In 1951 she published The Origins of Totalitarianism –a complex book in which she set out to comprehend what had happened with thebursting forth of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism represented a complete breakwith tradition. Traditional political, moral, and social categories were nolonger adequate to understand this new phenomenon, which she sharplydistinguished from all previous forms of tyranny and dictatorship. Near the endof her study she explains why she thinks that totalitarianism represents anunprecedented radical or absolute evil.What totalitarian ideologies therefore aim at is not the transformation of theoutside world or the transmutation of society, but the transformation of humannature itself. The concentration camps are but laboratories where changes inhuman nature are tested, and their shamefulness therefore is not just thebusiness of their inmates and those who run them according to strictly“scientiﬁc” standards; it is the concern of all men. Suffering, of which therehas been always too much on earth, is not the issue, not is the number ofvictims. Human nature as such is at stake. (Arendt 1968: 458–9)Totalitarianism seeks to make human beings as human beings superﬂuous – totransform them into creatures that are less than fully human.3[Notes.html#ch-04n3] In the concentration and extermination camps, there was asystematic attempt to destroy human plurality, spontaneity, individuality andnatality, and freedom. More generally, she claims that totalitarianism seeks tomake all human beings superﬂuous – perpetrators and victims. This is what shecalls absolute or radical evil, which “confronts us with its overpoweringreality and breaks down all standards we know.” Mass murder, genocide,unbearable large-scale suffering by innocent people, torture, and terror havehappened before in history. But it was only with totalitarianism that there wasa systematic attempt to obliterate people’s humanity. It is the specter oftotalitarianism, in both its Nazi and Stalinist variants, that haunts andinforms her understanding of politics. Totalitarianism seeks to eliminateplurality – the human condition that is the basis for action and politics. Withtotalitarianism there is “a much more radical liquidation of freedom as apolitical and as a human reality than anything we have ever witnessed before”(Arendt 1994: 408).In order to understand what Arendt means by politics, we need to explore anetwork of closely interrelated concepts: debate, action, speech, plurality,natality, public space, tangible freedom, opinion, and judgment. Let me start byreﬂecting on what Arendt considers a truism – a truism that has all sorts oframiﬁcations once these are teased out. She tells that “debate constitutes thevery essence of political life” (Arendt 1977a: 241). We should note that, inwhat initially appears to be a casual remark, she does not say that the essenceof political life is the control of the legitimate forms of violence, or evenrulership. Rather, the essence of politics is debate, and we will see that thishas a special meaning for Arendt.Debate itself is a form of action, and “action” is the term that Arendt uses todesignate the highest form of the vita activa (the active life). Shedistinguishes action from labor and work. Labor is the activity grounded inbiological necessity, and work is the activity by which we make or fabricateartiﬁcial objects. What Arendt calls action is close to what Aristotle calledpraxis – the human activity that is involved in leading an ethical and politicallife. Action itself is intimately related to speech. “Action and speech are soclosely related because the primordial and speciﬁcally human act must at thesame time contain the answer to the question asked of every newcomer: ‘Who areyou?’ This disclosure of who somebody is, is implicit in both his words anddeeds” (Arendt 1958: 178). This disclosure of who somebody is takes place in apublic space where we appear to each other and debate with each other. The verycondition for such action and speech is what Arendt calls plurality. “Action,the only activity that goes on directly between men without the intermediary ofthings or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plurality, to the factthat men, not Man, live on earth and inhabit the world” (Arendt 1958: 7).4[Notes.html#ch-04n4] We have already encountered the theme of plurality in ouranalysis of the mentality of pragmatic fallibilism. But Arendt gives plurality adistinctive political meaning. Plurality involves individuality, distinction,and equality. There is distinctiveness about each and every individual whobrings to a common world a unique perspective. And this plurality is rooted inour natality, the capacity to begin, to intiate acton spontaneously, “To act, inits most general sense, means to take initiative, to begin . . . to setsomething in motion” (Arendt 1958: 177). Human beings possess this capacity byvirtue of their birth. Human plurality is the basic condition of action andspeech, because they take place in between human beings in their singularity andplurality. Action, then, is, intrinsically, political activity, and it requiresthe creation of those public spaces within which individuals can encounter eachother as equals and reveal who they are.Drawing on her interpretation of the Greek polis, Arendt tells us that equality– or what the Greeks called isonomy – exists only in the political realm wherehuman beings encounter each other as citizens. It was only in the polis – in thepolitical sphere – “that men met one another as citizens and not as privatepersons . . . The equality of the Greek polis, its isonomy, was an attribute ofthe polis and not of men, who received their equality by virtue of citizenship,not by virtue of birth” (Arendt 1963: 23).Returning to the gloss on the claim that “debate is the very essence ofpolitics,” we can now see why Arendt does not think of politics as primarilyinvolving rulership, where one person, party, or class rules over another.Rather, politics involves collective action grounded in human plurality and theequality of citizens. In this public space, individuals debate and deliberatetogether; they seek to persuade each other about how to conduct their publicaffairs. Persuasion involves open debate among equals, in which they mutuallyseek to clarify, test, and purify their opinions. And persuasion itself isalways fallible. Debate can be contentious and agonistic; it does notnecessarily result in, or presuppose, consensus. But politics requires acommitment to persuasion – and when we fail to persuade, we must at least agreeon fair procedures for making decisions.We can deepen our understanding of what Arendt means by politics by seeing howshe integrates the concepts of public tangible freedom and the type of powerthat spontaneously emerges when citizens act together. Referring to thephilosophes of the Enlightenment, whose importance, she says, lies in theirshrewd insight into the public character of freedom, Arendt tells us:Their public freedom was not an inner realm into which men might escape at willfrom the pressures of the world, nor was it the liberum arbitrium which makesthe will choose between alternatives. Freedom for them could exist only inpublic; it was a tangible, worldly reality, something created by men to beenjoyed by men rather than a gift or capacity, it was the man-made public spaceor marketplace which antiquity had known as the area where freedom appears andbecomes visible to all. (Arendt 1963: 120–1)Public freedom must be sharply distinguished from liberty. Liberty is alwaysliberation from something, whether it is liberation from poverty, or fromoppressive rulers, tyrants, and dictators. Liberty is a necessary condition forfreedom, but not a sufﬁcient condition. Freedom is a positive politicalachievement of individuals acting together. And this tangible worldly freedomexists only as long as citizens deliberate, debate, and act together. Thedistinction between liberty and freedom is one of Arendt’s most important,enduring, and relevant political insights. Over and over again – especiallyafter the fall of communism in 1989 – we have to learn the painful lesson thatliberation from oppressive leaders is not sufﬁcient to bring about publicfreedom. One of the greatest disasters of the “political rhetoric” justifyingthe military invasion of Iraq is the (false) belief that liberation from thetyrannical oppression of Saddam Hussein would immediately initiate publicfreedom in Iraq and in the entire Middle East. This is a dangerous illusion.Public freedom requires far more than formal elections. It requires thecultivation of those practices such that individuals debate and deliberatetogether. It is only with the creation of such spaces that worldly freedomﬂourishes.Corresponding to this idea of tangible public freedom, Arendt develops herdistinctive concept of political power. She criticizes the traditional idea ofpower, where power is understood as the domination of an individual or a groupover other individuals or groups. Power, which she distinguishes from strength,force, authority, and violence, arises and grows spontaneously throughparticipation of citizens. Power is not to be understood in a vertical fashion,where power means control or domination over some individual or group. It is ahorizontal concept – power springs up when individuals act together.5[Notes.html#ch-04n5][P]ower comes into being only if and when men join themselves together for thepurpose of action, and it will disappear when for whatever reason, they disperseand desert one another. Hence binding and promising, combining and covenantingare the means by which power is kept in existence; where and when men succeed inkeeping intact the power which sprang up between them during the course of anyparticular act or deed, they are already in the process of foundation, ofconstituting a stable worldly structure to house, as it were, their combinedpower of action. (Arendt 1963: 174)So power, like public freedom, plurality, natality, action, speech, and debate,is woven into the fabric of Arendt’s understanding of politics.Before turning to the question of how Arendt integrates her understanding ofopinion and judgment into her conception of politics, I want to address anoften-repeated criticism of her concept of politics. Some critics argue thatArendt bases her understanding of politics upon an idealized conception of theGreek polis that does not correspond even to the realities of ancient Greeklife. Furthermore, whatever the merits of this conception of politics, it is notrelevant to the complexities and harsh realities of contemporary politics andmass democratic societies. I think it is false to suggest that Arendt wasinterested primarily in an imagined “golden era” of the Greek city-state. Thereis nothing nostalgic or sentimental about her thinking. As I have alreadyinsisted, Arendt’s lifelong concern with politics had its roots in her insightthat totalitarianism sought to destroy the very possibility of politics,freedom, and, consequently, our humanity. But, what is even more important,Arendt’s primary intention is to reclaim a human potentiality, one that isrooted in our natality and has been manifested at different times in radicallydifferent historical circumstances. This is not a fanciful utopian possibility.It has been actualized in different historical settings in the modern age. Shecalls this “the lost treasure of the revolutionary spirit.”The history of revolutions – from the summer of 1776 in Philadelphia and thesummer of 1789 in Paris to the autumn in Budapest – which politically spells theinnermost story of the modern age, and could be told in a parable as a tale ofan age-old treasure which, under the most varied circumstances, appearsabruptly, unexpectedly, and disappears again, under different mysteriousconditions, as though it were a fata morgana. (Arendt 1977a: 5)Arendt’s favorite example of politics – and her most extended analysis – is theAmerican Revolution. In speaking of the American Revolution, she is referring tothe events that began in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence andculminated with the writing and adoption of the Constitution. Indeed, it is thedeliberation, debates, compromises, and ultimate success in adopting theConstitution that epitomizes the tangible worldly freedom that she describes.This is a historically concrete example of the creation of public spaces inwhich power arises through collective action of individuals. The Constitutionlays the foundation for those institutions that house and preserve this freedom.[T]he course of the American revolution tells an unforgettable story and is aptto teach a unique lesson: for this revolution did not break out but was made bymen in common deliberation and on the strength of mutual pledges. The principlewhich came to light during those fateful years when foundations were laid – notby the strength of one architect but by the combined power of the many – was theinterconnected principle of mutual promise and common deliberation; and theevent itself decided indeed, as Hamilton had insisted, that men “are reallycapable . . . of establishing good government from reﬂection and choice,” thatthey are not “forever destined to depend for their political constitutions onaccident and force.” (Arendt 1963:215)Arendt’s characterization of politics captures what is vital for a ﬂourishingdemocratic politics. She warns about the danger of forgetfulness of thistreasure. So much of our chatter about democratic politics today is so heavilyencrusted with clichés that we too easily forget this vital core. Arendt wouldbe sharply critical of the post-9/11 absolutist discourse of good and evil. Anyappeal to absolutes in politics corrupts and destroys politics. When absolutes –whether absolute goodness or absolute evil – enter into politics, they can alltoo easily and ineluctably lead to violence. And for Arendt, it is violence thatdestroys politics. This is a lesson that is portrayed with the utmost vividnessby poets and novelists. In her discussion of Melville’s Billy Budd andDostoevsky’s Grand Inquisitor in On Revolution, she argues that “the absolutespells doom to everyone when it is introduced into the political realm” (1963:79). Arendt agrees with the pragmatists that tough moral and political choicesmay require choosing the lesser evil. It is the absolutizing of evil that isdangerous. This becomes even clearer in Arendt’s discussion of the role ofopinion and judgment in politics.Forming, testing, and clarifying opinions takes place in political debate. WhatArendt means by opinion has little to do what pollsters and politicians callopinions. Individuals do not simply “have” opinions, they form opinions. Theformation of opinions requires what Arendt calls “representative thinking.”I form an opinion by considering a given issue from different viewpoints, bymaking present to my mind the standpoints of those who are absent; that is, Irepresent them . . . The more people’s standpoints that I have present in mymind while I am pondering a given issue, and the better I can imagine how Iwould feel and think if I were in their place, the stronger will be my capacityfor representative thinking and the more valid my ﬁnal conclusions, my opinion.(Arendt 1977a: 241)Consequently, the formation of opinion is an achievement that requires politicalrepresentative thinking. The formation of opinions is not a private activityperformed by a solitary thinker. Opinions can be tested and enlarged only whenthere is a genuine encounter – even a clash – with differing opinions in thepublic spaces of debate among equals.Opinions . . . never belong to groups but exclusively to individuals, who “exerttheir reason coolly and freely,” and no multitude, be it the multitude of a partor of the whole of society, will ever be capable of forming an opinion. Opinionswill rise wherever men communicate freely with one another and have the right tomake their views public, but these views in their endless variety seem to standalso in need of puriﬁcation and representation. (Arendt 1963: 229)The formation and reﬁning of opinions through public testing and debate enableus to understand the type of judging that Arendt takes to be essential forpolitics. “Judging,” Arendt tells us, “is one, if not the most, importantactivity in which this sharing-the-world-with-others comes to pass.” Drawing herinspiration from her interpretation of Kant’s analysis of reﬂective judgment,she tells us that judging requires an “enlarged mentality” that enables one to“think in the place of everybody else.” “The judging person, as Kant says quitebeautifully, can only ‘woo the consent of everyone else’ in the hope of comingto an agreement with him eventually” (Arendt l977a: 222). This wooing, thispersuasion, is essential for politics. There is no guarantee that we willsucceed in this wooing, and there is no guarantee that we will come to agreementwith our fellow citizens. There may be irreconcilable conﬂicts in the clash ofopinions. But participants must be committed to the potential for agreement withothers. And if we fail to achieve agreement in our judgments, then we must atleast agree on fair procedures for making decisions – procedures that protectthe rights of minorities. The key elements of Arendt’s conception of politicaljudgment are summed up in the following passage:The power of judgment rests on a potential agreement with others, and thethinking process which is active in judging something is not, like the thoughtprocess of pure reasoning, a dialogue between me and myself, but ﬁnds itselfalways and primarily, even if I am quite alone in making my mind, in ananticipated communication with others with whom I know I must ﬁnally come tosome agreement. From this potential agreement judgment derives its speciﬁcvalidity. This means, on the one hand, that such judgment must liberate itselffrom the “subjective private conditions,” that is, from the idiosyncrasies whichnaturally determine the outlook of each individual in his privacy and arelegitimate as long as they are only privately held opinions, but which are notﬁt to enter the market place, and lack all validity in the public realm. Andthis enlarged way of thinking, which as judgment knows how to transcend its ownindividual limitations, on the other hand, cannot function in strict isolationor solitude; it needs the presence of others “in whose place” it must think,whose perspectives it must take into consideration, and without whom it neverhas the opportunity to operate at all. (Arendt 1977a: 220–1)We can start with any of the strands that are woven into Arendt’s politicalthinking – debate, action, speech, plurality, natality, public space, tangiblepublic freedom, power, opinion, and judgment – and we discover that they leadto, and reinforce, a compelling vision of what constitutes politics. There is noplace for absolutes in politics. The lesson that Arendt teaches us is the samelesson that the pragmatic thinkers sought to teach us in their response toAmerican Civil War – that the mentality that appeals to absolutes and rigidcertainties can lead to violence.Arendt had an acute sense of the powerful tendencies in modern society toundermine, distort, and suppress politics. But she never gave up her belief inthe power of the “revolutionary spirit.” In her own lifetime, she saw itmanifested in the Budapest uprising of 1956 and in the early Civil Rightsmovement in the United States. And if she had lived to witness the emergence ofthe political movements that led to the downfall of communism in Eastern andCentral Europe, she would have cited them as further evidence of the power ofthe revolutionary spirit – the power that springs forth when individuals acttogether. (Leaders of these movements, such as Adam Michnik in Poland, drewtheir inspiration from the political writings of Arendt.) Like Jefferson, Arendtemphasized the importance of “elementary republics,” or what she called“councils,” in keeping alive democratic politics.The councils say: We want to participate, we want to debate, we want to make ourvoices heard in public, and we want to have a possibility to determine thepolitical course of our country. Since the country is too big for all of us tocome together and determine our fate, we need a number of public spaces withinit. The booth in which we deposit our ballots is unquestionably too small, forthis booth has room for only one. The parties are completely unsuitable; therewe are, most of us, nothing but a manipulated electorate. But if only ten of usare sitting around a table, each expressing his opinion, each hearing theopinion of others, then a rational formation of opinion can take place throughthe exchange of opinions. (Arendt 1972: 233)There is a signiﬁcant overlap between Arendt’s conception of politics and thepragmatists’ – especially Dewey’s and Mead’s – conception of democracy. Dewey,like Arendt, sees that one of the most serious threats to democracy is the“eclipse of the public.” Dewey too thought that a healthy democracy, even incomplex industrial and technological societies, demands creation of publicspaces where individuals can debate together. In response to the criticism thathis faith in democracy was utopian, Dewey responded in words that reinforce whatwe learn from Arendt:I have been accused more than once and from opposed quarters of an undue, autopian, faith in intelligence and in education as a correlate of intelligence.At all events, I did not invent this faith. I acquired it from my surroundingsas far as those surroundings were animated by the democratic spirit. For what isthe faith in democracy, in the role of consultation, of conference, ofpersuasion, of discussion, in the formation of public opinion, which in the longrun is self-corrective, except faith in the capacity of the intelligence of thecommon man to respond with commonsense to the free play of facts and ideas whichare secured by effective guarantees of free inquiry, free assembly and freecommunication? (Dewey 1988: 227)6 [Notes.html#ch-04n6]What Dewey wrote in 1939 is even more urgent today. “We have to re-create bydeliberate and determined endeavor the kind of democracy which in its origin onehundred and ﬁfty years ago was largely a product of a fortunate combination ofmen and circumstances.” And he goes on to declare:If I emphasize that the task can be accomplished only by inventive effort andcreative activity, it is in part because the depth of the present crisis is duein considerable part to the fact that for a long period we acted as if democracywere something that perpetuated itself automatically . . . We acted as ifdemocracy were something that took place mainly at Washington or Albany – orsome other state capital – under the impetus of what happened when men and womenwent to the polls once a year or so. . . . We can escape from this external wayof thinking only as we realize in thought and act that democracy is a personalway of individual life; that it signiﬁes the possession and continual use ofcertain attitudes, forming personal character and determining desire and purposein all the relations of life. (Dewey 1988: 225–6)The reason why I think that these reﬂections on democratic politics are soimportant and relevant for us today is because they emphasize what is requiredto revitalize “really existing” large-scale democratic societies. Neither Arendtnor the pragmatists offer blueprints for what is to be done. And there are manyissues concerning the structure and functions of democratic law and institutionsthat they neglect. Both Arendt and the pragmatists are aware of the subtle andstrong forces in modern life that undermine and distort democratic politics. Butthey remind us of what is vital for the ﬂourishing of democratic politics, andthey emphasize that creating those public spaces in which tangible freedomﬂourishes is always “a task before us.” They teach us that introducingabsolutes, alleged moral certainties, and rigid simplistic dichotomies of goodand evil corrupt democratic politics.But still it may be asked how these reﬂections on democratic politics bear onour current situation. What lessons can we learn from them? Let me review someof the points that I have already made – and develop them further. The mostimportant point is to understand why the introduction of absolutes – andespecially demonizing one’s enemies as absolutely evil – distorts and corruptspolitics. To speak in this way, to speak about the “evil ones,” “the servants ofevil,” “the axis of evil” – as Bush frequently does – may be highly successfulin playing on people’s fears and anxieties, but it blocks serious deliberationand diplomacy. It is used to “justify” risky military interventions and to trumpserious consideration of alternatives in responding to real dangers. It rulesout the possibility of the type of democratic discussion wherein dissentingviews are respected and carefully evaluated. It stiﬂes serious inquiry aboutcomplex issues that need to be carefully analyzed, investigated, and debated.Ron Suskind reports a chilling conversation with Bruce Bartlett, a domesticpolicy advisor to Ronald Reagan and a treasury ofﬁcial under the ﬁrst PresidentBush. Speaking about George W. Bush, Bartlett said: “He truly believes he’s on amission from God. Absolute faith overwhelms a need for analysis. The whole thingabout faith is to believe things for which there is no empirical evidence”(Suskind 2004: 46). Unfortunately, many Christian conservatives do believe thatBush is executing God’s will. Suskind goes on to tell us that already in thesummer of 2001 “a cluster of particularly vivid qualities was shaping George W.Bush’s White House . . .: a disdain for contemplation or deliberation, anembrace of decisiveness, a retreat from empiricism, a sometimes bullyingimpatience with doubters and even friendly questioners. Already Bush was saying,Have faith in me and my decisions, and you’ll be rewarded. All through the WhiteHouse, people were channeling the boss. He didn’t second-guess himself; whyshould they?” (Suskind 2004: 49). Paul O’Neill, who was asked to resign asBush’s Secretary of the Treasury, told Suskind: “If you operate in a certain way– by saying this is how I want to justify what I’ve decided to do, and I don’tcare how you pull it off – you guarantee that you’ll get faulty, one-sidedinformation” (Suskind 2004: 51). The combination of Bush’s faith-basedself-assurance and his appeal to his “gut instincts” is not exactly exemplary ofthe virtues of democratic deliberation and debate. But Bush’s character andpersonality are not the primary issue; rather, it is the mentality he exhibitsthat is so scary.When Bob Woodward interviewed Bush for his book Bush at War, Bush told Woodward:“There is no doubt in my mind we’re doing the right thing. Not one doubt.” Andwhen Woodward asked him whether he had consulted his father on the war in Iraq,Bush replied, “He is the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength. Thereis a higher power I appeal to” (quoted in Schlesinger 2004: 35). One does nothave to doubt the sincerity of Bush’s faith or mock his religious beliefs, butsuch an appeal to the Almighty in making political decisions is antithetical tothe spirit of democratic politics, debate, and deliberation. Because the worldof political action always involves unforeseen consequences, reasoned doubt isalways appropriate when making momentous decisions. But this is a president whodoesn’t admit to having made any signiﬁcant mistakes.Reﬂection on the concrete meaning of democratic politics and public freedommight also forestall reliance on clichés and empty rhetoric. In his SecondInaugural Address and his State of the Union address, Bush reiterated the words“freedom,” “liberty,” and “democracy” over and over again – as if theyconstituted an incantation or mantra. Such ritual occasions are not idealopportunities for analytical ﬁnesse. But one can’t help but draw the conclusionthat all this talk about our mission to spread freedom and democracy throughoutthe world is intended to help us forget that the original justiﬁcation of theIraq war was the presumed “imminent threat” of Saddam’s weapons of massdestruction. The use of such “uplifting” rhetoric suffers from double-edgeddangers. It can easily be heard as hypocritical, empty rhetoric or a screen withwhich to justify new risky military interventions – as we bring freedom anddemocracy to the rest of the world.Earlier I mentioned Arendt’s important distinction between liberty and freedom,where liberty means “liberty from,” and freedom means the achievement of publictangible freedom in the public spaces that arise when individuals act anddeliberate together. The reason why I believe her distinction to be so relevanttoday is because much of the administration’s rhetoric about overthrowing SaddamHussein suggested that liberation from this ruthless dictator would immediatelylead to the ﬂourishing of freedom and democracy in Iraq. Many inﬂuentialneo-cons spoke as if American soldiers would be embraced as the great liberatorsof the Iraqi people. And they were convinced that they were right, because thisis what they wanted to hear (and were told) by their Iraqi friends. It hasbecome painfully clear that the Bush government had no detailed plans for whatto do after the military “victory,” and no expectation of the widespread deadlyinsurrection that has taken place. The president and his advisors believed thatonce the Iraqi people were liberated from Saddam Hussein, the transition todemocracy would be relatively straightforward and smooth. (And if they did notreally believe this, they certainly did not reveal their doubts to the Americanpublic.) The president and his cabinet ofﬁcers still refuse to admit that theymade any mistakes; that they made fallible judgments that turned out to bewrong.I also want to emphasize a point that I made earlier when describing thepragmatic mentality. I indicated that reasonable people can and do disagree.Pragmatic fallibilism does not dictate substantive conclusions and decisions;rather, it is primarily concerned with how these decisions are reached,discussed, and debated. Let me illustrate this with reference to some of thepublic debates that actually took place (outside the administration) before themilitary intervention in Iraq. Personally, I – like many other Americans –strongly opposed this military intervention. I did not subscribe to the idea ofa preemptive or, more accurately, preventive war. I saw this as a radical changein American foreign policy – a change that was unjustiﬁed. I did believe thatSaddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons – primarily because he hadalready used chemical weapons against the Kurds. But I did not think that heposed an “imminent threat” to the United States. I was dubious about the allegedevidence of his possession of nuclear weapons. I favored a strong policy ofcontainment and deterrence – isolating Saddam Hussein. Ironically – although noone knew it at the time – this policy had been working, because he had destroyedwhatever weapons of mass destruction he possessed. Even when this became clear,the president and vice-president went on reassuring us that WMD would bediscovered. I felt that the unilateral policy that the US was following wouldhave long-range damaging consequences in undermining multilateral cooperationwith our allies. I did not think that there was any substantial evidence linkingHussein to Al-Qaeda and the attack on the World Trade Center. Furthermore, givenHussein’s secularism and bin Ladin’s fanatical Islamic fundamentalism, I did notthink that it made any sense to link them together in the “War on Terror.” Butthe primary reason why I opposed the war was because I was convinced that the USgovernment was completely in the dark about what would happen in Iraq after theoverthrow of Saddam Hussein. There was no understanding of the chaos and theforces that would be unleashed in Iraq.But there were other persons whom I respected who argued for militaryintervention. They argued that Hussein was more than just a ruthless dictator;that he was prepared to commit genocide against his own population, and that hewas ruthless in stiﬂing any dissent and in eliminating anyone who opposed him.They argued that no nation should get away with ﬂouting so many United Nationsresolutions, and that the US had made an effort to work through the UnitedNations and to convince its allies to join in a military intervention. But therehad come a point when it needed to exercise its decisive leadership. As long asHussein was in power, there would never be any solution to the problems in theMiddle East. Hussein used Scud missiles against Israel in the First Gulf War,and there was no reason to believe that he might not do so again – and with moreeffectiveness. Some argued that the military intervention was not really a newinitiative, but would complete the unﬁnished First Gulf War. And although therewere many uncertainties about what would happen after the fall of Hussein, itcertainly could not be worse than living under his ruthless dictatorship.In a democracy, there ought to be ample opportunity for the full expression ofopinions pro and con when the nation is considering a momentous decisioninvolving war. Even after the arguments pro and con are aired, there must befair democratic procedures for making controversial decisions. But responsibledefenders of military intervention did not appeal to religious faith, did notappeal to absolutes, did not assert their moral certainty, did not seek tojustify the war as an American “crusade” against evil.7 [Notes.html#ch-04n7]Even though I remain convinced that the reasons against the war were farstronger than those offered in support of war, I certainly do not want to denythat many of those who advocated going to war in Iraq offered good reasons towarrant their position. A democracy thrives on the conﬂict of opinions.Pragmatic fallibilism encourages such conﬂict, but it is wary of any attempt todisplace the healthy conﬂict of opinions with appeals to absolutes, moralcertainty, and stark moralistic dichotomies of good and evil.In introducing my discussion of democratic politics, I began with Arendt’sdeclaration that “debate constitutes the very essence of political life.” I didso because drawing out the meaning and consequences of this claim enables usunderstand why appeals to absolutes about good and evil corrupt democraticpolitics. But, of course, there are other, competing conceptions of politics.One of the most controversial is Carl Schmitt’s characterization of “thepolitical.” Carl Schmitt was a German jurist and political theorist who died in1985 at the age of 96. His career spanned the First World War, the collapse ofthe Weimar Republic, the rise of Hitler, and the Second World War. Because hewas an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler, a vicious anti-Semite, and a relentlesscritic of liberalism, pluralism, and parliamentary democracy, he has beenseverely criticized and condemned. But there are a growing number of thinkers –conservatives and even left intellectuals – who claim that Schmitt is one of themost important political theorists of the twentieth century.Schmitt – especially in his pre-Nazi writings – articulated a view of politicsthat captures something important about “really existing politics.” The bestintroduction to Schmitt’s thought is The Concept of the Political. It ﬁrstappeared as a journal article in 1927 (the same year that Dewey published ThePublic and its Problems) and was expanded as a short book, which he revisedseveral times. Schmitt raises the same question that Arendt asks: What ispolitics? Or, more accurately, What is the political? In seeking to clarify “thepolitical” (das Politische) he focuses on the criterion for demarcating what isdistinctive about politics. He emphatically tells us: “The speciﬁc politicaldistinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is thatbetween friend and enemy” (Schmitt 1995: 26). And by an “enemy” he means apublic adversary. Unless there is a clearly deﬁned enemy, unless there is groupthat we identify as strange and alien, then, strictly speaking, there is nopolitics. Politics does not shun or seek to avoid conﬂict. It thrives onconﬂict. Unlike Arendt, Schmitt does not think that the violence of war is athreat to politics. “War is neither the aim nor the purpose nor even the verycontent of politics. But as an ever present possibility it is the leadingpresupposition which determines in a characteristic way human action andthinking and thereby creates a speciﬁcally political behavior” (Schmitt 1995:34). Those who think that there can be politics without conﬂict, struggle, andeven war are naïve. Worse than that, they fail to realize that they are seekingto destroy and eliminate politics. According to Schmitt, liberalism seeks tobring about the end of politics.8 [Notes.html#ch-04n8] Liberalism advances the“ﬁction” that the state is neutral, that its primary function is to protectindividual rights and to develop political institutions (e.g., parliaments andcongresses) that enable and promote compromises and the peaceful resolution ofconﬂicts under the rule of a neutral law. He even claims that there is“absolutely no liberal politics, only a liberal critique of politics.” AlthoughSchmitt distinguishes the different domains of morality, religion, aesthetics,and politics, everything is potentially political, because in exceptionalcircumstances any domain can become political if it is employed to distinguishfriend from enemy. We ﬁnd here one of the many disturbing tensions in Schmitt’sthinking. He sharply distinguishes morality, based on the distinction betweengood and evil, from politics, based on the sharp distinction between friend andenemy. Even though morality can be used to deﬁne the political enemy, Schmittthoroughly condemns a universalistic moral humanism. When the enemy is subsumedunder the universal moral categories of good and evil, the enemy is turned intoan inhuman monster that must be totally annihilated. Such a universalisticmoralism is hypocritically used to “justify” total war, which demands thecomplete annihilation of the foe. Schmitt draws a distinction between the enemyas one’s political adversary and the foe – those whom we condemn as morally eviland seek to annihilate. An enemy need not be considered to be morally evil.Consequently, wars against enemies are limited. They are won when the enemy isdefeated. Wars against foes are total wars; they are won only when the foe iscompletely annihilated. Schmitt’s rhetoric about “the political” is saturatedwith strong moral and religious evaluations. (For his damning critique of the“concept of humanity” in politics, see Schmitt 1995: 54.)Schmitt draws an extremely important conclusion from this understanding of thepolitical. Every political group requires a sovereign, who has the task ofmaking decisions in exceptional or extreme circumstances. And it is thesovereign who decides whether a situation is exceptional. From Schmitt’sperspective, debate is certainly not the essence of politics. Debate,deliberation, and persuasion obscure what is essential for politics – ﬁrmsovereign decisions for dealing with political enemies. Sovereigns may pretendthat they are making fundamental decisions in the name of some “higherprinciple” or that they are following proper legal and political procedures, butthis should not disguise the fact that such decisions are ungrounded; they aresolely the sovereign’s decisions. There is no higher appeal than the sovereign’sdecision.With liberalism there is a greater fear of making and carrying out these ﬁrmsovereign decisions than there is of one’s enemies. Liberals fail to acknowledgethat political enmity can never be eliminated completely. Enmity is a basicexistential feature of human beings, and if we ignore or obscure it, then wewill be thoroughly naïve about the essential character of real politics.9[Notes.html#ch-04n9] There is no way of avoiding sovereign decisions, and no wayof eliminating the existential enmity that is the basis for the politicaldistinction between friend and enemy.One of the lively debates about Schmitt’s conception of the political concernshow, precisely, we are to understand the main thrust of what he is claiming. Ishe concerned primarily with developing a realistic conception of how politicsactually works? Or is he concerned to tell us what “real” politics ought to be?He seems to want to do both. He argues that the opposition between friend andenemy has always characterized real politics, although – in the past – therehave been very “civilized” forms of politics and war. He also claims that thenew type of total war that emerged in the twentieth century is a consequence ofa false universal humanism. He strongly objects to all those tendencies (e.g.liberalism and technology) in modernity that “depoliticize” politics.Consequently, if we are ruthlessly honest, we ought to avoid liberal hypocrisy,we ought to recognize that the friend/enemy dichotomy deﬁnes “the political,”and we ought to recognize that sovereigns deﬁne those exceptional circumstancesthat call for ﬁrm decisions. We should not be sentimental about the need forexceptional sovereign decisions. It is the exceptions to so-called normaleveryday politics that bring out the true character of politics.One of the reasons why Schmitt has been receiving so much attention lately isbecause he appears to have put his ﬁnger on a key feature of modern politics.One can tell a story of politics since the First World War that “ﬁts” Schmitt’sfriend/enemy dichotomy. It is grist for Schmitt’s mill that the attempts tocreate institutions to contain and regulate political enmity and prevent wars(the League of Nations and the United Nations) have failed to do so. With theend of the Cold War, politics in the Schmittian sense seemed to ﬂounder. Butwith 9/11, the new “War on Terror” created a strong new sense of politicalidentity and purpose – at least for the United States. Now there is presumably aclear sense of political friend and enemy. The president of the United Statesfrequently speaks of those who are with us and those who are against us in the“War on Terror.” Our political identity is sharpened against this new enemy – weare the “lovers and defenders of freedom and democracy.” And we can even see therole of the sovereign decision in exceptional circumstances. After all, it wasPresident Bush who made the sovereign decision to go to war in Iraq. (It shouldbe noted, however, that a “War on Terror” in the name of universal human freedomﬁts Schmitt’s description of disastrous total war.) Most of the reasons advancedfor going to war in Iraq have now been discredited. But from a Schmittianperspective, this is not really relevant, because sovereign decisions are neverreally justiﬁed by reasons. And the religious and moral talk of good and evil isbest understood as a political means for distinguishing ourselves from ourenemies.There is an extremely dark underside to this Schmittian conception of politics.There are, of course, real enemies that nations must ﬁght. There is nothingﬁctitious about the existence of the Al-Qaeda. But what is really important forSchmitt is the construction of an enemy in order to deﬁne one’s politicalidentity. That is precisely what the United States has done; it has constructedan all-inclusive, threatening enemy – “the servants of Evil.” And inconstructing this enemy, it has played on and manipulated people’s fears andanxieties. Manipulating fear is one of the most powerful political weapons fordeﬁning the enemy. On the one hand, Schmitt emphasizes the importance forpolitics of identifying an enemy; on the other hand, he condemns the“hypocritical” moralism of those seeking complete annihilation of the enemy.Some commentators have thought of Schmitt as a contemporary Thomas Hobbes.Although Schmitt admires Hobbes, he is actually a severe critic of Hobbes,because he claims that Hobbes laid the foundations for modern liberalism.Hobbes, like Schmitt, does think that enmity, or belligerence, is the naturalcondition of human beings. But Hobbes’s Leviathan is intended to show how thisbelligerence can be controlled and contained by creating a “mortal god” – asovereign to guarantee security. But, according to Schmitt, we cannot and shouldnot pacify political enmity. Hobbes, then, is no better than those liberals whoclaim that the aim of politics is to seek peace and security. Schmitt’spolitical-theological imperative is “Fight Thy Enemy.”There is a deep irony in applying Schmittian principles to the current politicalsituation in the United States. We presumably fought the war in Iraq in the nameof the liberal democratic principles that Schmitt scorns and ﬁnds contemptible.We keep hearing about the importance of freedom and the need to help Iraq andthe Middle East to become genuine democracies. From Schmitt’s perspective thisis hypocritical. For Schmitt, the United States represents the worst form ofliberalism – a liberalism that pretends to be democratic, universalistic, andhumanitarian, but is actually responsible for bringing about total war. WilliamE. Scheuerman notes that Schmitt’s anti-Americanism is so extreme that he claimsthat the United States – “as that world power which systematically synthesizesawesome military power with liberal universalism . . . now menaces humanity to agreater degree than recent totalitarian dictatorships” (Scheuerman 2004: 545).10[Notes.html#ch-04n10]But I do think that there is an important lesson to be learned from Schmitt –although it is not the lesson he intended. There is a real clash between thedemocratic politics that I have described and the Schmittian conception ofpolitics. Schmitt claims that liberalism, when unmasked, is reallyanti-democratic. But Schmitt is no friend of democracy. If we take Schmittseriously, then debate, deliberation, persuasion, public spaces, and publictangible freedom are not only irrelevant to politics; they obscure the realcharacter of politics. The more we act on Schmittian principles, the more weundermine democratic politics.The basic issue today is not whether we have real enemies or whether it isnecessary to ﬁght these enemies, but rather how we think and act in extremesituations. I have already cited Sidney Hook’s remark: “Realization of the evilmen can do and have done to men is integral to any intelligent appraisal ofhuman history.” But we can face these concrete speciﬁc evils, and even make hardchoices and decisions, without accepting the Schmittian claim that enmity is thebasic existential condition of human beings. And we must be wary of sliding intoa mode of thinking and acting that is all too ready to sacriﬁce democraticpractices and principles for a specious “tough-minded” political realism. Ourtask today is to reinvigorate democracy – not to abandon it in the name ofSchmittian politics."},{"pageContent":"5--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evil and the Corruption of ReligionThe popular post-9/11 discourse about good and evil corrupts religion. There isno doubt that the religious right in the United States has been exerting agrowing inﬂuence on American politics. But we must not identify religion withthe religious right – or with what has been called the “New Christian Right.” Wemust not allow any denomination, group, or coalition of religious groups to“steal” the mantle of religion and to determine what is evil. In myintroduction, I indicated that at the heart of the world religions – includingJudaism, Christianity, and Islam – the concern with good and evil has beencentral. Every religion seeks to characterize what is good and evil – and how weare to combat the evil that lies within us and within the world. From theperspective of monotheistic religions, it is God who is the source and ground ofour morality – the basis for distinguishing good and evil. Many modern thinkershave maintained that we do not have to appeal to religion to ground ourmorality. Kant was a Christian believer who has had a great inﬂuence onProtestant theology and religious thought. Nevertheless, he categoricallyasserts “for its own sake morality does not need religion at all . . . by virtueof pure practical reason it is self-sufﬁcient” (Kant 1960: 3). But this is notwhat many ordinary religious persons believe; on the contrary, they believe thatreligious faith grounds morality and the knowledge of good and evil.When we examine the world religions, we discover that in every great religioustradition there has been an ongoing discussion and debate about the very meaningof good and evil. Living religious traditions are not monolithic. There reallyis no such thing as the religious understanding of good and evil. There is nosuch thing as the Christian, the Jewish, or the Islamic conception of good andevil. And this is just as true for the entire range of living religioustraditions. Plurality and diversity are not threats to religious traditions;they are what keep religious traditions alive. Religious concepts of good andevil are essentially contested concepts. To say that good and evil areessentially contested is not to say, “Anything goes.” On the contrary, it meansthat one is under an obligation to explain and justify one’s distinctivereligious understanding of good and evil. There is a great religious traditionof faith seeking understanding. And this seeking involves questioning, thinking,and struggling to clarify and deepen one’s faith. Alasdair Macintyre gives usone of the best succinct deﬁnitions of a tradition – including a religioustradition. He tells us that “a tradition not only embodies the narrative of anargument, but is recovered by the argumentative retelling of that narrativewhich will itself be in conﬂict with other argumentative retellings” (Macintyre1977: 461). This applies to the retelling of competing conceptions of good andevil. Consequently, we betray what is best in a living religious tradition whenwe identify religion with uncritical dogmatism or fanaticism. When someoneclaims that he knows what evil is because he is a religious believer, and thatno further explanation or justiﬁcation is needed, he is guilty of the sin ofpride.What I ﬁnd so objectionable about the post-9/11 talk of good and evil is thisarrogance. To speak about evil as if its meaning were perfectly clear, as if itneeded no further commentary or discussion, is dangerous. “Evil” tends to beused in an excessively vague and permissive manner in order to condemn whateverone ﬁnds abhorrent. One doesn’t have to think, because presumably the meaning ofevil is self-evident. Furthermore, “evil” is used in a highly selective andself-serving manner. Among religious and nonreligious ethicists, torture is hasbeen considered to be intrinsically evil. There have been an increasing numberof reliable reports about the widespread use of torture and deliberatehumiliation not only at Abu Ghraib, but throughout Iraq.1 [Notes.html#ch-05n1]And the Red Cross has reported that practices “tantamount to torture” have takenplace at prison in Guantánamo Bay. But somehow these don’t count as evil. I donot know of a single statement by a member of the current United Statesadministration who has condemned these practices as evil.Andrew Sullivan, an outstanding journalist, who has been a strong and articulatedefender of the US military intervention in Iraq, has eloquently expressed hisoutrage about the atrocities committed by Americans “in plain sight.”But in a democracy, the responsibility [for the torture and humiliation ofprisoners] is also wider. Did those of us who fought so passionately for aruthless war against terrorists give an unwitting green light to these abuses?Were we naïve in believing that characterizing complex conﬂicts from Afghanistanto Iraq as a single simple war against “evil” might not ﬁlter down and lead todecisions that could dehumanize the enemy and lead to abuse? Did our convictionof our own rightness in this struggle make it hard for us to acknowledge whenthat good cause had become endangered? I fear the answer to each of thesequestions is yes . . . . Advocates of the war, especially those allied with theadministration, kept relatively quiet, or attempted to belittle what had goneon, or made facile arguments that such things always occur in wartime. But itseems to me that those of us who are most committed to the Iraq interventionshould be the most vociferous in highlighting these excrescences. Getting rid ofthis cancer within the system is essential to winning this war. (Sullivan 2005:11)It is a shame that the administration does not share Sullivan’s sense ofoutrage. Despite loose talk about “taking responsibility” for what happened atAbu Ghraib, these seem to be empty, meaningless words, because no importantcivilian or military ofﬁcer has been ﬁred or removed from ofﬁce. On thecontrary, those who helped to clear the way for such abuses have been rewarded.“The man who paved the way for the torture of prisoners is to be entrusted withsafeguarding the civil rights of Americans. It is astonishing that he has beennominated, and even more astonishing that he will almost certainly be conﬁrmed”(Sullivan 2005: 11).2 [Notes.html#ch-05n2]Why has this happened? Why have Bush and his cohorts been so reluctant to faceup to this blatant evil? Of course, there are political reasons for downplayingits signiﬁcance, for seeing it as the actions of a few “bad apples.” Theinternational publicity given to the abuses at Abu Ghraib is a source ofembarrassment to the US administration. But another important factor is thatacknowledging that Americans commit atrocities doesn’t ﬁt with the “moral”universe constructed by this administration. After all, we are the good guys whoare dedicated to spreading democracy and freedom, and we are ﬁghting the badguys – the evil ones. In a world where there is a stark black-and-whiteopposition between good and evil, good guys do not commit evil atrocities. Andfor those who appeal to the New Testament for moral guidance, they mightremember Paul’s admonition: “Do not repay anyone evil for evil. . . . Be notovercome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”In order to explain why I think that the careless way in which “evil” is beingused today has a corrupting effect on religion, I want to explore a number ofrelated issues. To begin, I want to consider the distinction between the“religious” and the “secular.” The uses of “religious” and “secular” have becomeso familiar that we rarely stop to think about the meaning of these terms.Etymologically, “secular” is a word that is derived from the medieval Latinsaeculum, which means primarily “world.” As José Casanova tells us, in medievalCanon Law, “secularization refers to the legal (canonical process) whereby a‘religious’ person left the cloister to return to the ‘world’ and itstemptations, becoming a ‘secular’ person. Canonically, priests could be both‘religious’ and ‘secular.’ Those priests who decided to withdraw from the world(saeculum) to dedicate themselves to a life of perfection formed the religiousclergy. Those persons who lived in the world formed the secular clergy”(Casanova 1994: 13). What is noteworthy about this early meaning of “secular” isthat, although there is a distinction between religious persons living withinthe walls of a cloister and those living outside in the world (saeculum),nevertheless, a religious person could be both religious and secular. AChristian priest living in the world (saeculum) was (and is) a secular priest.As Casanova points out, “the structured division of ‘this world’ into twoseparate spheres, ‘religious’ and ‘secular,’ has to be distinguished and keptseparate from another division: that between ‘this world’ and ‘the other world’” (Casanova 1994: 14). In pre-modern Western Christendom, however, there are nottwo worlds, but three. There is the other world (heaven) and this world (earth).But this world is itself divided into the religious world (the Church) and thesecular world proper (the saeculum). The Church is situated in the middle ofthis double, dualist system of classiﬁcation as the mediator between this world(earth) and the other world (heaven), as well as between the religious and thesecular spheres in this world. This “spatialized” picture is an idealization,because there were always tensions and disputes about the precise boundariesbetween the religious and the secular.It is against this background that we can understand what secularization as ahistorical process means.Secularization as a concept refers to the actual historical process whereby thisdualist system within “this world” and the sacramental structures of mediationbetween this world and the other world progressively break down until the entiremedieval system of classiﬁcation disappears, to be replaced by new systems ofspatial structuration of the spheres. Max Weber’s expressive image of thebreaking of the monastery walls remains perhaps the best graphic description ofthis radical spatial restructuration. The wall separating the religious and thesecular realms within “this world” breaks down. The separation between “thisworld” and “the other world,” for the time being at least remains. But from nowon, there will be only one single “this world,” the secular one, within whichreligion will have to ﬁnd its own place. If before, it was the religious realmwhich appeared to be the all-encompassing reality within which the secular realmfound its proper place, now the secular sphere will be the all-encompassingreality, to which the religious sphere will have to adapt. (Casanova 1994: 15)This characterization of secularization enables us to understand what socialtheorists and sociologists of religion call “the theory of secularization.”Actually, this is not a single theory but a collection of diverse theories, andthere are a number of aspects that need to be carefully distinguished. The coreof these theories concerns the functional differentiation of different secularspheres that emerge from processes of modernization, such as differentiation ofstate, economy, and science. The basic idea is that in the course of moderndevelopments each of these spheres becomes differentiated and relativelyautonomous, subject to its own procedures, norms, and regularities. A secondaspect of theories of secularization is the decline of religion thesis. This isthe claim that as the historical process of secularization develops, there is adecline of religion. Some proponents of these theories claim that religion willeventually disappear as the world becomes thoroughly secularized. A third aspectis that the public role of religion declines – religion is privatized. Itbecomes a matter of personal faith, and is removed from the public sphere.Until recently theories of secularization (in all three aspects) were acceptedvirtually without question. But in the past few decades secularization theorieshave been severely criticized – especially the decline of religion thesis andthe privatization thesis. Some sociologists of religion now advocate thecomplete abandonment of the theory of secularization. Religion is certainly notdisappearing from the modern world. Indeed, the empirical evidence indicates atremendous growth of a variety of different religions in many (although, notall) regions of the world. Furthermore, rather than increasing privatization, weﬁnd an almost aggressive move toward a public role for religion in social andpolitical movements. This is what Casanova calls “deprivatization.”There is another ambiguity that has plagued theories of secularization.Presumably such theories have been advanced as descriptive and explanatory. Andas social-scientiﬁc theories, they are subject to conﬁrmation or refutation byempirical evidence. But in many formulations there is a clear normative bias.Implicitly or explicitly, it is afﬁrmed that the decline and privatization ofreligion is a desirable goal. Many liberal political theorists draw on theoriesof secularization to advocate that religion ought to be privatized and ought notto play a role in the public political sphere.Thus far I have been discussing the way in which scholars and social theoristsdiscuss “secular” and “secularization.” But there is a popular use of “secular”that is parasitic upon the theory of secularization. From the perspective ofmany religious believers, secularization is not a neutral social process. To theextent that secularization becomes the all-encompassing reality, it threatensthe very existence of a religious way of life. That is why it has to be stronglyopposed. From a Christian fundamentalist perspective, secularization is not theresult of impersonal social forces; it is the conspiratorial aim of individualsand groups. Who are these nefarious agents? They are primarily the “secularhumanists” – the godless, evil ones – who advocate sexual permissiveness,homosexuality, abortion, feminism, relativism, and atheism. They areunpatriotic, and they weaken the moral ﬁber of the country. As Steve Bruce tellsus:The problem for both potential supporters and promoters of the new Christianright was to construct a cause of the many things which concerned them abouttheir environment. The solution was ‘secular humanism’, whichDenies the deity of God, the inspiration of the Bible and the divinity of JesusChrist.Denies the existence of the soul, life after death, salvation and heaven,damnation and hell.Denies the Biblical account of Creation.Believes that there are no absolutes, no right, no wrong – that moral values areself-determined and situational.Do your own thing, ‘as long as it does not harm anyone else’.Believes in the removal of distinctive roles of male and female.Believes in sexual freedom between consenting individuals, regardless of age,including premarital sex, homosexuality, lesbianism and incest.Believes in the right to abortion, euthanasia (mercy killing), and suicide.Believes in equal distribution of America’s wealth to reduce poverty and bringabout equality.Believes in control of the environment, control of energy and its limitation.Believes in the removal of American patriotism and the free enterprise system,disarmament, and the creation of a one-world socialistic government.(Pro-Family Forum n.d.) (Bruce 1988: 77)Anyone who holds any of the beliefs listed here is labeled a “secular humanist.”These evil secular humanists are actively undermining conservative Christianity.It is difﬁcult to see any coherence in this disparate list of “offenses” toChristian fundamentalism. Whatever purpose this list may serve in theideological construction of the evil enemy, it doesn’t really single out anywell-deﬁned group. There are many religious and nonreligious persons who holdsome of these beliefs and make some of these denials. There is also the absurdconsequence that any religious person who “doesn’t believe in the divinity ofJesus Christ” is classiﬁed a “secular humanist.”Christian fundamentalists are extreme examples of the mentality that I have beencriticizing. To deny absolutes, to question moral certainties, to depart fromwhat they understand to be Christian “truths,” is to be a “secular humanist.”And for these fundamentalists, pragmatic fallibilism is just another version of“secular humanism.” But even less extreme religious believers tend to think thatpragmatic fallibilism is a form of atheistic secularism. I want to challengethis claim. I have already indicated that it is a serious (although all toocommon) mistake to think that pragmatic fallibilism is anti-religious andatheistic. Indeed, my more general thesis is that the mentalities that I havedescribed can take (and have taken) both religious and nonreligious forms. Thereare religious and secular persons who claim absolute moral certainty and dividethe world in rigid dichotomies. And there are religious and nonreligious personscommitted to genuine fallibilism. This is why I have spoken about a clash ofmentalities that cuts across the religious/secular divide.The classical pragmatists actually defended religious faith. Their Christianbackground shaped many of their leading ideas. They argued that religious faithis not only compatible with pragmatic fallibilism but is actually strengthenedby it. When William James introduced his popular conception of pragmatism in1898, he declared: “There is no difference which doesn’t make a difference, nodifference in abstract truth which does not express itself in a difference ofconcrete fact, and of conduct consequent upon the fact, imposed on somebody,somehow, somewhere, and somewhen” (1977: 349). The very ﬁrst example he gives toillustrate the pragmatic approach is the debate about God and materialism. Heasks the question: “Is matter the producer of all things, or is a God theretoo?” Listen to what he says:Many of us, most of us, I think, now feel as if a terrible coldness and deadnesswould come over the world were we forced to believe that no informing spirit orpurpose has to do with it, but it merely accidentally had come. The actuallyexperienced details of fact might be the same on either hypothesis, some joyous;some rational, some odd and grotesque; but without God behind them, we thinkthey would have something ghastly, they would tell no genuine story, there wouldbe no speculation in those eyes that they do glare with. With God, on the otherhand, they would grow solid, warm, and altogether full of real signiﬁcance.(James 1977: 350)Religious questions were always in the foreground of James’s thinking. James,who suffered from bouts of melancholia throughout his life, tells us: “I havealways thought that this experience of melancholia of mine had a religiousbearing. I mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had notclung to scripture texts like ‘The eternal God is my refuge,’ etc., ‘Come untome, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,’ etc., ‘I am the resurrection and thelife,’ etc., I think I should have grown really insane” (James 1977: 7). Jamesboldly defends “the right to believe.” He declares: “Faith thus remains as oneof the inalienable birthrights of our mind. Of course, it must remain apractical, not a dogmatic attitude. It must go with the toleration of otherfaiths, with the search for the most probable, and with the full consciousnessof responsibilities and risks” (James 1977: 737). This is certainly a differenttype of faith than that professed by fundamentalists. It shuns dogmatism andabsolute certainty. It is a faith infused with the pragmatic spirit.Even Peirce, who is considered to be the most “tough-minded” and scientiﬁc ofthe pragmatists, proposed “a neglected argument for the reality of God.” In astriking phrase, he declares: “As to God, open your eyes and your heart, whichis a perceptive organ and you see him.” Peirce integrated this religious outlookwith his cosmological speculations. He elaborated a doctrine of “evolutionarylove,” which he based on a reading of the Gospels.Here then, is the issue. The Gospel of Christ says that progress comes fromevery individual merging his individuality in sympathy with his neighbors. Onthe other side, the conviction of the nineteenth century is that progress takesplace by virtue of every individual’s striving for himself with all his mightand trampling his neighbor under foot whenever he gets a chance to do so. Thismay accurately be called the Gospel of Greed. Much is to be said on both sides.I have not concealed, I could not conceal, my own passionate predilection. Sucha confession will probably shock my scientiﬁc brethren. (Peirce 1931–5: vi. 493)John Dewey, who professed his faith in democracy, is frequently taken to be thepragmatist who was most indifferent to religious concerns. But Bruce Kuklick(1985) has shown that his Christian background shaped Dewey’s most fundamentalideas. Stephen Rockefeller (1991), in his comprehensive study of Dewey’sthought, argues for the necessity of “approaching Dewey’s thought from theperspective of its religious meaning and value” (p. x). In A Common Faith, Deweycriticizes both “militant atheism” and “supernaturalism.” Consider Dewey’sjustiﬁcation for speaking of God and defending the religious dimension ofexperience.One reason why personally I think it ﬁtting to use the word “God” to denote theuniting of the ideal and the actual which has been spoken of, lies in the factthat aggressive atheism seems to me to have something in common with traditionalsupernaturalism . . . What I have in mind especially is the exclusivepreoccupation of both militant atheism and supernaturalism with man inisolation. For in spite of supernaturalism’s reference to something beyondnature, it conceives of this earth as the moral centre of the universe and manas the apex of the whole scheme of things. It regards the drama of sin andredemption enacted within the isolated and lonely soul of man as the one thingof ultimate importance. Apart from man, nature is held to be accursed ornegligible. Militant atheism is also affected by lack of natural piety . . . Theattitude taken is often that of man living in an indifferent and hostile worldand issuing blasts of deﬁance. A religious attitude, however, needs the sense ofconnection of man, in the way of dependence and support, with the envelopingworld that imagination feels is a universe. Use of the words “God” or “divine”to convey the union of the actual with the ideal may protect man from a sense ofisolation and from consequent despair or deﬁance. (Dewey 1986: 36)These brief references to the classical pragmatists’ reﬂections on religiousfaith and experience are intended to explode the caricature of pragmatism as ahostile, atheistic, secular humanism.3 [Notes.html#ch-05n3] On the contrary,these thinkers sought to articulate what they took to be vital in religiousfaith and experience. Pragmatic fallibilism does not pose a threat to religion,although it rejects all forms of uncritical dogmatism. My primary objective,however, is not to defend any speciﬁc pragmatic conception of religious faithand experience. (There are striking differences and conﬂicts among the classicalpragmatist thinkers.) What I want to emphasize is that religious faith isdeepened when a fallibilistic spirit informs it.We must never underestimate the evil deeds that human beings are capable ofcommitting. And we cannot fully anticipate the new forms of evil deeds that willarise. But our task is to specify concretely what we mean when we designatesomething as evil, and to clarify intelligent responses to these evils. Weshould welcome and encourage serious debate about these vitally importantissues. We must avoid demonizing persons or thinking of evil as an impersonalforce operating in the world.Religious fundamentalists are hostile and scornful of pragmatically informedunderstandings of religion. But a questioning, fallible attitude has a muchgreater claim to being authentic to religious traditions than any form offundamentalism. Sometimes we forget how recently fundamentalism has emerged as areligious movement. There is a tendency to merge together a number of verydifferent religious movements, but they ought to be carefully distinguished. Themedia today will speak of the New Christian Right, evangelicals, andfundamentalists – as if they form a single monolithic group.“Evangelicalism” describes a network of Protestant religious movements thatarose in the eighteenth century. In a recent volume dedicated to the study ofevangelicalism, the authors single out the following pattern of convictions toidentify evangelicalism.Biblicalism (a reliance on the Bible as ultimate religious authority),conversionism (a stress on the New Birth), activism (an energetic,individualistic approach to religious duties and social involvement, andcrucicentrism (a focus on Christ’s redeeming work as the heart of essentialChristianity). (Noll et al. 1994:6)This schematic deﬁnition presents the key convictions of many evangelicals –although there are extremely varied interpretations of them. Not allevangelicals are committed to a literal reading of the Bible or to the inerrancyof the Bible. Furthermore, not all evangelicals are committed to a conservativepolitical agenda. There have been evangelicals who have avoided any form ofpolitical involvement, and there have been evangelicals who have inspired andplayed important roles in some of the most progressive movements in the historyof the United States. In the nineteenth century, evangelicals were leaders inanti-slavery movements, just as there were those, especially in the South, whodefended slavery on Christian principles. In the early twentieth century therewas a Social Gospel movement that joined forces with secular progressives inﬁghting for social and economic injustice. And evangelicals, especially Blackevangelical churches, played a vital role in the Civil Rights movement of the1960s. We do a great injustice to the diversity of the evangelical movement ifwe identify it with the Christian right. This is not to deny that there are manyevangelicals today who vigorously support the conservative Christian right.Fundamentalism in the USA is a reactive religious movement that has its originsin the last decades of the nineteenth century and the ﬁrst decades of thetwentieth century.4 [Notes.html#ch-05n4] It started as a reaction against thoseliberal Protestants who sought to adapt Christian beliefs to the modern worldand to modern science. Fundamentalism opposed the threat of Darwinism to thebiblical story of creation. It rejected the higher biblical criticism thatclaimed that several different editors authored the Bible. More generally,fundamentalism was a reaction against the modern secular tide that seemed tothreaten Christian faith and a Christian way of life.The word “fundamentalism” has had an interesting semantic career. Today it hasacquired a primarily negative connotation, but it did not begin as a term ofabuse. It did not have its origins in the Old South, but rather in southernCalifornia. We can actually date the origin of the expression “fundamentalism”in the American context.In 1910 Milton and Lyman Stewart, two devout Christian brothers who had madetheir fortune in the California oil business, embarked on a ﬁve-year programmeof sponsorship for a series of pamphlets which were sent free of charge to‘English-speaking Protestant pastors, evangelists, missionaries, theologicalprofessors, theological students, YMCA secretaries, and editors of religiouspublications throughout the world’. Entitled The Fundamentals: A Testimony ofTruth, the tracts, written by a number of leading conservative American andBritish theologians were aimed at stopping the erosion of what the brothers andtheir editors considered to be the ‘fundamental’ beliefs of Protestantism: theinerrancy of the Bible, the direct creation of the world, and humanity, exnihilo by God (in contrast to Darwinian evolution): the authenticity ofmiracles, the virgin birth of Jesus, his Cruciﬁxion and bodily resurrection; thesubstitutionary atonement (the doctrine that Christ died to redeem the sins ofhumanity); and (for some but not all believers) his imminent return to judge andrule over the world. (Ruthven 2004: 10–11)The Stewart brothers were premillennial dispensationalists. They believed thatthe biblical prophecies about the “End Times,” especially those in theRevelation of St John, were literally true, and that the Apocalypse wasimminent. On the Day of Judgment, the saved would be divided from the damned,the godly from the ungodly, before the promised thousand-year reign ofrighteousness. (Other evangelical Christians believe that the Day of Judgmentwill follow the millennium, and hence are called postmillennialists.5[Notes.html#ch-05n5]) If the Apocalypse is imminent, then the duty of goodChristians is to save as many sinners as possible, who will then be “raptured”into the presence of Christ on the Day of Judgment.Three million copies of The Fundamentals were circulated, and in 1920 Curtis LeeLaws, a conservative Baptist editor, added the “ist” ending, and declared that“Fundamentalists were those ready to do battle for The Fundamentals” (Ruthven2004: 12). Initially, fundamentalists expended more energy attacking liberalProtestants than in damning other sinners. Fundamentalists felt that themainline urban Protestant churches disinherited them. Fundamentalism soon tookroot in rural communities, especially in the South and the Southwest. After thefamous Scopes trial (1925) in Tennessee, which received extensive nationalattention, fundamentalists suffered a severe defeat in public opinion. ClarenceDarrow, the brilliant, witty ACLU lawyer, humiliated the populist (and threetimes presidential candidate) William Jennings Bryan by exposing contradictionsand absurdities in fundamentalist readings of the Bible. Even though the juryfound Scopes guilty of breaking the state law that forbade any teaching thatcontradicted the biblical view of creation, the attempt to put evolution andmodern science on trial backﬁred. “In the trial by public opinion and the press,it was clear that the twentieth century, the cities, and the universities hadwon a resounding victory, and that the country, the South, and thefundamentalists were guilty as charged” (Marsden 1980: 186). H. L. Mencken, themost famous journalist of the time, ridiculed and scorned the fundamentalists.Fundamentalists “retreated” to their own enclaves. They started their ownpublishing houses, radio stations, Bible schools, and seminaries. And theirpreaching focused on saving souls at home and establishing missionaries abroadwhile they awaited the Second Coming of Christ. There was a long period oflatency when fundamentalism – although growing in numbers and strength – playedlittle role in public political life.6 [Notes.html#ch-05n6]Fundamentalism came back into prominence in the late 1970s with a renewed andpowerful vigor. The 1960s horriﬁed fundamentalists. Student radicalism,anti-Vietnam War protests, the sexual revolution, and the beginnings of afeminist movement posed new threats to a Christian way of life. “Family values”were being called into question. And from a fundamentalist perspective, thecourts, especially the Supreme Court, had become aggressive agents for spreadingand enforcing secularism throughout the country. This was also a time whenfundamentalists were becoming increasingly afﬂuent and found many wealthysympathizers willing to support their causes. Fundamentalism now appealed to awider audience of Christians who were disturbed by secular challenges to aChristian way of life.7 [Notes.html#ch-05n7]The most signiﬁcant event in the rise of the New Christian Right occurred in1979 when Jerry Falwell, a popular fundamentalist Baptist preacher was persuadedto lead a new organization named the “Moral Majority.” Prior to this, there hadbeen a deep ambivalence about politics among fundamentalists (and there still isamong most extreme apocalyptic fundamentalists). If the “End Times” are reallyimminent, then there is little point in dealing with the dirty world ofpolitics. But politically conservative organizers saw a tremendous opportunityto organize fundamentalists and conservative evangelicals for national politicalpurposes. Steve Bruce describes how they went about this.Concerns become social movements only when they are mobilized, and if we arelooking for founders of the ‘new’ Christian Right, the best candidates would,surprisingly, be two Catholics and a Jew. Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich andHoward Phillips were three conservative activists who were responsible forplanning and fund-raising behind a number of new conservative groups in the late1960s and early 1970s. They believed that, beyond the common stock of economyand foreign policy, there were many sociomoral issues that could serve as thebasis for an organized conservative movement. They were also innovators inseeking to build a movement that would be independent of the main parties andbroader than such previous single-issue campaigns as the temperance crusades orthe anti-Communist League of America. Although they quickly became a factionwithin the Republican Party, the New Christian Right began with ambitions toinﬂuence both major parties. (Bruce 2000: 71)There is no doubt that organizing fundamentalists and conservative evangelicalswas a brilliant political move by political conservatives. In the ﬁrst month ofit founding, the Moral Majority raised one million dollars. Six months after itsfounding, polls indicated that 40 percent of Americans had heard about the MoralMajority, and 80 percent in the South and Southwest. In the ﬁrst year of itsorganization, the Moral Majority claimed to have 300,000 members, including70,000 ministers of religion.In 1980, Jerry Falwell published Listen America!, a manifesto of the MoralMajority that was a call to arms to potential supporters and a public warningabout its adversaries and evil enemies. The Moral Majority was intended to be aJudeo-Christian coalition that would include – in Falwell’s words – “Catholics,Jews, Protestants, Mormons, Fundamentalists” (but, of course, not Muslims). Hereare some choice quotes that give the ﬂavor of this manifesto.Experts estimate that between 5 million and 6 million babies have been murderedsince January 22, 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision known as Roev. Wade, granted women an absolute right to abortion on demand during the ﬁrsttwo trimesters of pregnancy. (p.165)Most Americans remain deeply committed to the idea of the family as a sacredinstitution. A minority of people in this country is trying to destroy what ismost important to the majority. (p. 122)Militant homosexuals march under the banner of “civil rights” or “human rights”. . . demanding to be accepted as a legitimate minority. (p. 183)It is our government that has attacked the family’s role as a primary educatorof children. (p. 131)We are very quickly moving to an amoral society where nothing is eitherabsolutely right or absolutely wrong. Our absolutes are disappearing. (p. 117)Students are told that there are no absolutes and that they are to develop theirown value systems. Humanists believe that . . . moral values are relative, thatethics is situational. (p. 206)The aim of the Moral Majority is to provide leadership in establishing aneffective coalition who are (a) prolife, (b) profamily, (c) promoral, and (d)pro-American. (p. 259)Right living must be re-established as an American way of life . . . Theauthority of Bible morality must once again be recognized as the legitimateguiding principle of our nation. (p. 265)8 [Notes.html#ch-05n8]It should be clear from these quotations (as well as the earlier Pro-FamilyForum statement) that fundamentalists have been primarily concerned withdomestic issues such as abortion, homosexuality, gay marriage, family values,and denial of prayer in schools. This is what the code term “moral values” hascome to mean. Patriotism and the defense of the “American (Christian) way oflife” have also been central. Fundamentalists have always been anti-Communist;they welcomed Reagan’s characterization of the Soviet Union as the “EvilEmpire.” But there had not been much interest in foreign affairs and foreignpolicy – at least until 9/11.Perhaps the ﬁrst great national political success of the fundamentalists was therole they played in the election of Ronald Reagan, although, ironically, it wasJimmy Carter who was the born-again Christian, and Reagan didn’t do much tofurther the domestic agenda so dear to the fundamentalists. Political scientistsand sociologists are still debating whether the New Christian Right was adriving force in the Reagan revolution or was simply riding on its coattails. In1988, Steve Bruce published a book with the title, “The Rise and Fall of the NewChristian Right.” He was perhaps a bit precipitous in his judgment. But in 1987Falwell folded the Moral Majority. The bid of Pat Robertson (the populartelevangelist) for the Republican nomination in 1988 ended in a miserablefailure. Although he spent more money than any other Republican candidate, hefailed to win a single primary. Polls showed that many fundamentalists andconservative evangelical Protestants did not like the overt mixing of politicsand religion. They preferred a secular politician who held some of the rightpositions rather than a televangelist. Bruce argues that the power and inﬂuenceof the New Christian Right had been greatly exaggerated by both its enemies andits friends. “The NCR has failed to achieve any signiﬁcant legislative success,it has failed in its main goal of Christianizing America, and there are fewreasons to suppose that it will at some future time succeed . . . what broughtthe NCR into being is so amorphous as to be barely identiﬁable while at the sametime being irreversible: what troubles supporters of the NCR is modernity and itwill not go away” (Bruce 1988: 182). Casanova echoes Bruce’s cautionary warningwhen he writes: “A well-organized, vociferous minority, whose unexpectedmobilization caught everybody by surprise but whose very loosely deﬁnedpotential constituency never reached 20 percent of the population, hadmiraculously become, in the minds of many, a threatening majority” (Casanova1994: 161).But despite the failure of the ﬁrst George Bush to win a second term and thepolitical success of Bill Clinton – who personiﬁed what so many fundamentalistsvehemently hated – the NCR did not go away. It was biding its time until anothernational opportunity would arise. That opportunity arose as a result of 9/11.The election of 2000 showed how closely the country was divided between the twomajor parties. Consequently, it became increasingly clear to Republicanstrategists that organizing sympathetic groups in key electoral states would bedecisive in the 2004 election. Even before 9/11, Karl Rove, Bush’s shrewdpolitical advisor, was working on organizing the New Christian Right.9[Notes.html#ch-05n9] George W. Bush’s pronouncements about abortion, gaymarriage, and family values were just what the New Christian Right wanted tohear. The White House also made a number of key appointments of persons favoredby conservative Christians.There can be little doubt that 9/11 radically changed the mood of the country.And from that day on, Bush started – almost obsessively – using the language ofevil, which struck deep chords among the New Christian Right. America in its“War on Terror” was ﬁghting the great Satan, the Antichrist. In his study of theethics of George W. Bush, Peter Singer points out that the clearest sign of theChristian evangelical inﬂuence on Bush is his repeated invocation of a conﬂictof good and evil.We have seen that Bush often talks of “the evil ones” and even occasionally ofthose who are “servants of evil.” He urges us to “call evil by its name,” to“ﬁght evil,” and he tells us that out of evil will come good. This languagecomes straight out of apocalyptic Christianity. To understand the context inwhich Bush uses this language, we need to remember that tens of millions ofAmericans hold an apocalyptic view of the world. According to a poll taken byTime, 53 percent of adult Americans “expect the imminent return of Jesus Christ,accompanied by the fulﬁllment of biblical prophecies concerning the cataclysmicdestruction of all that is wicked.” One of the signs of the apocalypse that willprecede the Second Coming of Christ is the rise of the Antichrist, the ultimateenemy of Christ, who heads Satan’s forces in the battle that will culminate inthe triumph of the forces of God, and the creation of the Kingdom of God onEarth. Projecting this prophecy onto the world in which they live, many AmericanChristians see their own nation as carrying out a divine mission. The nation’senemies therefore are demonized. That is exactly what Bush does. When during adiscussion about the looming war with Iraq with Australian prime minister JohnHoward in February 2003, Bush said that liberty for the people of Iraq would notbe a gift that the United States would provide, but rather, “God’s gift to everyhuman being in the world,” he seemed to be suggesting that there was divineendorsement for a war to overthrow Saddam Hussein. David Frum, Bush’sspeechwriter at the time of his “axis of evil” speech, says of Bush’s use of theterm “evil ones” for the people behind 9/11: “In a country where almosttwo-thirds of the population believes in the devil, Bush was identifying Osamabin Laden and his gang as literally satanic.”Frum has given an account of how Bush came to use the phrase “axis of evil” torefer to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. In his initial draft, he comparedAmerica’s enemies today with those in World War II, and referred to them as the“axis of hatred,” but Michael Gerson, who had the overall responsibility for itand is an evangelical Christian, changed “hatred” to “evil” because he “wantedto use the theological language that Bush had made his own since September 11.”(Singer 2004: 207–8)Since 9/11, when Americans suddenly became painfully aware of theirvulnerability to the terror of Islamic extremists, Bush’s “theological language”has become extremely effective in arousing deep emotions and political support –not only among fundamentalists and conservative Christian evangelicals, but alsoamong a larger Christian community. But, as Peter Singer notes, seeing the worldas a grand battle between the forces of evil and the forces of good is notChristian orthodoxy, but rather what Christians once thought of as heresy.Seeing the world as a conﬂict between the forces of good and the forces of evilis not, however, the orthodox Christian view, but one associated with the heresyof Manichaeanism. The Manichaeans were ferociously attacked by Augustine, whothought that seeing some kind of evil force as the source of all that is bad isa way of masking one’s own failing. Centuries of suppression and frequentpersecution, however, did not eradicate the Manichaean way of looking at theworld. After the Reformation, the Manichaean view appeared in some Protestantsects and was brought by them to America, where it ﬂourished . . . Bush’sreadiness to see America as pure and good, and its enemies as wholly evil, hasits roots in this American-Manichaean tradition. (Singer 2004: 209)The one qualiﬁcation I would add is that this is not quite what the Manichaeansprofessed. As I have previously indicated, this is really quasi-Manichaeanism–Manichaeanism with a Christian twist – because there is the underlyingconviction that the forces of good will triumph over evil. God is on our side.This theological language is presented as if it is the religious or theChristian view. But it isn’t; it is closer to what Christians once thought of asheresy.Throughout history we have witnessed the cruelty and extreme violence of thosewho are absolutely certain that they know what is good and what is evil. ArthurM. Schlesinger, Jr., has recently declared that the great threat to civilizationtoday is from religious fanatics.Religious fanaticism is the breeding place for the greatest current threat tocivilization, which is terrorism. Most of the killing in the world – whether inIreland, Kosovo, Israel, Palestine, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, thePhilippines, Tibet – is the consequence of religious disagreement. There are nomore dangerous people on earth than those who believe they are executing thewill of the Almighty. It is this conviction that drives on terrorists to murderthe inﬁdel. (Schlesinger 2004: 116)I agree with Schlesinger that “there are no more dangerous people on earth thanthose who believe they are executing the will of the Almighty.” That is why itis so disturbing and frightening when we hear something like this from ourpolitical leaders and fellow citizens, who think they are defending democracyand freedom. This is just the sort of uncritical absolutism that the pragmaticthinkers sought to root out and critique – the type of absolutism that corruptsdemocratic politics and religion.Many Christians and other religious believers do not accept a view of the worldas a grand conﬂict between the forces of evil and the forces of good. They alsoreject the idea of a clash of civilizations. They question the way in which Bushand his supporters use “evil” as a blanket term to justify dubious politicalpolicies. They are deeply suspicious of those who claim that they – and theyalone – are the true believers who are executing the will of the Almighty. Theybelieve that a fallibilistic spirit can and should inform their religious faith– whether they are Christians, Jews, Muslims, or followers of some otherreligion. When any individual, sect, or denomination presents itself aspossessing the exclusive or deﬁnitive understanding of good and evil, when“evil” is used as a blanket term of condemnation to advance a dubious politicalagenda, then there is a corruption of religion. Religious believers andnonreligious persons should passionately oppose this invidious form ofcorruption."},{"pageContent":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EpilogueWhat is to be Done?I want to begin with a disclaimer. In the spirit of the pragmatic fallibilismthat I have defended, it would be foolhardy to offer grand solutions orblueprints to correct the abuse of evil. Responsible choices and actions alwaysdemand speciﬁcity, sensitivity to context, careful analysis, clariﬁcation ofreal options, debate, and persuasion. But it doesn’t follow that there isnothing to be done. That would be a counsel of despair. It is helpful to recallwhat Hannah Arendt wrote in the preface to The Origins of Totalitarianism: “Thisbook has been written against a background of both reckless optimism andreckless despair. It holds that Progress and Doom are two sides of the samemedal: that both are articles of superstition, not of faith.” It is also helpfulto recall Menand’s thesis about how the lifelong projects of Holmes, James,Peirce, and Dewey were creative responses to the mentality that prevailed duringthe Civil War – how they sought, and to a remarkable degree succeeded infostering, a more open, ﬂexible, experimental, fallible mode of thinking andacting that helped to shape the culture of political and everyday life inAmerica. We are, of course, living in radically different times. But, as I haveargued, the same or similar mentalities can take many different historicalforms. In times of widespread anxiety, fear, and perceived crises, there arisesa craving for absolutes, ﬁrm moral certainties, and simplistic schemas that helpmake sense of confusing contingencies; they help to provide a sense ofpsychological security. Since 9/11 we have been living through such a time. Overand above the real dangers that we face, there has been a widespread sense ofvulnerability from an enemy that is difﬁcult to understand and locate. The “Waron Terror” is unlike any other war in modern history. It is not a war against asovereign state, a civil war, or even a guerilla war. We are ﬁghting anamorphous and ambiguous enemy. It is not even clear how to conduct such a war orwhat would count as “victory.” It is always unsettling and threatening when ourconventional categories for making sense of the world break down, and when weare at a loss as to how to develop new, more appropriate tools for understandingwhat is happening. The careless talk of evil and the demonizing of our enemiesdo not help matters. On the contrary – as I have argued – they obscure complexissues, block inquiry, and stiﬂe public debate about appropriate responses to anunsettling, ﬂuid state of affairs. So what is to be done? Ordinary citizens muststand up to and oppose the political abuse of evil, challenge the misuse ofabsolutes, expose false and misleading claims to moral certainty, and argue thatwe cannot deal with the complexity of the issues we confront by appealing to –or imposing – simplistic dichotomies. There is a role for public intellectuals,educators, journalists, and artists to help guide the way – just as Holmes,James, Peirce, and Dewey did at a different time under radically differenthistorical circumstances. There have been other moments in American history whenthe mentality that demonizes the enemy and divides the world into the forces ofgood and the forces of evil has prevailed. This was characteristic of the darkyears of the McCarthy period. But McCarthyism was defeated, in part becausethere were those who had the courage to stand up and oppose McCarthy’sdemagoguery.The problem is not just an American one. The clash of mentalities is in evidencethroughout the world. Various forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism arespreading; they are becoming threatening mass movements. Earlier I argued thatthe mentality of pragmatic fallibilism is not uniquely American. Many citizensthroughout the world share it. There is a new democratic cosmopolitanism that isbeginning to emerge throughout the world – although it is still in its initialstages. Those who share a democratic faith that abhors the appeal to rigidideologies must seek alliances with like-minded individuals throughout theworld. There is also a lesson to be learned from Dewey and Arendt. Both teach ushow fragile democracy really is – how its fate is always uncertain. There are noguarantees that it will persist and ﬂourish. Democracy does not consistexclusively of elections and formal political institutions. There is ademocratic ethos that must be kept alive. And this takes constant attention,work, and practice. The creation and sustenance of what Dewey called “creativedemocracy” is always a task before us. Robust fallibilism requires thecultivation of demanding democratic virtues and practices. There is always thedanger that we will undermine this democratic ethos – and empty democracy of anysubstantive meaning.We also need to rethink the role of religion in the contemporary world. Scholarshave already begun to challenge various theories of secularization. This demandsrethinking many of our conventional understandings of modernity. It alsorequires seeking to make sense of new phenomena, including the reasons why somany people throughout the world feel that religion supplies an importantspiritual dimension to their lives, as well as the reasons for the appeal ofmilitant forms of religious fundamentalism. We need to understand the“deprivatization” of religion and the ways in which religion has become apowerful force in social movements. We need to understand why and how religionhas served emancipatory aims – as in the case of liberation theology in LatinAmerica – and also served to foster terrorism. These are intellectual tasks, butthere is also practical work to be done. It doesn’t help to scorn, dismiss, ordenigrate those who afﬁrm their religious faith or to caricature all religion asif it were only ignorant superstition. Religion must not be identiﬁed withfundamentalism. But it is to be lamented that – especially in the United States– there has been a virtual collapse of progressive Christian publicintellectuals. Reinhold Niebuhr had his disagreements with John Dewey, but theyshared common ground in their social and democratic political vision. Niebuhrwas a progressive Christian thinker and a liberal social reformer who exerciseda powerful inﬂuence on both the Christian and the secular communities. Thedominant voices of American Protestantism during the ﬁrst half of the twentiethcentury were not those of fundamentalists, but rather of thinkers and activistscommitted to programs of social reform and social justice. They played a vitalrole in the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s. In Catholic circles therewere also progressive thinkers and activists concerned with the plight of thepoor and oppressed, such as Dorothy Day, Michael Harrington, and a groupassociated with the Catholic weekly, Commonweal. They read the Gospels ascalling for the alleviation of the pain and suffering of the poor. The spirit ofpragmatic fallibilism informed the religious faith of these Christian thinkers.But today there is simply no public liberal Christian thinker in America withthe stature and inﬂuence of a Reinhold Niebuhr or a Michael Harrington.Fundamentalists and conservative televangelists are drowning out the voices ofprogressive, open-minded Christians. Religious thinkers, preachers, and pastorshave a special responsibility to speak out against the abuse of evil – to showhow it distorts and corrupts religious faith. They have a responsibility toremind their congregations and constituencies of the great religious traditionof faith seeking understanding, and to afﬁrm that serious issues concerning themeaning of good and evil do not lend themselves to sloganeering and clever soundbites.In sum, there is intellectual and practical work to be done to counter the abuseof evil and the mentality that it reﬂects. The time is ripe – indeed, it isurgent – for a revitalized, passionate commitment to furthering a genuinedemocratic faith that eschews the appeal to dogmatic absolutes and simplisticdichotomies; a democratic faith that fosters tangible public freedom wheredebate, persuasion, and reciprocal argumentation ﬂourish; a democratic faiththat has the courage to live with uncertainty, contingency, and ambiguity; ademocratic faith that is thoroughly imbued with a fallibilistic spirit."},{"pageContent":"NotesIntroduction 1 [Introduction.html#fn1]Kant introduced the concept of “radical evil” intophilosophy.

Browning sums up the judgment of many historians when he writes: “I considerArendt’s concept of the ‘banality of evil’ a very important insight forunderstanding many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust, but not Eichmannhimself. Arendt was fooled by Eichmann’s strategy of self-representation in partbecause there were so many perpetrators of the kind he was pretending to be”(2003: 3–4).Chapter 1 The Clash of Mentalities: The Craving for Absolutes versus PragmaticFallibilism 1 [ch-01.html#fn1]See Putnam’s (2002) critique of the fact/value dichotomy. 2 [ch-01.html#fn2]See Menand’s discussion of the debates about culturalpluralism (2001: ch. 14). “Pluralisms.” 3 [ch-01.html#fn3]I discuss the “mythof the framework” in my 1983, and “engaged pluralism” in the appendix,“Pragmatism and the Healing of Wounds,” in my 1991.Chapter 2 The Anticipations and Legacy of Pragmatic Fallibilism 1 [ch-02.html#fn1]See the exchange between Taylor and Habermas in Gutman 1994. 2 [ch-02.html#fn2]See Habermas’s remarks about the inﬂuence of pragmatism onhis thinking in the postscript to Aboulaﬁa et la. 2002. Alan Ryan, in hisilluminating study of John Dewey discusses the revival of a Deweyan style ofphilosophy. He claims that Taylor “is for the most part a Deweyean withoutknowing it” (Ryan 1995: 361). Taylor has written perceptively about WilliamJames. See his 2002 and also his essay “What is Pragmatism?” in Benhabib andFraser 2004. 3 [ch-02.html#fn3]See Bernstein 1992 and Dickstein 1998. 4[ch-02.html#fn4]The best-known contemporary philosopher to identify with thepragmatic tradition is Richard Rorty. He enjoys a wide readership amonghumanistic scholars, even though many “professional” analytic philosophers thinkhe has abandoned “serious” rigorous thinking. But, unlike James, Holmes, andDewey, he does not have the inﬂuence that they enjoyed among a much widerpublic.Chapter 3 Moral Certainty and Passionate Commitment 1 [ch-03.html#fn1]For an account of Niebuhr’s criticism of Dewey and Dewey’sresponse, see Rice 1993; Westbrook 1991; and Diggins 1995. See also CornelWest’s interview with Eduardo Mendieta (2004); and Sidney Hook, “The MoralVision of Reinhold Niebuhr,” in Hook 1974. 2 [ch-03.html#fn2]Two essays areespecially relevant for understanding the pragmatic sense of tragedy and evil:the title essay, “Pragmatism and the Tragic Sense of Life” (1960), and“Intelligence and Evil in Human History” (1947). 3 [ch-03.html#fn3]In hisarticle, “How Bush Really Won,” Mark Danner analyzes Bush’s speeches about the“War on Terror” during the presidential campaign: “In a few blunt lines Bush hassubsumed everything else beneath the preeminent shining banner of the war onterror, and subsumed that war beneath his own reputation for forthrightness,decisiveness, and strength. And he has identiﬁed uncertainty, hesitation,vacillation – even the sort of nitpicking that would seek to separate the war inIraq from the war on terror – as not mistaken or foolish but dangerous.‘Relentless’ . . . ‘Steadfast’ . . . ‘Determined’: these words came fast andstrong, again and again. And then the climatic line: ‘We will ﬁght theterrorists across the globe so we do not have to ﬁght them here at home!” (2005:50). 4 [ch-03.html#fn4]William James introduced the distinction between “thetough-minded” and “the tender-minded” into philosophical discussion. He claimedthat pragmatism “can satisfy both kinds of demand.” See “The Present Dilemma inPhilosophy” in James 1977. 5 [ch-03.html#fn5]Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., stresses the importance of the distinction between a“preventive war” and a “preemptive war.”Given the dispute attached to the idea of a “preventive” war, the Bushadministration prefers to talk about “preemptive” war, and too many havefollowed its example. The distinction between “preemptive” and “preventive” iswell worth preserving. It is the distinction between legality and illegality.“Preemptive” war refers to a direct, immediate, speciﬁc threat that must becrushed at once; in the words of the Department of Defense manual, “an attackinitiated on the basis of incontrovertible evidence that an enemy attack isimminent.” “Preventive” war refers to potential, future, therefore speculativethreats. (Schlesinger 2004: 23).The Iraqi war a preventive war, not a preemptive war. 6 [ch-03.html#fn6]Richard Rorty quotes these remarks by Isaiah Berlin in his1989: 46. Despite some of my disagreements with Rorty’s version of pragmatism,he is one of the most forceful and eloquent defenders of pragmatic fallibilism.Chapter 4 Evil and the Corruption of Democratic Politics 1 [ch-04.html#fn1]Peter Singer observes that “Bush’s tendency to see the worldin terms of good and evil is especially striking. He has spoken about evil in319 separate speeches, or about 30 percent of all the speeches he gave betweenthe time he took ofﬁce and June 16, 2003. In these speeches he uses the word‘evil’ as a noun far more than he uses it as an adjective – 914 noun uses asagainst 182 adjectival uses. Only twenty-four times, in all these occasions onwhich Bush talks of evil, does he use it as an adjective to describe what peopledo – that is, to judge acts and deeds. This suggests that Bush is not thinkingabout evil deeds, or even evil people, nearly as often as he is thinking aboutevil as a thing, or a force, something that has real existence apart from thecruel, callous, brutal, and selﬁsh acts of which human beings are capable”(2004:2). 2 [ch-04.html#fn2]My discussion of Arendt’s conception of politicsis based upon my earlier discussions of Arendt in my 1983 and 1996. 3[ch-04.html#fn3]See my discussion of radical evil and the banality of evil in my1996. 4 [ch-04.html#fn4]Arendt consistently used masculine nouns and pronounswhen referring to human beings. But we should not forget that it is onlyrelatively recently that women have been allowed to participate in politicallife. 5 [ch-04.html#fn5]See Arendt’s discussion of power, strength, authority,and violence in “On Violence,” in her 1972: 143ff. She describes power asfollows: “Power corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act inconcert. Power is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group andremains in existence only so long as the group keeps together. When we say ofsomebody that he is ‘in power’ we actually refer to his being empowered by acertain number of people to act in their name. The moment the group, from whichthe power originated to begin with (potestas in populo, without a people orgroup there is no power) disappears, ‘his power’ also vanishes.” 6[ch-04.html#fn6]I have been stressing the overlap between Arendt and thepragmatic conception of democratic politics, especially in regard to what theyperceive as the danger of introducing absolute good and evil into politics. Butthere are also some striking differences. Arendt thought that the type ofpolitics she describes is limited to the few – to a political elite – althoughshe insisted that everyone ought to have the opportunity to enter into thepolitical sphere. This is why she preferred – as did the Founding Fathers – tospeak about the Republic. The checks and balances of republican government wereintended to prevent the excesses of unrestrained democracy. Dewey had a muchgreater faith in the “common man,” and the potential of all individuals toparticipate in democratic politics. Furthermore, Dewey would never accept thesharp distinction that Arendt draws between “the social” and “the political.”For a critique of Arendt’s distinction, see my article, “Rethinking the Socialand the Political,” in my 1986. 7 [ch-04.html#fn7]In his press conference onSept. 16, 2001, President Bush said: “This is a new kind of – a new kind ofevil. And the American people are beginning to understand. This crusade, thiswar on terrorism is going to take a while.” Muslims around the world wereincensed with this reference to a “crusade.” Bush soon stopped speaking about a“crusade” against evil and terrorism. 8 [ch-04.html#fn8]When Schmitt speaks of“liberalism,” he is not using the expression as it is commonly used today in theUnited States, as the name of a political orientation that is distinguished fromand opposed to “conservatism.” Rather, he is referring to the classical doctrineof liberalism that emphasizes individual rights and the alleged neutrality ofthe state in the protection of these rights. Liberalism in this sense has itsroots in the philosophy of John Locke (although Schmitt thinks that it can betraced back to Hobbes). The United States is Schmitt’s preeminent example ofliberal society in the twentieth century – and the target of his harshestcriticism. 9 [ch-04.html#fn9]Schmitt insists on enmity as the basic human(political) condition, but rarely seeks to justify this claim. Heinrich Meier,one of the most insightful German scholars of Schmitt, persuasively argues thatSchmitt’s understanding of “the political” is rooted in his political theology.Meier also provides a perceptive analysis of the changes in the several editionsof The Concept of the Political, which he interprets as responses in hiddendialogue with Leo Strauss. See Meier 1995 and 1998. For an analysis of Schmittthat challenges some of Meier’s claims, see Scheuerman. See also McCormick 1997.10 [ch-04.html#fn10]There are right and left Schmittians. There are those who(selectively) appeal to Schmitt to explain and “justify” the “War on Terror,”and those who (selectively) appeal to Schmitt to condemn the “War on Terror” asa disastrous total war “justiﬁed” by hypocritical universal moral principles ofgood and evil. For differing accounts of the use of Schmitt by the right and theleft, see Lilla 1997 and Wolfe 2004.Chapter 5 Evil and the Corruption of Religion 1 [ch-05.html#fn1]See Danner 2004. See also Steinfels 2004. Steinfels pointsout that “when Pope John Paul II weighed in on the question [of intrinsic evil]in his 1993 encyclical ‘The Splendor of Truth,’ the list of . . . actions hedescribed as evil ‘in themselves, independently of circumstances’ included,along with genocide and slavery, ‘physical and mental torture.’” 2[ch-05.html#fn2]Andrew Sullivan wrote this shortly before Alberto R. Gonzaleswas conﬁrmed by the Senate to be the US Attorney-General by a vote of 60 (for)to 36 (against). Recently, there has been new evidence that foreign governmentsworking secretly with the United States have been torturing prisoners capturedby the Americans. This “outsourcing” of torture elicited a strong editorial fromThe New York Times. “What is going on here is not what supporters of theadministration’s policies depict: an awful but necessary and skilled inquiryreserved for the worst terrorists, who hold secrets that could cost innocentlives. . . . This is about a system that was hastily conceived, ineptlyformulated, incompetently administered and now out of control. It lowers thehumanity of the people who practice it, and the citizens who condone it(“Self-Inﬂicted Wounds,” The New York Times, Feb. 15, 2005, A15). 3[ch-05.html#fn3]See also the articles collected in Rosenbaum 2003, including myessay, “Pragmatism’s Common Faith.” See Stout 2004 for an illuminating andpassionate defense of a pragmatic understanding of religion and democracy. 4[ch-05.html#fn4]I am restricting my discussion to Protestant religiousfundamentalism in the USA. Although the term originated in the USA, it is usedtoday to identify a variety of religious movements, including Islamicfundamentalism. The most comprehensive study of fundamentalism in the worldtoday is The Fundamentalism Project, a series of ﬁve volumes edited by Martin E.Marty and R. Scott Appleby and published by the University of Chicago Press.Sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, these ﬁve volumescontain articles by an international group of leading religious scholars. Forbriefer studies of fundamentalism, see Bruce 2000, and Ruthven 2004. 5[ch-05.html#fn5]Steve Bruce notes that there is a link between these two polarpositions and the prevailing social climate. “In times of social crisis andeconomic depression, the more pessimistic premillennialist view tends todominate. In periods of social optimism, such as that enjoyed by the USA in theﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century, the postmillennialist view tends tobe more attractive” (Bruce 2000: 11). 6 [ch-05.html#fn6]José Casanova notesthat during the Great Depression, “Evangelical Protestantism had ceased being apublic civic religion . . . Along with the economy, religion was undergoing itown ‘depression.’ After the war, both religion and the economy underwent atypical cyclical revival, and the ‘Christianization’ of the American peoplecontinued apace, but the character of Christianity had changed. Religion hadbecome increasingly privatized, and Protestantism had become just anotherdenomination. The Protestant churches and other denominations could, and oftendid, still enter the public sphere. But they were no longer established there.They had to compete not only among themselves but, most important, with secularrivals” (Casanova 1994: 143). 7 [ch-05.html#fn7]Some commentators such asMartin E. Marty think that Protestant fundamentalism has now “peaked,” and thatother Protestant groups such as the Pentecostals are rapidly growing in the USAand throughout the world. 8 [ch-05.html#fn8]See José Casanova’s illuminatinganalysis of Listen, America! (Casanova 1994: 150–4). 9 [ch-05.html#fn9]The NewChristian Right includes more than Protestant conservative evangelicals andfundamentalists. It also includes a signiﬁcant number of Catholic conservatives,who share many of the same domestic concerns as conservative Protestants, e.g.about abortion, homosexuality, single-sex marriage. The political signiﬁcance ofthis Christian coalition is illustrated by what happened in Ohio in the 2004presidential election. Ohio is a state that had suffered an economic downturnand extensive unemployment, and many pundits thought Kerry had a good chance ofwinning there. If John Kerry had received an additional 60,000 votes, he wouldhave won Ohio’s twenty electoral votes and the national election. But thecoalition of conservative Protestants and Catholics was largely responsible forBush’s victory in Ohio. In addition to the conservative evangelical vote, Bushreceived 55 percent of the Catholic vote."},{"pageContent":"Works CitedAboulaﬁa, Mitchell, Bookman, Myra, and Kemp, Catherine (eds) 2002: Habermas andPragmatism, New York: Routledge.Agamben, Giorgio 1999: Remnants of Auschwitz:The Witness and the Archive, tr.Daniel Heller-Roazen.
