Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society consti- tute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smooth- ly functioning society. Our invisible governors are, in many cases, un- aware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet. They govern us by their qu alities of natural leader- ship, their ability to suppl y needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever atti- tude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almo st every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are 9"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Propaganda dominated by the relatively small number of per- sons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. It is not usually realized how necessary these in- visible governors are to th e orderly functioning of our group life. In theory, every citizen may vote for whom he pleases. Our Constitution does not envisage political parties as part of the mechanism of government, and its framers seem not to have pictured to themselves the existence in our national politics of anything like the modern political ma- chine. But the American voters soon found that without organization and di rection their individual votes, cast, perhaps, for dozens or hundreds of can- didates, would produce nothing but confusion. In- visible government, in the shape of rudimentary political parties, arose al most overnight. Ever since then we have agreed, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, that party machines should narrow down the field of choice to two ca ndidates, or at most three or four. In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political , and ethical data involved 10"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Organizing Chaos in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion about anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issues so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions. From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public ques- tions; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or mere ly prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time. In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, eco- nomic life would become hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, soci ety consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas an d objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea. It might be better to ha ve, instead of propaganda and special pleading, committees of wise men who would choose our rulers, di ctate our conduct, private and public, and decide upon th e best types of clothes for us to wear and the best kinds of food for us to 11"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Propaganda eat. But we have chosen the opposite method, that of open competition. We mu st find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smooth- ness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda. Some of the phenomena of this process are crit- icized—the manipulation of news, the inflation of personality, and the general ballyhoo by which poli- ticians and commercial products and social ideas are brought to the consciousness of the masses. The in- struments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life. As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increas- ingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented. With the printing press and the newspaper, the railroad, the telephone, telegraph, radio and air- planes, ideas can be spread rapidly and even instanta- neously over the whole of America. H. G. Wells senses the vast potentialities of these inventions when he write s in the New York Times: \"Modern means of communication—the power afforded by print, telephone , wireless and so forth, of rapidly putting through dire ctive strategi c or tech- nical conceptions to a gr eat number of cooperating 12"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Organizing Chaos centers, of getting quick re plies and effective discus- sion—have opened up a new wo rld of political proc- esses. Ideas and phrases can now be given an effectiveness greater than the effectiveness of any personality and st ronger than any sectional interest. The common design can be documented and sustained against perversion and betrayal. It can be elaborated and developed steadily and widely withou t personal, local and sectiona l misunderstanding.\" What Mr. Wells says of political processes is equally true of commercial and social processes and all manifestations of mass activity. The groupings and affiliations of society to-day are no longer subject to \"local and sectional\" limitations. When the Con- stitution was adopted, the unit of organization was the village community, which produced the greater part of its own necessary commodities and generated its group ideas and opinions by personal contact and discussion directly among its citizens. But to-day, because ideas can be instantaneously transmitted to any distance and to any number of people, this geo- graphical integration has been supplemented by many other kinds of grouping, so that persons having the same ideas and interests may be associated and regi- mented for common action even though they live thousands of miles apart. It is extremely difficult to realize how many and diverse are these cleavages in our society. They may be social, political, economic, racial, religious or eth- 13"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Propaganda ical, with hundreds of subdi visions of each. In the World Almanac, for example, the following groups are listed under the A's: The League to Abolish Capital Punishment; As- sociation to Abolish War; American Institute of Accountants; Actors' Equity Association; Actuarial Association of America; International Advertising Association; National Aer onautic Association; Al- bany Institute of History and Art; Amen Corner; American Academy in Rome ; American Antiquarian Society; League for Amer ican Citizenship; Ameri- can Federation of Labor; Amorc (Rosicrucian Or- der); Andiron Club; Amer ican-Irish Historical Association; Anti-Cigarette League; Anti-Profanity League; Archeological Asso ciation of America; Na- tional Archery Association; Arion Singing Society; American Astronomical Asso ciation; Ayrshire Breed- ers' Association; Aztec Club of 1847. There are many more under the \"A\" section of this very limited list. The American Newspaper Annual and Directory for 1928 lists 22,128 peri odical publications in America. I have selected at random the N's pub- lished in Chicago. They are: Narod (Bohemian daily ne wspaper); Narod-Pol- ski (Polish monthly); N.A.R.D. (pharmaceutical); National Corporation Repor ter; National Culinary Progress (for hotel chefs); National Dog Journal; National Drug Clerk; Nati onal Engineer; National 14"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Organizing Chaos Grocer; National Hotel Reporter; National Income Tax Magazine; National Je weler; National Journal of Chiropractic; National Live Stock Producer; National Miller; National Nut News; National Poultry, Butter and Egg Bulletin; National Provi- sioner (for meat packers) ; National Real Estate Journal; National Retail Clothier; National Retail Lumber Dealer; National Safety News; National Spiritualist; National Underwriter; The Nation's Health; Naujienos (Lithuanian daily newspaper); New Comer (Republican weekly for Italians); Daily News; The New World (Catholic weekly); North American Banker; North American Veterina- rian. The circulation of some of these publications is astonishing. The National Live Stock Producer has a sworn circulation of 155,978; The National En- gineer, of 20,328; The New World, an estimated circulation of 67,000. The greater number of the periodicals listed—chosen at random from among 22,128—have a circulation in excess of 10,000. The diversity of these public ations is evident at a glance. Yet they can only faintly suggest the multi- tude of cleavages which exist in our society, and along which flow information and opinion carrying authority to the individual groups. Here are the conventions scheduled for Cleveland, Ohio, recorded in a single recent issue of \"World 15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Propaganda Cenvention Dates\"—a fraction of the 5,500 con- ventions and rallies scheduled. The Employing Photo-Engravers' Association of America; The Outdoor Writers' Association; the Knights of St. John; the Walther League; The Na- tional Knitted Outerwear Association; The Knights of St. Joseph; The Royal Order of Sphinx; The Mortgage Bankers' Associat ion; The International Association of Public Employment Officials; The Kiwanis Clubs of Ohio; The American Photo-En- gravers' Association; Th e Cleveland Auto Manufac- turers Show; The American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers. Other conventions to be held in 1928 were those of: The Association of Limb Manufacturers' Asso- ciations; The National Circus Fans' Association of America; The American Na turopathic Association; The American Trap Shooting Association; The Texas Folklore Association; The Hotel Greeters; The Fox Breeders' Association; The Insecticide and Disinfectant Association; The National Association of Egg Case and Egg Case Filler Manufacturers; The American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages; and The National Pickle Pack ers' Association, not to mention the Terrapin Derby—most of them with banquets and orations attached. If all these thousands of formal organizations and institutions could be listed (and no complete list has 16"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Organizing Chaos ever been made), they would still represent but a part of those existing le ss formally but leading vigorous lives. Ideas are si fted and opinions stereo- typed in the neighborhood bridge club. Leaders assert their authority through community drives and amateur theatricals. Thousands of women may un- consciously belong to a so rority which follows the fashions set by a single society leader. \"Life\" satirically expresses this idea in the reply which it represents an Am erican as giving to the Britisher who praises this country for having no upper and lower classes or castes: \"Yeah, all we have is the Four Hundred, the White-Collar Men, Bootlegge rs, Wall Street Barons, Criminals, the D.A.R., the K.K.K., the Colonial Dames, the Masons, Kiwanis and Rotarians, the K. of C, the Elks, the Cens ors, the Cognoscenti, the Morons, Heroes like Lindy, the W.C.T.U., Poli- ticians, Menckenites, the Booboisie, Immigrants, Broadcasters, and—the Rich and Poor.\" Yet it must be remembered that these thousands of groups interlace. John Jones, besides being a Rotarian, is member of a c hurch, of a fraternal order, of a political party, of a charitable organization, of a professional associati on, of a local chamber of commerce, of a league for or against prohibition or of a society for or against lowering the tariff, and of a golf club. The opinions which he receives as a 17"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Propaganda Rotarian, he will tend to disseminate in the other groups in which he may have influence. This invisible, intertwining structure of groupings and associations is the mechanism by which democ- racy has organized its group mind and simplified its mass thinking. To deplore th e existence of such a mechanism is to ask for a society such as never was and never will be. To admit that it easts, but expect that it shall not be used, is unreasonable. Emil Ludwig represents Napoleon as \"ever on the watch for indications of public opinion; always listening to the voice of the people, a voice which defies calculation. 'Do you know,' he said in those days, 'what amazes me more than all else? The impotence of force to organize anything.'\" It is the purpose of this book to explain the struc- ture of the mechanism wh ich controls the public mind, and to tell how it is manipulated by the special pleader who seeks to create public acceptance for a particular idea or commodity. It will attempt at the same time to find the due place in the modern demo- cratic scheme for this ne w propaganda and to sug- gest its gradually evolving code of ethi cs and prac- tice. 18"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II THE NEW PROPAGANDA I N the days when kings were kings, Louis XIV made his modest remark, \"L'Etat c'est moi.\" He was nearly right. But times have changed. The steam engine, the multiple press, and the public school, that trio of the industrial revolution, have taken the power away from kings and given it to the people. The people actually gained power which the king lost For economic power tends to dr aw after it political power; and the history of the industrial revolution shows how that power passed from the king and the aristocracy to the bourgeoi sie. Universal suffrage and universal schooling reinforced this tendency, and at last even the bourgeoisie stood in fear of the com- mon people. For the masses promised to become king. To-day, however, a reaction has set in. The mi- nority has discovered a power ful help in influencing majorities. It has been found possible so to mold the mind of the masses that they will throw their newly gained strength in the desired direction. In the present structure of society, this practice is inevitable. Whatever of social importance is done 19"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Propaganda to-day, whether in politics, finance, manufacture, agri- culture, charity, education, or other fiel ds, must be done with the help of propaganda. Propaganda is the executive arm of the invisible government Universal literacy was supposed to educate the common man to control his environment. Once he could read and write he would have a mind fit to rule. So ran the democra tic doctrine. But instead of a mind, universal litera cy has given him rubber stamps, rubber stamps inked with advertising slogans, with editorials, with publis hed scientific data, with the trivialities of the tabloids and the platitudes of history, but quite innocent of original thought. Each man's rubber stamps are th e duplicates of millions of others, so that when those millions are exposed to the same stimuli, all rece ive identical imprints. It may seem an exaggeration to say that the American public gets most of its ideas in this wholesale fashion. The mechanism by which ideas are disseminated on a large scale is propaganda, in the broad sense of an organized effort to spre ad a particular belief or doctrine. I am aware that the word \"propaganda\" carries to many minds an unpleasant connotation. Yet whether, in any instance, propaganda is good or bad depends upon the merit of the cause urged, and the correct- ness of the information published. In itself, the word \"pr opaganda\" has certain tech- nical meanings which, like most things in this world, 20"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The New Propaganda are \"neither good nor bad but custom makes them so.\" I find the word defi ned in Funk and Wagnalls' Dictionary in four ways: \"1. A society of cardinals , the overseers of for- eign missions; also the College of the Propaganda at Rome founded by Pope Urban VIII in 1627 for the education of missionary pr iests; Sacred College de Propaganda Fide. \"2. Hence, any instituti on or scheme for propa- gating a doctrine or system. \"3. Effort directed syst ematically toward the gaining of public support for an opi nion or a course of action. \"4. The principles adva nced by a propaganda.\" The Scientific American, in a recent issue, pleads for the restoration to respec table usage of that \"fine old word 'propaganda.'\" \"There is no word in th e English language,\" it says, \"whose meaning has been so sadly distorted as the word 'propaganda.' The change took place mainly during the late war when the term took on a decidedly sinister complexion. \"If you turn to the Sta ndard Dictionary, you will find that the word was app lied to a congregation or society of cardinals for the care and oversight of foreign missions which was instituted at Rome in the year 1627. It was applie d also to the College of the Propaganda at Rome that was founded by Pope Urban VIII, for the education of the missionary 21"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Propaganda priests. Hence, in later years the word came to be applied to any institution or scheme for propagating a doctrine or system. \"Judged by this de finition, we can see that in its true sense propaganda is a perfectly legitimate form of human activity. Any society, whether it be social, religious or political, whic h is possessed of certain beliefs, and sets out to make them known, either by the spoken or written word s, is practicing propa- ganda. \"Truth is mighty and must prevail, and if any body of men believe that they have discovered a valuable truth, it is not merely their privilege but their duty to disseminate that truth. If they realize, as they quickly must, that this spreading of the truth can be done upon a large scale and effectively only by organized effort, they w ill make use of the press and the platform as the best means to give it wide circulation. Propaganda becomes vicious and repre- hensive only when its authors consci ously and delib- erately disseminate what th ey know to be lies, or when they aim at effects wh ich they know to be prej- udicial to the common good. \" 'Propaganda' in its prope r meaning is a perfectly wholesome word, of honest parentage, and with an honorable history. The fact that it should to-day be carrying a sinister meani ng merely shows how much of the child remains in th e average adult.

Let us make haste to put this fine old word back where it belongs, and restore its dignified signi ficance for the use of our children and our children's children.\" The extent to which propaganda shapes the prog- ress of affairs about us may surprise even well in- formed persons. Nevertheless, it is only necessary to look under the surface of the newspaper for a hint as to propaganda's authority over public opinion. Page one of the New York Times on the day these paragraphs are written cont ains eight important news stories. Four of them, or one-half, are propaganda. The casual reader accepts them as accounts of spon- taneous happenings. But are they? Here are the headlines which announce them: \" TWELVE NATIONS WARN CHINA REAL REFORM MUST COME BEFORE THEY GIVE RELIEF,\" \"PRITCHETT REPORTS ZIONISM WILL FAIL,\" \"REALTY MEN DEMAND A TRANSIT IN- QUIRY,\" and \" OUR LIVING STANDARD HIGHEST IN HISTORY, SAYS HOOVER REPORT.\" Take them in order: th e article on China explains 23"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Propaganda the joint report of the Commission on Extraterri- toriality in China, presenting an exposition of the Powers' stand in the Chinese muddle. What it says is less important than what it is. It was \"made pub- lic by the State Department to-day\" with the purpose of presenting to the American public a picture of the State Department's position. Its source gives it au- thority, and the American public tends to accept and support the State Department view. The report of Dr. Pritchett, a trustee of the Car- negie Foundation for International Peace, is an at- tempt to find the facts about this Jewish colony in the midst of a restless Arab world. When Dr. Pritchett's survey convinced him that in the long run Zionism would \"bring more bitterness and more un- happiness both for the Jew and for the Arab,\" this point of view was broadcast with all the authority of the Carnegie Foundation, so that the public would hear and believe. The stat ement by the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, and Secretary Hoover's report, are similar attempts to influence the public toward an opinion. These examples are not gi ven to create the impres- sion that there is anything sinister about propaganda. They are set down rather to illustrate how conscious direction is given to even ts, and how the men behind these events influence public opinion. As such they are examples of modern propaganda. At this point we may attempt to define propaganda. 24"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The New Propaganda Modern propaganda is a consistent, enduring ef- fort to create or shape events to influence the rela- tions of the public to an enterprise, idea or group. This practice of creating circumstances and of creating pictures in the minds of millions of persons is very common. Virtually no important undertaking is now carried on without it , whether that enterprise be building a cathedral, endowing a university, mar- keting a moving picture, floating a large bond issue, or electing a president. Sometimes the effect on the public is created by a pr ofessional propagandist, sometimes by an amateur deputed for the job. The important thing is that it is universal and continuous; and in its sum total it is regimenting the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments the bodies of its soldiers. So vast are the numbers of minds which can be regimented, and so tenacious are they when regi- mented, that a group at times offers an irresistible pressure before which legislators, editors, and teach- ers are helpless. The group wi ll cling to its stereo- type, as Walter Lippmann calls it, making of those supposedly powerful beings, the leaders of public opinion, mere bits of drif twood in the surf. When an Imperial Wizard, sensing what is perhaps hunger for an ideal, offers a picture of a nation all Nordic and nationalistic, the co mmon man of the older American stock, feeling hi mself elbowed out of his rightful position and prosperity by the newer immi- 25"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Propaganda grant stocks, grasps the picture which fits in so neatly with his prejudices, and makes it his own. He buys the sheet and pillow-case costume, and bands with his fellows by the thousand into a huge group powerful enough to swing st ate elections and to throw a ponderous monkey wrench into a national convention. In our present social or ganization approval of the public is essential to a ny large undertaking. Hence a laudable movement may be lost unless it impresses itself on the public mind. Charity, as well as busi- ness, and politics and literature, for that matter, have had to adopt propaganda, for the public must be regimented into giving money just as it must be regi- mented into tuberculosis prophylaxis. The Near East Relief, the Association for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor of New York, and all the rest, have to work on public opinion just as though they had tubes of tooth paste to sell. We are proud of our diminishin g infant death rate—and that too is the work of propaganda. Propaganda does exist on all sides of us, and it does change our mental pictures of the world. Even if this be unduly pessimistic—and that remains to be proved—the opinion reflec ts a tendency that is undoubtedly real. In fact, its use is growing as its efficiency in gaining pub lic support is recognized. This then, evidently indicates the fact that any one with sufficient influence can lead sections of the 26"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The New Propaganda public at least for a time and for a given purpose. Formerly the rulers were the leaders. They laid out the course of history, by the simple process of doing what they wanted. And if nowadays the successors of the rulers , those whose position or ability gives them power, can no longer do what they want without the a pproval of the masses, they find in propaganda a tool which is increasingly powerful in gaining that approval. Therefore, prop- aganda is here to stay. It was, of course, the astounding success of prop- aganda during the war that opened the eyes of the intelligent few in all departments of life to the possibilities of regimenting the public mind. The American government and numerous patriotic agencies developed a technique which, to most per- sons accustomed to bidding for public acceptance, was new. They not only appealed to the individual by means of every approach—visual, graphic, and audi- tory—to support the national endeavor, but they also secured the cooperation of the key men in every group —persons whose mere word carried authority to hun- dreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers. They thus automatically gained the sup- port of fraternal, religious , commercial, patriotic, social and local groups whose members took their opinions from their accustom ed leaders and spokes- men, or from the periodical publications which they were accustomed to read and believe. At the same 27"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Propaganda time, the manipulators of patriotic opinion made use of the mental cliches and th e emotional habits of the public to produce mass reactions against the alleged atrocities, the terror and the tyranny of the enemy. It was only natural, after the war ended, that intel- ligent persons should ask themselves whether it was not possible to apply a similar technique to the prob- lems of peace. As a matter of fact, th e practice of propaganda since the war has assumed ve ry different forms from those prevalent twenty years ago. This new tech- nique may fairly be called the new propaganda. It takes account not merely of the individual, nor even of the mass mind alone , but also and especially of the anatomy of society, with its interlocking group formations and loyalties. It sees the individual not only as a cell in the social organism but as a cell organized into the social unit. Touch a nerve at a sensitive spot and you get an automatic response from certain specific members of the organism. Business offers graphic examples of the effect that may be produced upon the public by interested groups, such as textile manufacturers losing their markets. This problem arose, not long ago, when the velvet manufacturers were facing ruin because their product had long been out of fashion. Analysis showed that it was impossibl e to revive a velvet fash- ion within America. Anatomical hunt for the vital spot! Paris! Obviously! But yes and no. Paris is 28"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The New Propaganda the home of fashion. Lyons is the home of silk. The attack had to be made at the source. It was deter- mined to substitute purpose for chance and to utilize the regular sources for fashion distribution and to influence the public from these sources. A velvet fashion service, openly supported by the manufac- turers, was organized. Its first function was to es- tablish contact with the Lyons manufactories and the Paris couturiers to discover what they were doing, to encourage them to act on behalf of velvet, and to help in the proper exploita tion of their wares. An intelligent Parisian was enlisted in the work. He vis- ited Lanvin and Worth, Agne s and Patou, and others and induced them to use velvet in their gowns and hats. It was he who arrang ed for the distinguished Countess This or Duchess That to wear the hat or the gown. And as for the presentation of the idea to the public, the American buyer or the American woman of fashion was simply shown the velvet creations in the atelier of the dressmaker or the milliner. She bought the velvet because she liked it and because it was in fashion. The editors of the American magazines and fash- ion reporters of the American newspapers, like- wise subjected to the act ual (although created) cir- cumstance, reflected it in their news, which, in turn, subjected the buyer and the consumer here to the same influences. The result was that what was at first a trickle of velvet became a flood. A demand 29"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Propaganda was slowly, but deliberatel y, created in Paris and America. A big department store, aiming to be a style leader, advertised ve lvet gowns and hats on the authority of the French couturiers, and quoted origi- nal cables received from them. The echo of the new style note was heard from hundreds of depart- ment stores throughout the country which wanted to be style leaders too. Bulletins followed despatches. The mail followed the cables. And the American woman traveler appeared before the ship news pho- tographers in velvet gown and hat. The created circumstances had their effect. \"Fickle fashion has veered to ve lvet,\" was one newspaper comment. And the industry in the United States again kept thousands busy. The new propaganda, having regard to the consti- tution of society as a whole, not infrequently serves to focus and realize the desires of the masses. A desire for a specific reform, however widespread, cannot be translated into action until it is made articu- late, and until it has exerted sufficient pressure upon the proper law-making bodies. Millions of house- wives may feel that ma nufactured foods dele- terious to health should be prohibited. But there is little chance that their individual desires will be translated into effective legal form unless their half- expressed demand can be organized, made vocal, and concentrated upon the state legislature or upon the Federal Congress in some mode which will pro- 30"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The New Propaganda duce the results they desire.

But clearly it is the intelligent minorities which need to make use of propaganda continuously and systematically. In the active proselytizing minori- ties in whom selfish interests and public interests coincide lie the progress and development of Amer- ica. Only through the active energy of the intelligent few can the public at large become aware of and act upon new ideas. Small groups of persons can, and do, make the rest of us think what they please about a given sub- ject. But there are usually proponents and opponents of every propaganda, both of whom are equally eager to convince the majority. 31"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III THE NEW PROPAGANDISTS W HO are the men who, without our realizing it, give us our ideas, tell us whom to admire and whom to despise, what to believe about the ownership of public utilities, about the ta riff, about the price of rubber, about the Dawes Pl an, about immigration; who tell us how our houses should be designed, what furniture we should put into them, what menus we should serve on our table, what kind of shirts we must wear, what sports we should indulge in, what plays we should see, what charities we should sup- port, what pictures we should admire, what slang we should affect, what jokes we should laugh at? If we set out to make a list of the men and women who, because of their position in public life, might fairly be called the molders of public opinion, we could quickly arrive at an extended list of persons mentioned in \"Who's Who.\" It would obviously include, the President of the United States and the members of his Cabinet; the Senators and Repre- sentatives in Congress; th e Governors of our forty- eight states; the presidents of the chambers of com- merce in our hundred largest cities, the chairmen of the boards of directors of our hundred or more 32"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The New Propagandists largest industrial corporati ons, the president of many of the labor unions affiliated in the American Fed- eration of Labor, the nati onal president of each of the national professional and fraternal organizations, the president of each of the racial or language so- cieties in the country, the hundred leading news- paper and magazine editors, the fifty most popular authors, the presidents of the fifty leading charitable organizations, the twenty leading theatrical or cinema producers, the hundred recognized leaders of fash- ion, the most popular and influential clergymen in the hundred leading cities, th e presidents of our col- leges and universities and the foremost members of their faculties, the most powerful financiers in Wall Street, the most noted amateurs of sport, and so on. Such a list would comprise several thousand persons. But it is well known that many of these leaders are themselves led, sometimes by persons whose names are known to few. Many a congress- man, in framing his platform, follows the suggestions of a district boss whom few persons outside the politi- cal machine have ever heard of. Eloquent divines may have great influence in their communities, but often take their doctrines from a higher ecclesiasti- cal authority. The presidents of chambers of com- merce mold the thought of local business men concerning public issues, but the opinions which they promulgate are usually de rived from some national authority.

There was a period in which the major policies of the national government were dic- tated by a single man, Mark Hanna. A Simmons may, for a few years, succeed in marshaling mil- lions of men on a platform of intolerance and vio- lence. Such persons typify in the public mind the type of ruler associated with the phrase invisible govern- ment. But we do not often stop to think that there are dictators in other fields whose influence is just as decisive as that of the politicians I have mentioned. An Irene Castle can establish the fashion of short hair which dominates nine -tenths of the women who make any pretense to being fashionable. Paris fashion leaders set the mode of the short skirt, for wearing which, twenty year s ago, any woman would simply have been arrested and thrown into jail by the New York police, and the entire women's clothing industry, capitalized at hundreds of mil- lions of dollars, must be reorganized to conform to their dictum. 34"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The New Propagandists There are invisible rulers who control the destinies of millions. It is not generally realized to what ex- tent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes. Nor, what is still more important, the extent to which our thoughts and habits are modified by authorities. In some departments of our daily life, in which we imagine ourselves free agents, we are ruled by dictators exercising great power. A man buying a suit of clothes imagines th at he is choosing, accord- ing to his taste and his pe rsonality, the kind of gar- ment which he prefers. In reality, he may be obey- ing the orders of an anonymous gentleman tailor in London. This personage is the silent partner in a modest tailoring establishment, which is patron- ized by gentlemen of fashion and princes of the blood. He suggests to Britis h noblemen and others a blue cloth instead of gr ay, two buttons instead of three, or sleeves a quarter of an inch narrower than last season. The distingui shed customer approves of the idea. But how does this fact affect John Smith of Topeka? The gentleman tailor is under contract with a certain large American firm, which manufactures men's suits, to send them instantly the designs of the suits chosen by the leaders of London fashion. 35"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Propaganda Upon receiving the designs, with specifications as to color, weight and texture, the firm immediately places an order with the cloth makers for several hundred thousand dollars' worth of cloth. The suits made up according to the specifications are then ad- vertised as the latest fashion. The fashionable men in New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia wear them. And the Topeka man, recognizing this leadership, does the same. Women are just as subject to the commands of invisible government as are men. A silk manufac- turer, seeking a new mark et for its product, sug- gested to a large manufacturer of shoes that women's shoes should be covered with silk to match their dresses. The idea was adopt ed and systematically propagandized. A popular actress was persuaded to wear the shoes. The fashion spread. The shoe firm was ready with the supply to meet the created de- mand. And the silk company was ready with the silk for more shoes. The man who injected this idea into the shoe in- dustry was ruling women in one department of their social lives. Different men rule us in the various departments of our lives. There may be one power behind the throne in politics, another in the manipu- lation of the Federal discount rate, and still another in the dictation of next season's dances.

Yet from another standpoint, every parent is a group leader with authority over his or her children. The invisible government tends to be concen- trated in the hands of the few because of the ex- pense of manipulating the social machinery which controls the opinions and ha bits of the masses. To advertise on a scale which will reach fifty million persons is expensive. To reach and persuade the group leaders who dictate the public's thoughts and actions is likewise expensive. For this reason there is an increasing tendency to concentrate the functions of propaganda in the hands of the propaganda specialist. This specialist is more and more assuming a distin ct place and function in our national life. New activities call for new nomenclature. The propagandist who specializes in interpreting enter- prises and ideas to the publ ic, and in interpreting the public to promulgators of new enterprises and ideas, has come to be known by the name of \"public rela- tions counsel.\" The new profession of public relations has grown up because of the increasing complexity of modern 37"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Propaganda life and the consequent necessity for making the actions of one part of the public understandable to other sectors of the public. It is due, too, to the increasing dependence of orga nized power of all sorts upon public opinion. Governments, whether they are monarchical, constitutional, democratic or com- munist, depend upon acquies cent public opinion for the success of their efforts and, in fact, government is only government by virtue of public acquiescence. Industries, public utilities, educational movements, indeed all groups represen ting any concept or prod- uct, whether they are majority or minority ideas, succeed only because of approving public opinion. Public opinion is the unac knowledged partner in all broad efforts. The public relations counsel, then, is the agent who, working with modern media of communica- tion and the group formations of society, brings an idea to the consciousness of the public. But he is a great deal more than that. He is concerned with courses of action, doctrines, systems and opinions, and the securing of public suppor t for them. He is also concerned with tangible thi ngs such as manufactured and raw products. He is conc erned with public utili- ties, with large trade groups and associations repre- senting entire industries. He functions primarily as an adviser to his client, very much as a lawyer does. A lawyer concentrates on the legal aspects of his client's business. A coun- 38"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The New Propagandists sel on public relations concentrates on the public con- tacts of his client's busin ess. Every phase of his client's ideas, products or activities which may affect the public or in which the public may have an in- terest is part of his function. For instance, in the specific problems of the manu- facturer he examines the product, the markets, the way in which the public react s to the product, the at- titude of the employees to the public and towards the product, and the coopera tion of the distribution agencies. The counsel on public rela tions, after he has ex- amined all these and other factors, endeavors to shape the actions of his client so that they will gain the interest, the approval and the acceptance of the public. The means by which the public is apprised of the actions of his client are as varied as the means of communication themselves, such as conversation, let- ters, the stage, the motion pi cture, the radio, the lec- ture platform, the magazine, the daily newspaper. The counsel on public relations is not an advertising man but he advocates advert ising where that is indi- cated. Very often he is ca lled in by an advertising agency to supplement its work on behalf of a client. His work and that of the advertising agency do not conflict with or duplicate each other. His first efforts are, naturally, devoted to analyz- ing his client's problems and making sure that what 39"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Propaganda he has to offer the public is something which the public accepts or can be br ought to acce pt. It is futile to attempt to sell an idea or to prepare the ground for a product that is basically unsound. For example, an orphan asylum is worried by a falling off in contributions and a puzzling attitude of indifference or hostility on the part of the public. The counsel on public rela tions may discover upon analysis that the public, a live to modern sociological trends, subconsciously critic izes the institution because it is not organized on the new \"cottage plan.\" He will advise modification of the client in this re- spect. Or a railroad may be urged to put on a fast train for the sake of the prestige which it will lend to the road's name, and hence to its stocks and bonds. If the corset makers, for instance, wished to bring their product into fashion again, he would un- questionably advise that the plan was impossible, since women have definitely emancipated themselves from the old-style corset. Yet his fashion advisers might report that women might be persuaded to adopt a certain type of gi rdle which eliminated the unhealthful features of the corset. His next effort is to analyze his public. He studies the groups which must be reached, and the leaders through whom he may approach these groups. Social groups, economic groups, geographical groups, age groups, doctrinal groups, language groups, cul- tural groups, all these repr esent the divisions through 40"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The New Propagandists which, on behalf of his clie nt, he may talk to the public. Only after this double analysis has been made and the results collated, has the time come for the next step, the formulation of po licies governing the gen- eral practice, procedure and ha bits of the client in all those aspects in which he comes in contact with the public. And only when these policies have been agreed upon is it time for the fourth step. The first recognition of th e distinct functions of the public relations counsel arose, perhaps, in the early years of the present century as a result of the insurance scandals coincide nt with the muck-raking of corporate finance in the popular magazines. The interests thus attacked s uddenly realized that they were completely out of touch with the public they were professing to serve, and required expert advice to show them how they could understand the public and interpret themselves to it. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, prompted by the most fundame ntal self-interest, in- itiated a conscious, directed effort to change the atti- tude of the public toward insurance companies in general, and toward itself in particular, to its profit and the public's benefit. It tried to make a majority movement of itself by getting the public to buy its policies. It reached the public at every point of its corporate and separate existences.

And so this company came to have a broad general acceptance. The num- ber and amount of its policies grew constantly, as its broad contacts with society increased. Within a decade, many large corporations were employing public relations c ounsel under one title or another, for they had come to recognize that they depended upon public good will for their continued prosperity. It was no longer true that it was \"none of the public's business\" how the affairs of a corpora- tion were managed. They were obliged to convince the public that they were conforming to its demands as to honesty and fairness. Thus a corporation might discover that its labor po licy was causing public re- sentment, and might introduce a more enlightened policy solely for the sake of general good will. Or a department store, hunting for the cause of diminish- ing sales, might discover th at its clerks had a repu- tation for bad manners, and initiate formal instruction in courtesy and tact.

After the public and the client are thoroughly anal yzed and policies have been formulated, his work may be finished. In other cases the work of th e public relations counsel must be continuous to be effective. For in many in- stances only by a careful sy stem of constant, thorough and frank information will the public understand and appreciate the value of what a merchant, educator or statesman is doing. The counsel on public relations must maintain constant vigilance, because inadequate information, or false information from unknown sources, may have results of enormous importance. A single false rumor at a cr itical moment may drive down the price of a corporation's stock, causing a loss of millions to stockholders. An air of secrecy or mystery about a corporation' s financial dealings may breed a general suspicion capable of acting as an in- visible drag on the compa ny's whole dealings with the public.

If we accept public relati ons as a profession, we must also expect it to have both ideals and ethics. The ideal of the profession is a pragmatic one. It is to make the producer, whether that producer be a legislature making laws or a manufacturer making a commercial product, understand what the public wants and to make the public understand the objec- tives of the producer. In relation to industry, the ideal of the profession is to eliminate the waste and the friction that result when industry does things or makes things which its public does not want, or when the public does not understand what is being offered it. For example, the tele phone companies maintain extensive public relations departments to explain what they are doing, so that energy may not be burned up in the friction of misunderstanding.

The profession of public relations counsel is de- veloping for itself an ethical code which compares favorably with that governing the legal and medical professions. In part, this code is forced upon the public relations counsel by th e very conditions of his work. While recognizing, ju st as the lawyer does, that every one has the right to present his case in its best light, he nevertheless refuses a client whom he believes to be dishonest, a product which he be- lieves to be fraudulent, or a cause which he believes to be antisocial. One reason for this is that, even though a special pleader, he is not dissociated from the client in the public's mind. Another reason is that while he is pleading before the court—the court of public opinion—he is at the same time trying to affect that court's judgme nts and actions. In law, the judge and jury hold the deciding balance of power. In public opinion, th e public rela tions coun- sel is judge and jury, because through his pleading of a case the public may accede to his opinion and judgment.

Trotter and Le Bon, who approached the subj ect in a scientific man- ner, and Graham Wallas, Walter Lippmann and others who continued with searching studies of the group mind, established that the group has mental characteristics distinct from those of the individual, and is motivated by impul ses and emotions which cannot be explained on the basis of what we know of individual psychology. So the question naturally arose: If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it? The recent practice of pr opaganda has proved that it is possible, at least up to a certain point and within certain limits. Mass psychology is as yet far from being an exact science a nd the mysteries of human motivation are by no means all revealed. But at least theory and practice have combined with suffi- cient success to permit us to know that in certain 47"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Propaganda cases we can effect some change in public opinion with a fair degree of accur acy by operating a certain mechanism, just as the motorist can regulate the speed of his car by manipulating the flow of gaso- line.

It is now scientific in the sense that it seeks to base its operations upon definite knowledge drawn from direct observation of the group mind, and upon the application of principles which have been demonstrated to be consistent and relatively constant The modern propagandist studies systematically and objectively the material with which he is working in the spirit of the laboratory. If the matter in hand is a nation-wide sale s campaign, he studies the field by means of a clipping se rvice, or of a corps of scouts, or by personal study at a crucial spot He determines, for example, wh ich features of a product are losing their public appeal , and in what new direc- tion the public taste is veering. He will not fail to investigate to what extent it is the wife who has the final word in the choice of her husband's car, or of his suits and shirts.

But he cannot be sure that some unexpected event will not overshadow this flight in the public in terest, or that some other aviator may not do something more spectacular the day before. Even in his restricted field of public psychology there must always be a wide margin of error. Propaganda, like economics and sociology, can never be an exact scie nce for the reason that its subject-matter, like theirs, deals with human beings. If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. But men do not need to be actually gathered together in a public meeting or in a street riot, to be subject to the influences of mass psychology. Because man is by nature gregarious he feels himself to be member of a herd, even when he is alone in his room with the curtains drawn. His mind re tains the patterns which have been stamped on it by the group influences. A man sits in his office deci ding what stocks to buy. He imagines, no doubt, that he is planning his pur- chases according to his own judgment. In actual fact his judgment is a melange of impressions stamped on his mind by outside influences which un- consciously control his thought. He buys a certain railroad stock because it was in the headlines yester- day and hence is the one which comes most promi- 49"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Propaganda nently to his mind; because he has a pleasant recollection of a good dinne r on one of its fast trains; because it has a liberal labor policy, a reputa- tion for honesty; because he has been told that J. P. Morgan owns some of its shares. Trotter and Le Bon conc luded that the group mind does not think in the strict sense of the word. In place of thoughts it has impulses, habits and emo- tions. In making up its mind its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology. It opera tes in establishing the rising or diminishing prestige of a summer resort, in causing a run on a bank, or a panic on the stock ex- change, in creating a best seller, or a box-office success. But when the example of the leader is not at hand and the herd must think for itself, it does so by means of cliches, pat words or images which stand for a whole group of ideas or experiences. Not many years ago, it was only necessary to tag a political candidate with the word interests to stampede millions of people into voting against him, because anything associated with \"the interests\" seemed nec- essarily corrupt. Recently the word Bolshevik has performed a similar service for persons who wished to frighten the public away from a line of action.

In Great Britain, during the war, the evacuation hospitals came in for a considerable amount of criticism because of the summary way in which they handled their wounded. It was assumed by the public that a hospital gives prolonged and conscientious a ttention to its patients. When the name was changed to evacuation posts the critical reaction vanish ed. No one expected more than an adequate emergency treatment from an insti- tution so named. The cliche hospital was indelibly associated in the public mind with a certain picture. To persuade the public to discriminate between one type of hospital and another, to dissociate the cliche from the picture it evoked, would have been an im- possible task. Instead, a ne w cliche automatically conditioned the public emotion toward these hospi- tals. Men are rarely aware of the real reasons which motivate their actions. A man may believe that he buys a motor car because, af ter careful study of the technical features of all makes on the market, he has concluded that this is the best. He is almost certainly fooling himself. He bought it, perhaps, because a friend whose financial acumen he respects bought one last week; or because his neighbors be- lieved he was not able to a fford a car of that class; or because its colors are those of his college fra- ternity. 51"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Propaganda It is chiefly the psychologists of the school of Freud who have pointed out that many of man's thoughts and actions are compensatory substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to suppress. A thing may be desired not for its intrinsic worth or usefulness, but because he has unconsciously come to see in it a symbol of so mething else, the desire for which he is ashamed to admit to himself. A man buying a car may think he wants it for purposes of locomotion, whereas the fact may be that he would really prefer not to be burdened with it, and would rather walk for the sake of his health. He may really want it because it is a symbol of social position, an evidence of his success in business, or a means of pleasing his wife. This general principle, th at men are very largely actuated bv motives which they conceal from them- selves, is as true of ma ss as of individual psychology. It is evident that the successful propagandist must understand the true motives and not be content to accept the reasons which men give for what they do. It is not sufficient to understand only the me- chanical structure of so ciety, the groupings and cleavages and loyalties.

It was the special pleader's function to provide the stimulus which would cause the desired reaction in the individual purchaser.

Although the appeal was aimed at fifty million persons, it was aimed at each as an individual. The new salesmanship has found it possible, by dealing with men in the mass through their group formations, to set up psychological and emotional currents which will work for him. Instead of as- saulting sales resistance by di rect attack, he is inter- ested in removing sales resistance. He creates circumstances which will swing emotional currents so as to make for purchaser demand.

Because he has decided that he wants the commodity called locomotion more than he wants the commodity called music? Not alto- gether. He buys a car, because it is at the moment the group custom to buy cars. The modern propagandist th erefore sets to work to create circumstances which will modify that cus- tom. He appeals perhaps to the home instinct which is fundamental. He will endeavor to develop public acceptance of the idea of a music room in the home. This he may do, for example, by organizing an ex- hibition of period music rooms designed by well known decorators who themselves exert an influence on the buying groups. He enhances the effectiveness and prestige of these rooms by putting in them rare and valuable tapestries. Then, in order to create dramatic interest in the exhibit, he stages an event or ceremony.

Less influential ar chitects will as a matter of course imitate what is done by the men whom they consider masters of their profession. They in turn will implant the idea of the music room in the mind of the general public. The music room will be accepted because it has been made the thing.

Business to-day is taking the public into partnership. A num- ber of causes, some economic, others due to the grow- ing public understanding of business and the public interest in business, have produced this situation. Business realizes that its relationship to the public is not confined to the manu facture and sale of a given product, but includes at the same time the selling of itself and of all those things for which it stands in the public mind. Twenty or twenty-five years ago, business sought to run its own affairs rega rdless of the public. The reaction was the muck-raking period, in which a multitude of sins were, justly and unjustly, laid to the charge of the interest s. In the face of an aroused public conscience the large corporations were obliged to renounce their cont ention that their affairs were nobody's business. If to-day big business were to seek to throttle the public, a new reaction similar to that of twenty years ago would take place and the public would rise and try to throttle big business with restrictive laws . Business is conscious 62"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Business and the Public of the public's conscience. This consciousness has led to a healthy cooperation. Another cause for the incr easing relationship is undoubtedly to be found in the various phenomena growing out of mass production. Mass production is only profitable if its rhythm can be maintained— that is, if it can continue to sell its product in steady or increasing quantity. Th e result is that while, under the handicraft or small-unit system of produc- tion that was typical a cen tury ago, demand created the supply, to-day supply must actively seek to create its corresponding demand. A single factory, poten- tially capable of supplying a whole continent with its particular product, cannot afford to wait until the public asks for its product; it must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda, with the vast public in order to a ssure itself the continuous demand which alone will make its costly plant profit- able. This entails a vastly more complex system of distribution than formerl y. To make customers is the new problem. One must understand not only his own business—the manufacture of a particular prod- uct—but also the structure, the personality, the prej- udices, of a potential ly universal public. Still another reason is to be found in the improve- ments in the technique of advertising—as regards both the size of the public which can be reached by the printed word, and the methods of appeal. The growth of newspapers and magazines having a 63"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Propaganda circulation of millions of copies, and the art of the modern advertising expert in making the printed message attractive and pers uasive, have placed the business man in a personal relation with a vast and diversified public. Another modern phenomenon, which' influences the general policy of big business, is the new compe- tition between certain firms and the remainder of the industry, to which they belong. Another kind of competition is between whol e industries, in their struggle for a share of the consumer's dollar. When, for example, a soap manufacturer claims that his product will preserve youth, he is obviously at- tempting to change the public's mode of thinking about soap in general—a thing of grave importance to the whole industry. Or when the metal furniture industry seeks to convince the public that it is more desirable to spend its money for metal furniture than for wood furniture, it is clear ly seeking to alter the taste and standards of a w hole generation. In either case, business is seeking to inject itself into the lives and customs of millions of persons. Even in a basic sense, business is becoming depend- ent on public opinion. With the increasing volume and wider diffusion of wealth in America, thousands of persons now invest in industrial stocks. New stock or bond flotations, upon wh ich an expanding business must depend for its success, can be effected only if the concern has understood how to gain the confi- 64"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Business and the Public dence and good will of the general public. Business must express itself and its entire corporate existence so that the public will unde rstand and accept it. It must dramatize its personality and interpret its ob- jectives in every particular in which it comes into contact with the community (or the nation) of which it is a part. An oil corporation which truly understands its many-sided relation to the public, will offer that public not only good oil but a sound labor policy. A bank will seek to show not only that its management is sound and conservative, but also that its officers are honorable both in their public and in their private life. A store specializing in fashionable men's clothing will express in its architecture the authenticity of the goods it offers. A bakery will seek to impress the public with the hygienic ca re observed in its manu- facturing process, not only by wrapping its loaves in dust-proof paper and thro wing its factory open to public inspection, but also by the cleanliness and at- tractiveness of its delivery wagons. A construction firm will take care that the public knows not only that its buildings are durabl e and safe, but also that its employees, when injured at work, are com- pensated. At whatever poi nt a business enterprise impinges on the public consciousness, it must seek to give its public relations the particular character which will conform to the objectives which it is pursuing. Just as the production manager must be familiar 65"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Propaganda with every element and detail concerning the mate- rials with which he is working, so the man in charge of a firm's public relations must be familiar with the structure, the prejudices, and the whims of the gen- eral public, and must handle his problems with the utmost care. The public ha s its own standards and demands and habits. You may modify them, but you dare not run counter to them. You cannot per- suade a whole generation of women to wear long skirts, but you may, by working through leaders of fashion, persuade them to wear evening dresses which are long in back. The public is not an amor- phous mass which can be molded at will, or dictated to. Both business and the public have their own per- sonalities which must somehow be brought into friendly agreement. Conflict and suspicion are in- jurious to both. Modern business must study on what terms the partnership can be made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept. Business does not willingl y accept dictation from the public. It should not expe ct that it can dictate to the public. While the public should appreciate the great economic benefits which business offers, thanks to mass production and scientific marketing, business should also appreciate that the public is becoming increasingly discriminative in its standards and should seek to understand its demands and meet 66"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Business and the Public them. The relationship between business and the public can be healthy only if it is the relationship of give and take. It is this condition and n ecessity which has created the need for a specialized field of public relations. Business now calls in the public relations counsel to advise it, to interpret its purpose to the public, and to suggest those modifications which may make it con- form to the public demand. The modifications then recommended to make the business conform to its objectives and to the public demand, may concern the broadest matters of policy or the apparently most trivial details of execution. It might in one case be necessary to transform entirely the lines of goods sold to conform to changing public demands. In another case the trouble may be found to lie in such small matters as the dress of the clerks. A jewelry store may complain that its patronage is shrinking upwards because of its reputation for carrying high-priced goods; in this case the public relations counsel might s uggest the featuring of medium-priced goods, even at a loss, not because the firm desires a large medium-price trade as such, but because out of a hundred medium-price customers acquired to-day a certain pe rcentage will be well-to- do ten years from now. A department store which is seeking to gather in the high-class trade may be urged to employ college graduates as clerks or to engage well known modern artists to design show-windows 67"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Propaganda or special exhibits. A ba nk may be urged to open a Fifth Avenue branch, not because the actual business done on Fifth Avenue warrants the expense, but because a beautiful Fifth Avenue office correctly ex- presses the kind of appeal which it wishes to make to future depositors; and, viewed in this way, it may be as important that the doorman be polite, or that the floors be kept clean, as that the branch manager be an able financier. Yet the be neficial effect of this branch may be canceled, if the wife of the president is involved in a scandal. Big business studies every move which may express its true personality. It seek s to tell the public, in all appropriate ways,—by the direct advertising message and by the subtlest esthetic suggestion—the quality of the goods or services which it has to offer. A store which seeks a large sales volume in cheap goods will preach prices day in and day out, concentrating its whole appeal on the wa ys in which it can save money for its clients. Bu t a store seeking a high margin of profit on indivi dual sales would try to associate itself with the di stinguished and the elegant, whether by an exhibition of old masters or through the social activities of the owner's wife. The public relations activi ties of a business cannot be a protective coloring to hide its real aims. It is bad business as well as bad morals to feature exclu- sively a few high-class articles, when the main stock is of medium grade or cheap, for the general im- 68"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Business and the Public pression given is a false one. A sound public rela- tions policy will not attempt to stampede the public with exaggerated claims and false pretenses, but to interpret the individual bus iness vividly and truly through every avenue that leads to public opinion. The New York Central Railroad has for decades sought to appeal to the public not only on the basis of the speed and safety of its trains, but also on the basis of their elegance and co mfort. It is appropriate that the corporation should have been personified to the general public in the pe rson of so suave and in- gratiating a gentleman as Chauncey M. Depew—an ideal window dressing for such an enterprise. While the concrete recommendations of the public relations counsel may vary infinitely according to individual circumstances, his general plan of work may be reduced to two types, which I might term continuous interpretation and dramatization by high- spotting. The two may be alternative or may be pursued concurrently. Continuous interpretation is achieved by trying to control every approach to the public mind in such a manner that the public receiv es the desired impression, often without being conscious of it. High-spotting, on the other hand, vividly se izes the attention of the public and fixes it upon some detail or aspect which is typical of the entire enterp rise. When a real estate corporation which is erec ting a tall office building 69"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Propaganda makes it ten feet taller than the highest sky-scraper in existence, that is dramatization. Which method is indicated , or whether both be indicated concurrently, can be determined only after a full study of objectives and specific possibilities. Another interesting case of focusing public atten- tion on the virtues of a product was shown in the case of gelatine. Its advantages in increasing the diges- tibility and nutritional valu e of milk were proven in the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. The suggestion was made and carri ed out that to further this knowledge, gelatine be used by certain hospitals and school systems, to be tested out there. The favorable results of such tests were then projected to other leaders in the field with the result that they followed that group leadership and utilized gelatine for the scientific purposes which had been proven to be sound at the research institution. The idea car- ried momentum. The tendency of big business is to get bigger. Through mergers and monopolies it is constantly increasing the number of pers ons with whom it is in direct contact. All this has intensified and multiplied the public relationships of business. The responsibilities are of many kinds. There is a responsibility to the stockholders—numbering per- haps five persons or five hundred thousand—who have entrusted their money to the concern and have the right to know how the money is being used. A 70"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Business and the Public concern which is fully awar e of its responsibility to- ward its stockholders, will furnish them with fre- quent letters urging them to use the product in which their money is invested, and use their influence to promote its sale. It has a responsibility toward the dealer which it may express by inviting him, at its expense, to visit the home factory. It has a responsi- bility toward the industry as a whole which should restrain it from making exaggerated and unfair sell- ing claims. It has a responsibility toward the re- tailer, and will see to it that its salesmen express the quality of the product which they have to sell. There is a responsibility toward the consumer, who is impressed by a clean a nd well managed factory, open to his inspection. And the general public, apart from its function as potential consumer, is influenced in its attitude toward the concern by what it knows of that concern's financial dealings, its labor policy, even by the livableness of the houses in which its employees dwell. There is no detail too trivial to influence the public in a favorable or unfavorable sense. The personality of the president may be a matter of importance, for he perhaps dramatizes the whole concern to the public mind. It may be very important to what charitie s he contributes, in what civic societies he holds office. If he is a leader in his industry, the public may dema nd that he be a leader in  his  community.  The business man has become a responsible member 71"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Propaganda of the social group. It is not a question of ballyhoo, of creating a picturesque fiction for public consump- tion. It is merely a question of finding the appro- priate modes of expressing th e personality that is to be dramatized. Some business men can be their own best public relations counsel . But in the majority of cases knowledge of the public mind and of the ways in which it will react to an appeal, is a specialized function which must be undertaken by the profes- sional expert. Big business, I believe, is realizing this more and more. It is increasingly availing itself of the serv- ices of the specialist in public relations (whatever may be the title accorded him). And it is my con- viction that as big busine ss becomes bigger the need for expert manipulation of its innumerabl e contacts with the public will become greater. One reason why the public relations of a business are frequently placed in the hands of an outside expert, instead of being conf ided to an officer of the company, is the fact that the correct approach to a problem may be indirect. For example, when the luggage industry attempted to solve some of its problems by a public relations policy, it was realized that the attitude of railroad s, of steamship companies, and of foreign government-owned railroads was an important factor in the handling of luggage. If a railroad and a baggage man, for their own interest, can be educated to handle baggage with more 72"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Business and the Public facility and promptness, with less damage to the baggage, and less inconvenience to the passenger; if the steamship company lets down, in its own in- terests, its restrictions on luggage; if the foreign government eases up on its ba ggage costs and trans- portation in order to further tourist travel; then the luggage manufacturers will profit. The problem then, to increase the sale of their luggage, was to have these and other forces come over to their point of vi ew. Hence the public rela- tions campaign was directed not to the public, who were the ultimate consumers, but to these other ele- ments. Also, if the luggage ma nufacturer can educate the general public on what to wear on trips and when to wear it, he may be in creasing the sale of men's and women's clothing, but he will, at the same time, be increasing the sale of his luggage. Propaganda, since it goes to basic causes, can very often be most effective th rough the manner of its introduction. A campaign against unhealthy cos- metics might be waged by fighting for a return to the wash-cloth and soap—a fight that very logically might be taken up by health officials all over the country, who would urge the return to the salutary and helpful wash-cloth and soap, instead of cos- metics. The development of public opinion for a cause or line of socially constr uctive action may very often 73"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Propaganda be the result of a desire on the part of the propa- gandist to meet successfully his own problem which the socially constructive cause would further. And by doing so he is actually fulfilling a social purpose in the broadest sense. The soundness of a public relations policy was likewise shown in the case of a shoe manufacturer who made service shoes fo r patrolmen, firemen, let- ter carriers, and men in similar occupations. He realized that if he could make acceptable the idea that men in such work ought to be well-shod, he would sell more shoes and at the same time further the efficiency of the men. He organized, as part of his business, a foot pro- tection bureau. This bureau disseminated scientifi- cally accurate information on the proper care of the feet, principles which th e manufacturer had incor- porated in the construction of the shoes. The result was that civic bodies, poli ce chiefs, fire chiefs, and others interested in the welfare and comfort of their men, furthered the ideas his product stood for and the product itself, with the consequent effect that more of his shoes were sold more easily. The application of this principle of a common denominator of interest between the object that is sold and the public good w ill can be carried to in- finite degrees. \"It matters not how much capital you may have, how fair the rates may be, how favorable the condi- 74"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Business and the Public tions of service, if you haven't behind you a sympa- thetic public opinion, you are bound to fail.\" This is the opinion of Samuel Insull, one the foremost traction magnates of the country. And the late Judge Gary, of the United States Steel Corporation, expressed the same idea when he said: \"Once you have the good will of the general public, you can go ahead in the work of constructive expansion. Too often many try to discount this vague and intangible element. That way lies destruction.\" Public opinion is no longe r inclined to be unfavor- able to the large business merger. It resents the censorship of business by the Federal Trade Com- mission. It has broken down the anti-trust laws where it thinks they hinder economic develop- ment. It backs great trus ts and mergers which it excoriated a decade ago. The government now per- mits large aggregations of producing and distributing units, as evidenced by mergers among railroads and other public utilities, because representative govern- ment reflects public opinion. Public opinion itself fosters the growth of ma mmoth industrial enter- prises. In the opinion of millions of small investors, mergers and trusts are friendly giants and not ogres, because of the economies, mainly due to quantity production, which they have effected, and can pass on to the consumer. This result has been, to a great extent, obtained by a deliberate use of propaganda in its broadest 75"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Propaganda sense. It was obtained not only by modifying the opinion of the public, as th e governments modified and marshaled the opinion of their publics during the war, but often by modifying the business concern itself. A cement company may work with road com- missions gratuitously to maintain testing laboratories in order to insure the best -quality roads to the public. A gas company maintains a free school of cookery. But it would be rash and unreasonable to take it for granted that because public opinion has come over to the side of big business, it will always remain there. Only recently, Prof . W. Z. Ripley of Har- vard University, one of the foremost national authorities on business or ganization and practice, exposed certain aspects of big business which tended to undermine public confiden ce in large co rporations. He pointed out that the stockholders' supposed vot- ing power is often illusory ; that annual financial statements are sometimes so brief and summary that to the man in the street they are downright mislead- ing; that the extension of the system of non-voting shares often places the effective control of corpora- tions and their finances in the hands of a small clique of stockholders; and that so me corporations refuse to give out sufficient information to permit the public to know the true cond ition of the concern. Furthermore, no matter how favorably disposed the public may be toward big business in general, the utilities are always fair game for public discontent 76"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Business and the Public and need to maintain good will with the greatest care and watchfulness. These and other corporations of a semi-public character will always have to face a demand for government or municipal ownership if such attacks as those of Professor Ripley are con- tinued and are, in the pub lic's opinion, justified, un- less conditions are changed a nd care is taken to main- tain the contact with the public at all points of their corporate existence. The public relations counsel should anticipate such trends of public opinion and advise on how to avert them, either by convincing the public that its fears or prejudices are unjustifie d, or in certain cases by modifying the action of the client to the extent nec- essary to remove the cause of complaint. In such a case public opinion might be surveyed and the points of irreducible opposition di scovered. The aspects of the situation which are susceptible of logical ex- planation; to what extent the criticism or prejudice is a habitual emotional reaction and what factors are dominated by accepted cliches, might be disclosed. In each instance he would advise some action or modification of policy calculated to make the read- justment. While government ownership is in most instances only varyingly a remote po ssibility, public ownership of big business through th e increasing popular in- vestment in stocks and bonds, is becoming more and more a fact. The im portance of public relations 77"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Propaganda from this standpoint is to be judged by the fact that practically all pros perous corporations expect at some time to enlarge operations, and will need to float new stock or bond issues. The success of such issues de- pends upon the general record of the concern in the business world, and also upon the good will which it has been able to create in the general public. When the Victor Talking Machine Company was recently offered to the public, millions of dollars' worth of stock were sold overnight. On the other hand, there are certain companies which, although they are fi- nancially sound and commerci ally prosperous, would be unable to float a large stock issue, because public opinion is not conscious of them, or has some unana- lyzed prejudice against them. To such an extent is the successful floating of stocks and bonds dependent upon the public favor that the success of a new merger may stand or fall upon the public acceptance which is created for it. A merger may bring into existence huge new re- sources, and these resources, perhaps amounting to millions of dollars in a single operation, can often fairly be said to have been created by the expert manipulation of public opini on. It must be repeated that I am not speaking of artificial value given to a stock by dishonest propaganda or stock manipulation, but of the real economic values which are created when genuine public acceptance is gained for an in- dustrial enterprise and beco mes a real partner in it. 78"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Business and the Public The growth of big business is so rapid that in some lines ownership is more in ternational than national. It is necessary to reach ev er larger groups of people if modern industry and comm erce are to be financed. Americans have purchased bi llions of dollars of for- eign industrial securities since the war, and Euro- peans own, it is estimated, between one and two billion dollars' worth of ours. In each case public acceptance must be obtained for the issue and the en- terprise behind it. Public loans, state or m unicipal, to foreign coun- tries depend upon the good will which those coun- tries have been able to create for themselves here. An attempted issue by an east European country is now faring badly largely because of unfavorable public reaction to the behavior of members of its ruling family. But other countries have no difficulty in placing any issue because the public is already con- vinced of the prosperity of these nations and the stability of their governments. The new technique of public relations counsel is serving a very useful pur pose in business by acting as a complement to legitimate advertisers and adver- tising in helping to break down unfair competitive exaggerated and overemphatic advertising by reach- ing the public with the trut h through other channels than advertising. Where two competitors in a field are fighting each other with this type of advertising, they are undermining that particular industry to a 79"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Propaganda point where the public may lose confidence in the whole industry. The only way to combat such unethical methods, is for ethical members of the in- dustry to use the weapon of propaganda in order to bring out the basic trut hs of the situation. Take the case of tooth pa ste, for instance. Here is a highly competitive field in which the preponder- ance of public acceptance of one product over another can very legitimately rest in inherent values. How- ever, what has happened in this field? One or two of the large manufacturers have as- serted advantages for th eir tooth pastes which no single tooth paste discovere d up to the present time can possibly have. The competing manufacturer is put in the position either of overemphasizing an al- ready exaggerated emphasis or of letting the over- emphasis of his competitor take away his markets. He turns to the weapon of propaganda which can effectively, through various channels of approach to the public—the dental clin ics, the schools, the women's clubs, the medical colleges, the dental press and even the daily press—bring to the public the truth of what a tooth paste can do. This will, of course, have its effect in making the honestly adver- tised tooth paste get to its real public. Propaganda is potent in meeting unethical or un- fair advertising. Effectiv e advertising has become more costly than ever before. Years ago, when the country was smaller and there was no tremendous 80"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Business and the Public advertising machinery, it was comparatively easy to get country-wide recognition for a product. A corps of traveling salesmen might persuade the retailers, with a few cigars and a re pertory of funny stories, to display and recommend their article on a nation- wide scale. To-day, a small industry is swamped unless it can find appropria te and relatively inex- pensive means of making known the special virtues of its product, while larg er industries have sought to overcome the difficulty by cooperative advertising, in which associations of i ndustries compete with other associations. Mass advertising has produced new kinds of com- petition. Competition between rival products in the same line is, of course, as old as economic life itself. In recent years much has been said of the new com- petition, we have discussed it in a previous chapter, between one group of products and another. Stone competes against wood for building; linoleum against carpets; oranges against appl es; tin against asbestos for roofing. This type of competit ion has been humorously illustrated by Mr. O. H. Cheney, Vice-President of the American Exchange and Irving Trust Company of New York, in a speech before the Chicago Busi- ness Secretaries Forum. \"Do you represent the millinery trades?\" said Mr. Cheney. \"The man at your side may serve the fur industry, and by promoting the style of big fur col- 81"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Propaganda lars on women's coats he is ruining the hat business by forcing women to wear small and inexpensive hats.

The old competi- tion was that between the members of each trade organization. One phase of the new competition is that between the trade associations themselves—be- tween you gentlemen who represent those industries. Inter-commodity competition is the new competition between products used alte rnatively for the same purpose. Inter-industrial competition is the new competition between apparently unrelated industries which affect each other or between such industries as compete for the consumer's dollar—and that means practically all industries. . . . \"Inter-commodity competition is, of course, the 82"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Business and the Public most spectacular of all. It is the one which seems most of all to have caught the business imagination of the country. More and more business men are beginning to appreciate what inter-commodity com- petition means to them. More and more they are calling upon their trade associ ations to help them— because inter-commodity competition cannot be fought single-handed. \"Take the great war on the dining-room table, for instance. Three times a day practically every dining- room table in the country is the scene of a fierce battle in the new competi tion. Shall we have prunes for breakfast? No, cry the embattled orange-grow- ers and the massed legions of pineapple canners. Shall we eat sauerkraut? Why not eat green olives? is the answer of the Spaniards. Eat macaroni as a change from potatoes, says one advertiser—and will the potato growers take this challenge lying down? \"The doctors and dietitian s tell us that a normal hard-working man needs only about two or three thousand calories of food a day. A banker, I sup- pose, needs a little less. But what am I to do? The fruit growers, the wheat raisers, the meat packers, the milk producers, the fishermen—all want me to eat more of their products—and are spending mil- lions of dollars a year to convince me.

The new competition is probably keenest in the food industries because there we have a very real limitation on what we can consume—in spite of higher incomes and higher living standards, we can- not eat more than we can eat.\" I believe that competition in the future will not be only an advertising competition between individual products or between big asso ciations, but that it will in addition be a competition of propaganda. The business man and advertising man is realizing that he must not discard entirel y the methods of Barnum in reaching the public. An example in the annals of George Harrison Phelps, of the successful utilization of this type of appeal was the nation-wide hook-up which announced the launching of the Dodge Victory Six car. Millions of people, it is estimated, listened in to this program broadcast ove r 47 stations. The ex- pense was more than $60,000. The arrangements involved an additional telephonic hook-up of 20,000 miles of wire, and include d transmission from Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and New York. Al Jolson did his bit from New Orleans, Will Rogers from Beverly Hills, Fred and Dorothy Stone from Chicago, and Paul Whiteman from New York, at an aggregate artists' fee of $25,000. And 84"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Business and the Public there was included a fou r-minute address by the president of Dodge Brot hers announcing the new car, which gave him access in four minutes to an es- timated audience of thirty million Americans, the largest number, unquestionabl y, ever to concentrate their attention on a given commercial product at a given moment. It was a sugar-coated sales message. Modern sales technicians will object: \"What you say of this method of appeal is true. But it increases the cost of getting the manu facturer's message across. The modern tendency has been to reduce this cost (for example, the elimination of premiums) and con- centrate on getting full efficiency from the advertis- ing expenditure. If you hire a Galli-Curci to sing for bacon you increase the cost of the bacon by the amount of her very large fee. Her voice adds noth- ing to the product but it adds to its cost.\" Undoubtedly. But all modes of sales appeal re- quire the spending of money to make the appeal at- tractive. The advertiser in print adds to the cost of his message by the use of pictures or by the cost of getting distinguished endorsements. There is another kind of difficulty, created in the process of big business getting bigger, which calls for new modes of establishing contact with the public. Quantity production offers a standardized product the cost of which tends to diminish with the quantity sold. If low price is the only basis of competition with rival products, simila rly produced, there ensues 85"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Propaganda a cut-throat competition which can end only by taking all the profit and incenti ve out of the industry. The logical way out of this dilemma is for the manufacturer to develop some sales appeal other than mere cheapness, to give the product, in the public mind, some other attraction, some idea that will modify the product slightly, some element of originality that will disti nguish it from products in the same line. Thus, a manufacturer of typewriters paints his machines in cheerful hues. These special types of appeal can be popularized by the manipula- tion of the principles familiar to the propagandist— the principles of gregarious ness, obedience to author- ity, emulation, and the like. A minor element can be made to assume economic importance by being established in the public mi nd as a matter of style. Mass production can be sp lit up. Big business will still leave room for small business. Next to a huge department store there may be located a tiny spe- cialty shop which makes a very good living. The problem of bringing large hats back into fashion was undertaken by a propagandist. The mil- linery industry two years ago was menaced by the prevalence of the simple felt hat which was crowd- ing out the manufacture of a ll other kinds of hats and hat ornaments. It was found that hats could roughly be classified in six types. It was found too that four groups might help to change hat fashions: the society leader, the style expert, the fashion editor and writer, 86"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Business and the Public the artist who might give artistic approval to the styles, and beautiful mannequins. The problem, then, was to bring these groups together before an audience of hat buyers. A committee of prominent artists was organized to choose the most beautiful girls in New York to wear, in a series of tablea ux, the most beautiful hats in the style classifications, at a fashion fete at a lead- ing hotel. A committee was formed of distinguished Ameri- can women who, on the basis of their intere st in the development of an American industry, were willing to add the authority of their names to the idea. A style committee was formed of editors of fashion magazines and other prominent fashion authorities who were willing to support the idea. The girls in their lovely hats and costumes paraded on the run- ning-board before an audi ence of the entire trade. The news of the event affected the buying habits not only of the onlookers, but also of the women throughout the country. The story of the event was flashed to the consumer by her newspaper as well as by the advertisements of her favorite store. Broad- sides went to the millinery buyer from the manu- facturer. One manufacturer stated that whereas be- fore the show he had not sold any large trimmed hats, after it he had sold thousands.

The directors met in Detroit at 12:30, New York time, to act on a dividend. Almost im- mediately a false report that only the regular dividend had been declared was circulated. At 12:46 the Dow, Jones & Co. ticker service received the report from the Stock Exchange firm and its publication re sulted in further drop in the stock. Shortly after 1 o'clock the ticker services re- ceived official news that the dividend had been increased and a 20 per cent stock distribution authorized. They rushed the correct news out on their tickers and Hudson stock immediately jumped more than 6 points. 88"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Business and the Public A clipping from the Journal of Commerce of April 4, 1925, is reproduced here as an interesting ex- ample of a method to counteract a false rumor: BEECH-NUT HEAD HOME TOWN GUEST Bartlett Arkell Signally Honored by Com- munities of Mohawk Valley {Special to The J ournal of Commerce) C ANAJOHARIE , N. Y., April 3.—To-day was 'Beech-Nut Day' in this town; in fact, for the whole Mohawk Valley. Business men and prac- tically the whole community of this region joined in a personal testimonial to Bartlett Arkell of New York City, president of the Beech-Nut Packing Compa ny of this city, in honor of his firm refusal to consider selling his company to other financ ial interests to move elsewhere. When Mr. Arkell publicly denied recent rumors that he was to sell his company to the Postum Cereal Company for $17,000,000, which would have resulted in taking the indus- try from its birthplace, he did so in terms con- spicuously loyal to his boyhood home, which he has built up into a prosperous industrial com- munity through thirty year s' management of his Beech-Nut Company.

More than 3,000 people participated, headed by a committee comprising W. J. Roser, chair- man; B. F. Spraker, H. V. Bush, B. F. Diefen- dorf and J. H. Cook. They were backed by the Canajoharie and the Mohawk Valley Chambers of Business Men's Associations. Of course, every one reali zed after this that there was no truth in the rumor that the Beech-Nut Com- pany was in the market. A denial would not have carried as much conviction. Amusement, too, is a business—one of the largest in America. It was the amusement business—first the circus and the medicine show, then the theater— which taught the rudiments of advertising to indus- try and commerce. The la tter adopted the ballyhoo of the show business. But under the stress of prac- tical experience it adapted and refined these crude advertising methods to the precise ends it sought to obtain.

The dogma that the voice of th e people is the voice of God tends to make elected persons the will-less serv- ants of their constituents. This is undoubtedly part cause of the political sterility of which certain Amer- ican critics constantly complain. No serious sociologist a ny longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people ex- presses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it be- lieves and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opini on. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and cliches and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders. Fortunately, the sincere and gifted politician is able, by the instrument of propaganda, to mold and form the will of the people. Disraeli cynically expressed the dilemma, when he said: \"I must follow the people. Am I not their leader?\" He might have a dded: \"I must lead the people. Am I not their servant?\" 92"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership Unfortunately, the methods of our contemporary- politicians, in dealing with the public, are as archaic and ineffective as the advertising methods of busi- ness in 1900 would be to-day. While politics was the first important departme nt of American life to use propaganda on a large scale, it has been the slowest in modifying its propaganda methods to meet the changed conditions of the public mind. American business first learned from politics the methods of appealing to the broad public. But it continually im- proved those methods in the course of its competi- tive struggle, while politics clung to the old formulas. The political apathy of the average voter, of which we hear so much, is undoubtedly due to the fact that the politician does not know how to meet the conditions of the public mind. He cannot drama- tize himself and his platform in terms which have real meaning to the public. Acting on the fallacy that the leader must slavishly follow, he deprives his campaign of all dramatic interest. An automaton cannot arouse the public inte rest. A leader , a fighter, a dictator, can. But, given our present political con- ditions under which every office seeker must cater to the vote of the masses, the only means by which the born leader can lead is the expert use of propa- ganda.

The successful business man to-day apes the poli- tician. He has adopted th e glitter and the ballyhoo of the campaign. He has se t up all the side shows. He has annual dinners that are a compendium of speeches, flags, bombast, stateliness, pseudo-democ- racy slightly tinged with paternalism. On occasion he doles out honors to employees, much as the re- public of classic times re warded its worthy citizens. But these are merely the side shows, the drums, of big business, by which it builds up an image of public service, and of honorary service. This is but one of the methods by which business stimulates loyal enthusiasms on the part of directors, the work- ers, the stockholders and the consumer public. It is one of the methods by which big business performs its function of making and selling products to the public. The real work and campaign of business con- sists of intensive study of the public, the manufac- ture of products based on this study, and exhaustive use of every means of reaching the public. Political campaigns to-day are all side shows, all honors, all bombast, glitter, and speeches. These are for the most part unrelated to the main business of studying the public scientif ically, of supplying the public with party, candidate, platform, and perform- 94"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership ance, and selling the public these ideas and products. Politics was the first big business in America. Therefore there is a good d eal of irony in the fact that business has learned ev erything that politics has had to teach, but th at politics has failed to learn very much from business methods of mass distribution of ideas and products. Emily Newell Blair has recounted in the Inde- pendent a typical instance of the waste of effort and money in a political campai gn, a week's speaking tour in which she herself took part. She estimates that on a five-day trip covering nearly a thousand miles she and the United States Senator with whom she was making political speeches addressed no more than 1,105 persons whose votes might conceivably have been changed as a result of their efforts. The cost of this appeal to these voters she estimates (calculat- ing the value of the time spent on a very moderate basis) as $15.27 for each vote which might have been changed as a result of the campaign. This, she says, was a \"drive for votes, just as an Ivory Soap advertising campaign is a drive for sales.\" But, she asks, \"wha t would a company execu- tive say to a sales manager who sent a high-priced speaker to describe his product to less than 1,200 people at a cost of $15.27 for each possible buyer?\" She finds it \"amazing that the very men who make their millions out of cleverly devised drives for soap and bonds and cars will tu rn around and give large 95"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Propaganda contributions to be expended for vote-getting in an utterly inefficient and antiquated fashion.\" It is, indeed, incomprehens ible that politicians do not make use of the elaborate business methods that industry has built up. B ecause a politician knows political strategy, can develop campaign issues, can devise strong planks for platforms and envisage broad policies, it does not follow that he can be given the responsibility of se lling ideas to a public as large as that of the United States. The politician understands the public. He knows what the public wants and what the public will accept. But the politician is not n ecessarily a general sales manager, a public relations counsel, or a man who knows how to secure mass distribution of ideas. Obviously, an occasional political leader may be capable of combining every f eature of leadership, just as in business there are ce rtain brilliant industrial leaders who are financiers, fa ctory directors, engineers, sales managers and public relations counsel all rolled into one. Big business is conducted on the principle that it must prepare its policies car efully, and that in sell- ing an idea to the large buying public of America, it must proceed according to broad plans. The politi- cal strategist must do likewise. The entire campaign should be worked out according to broad basic plans. Platforms, planks, pledges, budgets, activities, personalities, must be as carefully studied, appor- 96"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership tioned and used as they are when big business de- sires to get what it wants from the public. The first step in a political campaign is to deter- mine on the objectives, and to express them exceed- ingly well in the current fo rm—that is, as a platform. In devising the platform th e leader should be sure that it is an honest plat form. Campaign pledges and promises should not be lightly considered by the pub- lic, and they ought to carry something of the guaran- tee principle and money-b ack policy that an honor- able business institution carries with the sale of its goods. The public has lost faith in campaign pro- motion work. It does not say that politicians are dishonorable, but it does say that campaign pledges are written on the sand. Here then is one fact of public opinion of which the party that wishes to be successful might well take cognizance. To aid in the preparation of the platform there should be made as nearly scientific an analysis as pos- sible of the public and of the needs of the public. A survey of public desires and demands would come to the aid of the political strate gist whose business it is to make a proposed plan of th e activities of the parties and its elected officials during the coming terms of office. A big business that wants to sell a product to the public surveys and analyzes its market before it takes a single step either to make or to sell the product. If one section of the community is absolutely sold to 97"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Propaganda the idea of this product, no money is wasted in re- selling it to it. If, on the other hand, another sec- tion of the public is irrevocably committed to another product, no money is wasted on a lost cause. Very often the analysis is the cause of basic changes and improvements in the product itself, as well as an index of how it is to be presented. So carefully is this analysis of markets and sales made that when a com- pany makes out its sales budget for the year, it sub- divides the circulations of the various magazines and newspapers it uses in advertising and calculates with a fair degree of accuracy how many times a section of that population is subject ed to the appeal of the company. It knows approximately to what extent a national campaign duplicates and repeats the em- phasis of a local campaign of selling. As in the business field, th e expenses of the politi- cal campaign should be budgeted. A large business to-day knows exactly how much money it is going to spend on propaganda during the next year or years. It knows that a certain per centage of its gross re- ceipts will be given over to advertising—newspaper, magazine, outdoor and poster; a certain percentage to circularization and sales promotion—such as house organs and dealer aids; and a certain percentage must go to the supervising salesmen who travel around the country to infuse extra stimulus in the local sales campaign. A political campaign should be similarly budg- 98"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership eted. The first question which should be decided is the amount of money that should be raised for the campaign. This decision can be reached by a care- ful analysis of campai gn costs. There is enough precedent in business procedur e to enable experts to work this out accurately. Then the second question of importance is the manne r in which money should be raised. It is obvious that politics would gain much in pres- tige if the money-raising campaign were conducted candidly and publicly, like the campaigns for the war funds. Charity drives might be made excellent models for political funds drives. The elimina- tion of the little black bag element in politics would raise the entire prestige of politics in America, and the public interest would be infinitely greater if the actual participation occurred earlier and more con- structively in the campaign. Again, as in the business field, there should be a clear decision as to how the money is to be spent. This should be done according to the most careful and exact budgeting, wherein every step in the cam- paign is given its proportionate importance, and the funds allotted accordingly. Advertising in news- papers and periodicals, poste rs and street banners, the exploitation of personali ties in motion pictures, in speeches and lectures and m eetings, spectacular events and all forms of propaganda should be considered proportionately according to the budget, and should 99"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Propaganda always be coordinated with the whole plan. Certain expenditures may be warranted if they represent a small proportion of the budget and may be totally unwarranted if they make up a large proportion of the budget. In the same way the emotions by which the public is appealed to may be made part of the broad plan of the campaign. Unrelated emotions become maud- lin and sentimental too easily, are often costly, and too often waste effort becau se the idea is not part of the conscious and coherent whole. Big business has realized that it must use as many of the basic emotions as possible. The politician, however, has used the emotions aroused by words almost exclusively. To appeal to the emotions of the public in a politi- cal campaign is sound—in fact it is an indispensable part of the campaign. But the emotional content must— (a) coincide in every way with the broad basic plans of the campaign a nd all its minor details; (b) be adapted to the many groups of the public at which it is to be aimed; and (c) conform to the media of the distribution of ideas. The emotions of oratory have been worn down through long years of overuse. Parades, mass meet- ings, and the like are successful when the public has a frenzied emotional interest in the event. The can- 100"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership didate who takes babies on his lap, and has his photo- graph taken, is doing a wise thing emotionally, if this act epitomizes a definite pl ank in his platform. Kiss- ing babies, if it is worth a nything, must be used as a symbol for a baby policy and it must be synchronized with a plank in the platform. But the haphazard staging of emotional events without regard to their value as part of the whole campaign, is a waste of effort, just as it would be a waste of effort for the manufacturer of hockey skat es to advertise a picture of a church surrounded by spring foliage. It is true that the church appeals to our religious impulses and that everybody loves the sp ring, but these impulses do not help to sell the id ea that hockey skates are amusing, helpful, or increase the general enjoyment of life for the buyer. Present-day politics places emphasis on personality. An entire party, a platform , an international policy is sold to the public, or is not sold, on the basis of the intangible element of pe rsonality. A charming can- didate is the alchemist's s ecret that can transmute a prosaic platform into the gold of votes. Helpful as is a candidate who for some reason has caught the imagination of the country, the party and its aims are certainly more important than the personality of the candidate. Not personality, but the ability of the candidate to carry out the party's program ade- quately, and the program itself should be empha- sized in a sound campaign plan. Even Henry Ford, 101"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Propaganda the most picturesque personality in business in America to-day, has become known through his product, and not his product through him. It is essential for the campaign manager to educate the emotions in terms of groups. The public is not made up merely of Democrats and Republicans. People to-day are largely uni nterested in politics and their interest in the issues of the campaign must be secured by coordinating it with their personal in- terests. The public is made up of interlocking groups —economic, social, religious , educational, cultural, racial, collegiate, local, sports, and hundreds of others. When President Coolidge invited actors for break- fast, he did so because he re alized not only that actors were a group, but that a udiences, the large group of people who like amusements, who like people who amuse them, and who like people who can be amused, ought to be aligned with him. The Shepard-Towner Maternity Bill was passed because the people who fought to secure its passage realized that mothers ma de up a group, that educa- tors made up a group, that physicians made up a group, that all these groups in turn influence other groups, and that taken all t ogether these groups were sufficiently strong and nume rous to impress Congress with the fact that the peopl e at large wanted this bill to be made part of the national law. The political campaign having defined its broad 102"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership objects and its basic plans, having defined the group appeal which it must use, mu st carefully allocate to each of the media at hand the work which it can do with maximum efficiency. The media through which a political campaign may be brought home to the public are numerous and fairly well defined. Events and activities must be created in order to put ideas into circulation, in these channels, which are as varied as the means of human communication. Every object which presents pic- tures or words that the public can see, everything that presents intelligible sounds, can be utilized in one way or another. At present, the political campaigner uses for the greatest part the radio, th e press, the banquet hall, the mass meeting, the lecture platform, and the stump generally as a means for furthering his ideas. But this is only a small pa rt of what may be done. Actually there are infinitely more varied events that can be created to dramatize the campaign, and to make people talk of it. Exhibitions , contests, institutes of politics, the cooperation of educational institutions, the dramatic cooperation of groups which hith- erto have not been drawn into active politics, and many others may be made th e vehicle for the presen- tation of ideas to the public. But whatever is done must be synchronized accu- rately with all other form s of appeal to the public. News reaches the public through the printed word— 103"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Propaganda books, magazines, letters, pos ters, circulars and ban- ners, newspapers; throu gh pictures—photographs and motion pictures; through the ear—lectures, speeches, band music, radio, campaign songs. All these must be employed by the political party if it is to succeed. One method of appeal is merely one method of ap- peal and in this age wherein a thousand movements and ideas are competing for public attention, one dare not put all one's eggs into one basket. It is understood that the methods of propaganda can be effective only with the voter who makes up his own mind on the basis of his group prejudices and desires. Where specific alle giances and loyalties exist, as in the case of boss lead ership, these loyalties will operate to nullify the free will of the voter. In this close relation between the boss and his constituents lies, of course, the strength of his position in politics. It is not necessary for the politician to be the slave of the public's group prejudices, if he can learn how to mold the mind of the voters in conformity with his own ideas of public welfar e and public service. The important thing for the statesman of our age is not so much to know how to please the public, but to know how to sway the public. In theory, this educa- tion might be done by mean s of learned pamphlets explaining the intricacies of public questions. In actual fact, it can be done only by meeting the con- ditions of the public mind, by creating circumstances which set up trains of thought, by dramatizing per- 104"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership sonalities, by establishi ng contact with the group leaders who control the op inions of their publics. But campaigning is only an incident in political life. The process of govern ment is continuous. And the expert use of propaganda is more useful and fun- damental, although less striki ng, as an aid to demo- cratic administration, than as an aid to vote getting. Good government can be sold to a community just as any other commodity can be sold. I often wonder whether the politicians of the future, who are re- sponsible for maintaining th e prestige and effective- ness of their party, will not endeavor to train poli- ticians who are at the same time propagandists. I talked recently with George Olvany. He said that a certain number of Princeton men were joining Tam- many Hall. If I were in his place I should have taken some of my brightest young men and set them to work for Broadway theatrical productions or ap- prenticed them as assistants to professional propa- gandists before recruiting th em to the service of the party. One reason, perhaps, why the politician to-day is slow to take up methods which are a commonplace in business life is that he has such ready entry to the media of communication on which his power depends. The newspaper man looks to him for news. And by his power of giving or withholding information the politician can often effectively censor political news. But being dependent, every day of the year 105"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Propaganda and for year after year, upon certain politicians for news, the newspaper reporters are obliged to work in harmony with their news sources. The political leader must be a creator of circum- stances, not only a creature of mechanical processes of stereotyping and rubber stamping. Let us suppose that he is campaigning on a low- tariff platform. He may use the modern mechanism of the radio to spread his views, but he will almost certainly use the psychologi cal method of approach which was old in Andrew Jackson's day, and which business has largely discarded. He will say over the radio: \"Vote for me and low tariff, because the high tariff increases the cost of the things you buy.\" He may, it is true, have the grea t advantage of being able to speak by radio directly to fifty million listeners. But he is making an old-fashioned approach. He is arguing with them. He is assaulting, single-handed, the resistance of inertia. If he were a propagandist, on the other hand, al- though he would still use the radio, he would use it as one instrument of a well-planned strategy. Since he is campaigning on the issue of a low tariff, he not merely would tell peopl e that the high tariff in- creases the cost of the things they buy, but would create circumstances which would make his conten- tion dramatic and self-evident. He would perhaps stage a low-tariff exhibition simultaneously in twenty cities, with exhibits illu strating the additional cost 106"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership due to the tariff in force. He would see that these exhibitions were ceremoniously inaugurated by prom- inent men and women who were interested in a low tariff apart from any interest in his personal political fortunes. He would have groups, whose interests were especially affected by the high cost of living, institute an agitation for lower schedules. He would dramatize the issue, perhaps by having prominent men boycott woolen clothe s, and go to important functions in cotton suits, unt il the wool schedule was reduced. He might get the opinion of social workers as to whether the high co st of wool endangers the health of the poor in winter. In whatever ways he dramatized the issue, the at- tention of the public would be attracted to the ques- tion before he addressed them personally. Then, when he spoke to his millions of listeners on the radio, he would not be seeking to force an argument down the throats of a public thinking of other things and annoyed by another demand on its attention; on the contrary, he would be answering the spontaneous questions and expressing the emotional demands of a public already keyed to a certain pitch of interest in the subject. The importance of taking the entire world public into consideration before planning an important event is shown by the wise action of Thomas Masaryk, then Provisional President, now President of the Republic of Czecho-Slovakia. 107"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Propaganda Czecho-Slovakia officially became a free state on Monday, October 28, 1918, instead of Sunday, October 27, 1918, because Professor Masaryk real- ized that the people of the world would receive more information and would be more receptive to, the an- nouncement of the republic's freedom on a Monday morning than on a Sunday, because the press would have more space to devote to it on Monday morning. Discussing the matter with me before he made the announcement, Professor Masaryk said, \"I would be making history for the cables if I changed the date of Czecho-Slovakia's birth as a free nation.\" Cables make history and so the date was changed. This incident illustrates the importance of tech- nique in the new propaganda. It will be objected, of c ourse, that propaganda will tend to defeat itself as its mechanism becomes obvi- ous to the public. My opini on is that it will not. The only propaganda which wi ll ever tend to weaken itself as the world becomes more sophisticated and intelligent, is propaganda that is untrue or unsocial. Again, the objection is rais ed that propaganda is utilized to manufacture our leading poli tical person- alities. It is asked whether, in fact, the leader makes propaganda, or whether propaganda makes the leader. There is a wide spread impression that a good press agent can puff up a nobody into a great man. The answer is the same as that made to the old 108"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership query as to whether the newspaper makes public opinion or whether public opinion makes the news- paper. There has to be fertile ground for the leader and the idea to fall on. But the leader also has to have some vital seed to sow. To use another figure, a mutual need has to exist before either can become positively effective. Propaganda is of no use to the politician unless he has something to say which the public, consciously or unconsciously, wants to hear. But even supposing that a certain propaganda is untrue or dishonest, we cannot on that account re- ject the methods of propaganda as such. For propa- ganda in some form will always be used where lead- ers need to appeal to their constituencies. The criticism is often ma de that propaganda tends to make the President of the United States so im- portant that he becomes not the President but the embodiment of the idea of hero worship, not to say deity worship. I quite agree that this is so, but how are you going to stop a condition which very accu- rately reflects the desires of a certain part of the public? The American people rightly senses the enormous importance of the executive's office. If the public tends to make of the President a heroic symbol of that power, that is not the fault of propaganda but lies in the very nature of the office and its relation to the people. This condition, despite its somewhat irrational puff- ing up of the man to fit the office, is perhaps still 109"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Propaganda more sound than a condition in which the man utilizes no propaganda, or a propaganda not adapted to its proper end. Note the example of the Prince of Wales. This young man reaped bales of clippings and little additional glory from his American visit, merely because he was poorly advised.

Nothing was done to add dignity and prestige to this impres- sion until towards the end of his stay he made a trip in the subway of New York. This sole venture into democracy and the serious bus iness of living as evi- denced in the daily habits of workers, aroused new interest in the Prince. Ha d he been properly advised he would have augmented this somewhat by such serious studies of American life as were made by an- other prince, Gustave of Sweden. As a result of the lack of well directed propa ganda, the Prince of Wales became in the eyes of the American people, not the thing which he constitutionally is, a symbol of the unity of the British Empire , but part and parcel of sporting Long Island and dancing beauties of the ballroom. Great Britain lo st an invaluable oppor- tunity to increase the good will and understanding between the two countries when it failed to under- stand the importance of corre ct public relations coun- sel for His Royal Highness.

A political practice which has its roots in the tendency of the popular leader to follow oftener than he leads is the technique of the trial balloon which he uses in order to maintain, as he believes, his contact with the public. The politician, of course, has his ear to the ground. It might be called the clinical ear. It touches the ground and hears the disturbances of the political universe. But he often does not know what the disturbances mean, whether they are supe rficial, or fundamental. So he sends up his balloon. He may send out an anonymous interview through the press. He then waits for reverberations to come from the public—a public which expresses itsel f in mass meetings, or resolutions, or telegrams, or even such obvious mani- festations as editorials in the partisan or nonpartisan press. On the basis of these repercussions he then publicly adopts his original tentative policy, or rejects it, or modifies it to conform to the sum of public opinion which has reached him. This method is modeled on the peace feelers which were used during the war to sound out the disposition of the enemy to make peace or to test any one of a dozen other popu- lar tendencies.

The whole basis of successful propaganda is to have an objective and then to endeavor to arrive at it through an exact knowledge of the public and modifying circum- stances to manipulate and sway that public. \"The function of a statesman,\" says George Ber- nard Shaw, \"is to express th e will of the people in the way of a scientist.\" The political leader of to -day should be a leader as finely versed in the technique of propaganda as in political economy and civics . If he remains merely the reflection of the averag e intelligence of his com- munity, he might as well go out of politics. If one is dealing with a democracy in which the herd and the group follow those whom they recognize as leaders, why should not the young me n training for leader- ship be trained in its technique as well as in its idealism? \"When the interval between the intellectual classes and the practical classes is too great,\" says the his- torian Buckle, \"the former will possess no influence, the latter will reap no benefits.\" 112"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Propaganda and Political Leadership Propaganda bridges this interval in our modern complex civilization. Only through the wise us e of propaganda will our government, considered as the continuous administra- tive organ of the people, be able to maintain that inti- mate relationship with the public which is necessary in a democracy. As David Lawrence pointed out in a recent speech, there is need for an intelligent interpretative bureau for our government in Washington. There is, it is true, a Division of Current Information in the De- partment of State, which at first was headed by a trained newspaper man. But later this position began to be filled by men from the diplomatic service, men who had very little know ledge of the public. While some of these diplomats have done very well, Mr. Lawrence asserted that in the long run the country would be benefited if the functions of this office were in the hands of a different type of person. There should, I believe, be an Assistant Secretary of State who is familiar with the problem of dis- pensing information to the press—some one upon whom the Secretary of State can call for consulta- tion and who has sufficient au thority to persuade the Secretary of State to make public that which, for in- sufficient reason, is suppressed.

He would, in short, interp ret the people to the gov- ernment and the government to the people. Such an official would be neither a propagandist nor a press agent, in the ordi nary understanding of those terms. He would be, rather, a trained technician who would be helpful in analyzing public thought and public trends, in orde r to keep the government informed about the public, and the people informed about the government. Amer ica's relations with South America and with Europe would be greatly improved under such circumstances. Ours must be a leadership democracy administered by the intelli- gent minority who know how to regiment and guide the masses. Is this government by propa ganda? Call it, if you prefer, government by educa tion. But education, in the academic sense of the word, is not sufficient. It must be enlightened expe rt propaganda through the creation of circumstances, through the high-spotting of significant events, and the dramatization of im- portant issues.

This does not mean that their activities are identic al with those of men. Women in the mass still have special interests and activities in addition to their economic pursuits and vocational interests. Women's most obvious infl uence is exerted when they are organized and ar med with the weapon of propaganda. So organized and armed they have made their influence felt on city councils, state legisla- tures, and national congre sses, upon executives, upon political campaigns and upon public opinion gener- ally, both local and national. In politics, the American women to-day occupy a much more important position, from the standpoint of their influence, in th eir organized groups than from the standpoint of the leadership they have ac- quired in actual political positions or in actual office holding. The professional woman politician has had, up to the present, not much influence, nor do women generally regard her as bei ng the most important ele- ment in question.

If the suffrage campaign did nothing more, it showed the possibilities of propaganda to achieve cer- tain ends. This propaganda to-day is being utilized by women to achieve their programs in Washington and in the states. In Washington they are organized as the Legislative Committee of Fourteen Women's Organizations, including the League of Women Voters, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Fed- eration of Women's Clubs, et c. These organizations map out a legislative program and then use the mod- ern technique of propaganda to make this legislative program actually pass into the law of the land. Their accomplishments in the field are various. They can justifiably take the credit for much welfare legisla- tion. The eight-hour day for women is theirs. Undoubtedly prohibition and its enforcement are theirs, if they can be cons idered an accomplishment. So is the Shepard-Towner Bi ll which stipulates sup- port by the central government of maternity welfare in the state governments. This bill would not have passed had it not been for the political prescience and sagacity of women like Mrs. Vanderlip and Mrs. Mitchell. The Federal measures endor sed at the first con- vention of the National League of Women Voters typify social welfare activities of women's organiza- 116"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Women's Activities and Propaganda tions. These covered such broad interests as child welfare, education, the home and high prices, women in gainful occupations, public health and morals, in- dependent citizenship for married women, and others. To propagandize these principles, the National League of Women Voters has published all types of literature, such as bulletins, calendars, election in- formation, has held a correspondence course on gov- ernment and conducted demons tration classes and citi- zenship schools. Possibly the effectiveness of women's organizations in American politics to-day is due to two things: first, the training of a pr ofessional class of executive secretaries or legislative secretaries during the suf- frage campaigns, where every device known to the propagandist had to be used to regiment a recalcitrant majority; secondly, the routing over into peace- time activities of the many prominent women who were in the suffrage campaigns and who also de- voted themselves to the important drives and mass influence movements during the war. Such women as Mrs. Frank Vanderlip, Alice Ames Winter, Mrs. Henry Moskowitz, Mrs. Florence Kelley, Mrs. John Blair, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Doris Stevens, Alice Paul come to mind. If I have seemed to concentrate on the accomplish- ments of women in politics, it is because they afford a particularly striking exam ple of intelligent use of the new propaganda to secure attention and acceptance 117"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Propaganda of minority ideas. It is pe rhaps curiously appropriate that the latest recruits to the political arena should recognize and make use of the newest weapons of persuasion to offset any lack of experience with what is somewhat euphemistically termed practical poli- tics. As an example of this new technique: Some years ago, the Consumer s' Committee of Women, fighting the \"American valuation\" tariff, rented an empty store on Fifty-seventh Street in New York and set up an exhibit of mercha ndise tagging each item with the current price and th e price it would cost if the tariff went through. H undreds of visitors to this shop rallied to the cause of the committee. But there are also non-pol itical fields in which women can make and have made their influence felt for social ends, and in whic h they have utilized the principle of group leadership in attaini ng the desired objectives. In the General Federation of Women's Clubs, there are 13,000 clubs. Broadl y classified, they in- clude civic and city clubs, mothers' and homemakers' clubs, cultural clubs devoted to art, music or litera- ture, business and professional women's clubs, and general women's clubs, which may embrace either civic or community phases, or combine some of the other activities listed. The woman's club is generally effective on behalf of health education; in fu rthering appreciation of the fine arts; in sponsoring le gislation that affects the 118"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Women s Activities and Propaganda welfare of women and children; in playground de- velopment and park improvement; in raising stand- ards of social or political morality; in homemaking. and home economics, education and the like. In these fields, the woman's club concerns itself with efforts that are not ordina rily covered by existing agencies, and often both initiates and helps to fur- ther movements for the good of the community. A club interested princi pally in homemaking and the practical arts can s ponsor a cooking school for young brides and others. An example of the keen interest of women in this field of education is the cooking school recently c onducted by the New York Herald Tribune, which held its classes in Carnegie Hall, seating almost 3,000 persons. For the several days of the cooking school, the hall was filled to capacity, rivaling the draw ing power of a McCor- mack or a Paderewski, a nd refuting most dramat- ically the idea that women in large cities are not interested in housewifery. A movement for the serving of milk in public schools, or the establishmen t of a baby health sta- tion at the department of he alth will be an effort close to the heart of a club devoted to the interest of mothers and child welfare. A music club can broaden its sphere and be of service to the community by cooperating with the local radio station in arranging better musical pro- grams.

An art club can be active in securing loan exhibi- tions for its city. It can also arrange travelling ex- hibits of the art work of its members or show the art work of schools or universities. A literary club may step out of its charmed circle of lectures and literary lions and take a definite part in the educational life of the community. It can sponsor, for instance, a co mpetition in the public schools for the best essay on the history of the city, or on the life of its most famous son. Over and above the particular object for which the woman's club may have been constituted, it commonly stands ready to initiate or help any movement which has for its object a distin ct public good in the com- munity. More important, it constitutes an organized channel through which women can make themselves felt as a definite pa rt of public opinion. Just as women supplement men in private life, so they will supplement men in public life by concen- trating their organized effo rts on those objects which men are likely to ignore. There is a tremendous field for women as active prota gonists of new ideas and new methods of political and social housekeeping. When organized and conscious of their power to in- fluence their surroundings, women can use their newly acquired freedom in a great many ways to mold the world into a better place to live in. 120"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA FOR EDUCATION E DUCATION is not securing its proper share of pub- lic interest. The public school system, materially and financially, is being ade quately supported. There is marked eagerness for a college education, and a vague aspiration for culture, expressed in innumer- able courses and lectures. The public is not cognizant of the real value of edu cation, and does not realize that education as a social force is not receiving the kind of attention it has the right to expect in a democ- racy. It is felt, for example, that education is entitled to more space in the newspapers; that well informed discussion of education hardly exists; that unless such an issue as the Gary School system is created, or out- side of an occasional discussion, such as that aroused over Harvard's decision to establish a sc hool of busi- ness, education does not attract the active interest of the public. There are a number of reasons for this condition. First of all, there is the fact that the educator has been trained to stimulate to thought the individual students in his classroom, but has not been trained as an educator at large of the public. 121"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Propaganda In a democracy an educator should, in addition to his academic duties, bear a definite and wholesome relation to the general public. This public does not come within the immediate scope of his academic du- ties. But in a sense he depends upon it for his liv- ing, for the moral support, and the general cultural tone upon which his work must be based. In the field of education, we fi nd what we have found in politics and other fields—t hat the evolution of the practitioner of the profession has not kept pace with the social evolution around him, and is out of gear with the instruments for the dissemination of ideas which modern society has developed. If this be true, then the training of the educators in this re- spect should begin in the normal schools, with the addition to their curricula of whatever is necessary to broaden their viewpoint. The public cannot un- derstand unless the teache r understands the relation- ship between the general public and the academic idea. The normal school should provide for the training of the educator to make him realize that his is a two- fold job: education as a teacher and education as a propagandist. A second reason for the pres ent remoteness of edu- cation from the thoughts an d interests of the public is to be found in the ment al attitude of the pedagogue —whether primary school te acher or college profes- sor—toward the world outside the school. This is a 122"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Propaganda for Education difficult psychological problem. The teacher finds himself in a world in which the emphasis is put on those objective goals and those objective attainments which are prized by our Am erican society. He him- self is but moderately or poorly paid. Judging him- self by the standards in common acceptance, he can- not but feel a sense of in feriority because he finds himself continually being compared, in the minds of his own pupils, with the su ccessful business man and the successful leader in the outside world. Thus the educator becomes represse d and suppressed in our civilization. As things stand, this condition cannot be changed from the outside unless the general public alters its standards of achievement, which it is not likely to do soon. Yet it can be changed by the teaching profession itself, if it becomes conscious not only of its indi- vidualistic relation to the pup il, but also of its social relation to the general pub lic. The teaching profes- sion, as such, has the right to carry on a very definite propaganda with a view to enlightening the public and asserting its intimate relation to the society which it serves. In addition to conducting a propaganda on behalf of its individual members, education must also raise the general a ppreciation of the teaching profession. Unless the profession can raise itself by its own bootstraps, it will fast lose the power of re- cruiting outstanding talent for itself. Propaganda cannot change all that is at present un- 123"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Propaganda satisfactory in the educational situation. There are factors, such as low pay and the lack of adequate provision for superannuate d teachers, which defi- nitely affect the status of the profession. It is pos- sible, by means of an inte lligent appeal predicated upon the actual present composition of the public mind, to modify the general attitude toward the teaching profession. Such a changed attitude will begin by expressing itself in an insistence on the idea of more adequate salaries for the profession. There are various ways in which academic organi- zations in America handle their financial problems. One type of college or university depends, for its monetary support, upon gran ts from the state legis- latures. Another depends upon private endow- ment. There are other type s of educational institu- tions, such as the sectarian, but the two chief types include by far the greater number of our institutions of higher learning. The state university is supported by grants from the people of the state, voted by the state legislature. In theory, the degree of s upport which the university receives is dependent upon the degree of acceptance accorded it by the voters. The state university pros- pers according to the extent to which it can sell itself to the people of the state. The state university is therefore in an unfortunate position unless its president happens to be a man of outstanding merit as a propagandist and a dramatizer 124"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Propaganda for Education of educational issues. Yet if this is the case—if the university shapes its whol e policy toward gaining the support of the state legislature—its educational function may suffer. It may be tempted to base its whole appeal to th e public on its public service, real or supposed, and permit the education of its indi- vidual students to take care of itself. It may attempt to educate the people of the state at the expense of its own pupils. This may generate a number of evils, to the extent of making the uni versity a political instru- ment, a mere tool of th e political gr oup in power. If the president dominates both the public and the professional politician, this may lead to a situation in which the personality of the president outweighs the true function of the institution. The endowed college or university has a problem quite as perplexing. The endowed college is de- pendent upon the support, usually, of key men in in- dustry whose social and economic objectives are concrete and limited, and ther efore often at variance with the pursuit of abstract knowledge. The success- ful business man criticizes the great universities for being too academic, but seldom for being too prac- tical. One might imagine that the key men who support our universities would like them to special- ize in schools of applied sc ience, of practical sales- manship or of industrial efficiency. And it may well be, in many instances, that the demands which the potential endowers of our universities make upon 125"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Propaganda these institutions are flatly in contradiction to the in- terests of scholarship and general culture.

Me n who, by the commonly accepted standards, are failures or very moderate suc- cesses in our American world (the pedagogues) seek to convince the outstanding successes (the business men) that they should give their money to ideals which they do not pursue. Men who, through a sense of inferiority, despise money, seek to win the good will of men who love money. It seems possible that the future status of the en- dowed college will depend upon a balancing of these forces, both the academic and the endowed elements obtaining in effect due consideration. The college must win public support. If the po- tential donor is apathetic, enthusiastic public approval must be obtained to convince him. If he seeks unduly to influence the educational policy of the in- stitution, public opinion must support the college in the continuance of its pr oper functions. If either factor dominates unduly, we are likely to find a demagoguery or a snobbishness aiming to please one group or the other. There is still another pote ntial solution of the prob- lem.

Everitt Macy, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., th e late Willard Straight. Many colleges have alread y developed intelligent propaganda in order to bring them into active and continuous relation with th e general public. A defi- nite technique has been developed in their relation to the community in the form of college news bureaus. These bureaus have formed an intercollegiate as- sociation whose members meet once a year to dis- cuss their problems. These problems include the education of the alumnus and his effect upon the general public and upon speci fic groups, the education of the future student to the choice of the particular college, the maintenance of an esprit de corps so that the athletic prowess of th e college will not be placed first, the development of some familiarity with the research work done in th e college in order to at- tract the attention of those who may be able to lend aid, the development of an understanding of the aims and the work of the institution in order to attract special endowments for specified purposes. Some seventy-five of these bureaus are now affili- ated with the American Association of College News Bureaus, including those of Yale, Wellesley, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Western Reserve, Tufts and 127"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Propaganda California.

One of the aims of such propaganda is of course im- provement in the prestige and material position of the teachers themselves. An occasional McAndrew case calls the attention of the public to the fact that in some schools the teacher is far from enjoying full academic freedom, while in certain communities the choice of teachers is based upon political or sectarian considerations rather than upon real ability. If such issues were made, by mean s of propaganda, to become a matter of public concern on a truly national scale, there would doubtless be a general tendency to improvement. The concrete problems of colleges are more varied and puzzling than one might suppose.

Yet it is part of the president's work to see that his university takes its proper place in the com- munity and therefore also in the community mind, and produces the results de sired, both in a cultural and in a financial sense.

For bot h possibilities lie within the province of the public relations counsel. Columbia University recently instituted a Casa Italiana, which was solemnly inaugurated in the presence of representatives of the Italian govern- ment, to emphasize its high standing in Latin studies and the Romance languages. Years ago Harvard founded the Germanic Museum, which was cere- moniously opened by Prince Henry of Prussia. Many colleges maintain extension courses which bring their work to the knowledge of a broad public. It is of course proper th at such courses should be made known to the general public.

In such a case, it is not the work of the public relations counsel to urge that the courses be made better known, but to urge that they first be modified to conform to the impres- sion which the college wishes to create, where that is compatible with the university's scholastic ideals. 132"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Propaganda for Education Again, it may be the general opinion that the work of a certain institution is 80 per cent post- graduate research, an opinion which may tend to alienate public interest.

And since social service, by its very nature, can continue only by means of the voluntary support of the wealthy, it is obliged to use propaganda con- tinually.

Civilization is limited by inertia. Our attitude toward social relations, toward eco- nomics, toward national a nd international politics, continues past attitudes and strengthens them under the force of tradition. Comstock drops his mantle of proselytizing morality on the willing shoulders of a Sumner; Penrose drops his mantle on Butler; Car- negie his on Schwab, and so ad infinitum.

The literature on social service publicity is so extensive, and the underlying prin- ciples so fundamental, that only one example is nec- essary here to illustrate the technique of social service propaganda. A social service organi zation undertook to fight lynching, Jim Crowism and the civil discriminations against the Negro below the Mason and Dixon line. The National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People had the fight in hand. As a matter of technique they decided to dramatize the year's campaign in an a nnual convention which would concentrate attention on the problem. Should it be held in the North, South, West or East?

The support of leaders of diversified groups was sought. Tele- grams and letters were disp atched to leaders of re- ligious, political, social a nd educational groups, ask- ing for their point of view on the purpose of the conference. But in addition to these group leaders of national standing it was particularly important from the technical standpoint to secure the opinions of group leaders of the Sout h, even from Atlanta it- self, to emphasize the purpos es of the conference to the entire public.

Many churches have made paid advertising and organized propaganda part of their regular activities.

The Methodist Board of Publication and In formation systematically gives announcements and re leases to the press and the magazines. But in a broader sense the very activities of social service are propaganda act ivities. A campaign for the preservation of the teeth seeks to alter people's habits in the direction of more frequent brushing of teeth. A campaign for better parks seeks to alter people's opinion in regard to the desirability of tax- ing themselves for the purchase of park facilities. A campaign against tuberculosis is an attempt to con- vince everybody that tubercul osis can be cured, that persons with certain symp toms should immediately go to the doctor, and the like. A campaign to lower the infant mortality rate is an effort to alter the habits of mothers in regard to feeding, bathing and caring for their babies.

When art galleries seek to launch the canvases of an artist they should create public accept- ance for his works. To in crease public appreciation a deliberate propagandizing effort must be made. In art as in politics the minority rules, but it can rule only by going out to meet the public on its own ground, by understanding the anatomy of public opinion and utilizing it. In applied and commercial art, propaganda makes greater opportunities for the artist than ever before. This arises from the fact that mass production reaches an impasse when it competes on a price basis only. It must, therefore, in a large number of fields create a field of competition based on esthetic values. Business of many types capitalizes the es- thetic sense to increase markets and profits.

Propaganda can play a part in pointing out what is and what is not beautiful, and business can definitely help in this way to raise the level of American cul- ture. In this process propaganda will naturally make use of the authority of group leaders whose taste and opinion are recognized. The public must be interested by means of asso- ciational values and dramatic incidents. New in- spiration, which to the artist may be a very technical and abstract kind of beauty, must be made vital to the public by association with values which it recog- nizes and responds to. For instance, in the ma nufacture of American silk, markets are developed by going to Paris for inspiration. Paris can give American silk a stamp of authority which will aid it to achieve definite position in the United States. The following clipping from the New York Times of February 16, 1925, tells th e story from an actual incident of this sort: \"Copyright, 1925, by T HE N EW Y ORK T IMES C OMPANY —Special Cable to T HE N EW Y ORK T IMES . \"P ARIS , Feb. 15.—For the first time in his- tory, American art materials are to be exhibited 142"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Art and Science in the Decorative Arts Section of the Louvre Museum. \"The exposition opening on May 26th with the Minister of Fine Arts, Paul Leon, acting as patron, will include silks from Cheney Brothers, South Manchester and New York, the designs of which were based on the inspiration of Edgar Brandt, famous French iron worker, the mod- ern Bellini, who makes wonderful art works from iron. \"M.

He has been asked to assist and participate in this exposition, which will show France the ac- complishments of American industrial art. \"Thirty designs inspired by Edgar Brandt's work are embodied in 2,500 yards of printed silks, tinsels and cu t velvets in a hundred colors. . . . \"These 'prints ferronnieres' are the first tex- tiles to show the influence of the modern master, M.

They tried to mold the public taste in c onformity with the idea which had the approval of Paris. The silks of Cheney Brothers—a commercial product produced in quantity—gained a place in public esteem by being associated with the work of a recognized artist and with a great art museum. The same can be said of almost any commercial product susceptible of b eautiful design. There are few products in daily use, whether furniture, clothes, lamps, posters, commercial labels, book jackets, pocketbooks or bathtubs which are not subject to the laws of good taste. In America, whole departments of production are being changed through propa ganda to fill an eco- nomic as well as an esthetic need. Manufacture is being modified to conform to the economic need to satisfy the public demand for more beauty. A piano manufacturer recently engage d artists to design mod- ernist pianos.

When Secretary Hoover, three years ago, was asked to appoint a commi ssion to the Paris Expo- sition of Decorative Arts, he did so. As Associate Commissioner I assisted in the organizing of the group of important business leaders in the industrial art field who went to Paris as delegates to visit and report on the Exposition. The propaganda carried on for the aims and purposes of the Commission undoubtedly had a widespread effect on the attitude of Americans towards art in industry; it was only a few years later that the modern art movement pene- trated all fields of industry. Department stores took it up. R. H. Macy & Company held an Art-in-Trades Exposition, in which the Metropolitan Museum of Art collaborated as adviser. Lord & Taylor sponsored a Modern Arts Exposition, with foreign exhibitors. These stores, coming closely in touch with the life of the people, performed a propagandizing function in bringing to the people the best in art as it related to these in- dustries. The Museum at the same time was alive to the importance of maki ng contact with the public mind, by utilizing the depart ment store to increase art appreciation.

The housewife in a Bronx apartment doubt- less feels little interest in an ancient Greek vase in the Metropolitan Museum. Yet an artist working with a pottery firm may adapt the design of this vase to a set of china and this china, priced low through quantity production, may find its way to that Bronx apartment, developing uncons ciously, through its fine line and color, an appreciation of beauty. Some American museums feel this responsibility. The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York rightly prides itself on its million and a quarter of visitors in the year 1926; on its efforts to dramatize and make visual the civilizat ions which its various de- partments reveal; on its sp ecial lectures, its story hours, its loan collections of prints and photographs and lantern slides, its facilities offered to commercial firms in the field of applied art, on the outside lec- turers who are invited to lecture in its auditorium and on the lectures given by its staff to outside or- ganizations} and on the free chamber concerts given in the museum under the direction of David Mannes, which tend to dramatize the museum as a home of beauty.

The museum can stand in its community for a defi- nite esthetic standard which can, by the help of in- telligent propaganda, permeat e the daily lives of all its neighbors. Why should not a museum establish a museum council of art, to establish standards in home decoration, in archite cture, and in commercial production? or a research board for applied arts? Why should not the museum, instead of merely pre- serving the art treasures which it possesses, quicken their meaning in terms which the general public understands? A recent annual report of an art museum in one of the large cities of the United States, says: \"An underlying characterist ic of an Art Museum like ours must be its attitude of conservatism, for after all its first duty is to treasure the great achieve- ments of men in the arts and sciences.\" Is that true?

Many of the laboratories in which ab- stract research is being pursued are now connected with some large corporation, which is quite willing to devote hundreds of thousa nds of dollars to scien- tific study, for the sake of one golden invention or discovery which may emerge from it. Big business of course gains heavily when the in- vention emerges. But at that very moment it assumes the responsibility of placing the new inven- tion at the service of the public. It assumes also the responsibility of interpre ting its meaning to the public. The industrial interests can furnish to the schools, the colleges and the postgr aduate university courses the exact truth concerning th e scientific progress of our age. They not only can do so; they are under obligation to do so. Propaganda as an instrument of commercial competition has opened opportunities to the inventor and given great stimulus to the research scientist.

There is no means of hu- man communication which may not also be a means of deliberate propaganda, because propaganda is simply the establishing of reciprocal understanding between an individual and a group. The important point to the propagandist is that the relative value of the various instruments of propaganda, and their rela tion to the masses, are constantly changing. If he is to get full reach for his message he must take advantage of these shifts of value the instant they occur. Fifty years ago, the public meeting was a propaganda instrument par excellence. To-day it is difficult to get more than a handful of people to attend a public meeting unless extraordinary attractions are part of the program. The automobile takes them away from home, the radio keeps them in the home, the successive daily editions of the newspaper bring information to them in office or subway, and also they are sick of the ballyhoo of the rally. 150"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Mechanics of Propaganda Instead there are numerous other media of com- munication, some new, othe rs old but so transformed that they have become virtually new. The news- paper, of course, remains always a primary medium for the transmission of opinions and ideas—in other words, for propaganda. It was not many years ago that newspaper editors resented what they called \"the use of the news col- umns for propaganda purposes.\" Some editors would even kill a good story if they imagined its publication might benefit any one. This point of view is now largely aba ndoned. To-day the leading editorial offices take the vi ew that the real criterion governing the publication or non-publication of mat- ter which comes to the desk is its news value. The newspaper cannot assume, nor is it its function to assume, the responsibility of guaranteeing that what it publishes will not work out to somebody's interest. There is hardly a single it em in any daily paper, the publication of which does not , or might not, profit or injure somebody. That is the nature of news. What the newspaper does strive for is that the news which it publishes shall be accurate, and (since it must select from the mass of news mate rial available) that it shall be of interest and importance to large groups of its readers. In its editorial columns the newspaper is a per- sonality, commenting upon things and events from its individual point of view. But in its news columns 151"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Propaganda the typical modern American newspaper attempts to reproduce, with due regard to news interest, the out- standing events and opinions of the day. It does not ask whether a given item is propaganda or not. What is important is that it be news. And in the selection of news the editor is usually entirely independent. In the New York Times—to take an outstanding example—news is printed because of its news value and for no other reason. The Times edi- tors determine with complete independence what is and what is not news. They brook no censorship. They are not influenced by any external pressure nor swayed by any values of expediency or opportunism. The conscientious editor on every newspaper realizes that his obligation to the public is news. The fact of its accomplishment makes it news. If the public relations counsel can breathe the breath of life into an idea and make it take its place among other ideas and events, it will receive the public attention it merits . There can be no question of his \"contaminating news at its source.\" He creates some of the day's events, which must compete in the editorial office with other events. Often the events which he creates ma y be specially acceptable to a newspaper's public and he may create them with that public in mind.

The so-called flow of propaganda into the newspaper offices of the country may, simply at the editor's dis- cretion, find its way to the waste basket. The source of the news offered to the editor should always be clearly stated and the facts accu- rately presented. The situation of the magazines at the present moment, from the propagandi st's point of view, is different from that of the daily newspapers. The average magazine assumes no obligation, as the newspaper does, to reflect the current news. It selects its material deliberately, in accordance with a continuous policy. It is not, like the newspaper, an organ of public opinion, but tends rather to be- come a propagandist organ, propagandizing for a particular idea, whether it be good housekeeping, or smart apparel, or beauty in home decoration, or de- bunking public opinion, or general enlightenment or liberalism or amusement. One magazine may aim to sell health; another, English gardens; another, fashionable men's wear; an other, Nietzschean phi- losophy.

A bank, in order to em- phasize the importance of its women's department, may arrange to supply a leading women's magazine with a series of articles and advice on investments written by the woman expert in charge of this de- partment. The women's magazine in turn will utilize this new feature as a means of building addi- tional prestige and circulation. The lecture, once a powerful means of influencing public opinion, has changed its value. The lecture itself may be only a sym bol, a ceremony; its impor- tance, for propaganda purposes , lies in the fact that it was delivered. Professor So-and-So, expounding an epoch-making invention, may speak to five hun- dred persons, or only fift y. His lecture, if it is important, will be broadcast; reports of it will ap- pear in the newspapers; discussion will be stimu- lated. The real value of the lecture, from the propaganda point of view, is in its repercussion to the general public. The radio is at present one of the most important tools of the propagandist.

To what extent is the publisher alive to this new phenomenon? It is bound to come close to American journalism and publishing. Newspapers have recog- nized the advertising potent ialities of the companies that manufacture radio apparatus, and of radio stores, large and small; and newspapers have ac- corded to the radio in their news and feature col- umns an importance relative to the increasing atten- tion given by the public to ra dio. At the same time, certain newspapers have bought radio stations and linked them up with their news and entertainment distribution facilities, suppl ying these two features over the air to the public. It is possible that newspaper chains will sell sched- ules of advertising space on the air and on paper. Newspaper chains will possibl y contract with adver- tisers for circulation on paper and over the air. There are, at present, pub lishers who sell space in the air and in their columns, but they regard the two as separate ventures. Large groups, political, ra cial, sectarian, economic or professional, are tending to control stations to propagandize their points of view.

Whether, in the future, air space will be sold openly as such, or whether the message will reach the public in the form of straight entertain- ment and news, or as special programs for particular groups, the propagandist must be prepared to meet the conditions and utilize them. The American motion picture is the greatest un- conscious carrier of propaga nda in the world to-day. It is a great distributor for ideas and opinions. The motion picture can st andardize the ideas and habits of a nation. Because pictures are made to meet market demands, th ey reflect, emphasize and even exaggerate broad popular tendencies, rather than stimulate new ideas and opinions. The motion picture avails itself only of ideas and facts which are in vogue. As the newspaper seeks to purvey news, it seeks to purvey entertainment. Another instrument of propaganda is the person- ality. Has the device of the exploited personality been pushed too far? President Coolidge photo- graphed on his vacation in full Indian regalia in company with full-blooded chiefs, was the climax of a greatly over-reported vacation. Obviously a pub- lic personality can be made absurd by misuse of the very mechanism which helped create it. Yet the vivid dramatizati on of personality will always remain one of the functions of the public relations counsel.

There is a story that a gr eat financier discharged a partner because he had divorced his wife. \"But what,\" asked the partner, \"have my private affairs to do with the banking business?\" \"If you are not capable of managing your own wife,\" was the reply, \"the people will certainly be- lieve that you are not cap able of managing their money.\" The propagandist must tr eat personality as he would treat any other obj ective fact within his province. A personality may create circumstances, as Lind- bergh created good will between the United States and Mexico. Events may create a personality, as the Cuban War created the political figure of Roose- velt. It is often difficult to say which creates the other. Once a public figure has decided what ends he wishes to achieve, he must regard himself objec- tively and present an outward picture of himself which is consistent with his real character and his aims. There are a multitude of other avenues of ap- proach to the public mind, some old, some new as television. No attempt will be made to discuss each one separately.

It may be that a new product will be announced to the public by means of a motion picture of a parade taking place a thousand miles away. Or the manufacturer of a new jitney airplane may person- ally appear and speak in a million homes through radio and television. The man who would most effectively transmit his message to the public must be alert to make use of all the means of propaganda. Undoubtedly the public is becoming aware of the methods which are being used to mold its opinions and habits. If the public is better informed about the processes of its own life, it will be so much the more receptive to reasonable appeals to its own in- terests. No matter how sophi sticated, how cynical the public may become about publicity methods, it must respond to the basic appeals, because it will always need food, crave amusement, long for beauty, re- spond to leadership.
