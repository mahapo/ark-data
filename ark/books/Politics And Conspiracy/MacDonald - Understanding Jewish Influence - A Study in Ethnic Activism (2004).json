I will discuss Jewish background traits conducive to influence: ethnocentrism, inte lligence and wealth, psychological intensity, aggressiveness, with most of the focus on et hnocentrism. I discuss Jewish ethnocentrism in its historical, anthropological, and evolutionary c ontext and in its relation to three critical psychological processes: moral particularism, self-deception, and the powerful Jewish tendency to coalesce into exclusionary, author itarian groups under conditions of perceived threat. Jewish populations have always had enormous e ffects on the societies in which they reside because of several qualitie s that are central to Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy: First and foremost, Jews are ethnocentric and able to coopera te in highly organi zed, cohesive, and effective groups. Also important is high intelligence, including th e usefulness of intelligence in attaining wealth, prominence in the media, a nd eminence in the academic world and the legal profession. I will also discuss two other qualities that have receive d less attention: psychological intensity and aggressiveness. The four background traits of ethnocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness result in Jews bei ng able to produce formidable, effective groups—groups able to have powerful, transformative effects on the peop les they live among. In the modern world, these traits influence the academic world and the world of mainstream and elite media, thus amplifying Jewish effectiveness compared with traditional societies. However, Jews have repeatedly become an elite and powerful group in societies in which they reside in sufficient numbers. It is remarkable that Jews, usually as a tiny minority, have been central to a long list of historical events. Jews were much on the mind of the Chur ch Fathers in the fourth century during the formative years of Christian dominance in the We st. Indeed, I have propos ed that the powerful anti-Jewish attitudes and legisl ation of the fourth-c entury Church must be understood as a defensive reaction against Jewish economi c power and enslavement of non-Jews. 1 Jews who had nominally converted to Christianity but maintain ed their ethnic ties in marriage and commerce were the focus of the 250-year Inquisition in Spain, Portugal, and the Sp anish colonies in the New World. Fundamentally, the Inquisition shoul d be seen as a defensive reaction to the economic and political domination of these “New Christians.” 2 Jews have also been central to all the important events of the twentieth century. Jews were a necessary component of the Bolshevik revoluti on that created the Sovi et Union, and they remained an elite group in the Soviet Union until at least the post-World War II era. They were an important focus of National Socialism in Germ any, and they have been prime movers of the post-1965 cultural and ethnic revolution in the Un ited States, including the encouragement of massive non-white immigration to countries of European origins. 3 In the contemporary world, organized American Jewish lobbying groups and deeply committed Jews in the Bush administration and the media are behind the pro-Isr ael U.S. foreign policy th at is leading to war against virtually the entire Arab world."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 How can such a tiny minority have such huge effects on the history of the West? This article is the first of a three-part series on Jewi sh influence which seeks to answer that question. This first paper in the series provides an introduction to Jewish ethnocentrism and other background traits that influence Jewish success. The second article discusses Zionism as the quintessential example of twentie th-century Jewish et hnocentrism and as an example of a highly influential Jewish intellectual/political move ment. A broader aim w ill be to discuss a generalization about Jewish history: that in the long run the more extreme elements of the Jewish community win out and determine the direction of the entire group. As Jonathan Sacks points out, it is the committed core—mad e up now especially of highly in fluential and vigorous Jewish activist organizations in the United States and hypernationalist elem ents in Israel—that determines the future direction of the community. 4 The third and final article will discuss neoconservatism as a Jewish intellectual an d political movement. Although I touched on neoconservatism in my trilogy on Jews, 5 the present influence of this movement on U.S. foreign policy necessitates a much fuller treatment. Figure 1: Understanding Jewish Activism Figure 1 provides an overview of the sources of Jewish in fluence. The four background traits—discussed in more detail below—are ethn ocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness. These traits are seen as underlying Jewish success in producing focused, effective groups able to influe nce the political proce ss and the wider cultu re. In the modern world, Jewish influence on politics and culture is channeled through the media and through elite academic institutions into an almost bewildering array of areas—far too many to consider here. I. J EWS ARE H YPERETHNOCENTRIC Elsewhere I have argued that Je wish hyperethnocentrism can be traced back to their Middle Eastern origins. 6 Traditional Jewish culture has a number of features identifying Jews with the ancestral cultures of the area. The most important of these is that Jews and other Middle Eastern cultures evolved under circumstances that favored large groups dominated by males. 7 These groups were basically extended families with high levels of endogamy (i.e., marriage within the kinship group) and consanguine ous marriage (i.e., ma rriage to blood relati ves), including the uncle-niece marriage sanctioned in the Old Testamen t. These features are exactly the opposite of Western European tendencies (See Table 1). 8 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Table 1: Contrasts between Europe an and Jewish Cultural Forms.

Middle Eastern societies are characterized by anthropologists as “segment ary societies” organized into relatively impermeable, kinship-based groups. 9 Group boundaries are ofte n reinforced through external markers such as hair style or clothi ng, as Jews have often done throughout their history. Different groups settle in differe nt areas where they retain th eir homogeneity alongside other homogeneous groups, as illustrated by th e following account from Carleton Coon: There the ideal was to emphasize not the uniformity of the citizens of a country as a whole but a uniformity within each special segment, and the gr eatest possible contrast between segments. The members of each ethnic unit feel the need to iden tify themselves by some configuration of symbols. If by virtue of their history they possess some raci al peculiarity, this they will enhance by special haircuts and the like; in any case they will wear di stinctive garments and behave in a distinctive fashion. 10 These societies are by no mean s blissful paradises of mu lticulturalism. Between-group conflict often lurks just beneath the surface. For example, in nineteenth-century Turkey, Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in a sort of s uperficial harmony, and even inhabited the same areas, “but the slightest spark sufficed to ignite the fuse.” 11 Jews are at the extreme of this Middle Ea stern tendency toward hypercollectivism and hyperethnocentrism. I give many examples of Jewish hyperethnocentrism in my trilogy on Judaism and have suggested in several places that Jewish hype rethnocentrism is biologically based. 12 Middle Eastern ethnocentrism and fanaticism has struck a good many people as extreme, including William Hamilton, perhap s the most important evolutiona ry biologist of the twentieth century. Hamilton writes: I am sure I am not the first to have wondered what it is about that part of the world that feeds such diverse and intense senses of rectitude as has create d three of the worlds’ most persuasive and yet most divisive and mutually incompatible religions. It is hard to discern the root in the place where I usually look for roots of our strong emotions, th e part deepest in us, our biology and evolution. 13 Referring to my first two books on Judaism, Ham ilton then notes that “even a recent treatise on this subject, much as I agree with its general th eme, seems to me hardly to reach to this point of the discussion.” If I failed to go far enough in de scribing or analyzing Jewi sh ethnocentrism, it is perhaps because the subject seems almo st mind-bogglingly deep, with psychological ramifications everywhere. As a pan-humanist, Ha milton was acutely aware of the ramifications of human ethnocentrism and especia lly of the Jewish variety. Like ning Judaism to the creation of a new human species, Hamilton noted that from a humanist point of view, were those \"species \" the Martian thought to see in the towns and villages a millennium or so ago a good thing? Sh ould we have let their crystals grow; do we retrospectively approve them? As by growth in num bers by land annexation, by the heroizing of a recent mass murderer of Arabs [i.e., Baruch Goldst ein, who murdered 29 Arabs, including children, at the Patriarch’s Cave in Hebr on in 1994], and by the honorific burial accorded to a publishing magnate [Robert Maxwell], who had enriched Israel partly by his swindling of his employees, most of them certainly not Jews, some Israelis seem to favour a \"racewise\" and unrestrained competition, just as did the ancient Israelites and Nazi Germans. In proportion to the size of the country and the degree to which the eyes of the world are watching, the acts themselves that betray this trend of reversion from panhumanism may seem small as yet, but the spirit behind them, to this observer, seems virtually identical to trends that have long predated them both in humans and animals. 14 A good start for thinking about Jewish ethnocentr ism is the work of Israel Shahak, most notably his co-authored Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel . 15 Present-day fundamentalists attempt to re-create the life of Jewish communities before the Enlightenment (i.e., prior to about 1750). During this period the great majority of Jews be lieved in Cabbala—Jewish mysticism. Influential"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Jewish scholars like Gershom Scholem ignored the obvious racialist, exclus ivist material in the Cabbala by using words like “men,” “human beings ,” and “cosmic” to suggest the Cabbala has a universalist message. The actual text says salv ation is only for Jews, while non-Jews have “Satanic souls.” 16 The ethnocentrism apparent in such statements was not only the norm in traditional Jewish society, but remains a powerful current of contem porary Jewish fundamentalism, with important implications for Israeli politics. For example, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, describing the differenc e between Jews and non-Jews: We do not have a case of profound change in whic h a person is merely on a superior level. Rather we have a case of...a totally different species.... Th e body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the world.... The difference of the inner quality [of the body]...is so great that the bodies would be considered as completely different species. This is the reason why the Talmud states that there is an halachic difference in attitude about the bodies of non-Jews [as opposed to the bodies of Jews]: “their bodies are in vain”.... An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two cont rary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness. 17 This claim of Jewish uniqueness echoes Holo caust activist Elie Wiesel’s claim that “everything about us is different.” Jews are “ontologically” exceptional. 18 The Gush Emunim and other Jewish fundame ntalist sects described by Shahak and Mezvinsky are thus part of a long mainstream Jewish tradition which considers Jews and non- Jews completely different species, with Jews absolutely superior to non-Jews and subject to a radically different moral code. Moral universalism is thus antithetical to the Jewish tradition in which the survival and interests of the Jewish people are the most important ethical goal: Many Jews, especially religious Jews today in Israel and their supporters abro ad, continue to adhere to traditional Jewish ethics that other Jews would lik e to ignore or explain away. For example, Rabbi Yitzhak Ginzburg of Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus/S hechem, after several of his students were remanded on suspicion of murdering a teenage Arab girl: “Jewish blood is not the same as the blood of a goy.” Rabbi Ido Elba: “According to the Torah, we are in a situation of pikuah nefesh (saving a life) in time of war, and in such a situation one may kill any Gentile.” Rabbi Yisrael Ariel writes in 1982 that “Beirut is part of the Land of Israel. [T his is a reference to the boundaries of Israel as stated in the Covenant between God and Abra ham in Genesis 15: 18–20 and Joshua 1 3–4]...our leaders should have entered Lebanon and Beirut wi thout hesitation, and killed every single one of them. Not a memory should have remained.” It is usually yeshiva students who chant “Death to the Arabs” on CNN. The stealing and corruption by reli gious leaders that has recently been documented in trials in Israel and abroad continues to rai se the question of the relationship between Judaism and ethics. 19 Moral particularism in its most aggressive form can be seen among the ultranationalists, such as the Gush Emunim, who hold that Jews are not, and cannot be a normal people. The eter nal uniqueness of the Jews is the result of the Covenant made between God and the Jewish people at Mount Sinai.... The implication is that the transcendent imperatives for Jews effectively nullify moral laws that bind the behavior of normal nations. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, one of Gush Emuni m’s most prolific ideologues, argues that the divine commandments to the Jewish people “trans cend the human notions of national rights.” He explains that while God requires other nations to abide by abstract codes of justice and righteousness, such laws do not apply to Jews. 20 As argued in the second paper in this series , it is the most extreme elements within the Jewish community that ultimately give dire ction to the community as a whole. These fundamentalist and ultranationalist groups are not tiny fringe groups, mere relics of traditional Jewish culture. They are widely respected by the Israeli public and by many Jews in the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Diaspora. They have a great de al of influence on the Israeli government, especially the Likud governments and the recent government of nation al unity headed by Ariel Sharon. The members of Gush Emunim constitute a significant percentage of the elite units of th e Israeli army, and, as expected on the hypothesis that they are extremely ethnocentric, th ey are much more willing to treat the Palestinians in a savage and brutal manner than are other Israeli soldiers. All together, the religious parties represent about 25% of the Israeli electorate 21 —a percentage that is sure to increase because of the high fert ility of religious Jews and beca use intensified tr oubles with the Palestinians tend to make other Israelis more sympathetic to their cause. Given the fractionated state of Israeli po litics and the increasing num bers of the religious gr oups, it is unlikely that future governments can be formed without their pa rticipation. Peace in th e Middle East therefore appears unlikely absent the complete capitu lation or expulsion of the Palestinians. A good discussion of Jewish moral particular ism can be found in a recent article in Tikkun —probably the only remainin g liberal Jewish publication. Kim Chernin wonders why so many Jews “have trouble bein g critical of Israel.” 22 She finds several obstacles to criticism of Israel: 1. A conviction that Jews are always in danger, al ways have been, and therefore are in danger now. Which leads to: 2. The insistence th at a criticism is an attack and w ill lead to our destruction. Which is rooted in: 3. The supposition that any nega tivity towards Jews (or Israel) is a sign of anti- Semitism and will (again, inevitably) lead to our dest ruction.... 6. An even more hidden belief that a sufficient amount of suffering confers the right to violence.... 7. The conviction that our beliefs, our ideology (or theology), matter more than the lives of other human beings. Chernin presents the Jewish psyc hology of moral particularism: We keep a watchful eye out, we read the sign s, we detect innuendo, we summon evidence, we become, as we imagine it, the ev er-vigilant guardians of our people’s survival. Endangered as we imagine ourselves to be; endangered as we insist we are, any negativity, criticism, or reproach, even from one of our own, takes on exag gerated dimensions; we come to perceive such criticism as a life- threatening attack. The path to fear is clear. But our proclivity for this perception is itself one of our unrecognized dangers. Bit by bit, as we gather ev idence to establish our perilous position in the world, we are brought to a selective perception of that world. With our attention focused on ourselves as the endangered species, it seems to fo llow that we ourselves can do no harm.... When I lived in Israel I practiced selective perception. I was elated by our little kibbutz on the Lebanese border until I recognized that we were living on land that had belonged to our Arab neighbors. When I didn’t ask how we had come to acquire that land, I practiced blindness... The profound depths of Jewish ethnocentrism are intimately tied up with a sense of historical persecution. Jewish memory is a memory of persecution and impending doom, a memory that justifies any response because ultimat ely it is Jewish survival that is at stake: Wherever we look, we see nothing but impendi ng Jewish destruction.... I was walking across the beautiful square in Nuremberg a couple of years a go and stopped to read a public sign. It told this story: During the Middle Ages, the town govern ing body, wishing to clear space for a square, burned out, burned down, and burned up the Jews who had formerly filled up the space. End of story. After that, I felt very uneasy walking throug h the square and I eventu ally stopped doing it. I felt endangered, of course, a woman going about through Germany wearing a star of David. But more than that, I experienced a c onspicuous and dreadful self-reproach at being so alive, so happily on vacation, now that I had come to think about the murder of my people hundreds of years before. After reading that plaque I stopped enjoying myself and began to look for other signs and traces of the mistreatment of the former Jewish community. If I had stayed longer in Nuremberg, if I had gone further in this direction, I might soon have co me to believe that I, personally, and my people, currently, were threatened by the contemporary Ge rmans eating ice cream in an outdoor cafe in the square. How much more potent this tendency for al arm must be in the Middle East, in the middle of a war zone!..."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Notice the powerful sense of history here. Jews have a very long historical memory. Events that happened centuries ago co lor their curren t perceptions. This powerful sense of group endangerment and historical grievance is associated with a hyperbolic style of Jewish thought that runs repeatedly thr ough Jewish rhetoric. Chernin’s comment that “any negativity, criticism, or re proach, even from one of our own, takes on exaggerated dimensions” is particularly importa nt. In the Jewish mind, all criticism must be suppressed because not to do so would be to risk another Holocaust: “There is no such thing as overreaction to an anti-Semitic incident, no such thing as exaggerating the omnipresent danger. Anyone who scoffed at the idea that there were dangerous portents in American society hadn’t learned ‘the lesson of the Holocaust.’ ” 23 Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary , a premier neoconservative journal published by the Ameri can Jewish Committee, provides an example: My own view is that what had befallen the Jews of Europe inculcated a subliminal lesson.... The lesson was that anti-Semitism, even the relatively harmless genteel variety that enforced quotas against Jewish students or kept their parents from joining fashionable clubs or getting jobs in prestigious Wall Street law firms, could end in mass murder. 24 This is a “slippery slope” argument with a ve ngeance. The schema is as follows: Criticism of Jews indicates dislike of Jews; this leads to hostility toward Jews, which leads to Hitler and eventually to mass murder. Therefor e all criticism of Jews must be suppressed. With this sort of logic, it is easy to dismiss arguments about Palestinian rights on the West Bank and Gaza because “the survival of Israel” is at stake. Consider, for example, the following advertisement distributed by neoconservativ e publicist David Horowitz: The Middle East struggle is not about right versus right. It is about a fifty-year effort by the Arabs to destroy the Jewish state, and the refusal of the Arab states in general and the Palestinian Arabs in particular to accept Israel’s existence.... The Middle East conflict is not about Israel’s occupation of the territories; it is about the refusal of the Arabs to make peace with Israel, which is an expression of their desire to destroy the Jewish state. 25 “Survival of Israel” argument s thus trump concerns about a llocation of scarce resources like water, the seizure of Palestinian land, co llective punishment, torture, and the complete degradation of Palestinian communities into isolated, military-occupied, Bantustan-type enclaves. The logic implies that critics of Isra el’s occupation of the We st Bank and Gaza also favor the destruction of Israel and hence the mass murder of millions of Jews. Similarly, during the debate over selling military hardware to Saudi Arabia in the Carter administration, “the Israeli l obby pulled out all the stops,” including circulating books to Congress based on the TV series The Holocaust . The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the main Jewish lobbying group in C ongress, included a note stating, “This chilling account of the extermination of six million Jews unde rscores Israel’s concerns during the current negotiations for security without reliance on outside guarantees.” 26 In other words, selling AWACS reconnaissance planes to Saudi Arab ia, a backward kingdom with little military capability, is tantamount to collusion in the extermination of millions of Jews. Jewish thinking about immigrati on into the U.S. shows the sa me logic. Lawr ence Auster, a Jewish conservative, descri bes the logic as follows: The liberal notion that “al l bigotry is indivisible” [advocated by Norman Podhoretz] implies that all manifestations of ingroup/outgroup feel ing are essentially the same—and equally wrong . It denies the obvious fact that some outgroups are more different from the ingroup, and hence less assimilable, and hence more legitimately excluded, than other outgroups. It means, for example, that wanting to exclude Muslim immigrants from Amer ica is as blameworthy as wanting to exclude Catholics or Jews."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Now when Jews put together the idea that “all social prejudice a nd exclusion leads potentially to Auschwitz” with the idea that “all bigotry is indi visible,” they must reach the conclusion that any exclusion of any group, no matter how alien it may be to th e host society, is a potential Auschwitz. So there it is. We have identified the core Jew ish conviction that makes Jews keep pushing relentlessly for mass immigration, even the mass i mmigration of their deadliest enemies. In the thought-process of Jews, to keep Jew-hating Mu slims out of America would be tantamount to preparing the way to another Jewish Holocaust. 27 The idea that any sort of exclusionary thi nking on the part of Am ericans—and especially European Americans as a majority group—leads ine xorably to a Holocaust for Jews is not the only reason why Jewish organizatio ns still favor mass immigration. I have identified two others as well: the belief that greater diversity makes Jews safer and an intense sense of historical grievance against the traditional peoples and culture of the United States and Europe. 28 These two sentiments also illustrate Jewish moral particul arism because they fail to consider the ethnic interests of other peoples in thinking about immigration polic y. Recently the “diversity-as- safety” argument was made by Leonard S. Glickman, president and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish group that has advocated open im migration to the United States for over a century. Glickman stated, “The more diverse American society is the safer [Jews] are.” 29 At the present time, the HIAS is deeply involved in recruiting refugees from Africa to emigrate to the U.S. The diversity as safety argument and its linkage to historical grievances against European civilization is implicit in a recent statement of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) in response to former French president Valéry Giscard d’Es taing’s argument that Muslim Turkey has no place in the European Union: Ironically, in the fifteenth century, when Europ ean monarchs expelled the Jews, it was Moslem Turkey that provided them a welcome.... During the Holocaust, when Europe was slaughtering its Jews, it was Turkish consuls who extended protectio n to fugitives from Vichy France and other Nazi allies.... Today’s European neo-Nazis and ski nheads focus upon Turkish victims while, Mr. President, you are reported to be considering the Pope’s plea that your Convention emphasize Europe’s Christian heritage. [The Center sugg ested that Giscard’s new Constitution] underline the pluralism of a multi-faith and multi-ethnic Europe, in which the participation of Moslem Turkey might bolster the continent’s Moslem communi ties—and, indeed, Turkey itself—against the menaces of extremism, hate and fundamentalism. A European Turkey can only be beneficial for stability in Europe and the Middle East. 30 Here we see Jewish moral particularism co mbined with a profound sense of historical grievance—hatred by any other na me—against European civilizati on and a desire for the end of Europe as a Christian civilization with its trad itional ethnic base. According to the SWC, the menaces of “extremism, hate and fundamenta lism”—prototypically against Jews—can only be repaired by jettisoning the tradit ional cultural and ethnic basis of European civilization. Events that happened five hundred year s ago are still fresh in the minds of Jewish activists—a phenomenon that should give pause to everyone in an age when Israel has control of nuclear weapons and long-range delivery systems. 31 Indeed, a recent article on Assyrians in the U.S. shows that many Jews have not forgiven or forgotten events of 2,700 years ago, when the No rthern Israelite kingdom was forcibly relocated to the Assyrian cap ital of Nineveh: “Some Assyrians say Jews are one group of people who seem to be more familiar with them. But because the Hebrew Bible de scribes Assyrians as cruel and ruthless conquerors, people such as the Rev. William Nissan say he is invariably challenged by Jewish rabbis and scholars about the misdeeds of his ancestors.” 32 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 The SWC inveighs against hate but fails to confront the issue of hatred as a normative aspect of Judaism. Jewish hatr ed toward non-Jews emerges as a consistent th eme throughout the ages, beginning in the ancient world. 33 The Roman historian Tacitus noted that “Among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to show compassi on, though they regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies. 34 The eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon was struck by the fanatical ha tred of Jews in the ancient world: From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horri d cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives; and we are tempted to applaud the severe re taliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition see med to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but of human kind. 35 The nineteenth-century Spanish historian José Amador de los Rios wrote of the Spanish Jews who assisted the Muslim conquest of Spain that “without any love for the soil where they lived, without any of those affections that enno ble a people, and finally without sentiments of generosity, they aspired only to f eed their avarice and to accomplis h the ruin of the Goths; taking the opportunity to manifest their rancor, and boas ting of the hatreds that they had hoarded up so many centuries.” 36 In 1913, economist Werner Sombart, in his classic Jews and Modern Capitalism, summarized Judaism as “a group by themse lves and therefore separate and apart— this from the earliest antiquity. All nations were struck by their hatred of others.” 37 A recent article by Meir Y. Soloveichik, aptly tit led “The virtue of hate,” amplifies this theme of normative Jewish fanatical hatred. 38 “Judaism believes that while forgiveness is often a virtue, hate can be virtuous when one is dealing with the frightfully wicked. Rather than forgive, we can wish ill; rather than hope for repent ance, we can instead hope that our enemies experience the wrath of God.” Soloveichik notes that the Ol d Testament is replete with descriptions of horribly violent deaths inflicted on the enemies of the Israelites—the desire not only for revenge but for revenge in the bloodiest, most degrading manner imaginable: “The Hebrew prophets not only hated th eir enemies, but rather reveled in their suffering, finding in it a fitting justice.” In the Book of Es ther, after the Jews kill the ten sons of Haman, their persecutor, Esther asks that they be hanged on a gallows. This normative fanatical hatred in Juda ism can be seen by the common use among Orthodox Jews of the phrase yemach shemo , meaning, may his name be erased . This phrase is used “whenever a great enemy of the Jewish nati on, of the past or present, is mentioned. For instance, one might very well say casually, in the course of conversation, ‘Thank God, my grandparents left Germany before Hitler, yemach shemo , came to power.’ Or: ‘My parents were murdered by the Nazis, yemach shemam .’ ” 39 Again we see that the po werful consciousness of past suffering leads to pr esent-day intense hatred: Another danger inherent in hate is that we ma y misdirect our odium at institutions in the present because of their past misdeeds. Fo r instance, some of my coreligionists reserve special abhorrence for anything German, even though Germany is curr ently one of the most pro-Israel countries in Europe. Similarly, after centuries of suffering, many Jews have, in my own experience, continued to despise religious Christians, even though it is secula rists and Islamists who threaten them today, and Christians should really be seen as their natura l allies. Many Jewish intellectuals and others of influence still take every assertion of the truth of Christianity as an anti-Semitic attack. After the Catholic Church beatified Edith Stein, a Jewis h convert to Christianity, some prominent Jews asserted that the Church was attempting to cover up its role in causing the Holocaust. And then there is the historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, who essentially has asserted that any attempt by the Catholic Church to maintain that Christianity is the one true faith marks a continuation of the crimes of the Church in the past. Burning hatred , once kindled, is difficult to extinguish."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Soloveichik could also have included Jewish hatred toward the traditional peoples and culture of the United States. This hatred stems from Jewish memory of the immigration law of 1924, which is seen as having resulted in a gr eater number of Jews dying in the Holocaust because it restricted Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Jews are also acutely aware of widespre ad anti-Jewish attitudes in the U.S. prior to World War II. The hatred continues despite the virtua l disappearance of anti-Jewish attitudes in the U.S. after World War II and despite the powerful ties be tween the United States and Israel. 40 Given the transparently faulty logic and obvious self-interest involved in arguments made by Jewish activists, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Jews are often engaged in self- deception. In fact, self-deception is a very important component of Jewish moral particularism. I wrote an entire chapter on Jewish self-deception in Separation and Its Discontents 41 but it was nowhere near enough. Again, Kim Chernin: Our sense of victimization as a people works in a dangerous and seditious way against our capacity to know, to recognize, to name and to remember . Since we have adopted ourselves as victims we cannot correctly read our own history let alone ou r present circumstances. Even where the story of our violence is set down in a sacred text that we pore over again and again, we cannot see it. Our self-election as the people most likely to be vic timized obscures rather than clarifies our own tradition. I can’t count the number of times I read th e story of Joshua as a tale of our people coming into their rightful possession of their promised land w ithout stopping to say to myself, “but this is a history of rape, plunder, slaughter, invasion and d estruction of other peoples.” As such, it bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to the behavior of Israeli settlers and the Israeli army of today, a behavior we also cannot see for what it is. We are tracing the serpentine path of our own psychology. We find it organized around a persuasion of victimization, which leads to a sense of entitlement to enact violence, which brings about an inevitable distortion in the way we perceive both our Jewish identity and the world, and involves us finally in a tricky relationship to language. Political columnist Joe Sobran—who has su ffered professionally for expressing his opinions about Israel—exposes the moral particularism of Norman Podhoretz, one of the chorus of influential Jewish voices who advocate restructuring the entire Middle East in the interests of Israel: Podhoretz has unconsciously exposed the Manichaean fantasy world of so many of those who are now calling for war with Iraq. The United States and Israel are “good”; the Arab-Muslim states are “evil”; and those opposed to this war represent “moral relativism,” ostensibly neutral but virtually on the side of “evil.” This is simply deranged. The ability to see evil only in one’s enemies isn’t “moral clarity.” It’s the essence of fanaticism. We are now being counseled to fight one kind of fanaticism with another. [My emphasis] As Sobran notes, the moral particularism is unconscious—an example of self-deception. The world is cut up into two parts, the good and the evil—ingr oup-outgroup—as it has been, for Jews, for well over two thousand years. Recently Jared Taylor and Davi d Horowitz got into a discussion which touched on Jewi sh issues. Taylor writes: Mr. Horowitz deplores the idea that “we are all pris oners of identity politics,” implying that race and ethnicity are trivial matters we must work to over come. But if that is so, why does the home page of FrontPageMag carry a perpetual appeal for contribut ions to “David’s Defense of Israel Campaign”? Why Israel rather than, say, Kurdistan or Tibet or Euskadi or Chechnya? Because Mr. Horowitz is Jewish. His commitment to Israel is an expression of precisely the kind of particularist identity he would deny to me and to other racially-con scious whites. He passionately supports a self- consciously Jewish state but calls it “surrendering to the multicultural mias ma” when I work to return to a self-consciously white America. He suppor ts an explicitly ethnic identity for Israel but says American must not be allowed to have one... If he supports a Jewish Is rael, he should support a white America. 42 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Taylor is suggesting that Horowitz is self-de ceived or inconsistent. It is interesting that Horowitz was acutely aware of his own parents’ self-deception. Horowitz’s description of his parents shows the strong ethnocentr ism that lurked beneath the noisy universalism of Jewish communists in mid-twentieth century America. In his book, Radical Son , Horowitz describes the world of his parents who had joined a “shul” (i.e., a synagogue) run by the Communist Party in which Jewish holidays were give n a political interpretation. Ps ychologically these people might as well have been in eighteenth -century Poland, but they were completely unaware of any Jewish identity. Horowitz writes: What my parents had done in joining the Communist Party and moving to Sunnyside was to return to the ghetto. There was the same shared private language, the same hermetically sealed universe, the same dual posturing revealing one face to th e outer world and another to the tribe. More importantly, there was the same conviction of bein g marked for persecution and specially ordained, the sense of moral superiority towa rd the stronger and more numerous goyim outside. And there was the same fear of expulsion for heretical thoughts, which was the fear that riveted the chosen to the faith. 43 Jews recreate Jewish social structure wherever they are, even when they are completely unaware they are doing so. When asked about their Jewish commitments, these communists denied having any. 44 Nor were they consciously aware of having chosen ethnically Jewish spouses, although they all married other Jews. This denial has been useful for Jewish organizations and Jewish intellectual apologists attempting to de-emphasize the role of Jews on the radical left in the twentieth century. For ex ample, a common tactic of the ADL beginning in the Red Scare era of the 1920s right up through the Cold War era was to claim that Jewish radicals were no longer Jews because they had no Jewish religious commitments. 45 Non-Jews run the risk of failing to truly unde rstand how powerful these Jewish traits of moral particularism and self-dec eption really are. When confronted with his own rabid support for Israel, Horowitz simply denies that ethnicity has much to do with it; he supports Israel as a matter of principle—his commitment to univers alist moral principles—and he highlights the relationship between Israel and the West: “Israel is under attack by the same enemy that has attacked the United States. Israel is the poi nt of origin for the culture of the West.” 46 This ignores the reality that Israel’s treatmen t of the Palestinians is a major part of the reason why the United States was attacked and is hated throughout the Arab world. It also ignores the fact that Western culture and its strong strain of individualism are the antithesis of Judais m, and that Israel’s Western veneer overlays the deep structure of Is rael as an apartheid, ethnically based state. It’s difficult to argue with people who cannot see or at leas t won’t acknowledge the depths of their own ethnic commitments and continue to act in ways that compromise the ethnic interests of others. Pe ople like Horowitz (and his parents) can’t see their ethnic commitments even when they are obvious to everyone else . One could perhaps say the same of Charles Krauthammer, William Safire, William Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, and the legion of prominent Jews who collectively dominate the perception of Israel presented by the U.S. media. Not surprisingly, Horowitz pictures the U.S. as a se t of universal principles , with no ethnic content. This idea originated with Jewish intellectuals, particularly Horace Kallen, almost a century ago at a time when there was a str ong conception that the United St ates was a European civilization whose characteristics were racially/ethnically based. 47 As we all know, this world and its intellectual infrastructure have vanished, and I have tried to show that the prime force opposing a European racial/ethnic conception of the U.S. was a set of Jewish intellectual and political movements that collectively pathologized any se nse of European ethnic ity or European ethnic interests. 48 "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Given that extreme ethnocentrism continues to pervade all segments of the organized Jewish community, the advocacy of the de-ethni cization of Europeans—a common sentiment in the movements I discuss in The Culture of Critique —is best seen as a st rategic move against peoples regarded as historical enemies. In Chapter 8 of CofC , I call attention to a long list of similar double standards, especial ly with regard to the policies pursued by Israel versus the policies Jewish organizations have pursued in the U.S. These policies include church-state separation, attitudes toward multiculturalism, and immigration policies favoring the dominant ethnic group. This double standard is fairly pervasive. As noted throughout CofC , Jewish advocates addressing Western audiences have promoted policies that satisfy Jewish (particularist) interests in terms of the morally universalist language that is a centr al feature of Western moral and intellectual discourse; obviously David Horo witz’s rationalization of his commitment to Israel is a prime example of this. A principal theme of CofC is that Jewish organizations play ed a decisive role in opposing the idea that the United States ought to be a European nation. Ne vertheless, these organizations have been strong supporters of Israel as a nation of the Jewish people. Consider, for example, a press release of May 28, 1999, by the ADL: The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today lauded th e passage of sweeping changes in Germany’s immigration law, saying the easing of the nation’ s once rigorous naturalization requirements “will provide a climate for diversity and acceptance. It is encouraging to see pluralism taking root in a society that, despite its strong democracy, had for decades maintained an unyielding policy of citizenship by blood or descent only,” said Abra ham H. Foxman, ADL National Director. “The easing of immigration requirements is especially si gnificant in light of Germany’s history of the Holocaust and persecution of Jews and other minor ity groups. The new law will provide a climate for diversity and acceptance in a nation with an one rous legacy of xenophobia, where the concept of ‘us versus them’ will be replaced by a principle of citizenship for all.” 49 There is no mention of analogous laws in place in Israel restricting im migration to Jews, or of the long-standing policy of rejecting the possibi lity of repatriation fo r Palestinian refugees wishing to return to Israel or the occupied terr itories. The prospective change in the “us versus them” attitude alleged to be characteristic of Germany is applauded, while the “us versus them” attitude characteristic of Israel and Jewish culture throughout history is unmentioned. Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Interior ruled that new immigrants who ha ve converted to Judaism will no longer be able to bring non-Jewi sh family members into the count ry. The decision is expected to cut by half the number of eligible immigrants to Israel. Nevertheless , Jewish organizations continue to be strong proponents of multiet hnic immigration to the United States while maintaining unquestioning support for Israel. This pervasive double standard was noticed by writer Vincent Sheean in his observations of Zioni sts in Palestine in 1930: “how idealism goes hand in hand with the most terrific cynicism; . . . how they are Fascists in their own affairs, with regard to Palestine, and internationalists in everything else.” 50 The right hand does not know what the left is doing—self-deception writ large. Jewish ethnocentrism is well founded in the sense that scientific studies supporting the genetic cohesiveness of Jewish groups continue to appear. Most notable of the recent studies is that of Michael Hammer and colleagues. 51 Based on Y-chromosome data, Hammer et al. conclude that 1 in 200 matings within Jewish communities were with non-Jews over a 2000-year period. Because of their intense ethnocentrism, Jews te nd to have great rapport with each other—an important ingredient in producing effective gr oups. One way to understand this powerful attraction for fellow ethnic group members is J. Philippe Rushton’s Genetic Similarity Theory. 52 According to GST, people are attr acted to others who are genetical ly similar to themselves. One"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 of the basic ideas of evolutionary biology is that people are expected to help relatives because they share similar genes. When a father helps a child or an uncle helps a nephe w, he is really also helping himself because of their close genetic rela tionship. (Parents share half their genes with their children; uncles share one-fourth of their genes with nieces and nephews. 53 ) GST extends this concept to non-relatives by arguing that pe ople benefit when they favor others who are genetically similar to them even if they are not relatives. GST has some important implications for understanding cooperation and cohesiveness among Jews. It predicts that people will be frien dlier to other people who are genetically more similar to themselves. In the case of Jews and non-Jews, it predicts that Jews would be more likely to make friends and alliances with other Jews, and that there would be high levels of rapport and psychological satisfactio n within these relationships. GST explains the extraordinary rapport and cohesiveness among Jews. Since the vast majority of Jews are closely related genetically, GS T predicts that they will be very attracted to other Jews and may even be able to recognize them in the abse nce of distinctive clothing and hair styles. There is anecdotal evidence for this statement. Theologian Eugene Borowitz writes that Jews seek each other out in social situations and feel “far more at home” after they have discovered who is Jewish. 54 “Most Jews claim to be equipped with an interpersonal friend-or-foe sensing device that enables them to detect the presence of another Jew, despite heavy camouflage.” Another Jewish writer comments on th e incredible sense of oneness he has with other Jews and his ability to recognize other Je ws in public places, a talent some Jews call “J- dar.” 55 While dining with his non-Jewish fiancée, he is immediately r ecognized as Jewish by some other Jews, and there is an immediate “ bond of brotherhood” between them that excludes his non-Jewish companion. Robert Reich, Clinton administra tion Secretary of Labor, wrote th at in his first face-to-face meeting with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, “We have never met before, but I instantly know him. One look, one phrase, and I know where he grew up, how he grew up, where he got his drive and his sense of humor. He is New York. He is Je wish. He looks like my uncle Louis, his voice is my uncle Sam. I feel we’ve been together at countless weddings, bar mitzvahs, and funerals. I know his genetic structure. I’m certain that within the last five hundred years—perhaps even more recently—we shared the same ancestor.” 56 Reich is almost certainly correct: He and Greenspan do inde ed have a recent common ancesto r, and this genetic affinity causes them to have an almost supernatural attraction to each ot her. Or consider Sigmund Freud, who wrote that he found “the attraction of Juda ism and of Jews so i rresistible, many dark emotional powers, all the mightier the less they le t themselves be grasped in words, as well as the clear consciousness of inner identity, th e secrecy of the same mental construction.” 57 Any discussion of Judaism has to start and pr obably end with this incredibly strong bond that Jews have among each other—a bond that is created by their close genetic relationship and by the intensification of the psychological mechanisms underlying group cohesion. This powerful rapport among Jews translates into a hei ghtened ability to cooperate in highly focused groups. To conclude this section: In general, th e contemporary organized Jewish community is characterized by high levels of Jewish identification and ethnocentrism. Jewish activist organizations like the ADL, the American Je wish Committee, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and the neoconservative think tanks are not creations of the fundamentalist and Orthodox, but represent the broad Jewish commun ity, including non-religious Jews and Reform Jews. In general, the more actively people ar e involved in the Jewish community, the more committed they are to preventing intermarriag e and retaining Jewish ethnic cohesion. And"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 despite a considerable level of intermarriage among less committed Jews, th e leadership of the Jewish community in the U.S. is at present not ma de up of the offspring of intermarried people to any significant extent. Jewish ethnocentrism is ultimately simple tr aditional human ethnocentr ism, although it is certainly among the more extreme vari eties. But what is so fascina ting is the cloak of intellectual support for Jewish ethnocentrism, the complexi ty and intellectual s ophistication of the rationalizations for it—some of which are reviewed in Separation and Its Discontents 58 and the rather awesome hypocrisy (or cold-blooded d eception) of it, given Jewish opposition to ethnocentrism among Europeans. II. J EWS A RE I NTELLIGENT ( AND W EALTHY ) The vast majority of U.S. Jews are Ashkenazi Jews. This is a very in telligent group, with an average IQ of approximately 115 an d verbal IQ cons iderably higher. 59 Since verbal IQ is the best predictor of occupational success and upward mobility in contemporary societies, 60 it is not surprising that Jews are an elite group in the United States. Frank Salter has showed that on issues of concern to the Jewish community (Israel, immigration, ethnic policy in general), Jewish groups have four times the influence of Europe an Americans despite representing approximately 2.5% of the population. 61 Recent data indicate that Jewish per capita income in the U.S. is almost double that of non-Jews, a bigger difference than the black-white income gap. 62 Although Jews make up less than 3% of the population, they constitute more than a quarter of the people on the Forbes list of the richest four hundred Americans. Jews constitute 45% of the top forty of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. Fully one-third of all American multimillionaires are Jewish. The percentage of Jewish households with income greater than $50,000 is double that of non-Jews; on the other hand, the percentage of Jewish hous eholds with income less than $20,000 is half that of non-Jews. Twenty percent of professors at leading univer sities are Jewish, and 40% of partners in leading New York and Wa shington D.C. law firms are Jewish. 63 In 1996, there were approximately three hundr es national Jewish or ganizations in the United States, with a combined budget estimated in the range of $6 billi on—a sum greater than the gross national product of half the members of the United Nations. 64 For example, in 2001 the ADL claimed an annual budget of over $50,000,000. 65 There is also a critical mass of very wealthy Jews who are actively involved in fundi ng Jewish causes. Irving Moskowitz funds the settler movement in Israel and pro-Israeli, ne oconservative think tanks in Washington DC, while Charles Bronfman, Ronald Lauder, and the noto rious Marc Rich fund Birthright Israel, a program that aims to increase ethnic cons ciousness among Jews by bringing 20,000 young Jews to Israel every year. George Soros finances liberal immigra tion policy throughout the Western world and also funds Noel Ignatiev and his “Race Traitor” website dedicated to the abolition of the white race. So far as I know, there are no ma jor sources of funding ai med at increasing ethnic consciousness among Europeans or at pr omoting European ethnic interests. 66 Certainly the major sources of conservative funding in the U.S., su ch as the Bradley and Olin Foundations, are not aimed at this sort of thing. Indeed, the Brad ley Foundation has been a major source of funding for the largely Jewish neoconser vative movement and for pro-Isra el think tanks such as the Center for Security Policy. 67 Paul Findley 68 provides numerous examples of Jews using their financial clout to support political candidates with positions that are to the liking of AIPAC and other pro-Israel activist groups in the U.S. This very la rge financial support for pro-Isr ael candidates continues into the present—the most recent examples being the ca mpaigns to unseat Cynthia McKinney and Earl Hilliard from Congress in 2002. Because of their predominantly Jewish funding base, 69 Democratic candidates are partic ularly vulnerable, but all candi dates experience this pressure"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 because Jewish support will be f unneled to their opponents if there is any hint of disagreement with the pro-Israel lobby. Intelligence is also important in providing access to the entire range of influential positions, from the academic world, to the media, to bus iness, politics, and th e legal profession. In CofC I describe several influential Jewish intellectual movements developed by networks of Jews who were motivated to advance Jewish causes and in terests. These movements were the backbone of the intellectual left in the twen tieth century, and their influence continues into the present. Collectively, they call into question the fundamental moral, political, and economic foundations of Western society. These movements have been advocated with great in tellectual passion and moral fervor and with a very hi gh level of theoretical sophistication. As with the neoconservative movement, discussed in the third article in this series , all of these movements had ready access to prestigious mainstream media sources, at least part ly because of the high representation of Jews as owners and producers of mainstream media. 70 All of these movements were strongly represented at prestigiou s universities, and their work was published by prestigious mainstream academic and commercial publishers. Intelligence is also evident in Jewish activism. Jewish activism is like a full court press in basketball: intense pressure from every possible angle. But in addition to the intensity, Jewish efforts are very well organi zed, well funded, and backed up by sophisticated, scholarly intellectual defenses. A good example is the long and ultimately successful attempt to alter U.S. immigration policy. 71 The main Jewish activist organiza tion influencing immigration policy, the American Jewish Committee, was characterized by “strong leadership, in ternal cohesion, well- funded programs, sophisticated lobbying techniques, well-chosen non-Jewish allies, and good timing.” 72 The most visible Jewish activists, such as Louis Marshall, were intellectually brilliant and enormously energetic and resourceful in thei r crusades on behalf of immigration and other Jewish causes. When restrictionist arguments appeared in the media, the American Jewish Committee made sophisticated replies based on at least the appearance of scholarly data, and typically couched in univ ersalist terms as benefiting the w hole society. Articles favorable to immigration were published in national magazines, and letters to the editor were published in newspapers. Talented lawyers initiated legal pr oceedings aimed at preventing the deportation of aliens. The pro-immigration lobby was also very we ll organized. Immigration opponents, such as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and organizations lik e the Immigration Rest riction League were kept under close scrutiny and pressured by lobbyists. Lobbyists in Washington also kept a daily scorecard of voting tendencies as immigration bills wended their way through Congress, and they engaged in intense and successful efforts to convince Presidents Ta ft and Wilson to veto restrictive immigration legislation. Catholic prelates were recrui ted to protest the effects of restrictionist legislation on im migration from Italy and Hungar y. There were well-organized efforts to minimize the negative perceptions of immigration by distribu ting Jewish immigrants around the country and by getting Jewish aliens off public support. Highly visible and noisy mass protest meetings were organized. 73 Intelligence and organization are also apparent in contemporary Jewish lobbying on behalf of Israel. Les Janka, a U.S. Defe nse Department official, noted that, “On all kinds of foreign policy issues the American people just don’t make their voices heard. Jewish groups are the exceptions. They are prepared, superbly briefed. Th ey have their act together. It is hard for bureaucrats not to respond.” 74 Morton A. Klein, national pres ident of the Zionist Organi zation of America (ZOA), is typical of the highly intelligent, competent, and dedicated Jewish activist. The ZOA website"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 states that Klein had a distinguished career as a biostatistician in ac ademe and in government service in the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrati ons. He has received accolades as one of the leading Jewish activists in the U.S., especially by media that are closely associated with Likud policies in Israel. For example, the Wall Street Journal called the ZOA “heroic and the most credible advocate for Israel on the American Je wish scene today” and added that we should “snap a salute to those who we re right about Oslo and Arafat all along,... including Morton Klein who was wise, brave and unflinchingly honest.... [W]hen th e history of the American Jewish struggle in these years is written, Mr. Klein will emerge as an outsized figure.” The website boasts of Klein’s su ccess “against anti-Is rael bias” in textbooks, travel guides, universities, churches, and the media, as well as his work on Capitol Hill.” Klein has led successful efforts to block the appointment of Joe Zogby, an Arab American, to the State Department and the appointment of Strobe Ta lbott, Clinton nominee fo r Deputy Secretary of State. Klein’s pro-Israel articles have appeared in a wide range of mainst ream and Jewish media: New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New Republic, New Yorker, Commentary, Near East Report, Reform Judaism, Moment, Forward, Jerusalem Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, Miami Hera ld, Chicago Tribune, Ha’aretz (Jerusalem), Maariv (Jerusalem), and the Israeli-Russian paper Vesti. Klein’s activism highlights the importance of access to the major media enjoyed by Jewish activists and organizations—a phenomenon that is traceable ultimately to Jewish intelligence. Jews have a very large presence in the media as owners, writers, producers, and editors—far larger than any other identifiable group. 75 In the contemporary world, this presence is especially important with respect to perceptions of Israel. Me dia coverage of Israel in the U.S. is dominated by a pro-Israel bias, whereas in most of the worl d the predominant view is that the Palestinians are a dispossessed people under siege. 76 A critical source of support for Israel is the army of professional pundits “who can be counted upon to support Israel reflexively and without qualification.” 77 Perhaps the most egregious example of pro-Israel bias resulting from Jewish media control is the Asper family, owners of Ca nWest, a company that controls over 33% of the English-language newspapers in Canada. CanWes t inaugurated an editorial policy in which all editorials had to be approved by th e main office. As the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression notes, “the Asper family staunchly supports Israel in its conflicts with Palest inians, and coverage of the Middle East appears to be a particularly sensitive area.” 78 CanWest has exercised control over the content of articles related to Israel by ed iting and spiking articles with pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli views. Journalists who have fa iled to adopt CanWest positions have been reprimanded or dismissed. III. J EWS A RE P SYCHOLOGICALLY I NTENSE I have compared Jewish activism to a full court press—relentlessly intense and covering every possible angle. There is considerable ev idence that Jews are higher than average on emotional intensity. 79 Emotionally intense people are prone to intense emotional experience of both positive and negative emotions. 80 Emotionality may be thought of as a behavioral intensifier—an energizer. Indi viduals high on affect intensity have more complex social networks and more complex lives, including multiple and even conflicting goals. Their goals are intensely sought after. In the case of Jews, this affects the tone a nd intensity of their e fforts at activism. Among Jews there is a critical mass that is intensely committed to Jewish causes—a sort of 24/7, “pull out all the stops” commitment that produces instan t, massive responses on Jewish issues. Jewish activism has a relentless, never-say-die qualit y. This intensity goes hand in hand with the “slippery slope” style of arguing described above: Je wish activism is an intense response because"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 even the most trivial manifestation of anti-Jewish attitudes or behavior is seen as inevitably leading to mass murder of Jews if allowed to continue. Besides its ability to direct Jewish money to its preferred candidate s, a large part of AIPAC’s effectiveness lies in its ability to rapidly mobilize its 60,000 members. “In virtually every congressional district...AIPAC has a group of prominent citizens it can mobilize if an individual senator or representative needs stroking.” 81 When Senator Charles Percy suggested that Israel negotiate with the PLO and be willing to trade land for peace, he was inundated with 2200 telegrams and 4000 letters, 95% against, a nd mainly from the Jewish community in Chicago. 82 The other side is seldom able to muster a response that competes with the intensity of the Jewish response. When President Eisenhower—the last president to sta nd up to the pro-Israel lobby—pressured Israel into withdrawing from th e Sinai in 1957, almost all the mail opposed his decision. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles co mplained, “It is impossible to hold the line because we get no support from th e Protestant elements in the c ountry. All we ge t is a battering from the Jews.” 83 This pales in comparison to the av alanche of 150,000 letters to President Johnson urging support for Israel when Egypt closed the Strait of Tiran in May 1967. This was just prior to the “Six-Day War,” during whic h the U.S. provided a great deal of military assistance and actively cooperated in the cover-up of the assault on the USS Liberty . Jews had learned from their defeat at the hands of Ei senhower and had redoubled their lobbying efforts, creating by all accounts the most effective lobby in Washington. Pressure on officials in the St ate and Defense departments is relentless and intense. In the words of one official, “One has to keep in mi nd the constant character of this pressure. The public affairs staff of the Near East Bureau in the State Department figures it will spend about 75 percent of its time dealing with Jewish groups. Hundreds of such groups get appointments in the executive branch each year.” 84 Psychological intensity is also t ypical of Israelis. For example, the Israelis are remarkably persistent in their attempts to obtain U.S. military hardware. The following comment illustrates not only the relentless, intense pressure, but also the aggressiveness of Jewish pursuit of their interests: “They would never take no for an answ er. They never gave up. These emissaries of a foreign government always had a shopping list of wanted military items, some of them high technology that no other nation possessed, some of it secret devices that gave the United States an edge over any adversary.” 85 Even though small in number, the effects are enormous. “They never seem to sleep, guarding Is rael’s interests around the clock.” 86 Henry Kissinger made the following comment on Israeli negotiating tac tics. “In the combination of single-minded persistence and convoluted t actics the Israelis preserve in the interlocutor only those last vestiges of sanity and coherence needed to sign the final document.” 87 IV. J EWS A RE A GGRESSIVE Being aggressive and “pushy” is part of the stereotype of Jews in Western societies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of scientific st udies on this aspect of Jewish personality. Hans Eysenck, renowned for his research on personality, claims that Jews are indeed rated more aggressive by people who know them well. 88 Jews have always behaved aggressively toward those they have lived among, and they have been perceived as aggressive by their critics. What strikes the reader of Henry Ford’s The International Jew ( TIJ ), written in the early 1920s, is its portrayal of Jewish intensity and aggressiveness in asserting their interests. 89 As TIJ notes, from Biblical times Jews have endeavored to enslave and domin ate other peoples, ev en in disobedience of divine command, quoting the Old Testament, “And it came to pass, when Israel was str ong, that they put the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.\" In the Old Testament the relationship between Israel and foreigners is one of domina tion: For example, “They shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; And they shall fa ll down unto thee. They shall make supplication unto thee” (Isa. 45:14); “They shall bow down to th ee with their face to the earth, And lick the dust of thy feet” (49:23). Simila r sentiments appear in Trito-Is aiah (60:14, 61:5–6), Ezekiel (e.g., 39:10), and Ecclesiasticus (36:9). The apotheosis of Jewish attitudes of conquest can be seen in the Book of Jubilees, where worl d domination and great reproductiv e success are promised to the seed of Abraham: I am the God who created heaven and earth. I sh all increase you, and multiply you exceedingly; and kings shall come from you and shall rule wherever the foot of the sons of man has trodden. I shall give to your seed all the earth which is under he aven, and they shall rule over all the nations according to their desire; and afterwards they sh all draw the whole earth to themselves and shall inherit it for ever (Jub. 32:18-19). Elsewhere I have noted that a major theme of anti-Jewish attitudes throughout the ages has been Jewish economic domination. 90 The following petition from the citizens of the German town of Hirschau opposed allowing Jews to live there because Jews were seen as aggressive competitors who ultimately dominate the people they live among: If only a few Jewish families settle here, all sma ll shops, tanneries, hardware stores, and so on, which, as things stand, provide th eir proprietors with nothing but th e scantiest of livelihoods, will in no time at all be superseded and completely crushed by these [Jews] such that at least twelve local families will be reduced to beggary, and our poor reli ef fund, already in utter extremity, will be fully exhausted within one year. The Jews come into possession in the shortest possible time of all cash money by getting involved in every business; they rapidly become the only possessors of money, and their Christian neighbors become their debtors. 91 Late nineteenth-century Zioni sts such as Theodor Herzl we re quite aware that a prime source of modern anti-Jewish attitudes was th at emancipation had brought Jews into direct economic competition with the non-Jewish middle classes, a competition that Jews typically won. Herzl “insisted that one coul d not expect a majority to ‘let themselves be subjugated’ by formerly scorned outsiders whom they had just released from the ghetto.” 92 The theme of economic domination has often been combined with the view that Jews are personally aggressive. In the Middle Ages Jews were seen as “pitiless creditors.” 93 The philosopher Immanuel Kant stated that Jews were “a nation of usurers . . . outwitting the people amongst whom they find shelter.... They make the slogan ‘let the buyer beware’ th eir highest principle in dealing with us.” 94 In early twentieth-century America, the sociologist Ed ward A. Ross commented on a greater tendency among Jewish immigrants to maximize their advantage in all transactions, ranging from Jewish students badg ering teachers for higher grades to Jewish poor attempting to get more than the usual charitable allotment. “No other immigrants are so noisy, pushing and disdainful of the rights of others as the Hebrews.” 95 The authorities complain that the East European Hebrews feel no reverence for law as such and are willing to break any ordinance they find in their wa y.... The insurance compani es scan a Jewish fire risk more closely than any other. Credit men sa y the Jewish merchant is often “slippery” and will “fail” in order to get rid of his debts. For lying the immigrant has a very bad reputation. In the North End of Boston “the readiness of the Jews to commit perjury has passed into a proverb.” 96 These characteristics have at times been noted by Jews themselves. In a survey commissioned by the American Jewish Committ ee’s study of the Jews of Baltimore in 1962, “two-thirds of the respondents admitted to believ ing that other Jews are pushy, hostile, vulgar, materialistic, and the cause of anti-Semitism. A nd those were only the ones who were willing to admit it.” 97 "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Jews were unique as an American immigran t group in their hostility toward American Christian culture and in their energetic, a ggressive efforts to change that culture. 98 From the perspective of Ford’s TIJ , the United States had impor ted around 3,500,000 mainly Yiddish- speaking, intensely Jewish immigrants over the prev ious forty years. In that very short period, Jews had had enormous effect on American societ y, particularly in their attempts to remove expressions of Christianity from public life beginning with an attempt in 1899–1900 to remove the word “Christian” from the Virginia Bill of Rights: “The Jews’ determination to wipe out of public life every sign of the predominant Christia n character of the U.S. is the only active form of religious intolerance in the country today.” 99 A prototypical example of Jewish aggressiveness toward American culture has been Jewish advocacy of liberal immigration policies which have had a transformative effect on the U.S.: In undertaking to sway immigration policy in a liberal direction, Jewish spokespersons and organizations demonstrated a degree of energy unsurpassed by any other interested pressure group. Immigration had constituted a prime object of conc ern for practically every major Jewish defense and community relations organization. Over the years, their spokespersons had assiduously attended congressional hearings, and the Jewish effort was of the utmost importance in establishing and financing such non-sectarian groups as the Nationa l Liberal Immigration League and the Citizens Committee for Displaced Persons. 100 Jewish aggressiveness and their ro le in the media, in the creation of culture and information in the social sciences and humanities, and in the political process in the United States contrasts with the role of Overseas Chinese. 101 The Chinese have not formed a hostile cultural elite in Southeast Asian countries motivated by historical grievances against the people and culture of their hosts. For example, despite their econ omic dominance, the Chinese have not been concerned with restrictions on their citizenship rights, which have been common in Southeast Asia. 102 Whereas the Chinese have reacted rather passively to such restrictions, Jews have reacted to any manifestation of anti-Jewis h attitudes or behavior with an all-out effort at eradication. Indeed, we have seen that the mainstream Jewish attitude is that even trivial manifestations of anti-Jewish attitudes and behavior must not be ignored because they can a nd will lead to mass murder. Not only have the Chinese not attempte d to remove public displays of symbols of Indonesian nationalism and religion, they have not seriously attemp ted to change laws in place since the 1960s mandating that there be no public displays of Chinese culture. 103 Besides the normal sorts of lobbyi ng typical of the political pro cess in the U.S., perhaps the clearest examples of Jewish aggressiveness ar e the many examples of intimidation of their opponents—loss of job, death threat s, constant harassment, econom ic losses such as loss of advertising revenue for media businesses, and charges of anti-Semitism—the last being perhaps the greatest sin against the post-World War II polit ical order that can be imagined. When Adlai Stevenson III was running for governor of Illinois , his record in opposition to Israeli settlement policy and his statement that the PLO was a legitimate voice of the Palestinian people resulted in a whisper campaign that he was an anti-Semite. Stevenson commented: There is an intimidating, activist minority of Ameri can Jews that supports the decisions of the Israeli government, right or wrong. They do so very vocally and very aggressively in ways that intimidate others so that it’s their voice—even though it is a minority—that is heard in American politics. But it still is much louder in the United States than in Israel. In other words, you have a much stronger, more vocal dissent in Israel than within the Jewish community in the United States. The prime minister of Israel has far more influence over Amer ican foreign policy in the Middle East than over the policies of his own government generally. 104 A common tactic has been to charge that critic s of Israel are anti-Semites. Indeed, George Ball, a perceptive critic of Israel and its U.S. constituency, maintains that the charge of anti- Semitism and guilt over the Holocaust is the Is raeli lobby’s most eff ective weapon—outstripping"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 its financial clout. 105 The utility of these psyc hological weapons in turn derives from the very large Jewish influence on the U.S. media. Hist orian Peter Novick notes regarding the importance of the Holocaust in contemporary American life: We [i.e., Jews] are not just “the people of the book,” but the people of the Hollywood film and the television miniseries, of the magazine article a nd the newspaper column, of the comic book and the academic symposium. When a high level of concer n with the Holocaust became widespread in American Jewry, it was, given the important role that Jews play in American media and opinion- making elites, not only natural, but virtually inevita ble that it would spread throughout the culture at large. 106 And, of course, the appeal to the Holocaust is especially compelling for American Jews. When the Mossad wants to recruit U.S. Jews for help in its espionage wo rk, in the words of a CIA agent “the appeal is a simple one: ‘Whe n the call went out and no one heeded it, the Holocaust resulted.’ “ 107 Charges of anti-Semitism and guilt over the Holocaust are not the only instruments of Jewish aggressiveness on Israeli issues. Jewish groups intimidate their enemies by a variety of means. People who oppose policies on Israel advo cated by Jewish activist organizations have been fired from their jobs, harassed with lett ers, subjected to intrusive surveillance, and threatened with death. A lthough there is a great deal of self-censorship in the media on Israel as a result of the major role of Jews in the owne rship and production of the media, gaps in this armor are aggressively closed. There are “thr eats to editors and adve rtising departments, orchestrated boycotts, slanders, campaigns of character assassination, and personal vendettas.” 108 Other examples recounted by Findley includ e pressure on the Federal Communications Commission to stop broadcast licenses, demands fo r submission to an oversight committee prior to publication, and the stationing of a Jewi sh activist in the newsroom of the Washington Post in order to monitor the process. The result of all this intense, well-organized aggression is that Those who criticize Israeli policy in any sustained way invite painful and relentless retaliation, and even loss of their livelihood by pressure from one or more parts of Israel’s lobby. Presidents fear it. Congress does its bidding. Prestigious universiti es shun academic programs and buckle under its pressure. Instead of having their arguments and opini ons judged on merit, critics of Israel suddenly find their motivations, their integrity, and basic moral values called into question. No matter how moderate their criticism, they may be characterized as pawns of the oil lobby, apologists for Arabs, or even anti-Semitic. 109 The following quote from Henry Kissinger sums up the aggressive Israeli attitudes toward U.S. aid: Yitzak [Rabin] had many extraordinary qualities, but the gift of human relations was not one of them. If he had been handed the entire “United States Strategic Air Command” as a free gift he would have (a) affected the attitude that at la st Israel was getting its due, and (b) found some technical shortcoming in the airplanes that made his accepting them a reluctant concession to us. 110 But of course by far the most important exam ples of Israeli aggres siveness have been toward their neighbors in the Middle East. This aggression has been there from the beginning, as Israel has consistently put pr essure on border areas with incursions, including the Kibya massacre of 1953 led by Ariel Sharon. 111 The personal aggressiveness of Israeli society has long been a topic of commentators. Israel is known fo r its arrogance, insolen ce (chutzpah), coldness, roughness, rudeness, and lack of civility. For example, B. Z. S obel, an Israeli so ciologist at the University of Haifa, found that among the motivations for emigrating from Israel was that “there is indeed an edginess [in Isra eli society]; tempers flare, a nd verbal violence is rampant” 112 "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 C ONCLUSION The current situation in the United States is the result of an awesom e deployment of Jewish power and influence. One must contemplate the fact that American Jews have managed to maintain unquestioned support for Israel over the la st thirty-five years de spite Israel’s seizing land and engaging in a brutal occupation of the Palestinians in the occupied territories—an occupation that will most like ly end with expulsion or comple te subjugation, degradation, and apartheid. During this same period Jewish orga nizations in America have been a principal force—in my view the main force—for erec ting a state dedicated to suppressing ethnic identification among Europeans, for encouragi ng massive multi-ethnic immigration into the U.S., and for erecting a legal system and cultural ideology that is obsessively sensitive to the complaints and interests of ethnic minorities: the culture of the Holocaust. 113 American Judaism is well organized and lavish ly funded. It has achieved a great deal of power, and it has been successful in achieving its interests. 114 One of the great myths often promulgated by Jewish apologists is that Jews have no consensus and therefore cannot wield any real power. Yet there is in fact a great deal of consensus on broad Jewish issues, particularly in the areas of Israel and the welfare of other foreign Jewries, immigration and refugee policy, church-state separation, aborti on rights, and civil liberties. 115 Massive changes in public policy on these issues, beginning with th e counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s, coincide with the period of increasing Jewish power and influence in the United Stat es. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to find any significant area where public policy conflicts with the attitudes of mainstream Jewish organizations. Later papers in this series will discuss concre te examples of Jewish activism: The history of Zionism as a radical Jewish movement and the presently infl uential Jewish neoconservative movement.

He also notes th at, “In the world of animals, ants perhaps provide Homo 's nearest equivalent for typical broadness of niche. If an unspecialized ant species had a Bible, I’d expect to find in it extremely similar injunctions about food, ant genocide, and so forth, as I find in the actual Bible, and I would have no difficulty to suppose these as serving each ant colony well in its struggle for existence” (p. 271). 14.

Zionism began among the most ethnocentric Eastern European Jew s and had explicitly r acialist and nationalist overtones. However, Zionism was viewed as dangerous among the wider Jewish community, especially the partially assimilated Jews in Western countries, because it opened Jews up to charges of disloyalty and because the Zionists’ open racialism and ethnocentric nationalism conflicted with the assimilationist strategy then dominant among Western Jews. Zionist activists eventually succeeded in making Zionism a mainstream Jewish movement, due in large part to the sheer force of numbers of the Eastern European vanguard. Over time, the more militant, expansionist Zionists (the Jabo tinskyists, the Likud Party, fundamentalists, and West Bank settlers) have won th e day and have continued to push for territorial expansion within Israel. This has led to conflicts with Palestinians and a widespread belief among Jews that Israel itself is threatened. The result has been a heightened group consciousness among Jews and ultimately support for Zionist ex tremism among the entire organized American Jewish community. In the first part of this series I discussed Jewi sh ethnocentrism as a central trait influencing the success of Jewish activism. 1 In the contemporary world, the mo st important example of Jewish ethnocentrism and extremism is Zionism. In fact, Zionism is incredibly important. As of this writing, the United States has recently accomplished the destruction of the Iraqi regime, and it is common among influential Jews to advocate wa r between the United States and the entire Muslim world. In a recent issue of Commentary (an influential journal published by the American Jewish Committee), editor Norman Podhoret z states, “The regimes that richly deserve to be overthrown and replaced are not confined to the three singled-out members of the axis of evil [i.e., Iraq, Iran, and North Korea]. At a mi nimum, the axis should extend to Syria and Lebanon and Libya, as well as ’friends’ of Amer ica like the Saudi royal family and Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, along with the Palestinian Author ity, whether headed by Ar afat or one of his henchmen.” 2 More than anything else, this is a list of countries that Israel doesn’t like, and, as I discuss in the third part of this series, intens ely committed Zionists with close links to Israel occupy prominent positions in the Bush administra tion, especially in the Department of Defense and on the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney. The long-term consequence of Zionism is that the U.S. is on the verge of attempting to co mpletely transform the Arab/Muslim world to produce governments that accept Israel and whatever fate it decides for the Palestinians, and, quite possibly, to set the stage fo r further Israeli expansionism. Zionism is an example of an important principle in Jewish history: At all the turning points, it is the more ethnocentric elements—one might term them the radicals —who have determined the direction of the Jewish community and eventually won the day. 3 As recounted in the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, the Jews who returned to Israel after the Babylonian captivity energetically rid the community of those who had intermarried with the racially impure remnant left behind. Later, during the pe riod of Greek dominance, there was a struggle between the pro- Greek assimilationists and the more committed Jews, who came to be known as Maccabeans. At that time there appeared in Israel a group of re negade Jews, who incited the people. “Let us enter into a covenant with the Gentiles round about,” they said, “because disaster upon disaster has"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 overtaken us since we segregated ourselves from th em.” The people thought this a good argument, and some of them in their enthusiasm went to the king and received authority to introduce non- Jewish laws and customs. They built a sports st adium in the gentile st yle in Jerusalem. They removed their marks of circumcision and repudiated the holy covenant. They intermarried with Gentiles, and abandoned themselves to evil ways. 4 The victory of the Maccabeans r eestablished Jewish law and put an end to assimilation. The Book of Jubilees, written during this period, represents the epitome of ancient Jewish nationalism, in which God represents the national interests of the Jewish people in dominating all other peoples of the world: I am the God who created heaven and earth. I sh all increase you, and multiply you exceedingly; and kings shall come from you and shall rule wherever the foot of the sons of man has trodden. I shall give to your seed all the earth which is under he aven, and they shall rule over all the nations according to their desire; and afterwards they sh all draw the whole earth to themselves and shall inherit it forever. 5 A corollary of this is that th roughout history in times of trouble there has been an upsurge in religious fundamentalism, mysticism, and messianism. 6 For example, during the 1930s in Germany liberal Reform Jews became more consci ous of their Jewish identity, increased their attendance at synagogue, and returned to more tr aditional observance (including a reintroduction of Hebrew). Many of them became Zionists. 7 As I will discuss in the following, every crisis in Israel has resulted in an increase in Jewish identity and intense mobilization of support for Israel. Today the people who are being rooted out of th e Jewish community are Jews living in the Diaspora who do not support the aims of the Likud Pa rty in Israel. The overall argument here is that Zionism is an example of the trajectory of Jewish radicalism. The radical movement begins among the more committed segments of the Je wish community, then spreads and eventually becomes mainstream within the Jewish community ; then the most extreme continue to push the envelope (e.g., the settlement movement on the We st Bank), and other Jews eventually follow because the more extreme positions come to define the essence of Jewish identity. An important part of the dynamic is that Jewish radicalism te nds to result in conflicts with non-Jews, with the result that Jews feel threatened, become mo re group-oriented, and close ranks against the enemy—an enemy seen as irrationally and incomp rehensibly anti-Jewish. Jews who fail to go along with what is now a mainstream position ar e pushed out of the community, labeled “self- hating Jews” or worse, and relegated to impotence.

O RIGINS OF Z IONISM IN E THNIC C ONFLICT IN E ASTERN E UROPE The origins of Zionism and ot her manifestations of the in tense Jewish dynamism of the twentieth century lie in the Yiddi sh-speaking world of Eastern Eu rope in the early nineteenth century. Originally invited in by nobles as estate managers, toll farmers, bankers, and moneylenders, Jews in Poland expanded into comm erce and then into artisanry, so that there came to be competition between Jews and non-Jewish butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and tailors. This produced the ty pical resource-based anti-Jewish attitudes and behavior so common th roughout Jewish history. 8 Despite periodic restrictions and outbursts of hostility, Jews came to dominate the entire economy apart from agricultural labor and the nobility. Jews had an advantage in the competition in trade and artisanry because they were able to control the trade in raw materials a nd sell at lower prices to coethnics. 9 This increasing economic domination went along with a great increase in the population of Jews. Jews not only made up large percentages of urban populations, they increasingly migrated to small towns and rural areas. In short, Jews had overshot their economic niche: The economy was unable to support this burgeoning Jewish population in the sorts of positions that Jews had traditionally filled, with the resu lt that a large percentage of the Jewish population became mired in poverty. The result was a caul dron of ethnic hostility, with the government placing various restrictions on Jewish economic activity; rampant anti-Jewish atti tudes; and increasing Jewish desperation. The main Jewish response to this situation wa s an upsurge of fundamentalist extremism that coalesced in the Hasidic movement and, later in the nineteenth cen tury, into political radicalism and Zionism as solutions to Jewish problems. Jewish populations in Eastern Europe had the highest rate of natural increas e of any European population in the nineteenth century, with a natural increase of 120,000 per year in the 1880s and an overall increase within the Russian Empire from one to six million in the course of the nineteenth century. 10 Anti-Semitism and the exploding Jewish population, combined with economic adversity, were of critical importance for producing the sheer numbers of disaffected Jews who dreamed of deliverance in various messianic movements—the ethnocentric mysticism of the Kabbala, Zionism, or the dream of a Marxist political revolution. Religious fanaticism and messianic expectations have been a typical Jewish response to hard times throughout history. 11 For example, in the eighteent h-century Ottoman Empire there was “an unmistakable picture of gri nding poverty, ignorance, and insecurity” 12 among Jews that,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 in the context of high levels of anti-Semitism, effectively prevented Jewish upward mobility. These phenomena were accompanied by the preval ence of mysticism and a high fertility rate among Jews, which doubtlessly exacerbated the problems. The Jewish population explosion in Eastern Eur ope in the context of poverty and politically imposed restrictions on Jews was responsible fo r the generally destabiliz ing effects of Jewish radicalism in Eastern Europe and Russia up to th e revolution. These conditi ons also had spillover effects in Germany, where the negativ e attitudes toward the immigrant Ostjuden (Eastern Jews) and their foreign, clannish ways contri buted to the anti-Semitism of the period. 13 In the United States, radical political beliefs held by a great many Jewish immigrants and their descendants persisted even in the absence of difficult eco nomic and political conditions and have had a decisive influence on U.S. political and cultural hi story into the present. The persistence of these beliefs influenced the general political sensib ility of the Jewish community and has had a destabilizing effect on American society, ranging from the paranoia of the McCarthy era to the triumph of the 1960s countercultural revolution. 14 In the contemporary world, the descendants of these religious fundamentalists constitute the core of th e settler movement and other manifestations of Zionist extremism in Israel. The hypothesis pursued here is that Jewish population dynamics beginning in the nineteenth century resulted in a feed-forward dynamic: Increasing success in economic competition led to increased population. This in tu rn led to anti-Jewish reactions and eventually to Jewish overpopulation, poverty, anti-Jewish hos tility, and religious fanaticism as a response to external threat. In this regard, Jewish populations are quite the opposite of Eu ropean populations, in which there is a long history of curtailing repr oduction in the face of perceived scarcity of resources. 15 This may be analyzed in terms of th e individualism/collectivism dimension, which provides a general contrast betwee n Jewish and European culture: 16 Individualists curtail reproduction in response to adversity in order to better their own lives, whereas a group-oriented culture such as Judaism responds to adversity by strengtheni ng group ties; forming groups with charismatic leaders and a strong sense of ingr oup and outgroup; adopti ng mystical, messianic ideologies; and increasing their fertility—a ll of which lead to greater conflict. There is an association between religious or ethnic fanaticism and fertil ity, and it is quite common for competing ethnic groups to increase thei r fertility in response to perceived external threats. 17 Ethnic activists respond to the perceived n eed to increase the numbers of their group in several ways, including exhorting coethnics to re produce early and often, banning birth control and abortions, curtailing female employment in order to free wo men for the task of reproducing, and providing financial incentives. In the contemporary world, Jewish activists both within Israel and in the Diaspora have been strong advocates of increasing Jewish fertility, motivated by the threat of intermarriage in the Diaspora, the thr eat of wars with Israel’s neighbors, and as a reaction to Jewish population lo sses stemming from the Holo caust. Pro-natalism has deep religious significance for Jews as a religious commandment. 18 Within Israel, there is “a nationwide obsession with fertility,” as indicate d by the highest rate of in-vitro fertilization clinics in the world—one for every 28,000 citizens. This is more than matched by the Palestinians. Originating in the same group-orient ed, collectivist cultur e area as the Jews, the Palestinians have the highest birth rate in th e world and have been strongly attracted to charismatic leaders, messianic religious ideology, and desperate, suicidal solutions for their political problems. 19 For the Jews, the religious f undamentalism characteristic of Eastern Europe from around 1800–1940 has been a demographic wellspring for Juda ism. Jewish populations in the West have tended to have low fertility. Be ginning in the nineteenth cent ury, Western Jewish populations would have stagnated or declined in the absen ce of “the unending stream of immigrants from"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Jewish communities in the East.” 20 But the point here is that th is demographic wellspring created the stresses and strains within this very tale nted and energetic population that continue to reverberate in the modern world. These trends can be seen by describing the numerically dominant Hasidic population in early nineteenth-century Galicia, then a province of the Austro-Hungarian empire; similar phenomena occurred throughout the Yiddish-speaking, religiously fundamentalist culture area of Eastern Europe, most of which came to be governed by the Russian empire. 21 Beginning in the late eighteenth century, there were increasing rest rictions on Jewish economic activity, such as edicts preventing Jews from operating taverns, e ngaging in trade, and leasing mills. There were restrictions on where Jews could live, and ghettos were established in order to remove Jews from competition with non-Jews; taxes specific to Jews were imposed; there were government efforts to force Jewish assimilation, as by requiring th e legal documents be in the German language. These laws, even though often little enforced, reflected the anti-Jewish animosity of wider society and undoubtedly increased Jewish insecuri ty. In any case, a large percentage of the Jewish population was impoverished and doubtless woul d have remained so even in the absence of anti-Jewish attitudes and legislation. Indeed, the emigration of well over three million Jews to Western Europe and the New World did little to ease the grinding poverty of a large majority of the Jewish population. It was in this atmosphere that Hasidism rose to dominance in Eastern Europe. The Hasidim passionately rejected all the assimilatory pressures coming from the government. They so cherished the Yiddish language that well into the twentie th century the vast majority of Eastern European Jews could not speak the langua ges of the non-Jews living around them. 22 They turned to the Kabbala (the writi ngs of Jewish mystics), superstition, and anti-rationalism, believing in “magical remedies, amulets, exorcisms, de monic possession (dybbuks), ghosts, devils, and teasing, mischievous genies.” 23 Corresponding to this intense ingr oup feeling were attitudes that non-Jews were less than human. “As Mendel of Ry manów put it, ‘A Gentile does not have a heart, although he has an orga n that resembles a heart.’ ” 24 All nations exist only by virtue of the Jewish people: “Erez Yisreal [the land of Israel] is the essence of the world and all vitality stems from it.” 25 Similar attitudes are common among contem porary Jewish fundamentalists and the settler movement in Israel. 26 The Hasidim had an attitude of absolute faith in the person of the zaddic , their rebbe, who was a charismatic figure seen by his followers literally as the personification of God in the world. Attraction to charismatic leaders is a fund amental feature of Jewish social organization— apparent as much among religious fundamentalists as among Jewish political radicals or elite Jewish intellectuals. 27 The following account of a scene at a synagogue in Galicia in 1903 describes the intense emotionality of the community and its total subordination to its leader: There were no benches, and several thousand Jews were standing closely packed together, swaying in prayer like the corn in the wind. When the ra bbi appeared the service began. Everybody tried to get as close to him as possible. The rabbi led the prayers in a thin, weep ing voice. It seemed to arouse a sort of ecstasy in the listeners. They clo sed their eyes, violently swaying. The loud praying sounded like a gale. Anyone seeing these Jews in pray er would have concluded that they were the most religious people on earth. 28 At the end of the service, thos e closest to the rabbi were in tensely eager to eat any food touched by him, and the fish bones were preser ved by his followers as relics. Another account notes that “devotees hoping to catch a spark from this holy fire run to receive him.” 29 The power of the zaddic extends so far “that whatever God doe s, it is also within the capacity of the zaddic to do.” 30 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 An important role for the zaddi c is to produce wealth for the Jews, and by taking it from the non-Jews. According to Hasidic doc trine, the non-Jews have the preponderance of good things, but It was the zaddic who was to reverse this situati on. Indeed, R. Meir of Opatów never wearied of reiterating in his homilies that the zaddik must direct his prayer in a way that the abundance which he draws down from on high should not be squander ed during its descent, and not “wander away,” that is, outside, to the Gentiles, but that it mainly reach the Jews, the holy people, with only a residue flowing to the Gentiles, who are “the other side” (Satan’s camp). 31 The zaddics’ sermons were filled with pleas for vengeance and hatred toward the non-Jews, who were seen as the source of their problems. These groups were highly aut horitarian—another fundamental feature of Jewish social organization. 32 Rabbis and other elite members of the community had extraordinary power over other Jews in traditional societies—literally the power of life and death. Jews who informed the authorities about the ille gal activities of other Je ws were liquidated on orde rs of secret rabbinical courts, with no opportunity to defend themselves. Jews accused of heretical religious views were beaten or murdered. Their books were burned or buried in cemeteries. When a heretic died, his body was beaten by a special burial committee, placed in a cart filled with dung, and deposited outside the Jewish cemetery. In places where the authorities were lax, there were often pitched battles between different Jewish sects, often over trivial religious points such as what kind of shoes a person should wear. In 1838 the governor of southwestern Russia issued a directive that the police keep tabs on synagogues because “Ver y often something happens that leaves dead Jews in its wake.” 33 Synagogues had jails near the entrance, and prisoner s were physically abused by the congregation as they filed in for services. Not surprisingly, these groups had extraordinar y solidarity; a government official observed, “The Hasidim are bound to each other with heart and soul.” 34 This solidarity was based not only on the personality of the rebbe and the powerful so cial controls described above, but on the high levels of within-group generosity which alleviated to some extent their poverty. Needless to say, Hasidic solidarity was seen as threatening by ou tsiders: “How much longer will we tolerate the Hasidic sect, which is united by such a str ong bond and whose members help one another.” 35 Hasidism triumphed partly by its attraction to the Jewish mass es and partly because of the power politics of the rebbes: Opposing rabbis were forced out, so by the ear ly nineteenth century in Galicia, Poland, and the Ukraine, the vast ma jority of Jews were in Hasidic communities. Their triumph meant the failure of the Jewish Enlightenment (the Haskalah ) in Eastern Europe. The Haskalah movement advocated greater assi milation with non-Jewish society, as by using vernacular languages, studying secula r subjects, and not adopting di stinguishing forms of dress, although in other ways their commitment to J udaism remained powerful. These relatively assimilated Jews were the relatively thin upper cr ust of wealthy merchants and others who were free of the economic and social pressures that fu eled Hasidism. They often cooperated with the authorities in attempts to force the Hasidim to assi milate out of fear that Hasidic behavior led to anti-Jewish attitudes. As noted above, one source of the inward uni ty and psychological fanaticism of Jewish communities was the hostility of the surroundi ng non-Jewish population. Jews in the Russian Empire were hated by all the non-Jewish classes, w ho saw them as an exploitative class of petty traders, middlemen, innkeepers, store ow ners, estate agents, and money lenders. 36 Jews “were viewed by the authorities and by much of th e rest of population as a foreign, separate, exploitative, and distre ssingly prolific nation.” 37 In 1881 these tensions boiled over into several anti-Jewish pogroms in a great many towns of southe rn and southwestern Russia. It was in this"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 context that the first large-scal e stirrings of Zionism emerged. 38 From 1881–1884, dozens of Zionist groups formed in the Russian Empire and Romania. Political radicalism emerged from the same intensely Jewish communities during this period and for much the same reasons. 39 Political radicalism often coexisted with messianic forms of Zionism as well as intense commitment to Jewish nationalism and religious and cultural separatism, and many individuals he ld various and often rapidly ch anging combinations of these ideas. 40 The two streams of political radicalism and Zionism, each stemming from the teeming fanaticism of threatened Jewish populations in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe, continue to reverberate in the modern wo rld. In both England and Ameri ca the immigration of Eastern European Jews after 1880 had a transformative effect on the political attitudes of the Jewish community in the direction of radical politics and Zionism, of ten combined with religious orthodoxy. 41 The immigrant Eastern European Jews demographically swamped the previously existing Jewish communities in both countries, and the older community reacted to this influx with considerable trepidation because of the po ssibility of increased anti-Semitism. Attempts were made by the established Jewish communities to misrepresent the prevalence of radical political ideas and Zionism among the immigrants. 42 The Zionist and radical solutions for Jewish pr oblems differed, of course, with the radicals blaming the Jewish situation on the economic structure of societ y and attempting to appeal to non-Jews in an effort to completely restruct ure social and economic relationships. (Despite attempting to appeal to non-Jews, the vast major ity of Jewish radicals had a very strong Jewish communal identity and often worked in an entirely Jewish milieu. 43 ) Among Zionists, on the other hand, it was common from very early on to see the Jewish situation as resulting from irresoluble conflict between Je ws and non-Jews. The early Zionist Moshe Leib Lilienblum emphasized that Jews were strangers who competed with local peoples: “A stranger can be received into a family, but only as a guest. A guest who bothers, or competes with or displaces an authentic member of the household is promp tly and angrily reminded of his status by the others, acting out of a se nse of self-protection.” 44 Later, Theodor Herzl argued that a prime source of modern anti-Semitism was that Jews had come into direct economic competition with the non-Jewish middle classes. Anti-Semitism based on resource competition was rational: Herzl “insisted that one could not expe ct a majority to ‘let themselv es be subjugated’ by formerly scorned outsiders whom they had just released from the ghetto.... I find the anti-Semites are fully within their rights.” 45 In Germany, Zionists analyzed anti-Semitism during the Weimar period as “the inevitable and justifiable response of one people to attempts by another to make it share in the formation of its de stiny. It was an inst inctive response independent of reason and will, and hence common to all peoples, the Jews included.” 46 As was often the case during the period, Zionists had a much clearer un derstanding of their fellow Jews and the origins of anti-Jewish attitudes. Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, a prominent Zionist and leader of the American Jewish Congress w hose membership derived from Eastern Europe immigrants and their descendants, accused Wester n European Jews of deception by pretending to be patriotic citizens while really being Jewish nationalists: “They wore th e mask of the ruling nationality as of old in Spain—t he mask of the ruling religion.” 47 Wise had a well-developed sense of dual loyalty, stating on one occasion “I am not an American citizen of Jewish faith. I am a Jew. I am an American. I have been an American 63/64ths of my life, but I have been a Jew for 4000 years.” 48 Zionists in Western countries were also at the ethnocentric end of the Jewish population. Zionism was seen as a way of combating the a ssimilatory pressures of Western societies:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 “Zionist ideologues and publicists argued that in the West assimilation was as much a threat to the survival of the Jewish peopl e as persecution was in the East.” 49 Zionism openly accepted a national/ethnic conceptualization of Judaism that was quite inde pendent of religious faith. As Theodore Herzl stated, “We are a people—one people.” 50 The Zionist Arthur Hertzberg stated that “the Jews in all ages we re essentially a nation and...all other factor s profoundly important to the life of this people, even religion, were mainly instrumental values.” 51 There were a number of Zionist racial scientists in the period from 1890–1940, including Elias Auerbach, Aron Sandler, Felix Theilhaber, and Ignaz Zollschan. Zionist r acial scientists were motivated by a perceived need to end Jewish intermarriage and preserve Jewish racial purity. 52 Only by creating a Jewish homeland and leaving the assimila tory influences of the Diaspor a could Jews preserve their unique racial heritage. For example, Auerbach advocated Zionism becau se it would return Jews “back into the position they enjoyed before the nineteenth ce ntury—politically autonomous, culturally whole, and racially pure.” 53 Zollschan, whose book on “the Jewish racial question” went through five editions and was well known to both Je wish and non-Jewish anthropologists, 54 praised Houston Stewart Chamberlain and advocated Zionism as the only way to reta in Jewish racial purity from the threat of mixed marriages and assimilation. 55 Zollschan’s description of the phenotypic, and by implication genetic commonality of Jews around th e world is striking. He notes that the same Jewish faces can be seen throughout the Jewish world among Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Oriental Jews. He also remarked on the same mix of bo dy types, head shapes, skin, and hair and eye pigmentation in these widely separated groups. 56 For many Zionists, Jewish racialism went beyond merely asserting and shoring up the ethnic basis of Judaism, to embrace the idea of racial superiority. Consistent with the anti- assimilationist thrust of Zionism, very few Zi onists intermarried, and those who did, such as Martin Buber, found that their marriages were problematic within the wider Zionist community. 57 In 1929 the Zionist leaders of the Berlin Jewish community condemned inte rmarriage as a threat to the “racial purity of stock” and asserted its belief that “consanguinity of the flesh and solidarity of the soul” were essential for developi ng a Jewish nation, as was the “will to establish a closed brotherhood over against all other communities on earth.” 58 Assertions of Zionist racialism continued in to the National Socia list period, where they dovetailed with National Socialist attitudes. Jo achim Prinz, a German Jew who later became the head of the American Jewish C ongress, celebrated Hitler’s as cent to power because it signaled the end of the Enlightenment values, which ha d resulted in assimilation and mixed marriage among Jews: We want assimilation to be replaced by a new law: the declaration of belonging to the Jewish nation and the Jewish race . A state built upon the principle of th e purity of nation and race can only be honoured and respected by a Jew who declares his belonging to his own kind.... For only he who honours his own breed and his own blood can have an attit ude of honour towards the national will of other nations. 59 The common ground of the racial Zionists and their non-Jewish counterparts included the exclusion of Jews from the German Volksgemeinschaft . 60 Indeed, shortly after Hitler came to power, the Zionist Federation of Germany subm itted a memorandum to the German government outlining a solution to the Jewish question and c ontaining the following remarkable statement. The Federation declared that the Enlightenment view that Jews should be absorbed into the nation state discerned only the individual, the single human bei ng freely suspended in space, without regarding the ties of blood and history or spiritual distinctiv eness. Accordingly, the lib eral state demanded of the Jews assimilation [via baptism and mixed marriag e] into the non-Jewish environment.... Thus it"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 happened that innumerable persons of Jewish origin had the chance to occupy important positions and to come forward as representatives of German culture and German life, without having their belonging to Jewry become visible. Thus arose a state of affairs which in political discussion today is termed “debasement of Germandom,” or “Jew ification.” ...Zionism has no illusions about the difficulty of the Jewish condition, which consists above all in an abnormal occupational pattern and in the fault of an intellectual and moral posture not rooted in one’s own tradition. 61 Z IONISM A S A “R ISKY S TRATEGY ” Zionism was a risky strate gy—to use Frank Salter’s term 62 —because it led to charges of dual loyalty. The issue of dual loyalty has b een a major concern throughout the history of Zionism. From the beginnings of Zionism, the va st majority of the movement’s energy and numbers, and eventually its leadership, ste mmed from the Eastern European wellspring of Judaism. 63 In the early decades of the twentieth cen tury, there was a deep conflict within the Jewish communities of Western Europe and th e U.S., pitting the older Jewish communities originating in Western Europe (particularly Germany) against the new arrivals from Eastern Europe, who eventually overwhelm ed them by force of numbers. 64 Thus, an important theme of the history of Jews in America, England, and Ge rmany was the conflict between the older Jewish communities that were committed to some degree of cultural assimilation and the ideals of the Enlightenment, versus the Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Eastern Europe and their commitment to political radicalism, Zionism, and/ or religious fundamentalism. The older Jewish communities were concerned that Zionism would lead to anti-Semitism due to charges of dual loyalty and because Jews would be perceived as a nation and an ethnic group rather than simply as a religion. In England, during the final stages before the issu ance of the Balfour Declaration, Edwin Montagu “made a long, emotional appeal to his colleagues [in the British cabinet]: how could he represent the British gove rnment during the forthcoming mission to India if the same government declared that his (Montagu’s) national hom e was on Turkish territory?” 65 Similar concerns were expressed in th e United States, but by 1937 most American Jews advocated a Jewish state, and the Columbus Platform of th e Reform Judaism of 1937 officially accepted the idea of a Palestinian homeland and shortly thereaf ter accepted the idea of political sovereignty for Jews in Israel. 66 In post–World War I Germany, a major goal of Reform Judaism was to suppress Zionism because of its perceived effect of fanning the flames of anti-Semitism due to charges of Jewish disloyalty. 67 In Mein Kampf, Hitler argued that Jews were an ethnic group and not simply a religion, which was confirmed by his discovery that “among them was a great movement . . . which came out sharply in confirmation of the national character of the Jews: this was the Zionists. ” 68 Hitler went on to remark that although one might suppose that only a subset of Jews were Zionists and that Zionism was condemned by the great major ity of Jews, “the so-called liberal Jews did not reject Zioni sts as non-Jews, but only as Jews with an impractical, perhaps even dangerous, way of publicly avowing thei r Jewishness. Intrinsically they remained unalterably of one piece.” 69 Hitler’s comments reflect the weak position of the Zionists of his day as a small minority of Jews, but they also show the reality of the wo rst fears of the German Reform movement during this period: that the publicly e xpressed ethnocentric nationalism of the Zionists would increase anti-Semitism, because Jews would be perceived not as a religious group but as an ethnic/national entity with no ties to Germa ny. The existence of Zionism as well as of international Jewish organizations such as the Alliance Israélite Universelle (based in France) and continued Jewish cultural separatism were important sources of German anti-Semitism beginning in the late nineteenth century."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 In the Soviet Union, Stalin regarded Jews as politically unreliable after they expressed “overwhelming enthusiasm” for Israel and attempted to emigrate to Israel, especially since Israel was leaning toward the West in the Cold War. 70 During the fighting in 1948, Soviet Jews attempted to organize an army to fight in Israel, and there were a great many other manifestations of Soviet-Jewish solidarity with Israel, particularly in the wake of Jewish enthusiasm during Golda Meir’s visit to the S oviet Union. Stalin perceived a “psychological readiness on the part of the volunteers to be under the jurisd iction of two states—the homeland of all the workers and the hom eland of all the Jews—somet hing that was categorically impossible in his mind.” 71 There is also some indication that Stalin, at the height of the Cold War, suspected that Soviet Jews would not be loyal to the Soviet Union in a war with America because many of them had relatives in America. 72 In the U.S., the dual loyalty issue arose b ecause there was a conflict between perceived American foreign policy interests that began w ith the Balfour Declarat ion of 1917. The U. S. State Department feared that a British protect orate in Palestine would damage commercial interests in the region and that in any case it was not in the intere sts of America to offend Turkey or other Middle Eastern states. 73 While President Woodrow Wils on sympathized with the State Department position, he was eventually persua ded by American Zionists, notably Louis Brandeis, to endorse the decl aration; it was then quickly approved by the British. The dual loyalty issue was also raised in Br itain, most especially after the Second World War, when the Labour government failed to suppor t the creation of a Jewi sh state. Many British Jews gave generously to finance illegal activities in the British protectorate of Palestine, including the smuggling of arms and refug ees and Jewish attacks on British forces. 74 British losses to Jewish terrorism during this period we re not trivial: the bombing of the King David Hotel by future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his associates led to the deaths of eighty-three of the British administrative staff pl us five members of the public. These activities led to widespread hostility to ward Jews, and the Labour governme nt pointedly refused to outlaw anti-Semitism during this period. During the late 1960s and 1970s, charges of dual loyalty appeared in the House of Commons among Labour MPs, one of whom commented that “it is undeniable that many MPs have what I can only te rm a dual loyalty, which is to another nation and another natio n’s interests.” 75 Attitudes ranging from unenthusiastic ambivalen ce to outright hostility to the idea of a Zionist homeland on the pa rt of presidents, the State Department, Congress, or the American public persisted right up until the establishment of Israel in 1948 and beyond. After World War II, there continued to be a perception in the State Department that American interests in the area would not be served by a Jewish homeland, but should be directed at securing oil and military bases to oppose the Soviets. There was also concern that such a homeland would be a destabilizing influence for years to come because of Arab hostility. 76 Truman’s defense secretary, James Forrestal, “was all but obsessed by the thre at to [American interests] he discerned in Zionist ambitions. His concern was shared by the State Department and specifically by the Near East Desk.” 77 In 1960 Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared in response to attempts to coerce Egypt into ag reeing to Israel’s use of the Suez Canal, “in recent years we have seen the rise of organizations dedicated apparently not to America, but to foreign states and groups. The conduct of a foreign policy for America has been seriously compromised by this development.” 78 Truman himself eventually caved in to Zionist pressure out of desire to ensu re Jewish support in the 1948 elec tion, and despite his own recently revealed personal misgivings about Jewish myopia in pursuit of their own interests. 79 Z IONIST E XTREMISM B ECOMES M AINSTREAM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 Since the Second World War, there has been a long evolution such that the American Jewish community now fully supports the settler movement and other right-wing causes within Israel. Zionists made a great deal of progre ss during the Second World War. They engaged in “loud diplomacy,” organizing thousands of rallies, dinners with celebrity speakers (including prominent roles for sympathetic non-Jews), lett er-writing campaigns, mee tings, lobbying, threats against newspapers for publishing unfavorable item s, insertion of propaganda as news items in the press, and giving money to po liticians and non-Jewish celebri ties in return for their support. 80 By 1944, thousands of non-Jewish associations would pass pro-Zionist resolutions, and both Republican and Democratic platforms include d strong pro-Zionist pl anks, even though the creation of a Jewish state was strongly oppos ed by the Departments of State and War. 81 A 1945 poll found that 80.5% of Jews favored a Jewish state, with only 10.5% opposed. 82 This shows that by the end of the Second World War, Zionism had become thoroughly mainstream within the U.S. Jewish communit y. The triumph of Zionism occurred well before consciousness of the Holocaust came to be seen as legitimizing Israel. (Michael Novick dates the promotion of the Holocaust to its present stat us as a cultural icon from the 1967 Six-Day War. 83 ) What had once been radical and viewed as dangerous had become not only accepted, but seen as central to Jewish identity. Since the late 1980s, the American Jewish co mmunity has not been even-handed in its support of Israeli political factions, but has suppor ted the more fanatical el ements within Israel. While wealthy Israelis predominantly support the Labor Party, financ ial support for Likud and other right-wing parties comes from foreign sources, partic ularly wealthy U.S. Jews. 84 The support of these benefactors is endangered by any softening of Likud positions, with support then going to the settler movement. “Organized U. S. Jews are chauvinistic and militaristic in their views.” 85 Within Israel, there has been a transforma tion in the direction of the most radical, ethnocentric, and aggressive elements of th e population. During the 1920s–1940s, the followers of Vladimir Jabotinsky (the “Revisionists”) were the vanguard of Zioni st aggressiveness and strident racial nationalism, but they were a mino rity within the Zionist movement as a whole. Revisionism had several characteristics typical of influential nineteenth-century Jewish intellectual and political movements—features sh ared also with other forms of traditional Judaism. Like Judaism itself and the various he rmeneutic theories typical of other Jewish twentieth-century intellectual m ovements, the philosophy of Revisionism was a closed system that offered a complete worldview “cr eating a self-evident Jewish world.” 86 Like the Hasidic movement and other influential Jewish intellec tual and political movements, Revisionism was united around a charismatic leader figure, in this case Jabo tinsky, who was seen in god-like terms—“Everyone waited for him to speak, clu ng to him for support, and considered him the source of the one and only absolute truth.” 87 There was a powerful sense of “us versus them.” Opponents were demonized: “The style of communi cation . . . was coarse and venomous, aimed at moral delegitimization of th e opponent by denouncing him and even ‘inciting’ the Jewish public against him.” 88 Jabotinsky developed a form of racial nationalism similar to other Zionist racial theorists of the period (see above). He believed that Jews were shaped by their long history as a desert people and that establishment of Israel as a Jewi sh state would allow the natural genius of the Jewish race to flourish. “These natural and fundamental distinc tions embedded in the race are impossible to eradicate, and are continually being nurtured by the differences in soil and climate.” 89 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 The Revisionists advocated military force as a means of obtaining a Jewish state; they wanted a “maximalist” state that would incl ude the entire Palestine Mandate, including the Trans-Jordan (which became the nation of Jordan in 1946). 90 In the 1940s, its paramilitary wing, the Irgun, under the leadership of Menachem Begi n, was responsible for much of the terrorist activities directed against both Arabs and the British forces maintaining the Palestinian Mandate until 1948, including the bombing of th e King David Hotel and the ma ssacre at Deir Yasin that was a major factor in terrorizing much of the Palestinian population into fleeing. 91 Over time, the Labor Party has dwindled in influence, and there has followed the rise and ascendancy of the Likud Party and ultra-nationali sm represented by Begin, who came to power in 1977 and began the process of resurrecting Jabotinsky, 92 by Yitzhak Shamir (commander of LEHI [the Stern Group], another pre-1948 terroris t group), and now by the government of Ariel Sharon, whose long record of aggressive brutality is described briefly below. Fundamentalists and other ultranationalis ts were a relatively weak phenomenon in the 1960s, but have increased to around 25 percent in the late 1990s and are an integral part of Sharon’s government. In other words, the more radical Zionists have won out within Israel. (As Noam Chomsky notes, there has been a consensus on retaining sovereignty over the West Bank, so that the entire Israeli political spectrum must be seen as aggressively expansionist. 93 The differences are differences of degree.) The connections between Jabotinsky and the current Israeli government are more than coincidental: Just before Israel’s election in February 2001, Sharon was interviewed seated “symbolically and ostentatiously beneath a large photo of Vladimir Jabotinsky, spiritual father of militant Zionism and Sharon’s Likud party. Jabotinsky called for a Jewish state extending from the Nile to the Euphrates. He a dvocated constant attacks to smas h the weak Arab states into fragments, dominated by Israel. In fact, just what Sharon tried to do in Lebanon. Hardly a good omen for the Mideast’s future.” 94 Sharon has been implicated in a long string of acts of “relentless brutality toward Arabs,” including massacring an Arab village in the 195 0s; the “pacification” of the Gaza Strip in the 1970s (involving large-scale bulldozing of homes a nd deportation of Palestinians); the invasion of Lebanon, which involved thousands of civ ilian deaths and the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees; and the br utal Israeli respons e to the recent Pa lestinian intifada. 95 The Kahan Commission, an Israeli board formed to inve stigate the Lebanese incident, concluded that Sharon was indirectly responsible for the mass acre, and it went on to say that Sharon bears personal responsibility. The intention of the Sharon governme nt is to make life so misera ble for the Palestinians that they will voluntarily leave, or, failing that, to simply expel them. Ran HaCohen, an Israeli academic, sums up the situation as of June 2002: Step by step, Palestinians have been dispossess ed and surrounded by settlements, military camps, by-pass roads and checkpoints, squeezed into sealed-o ff enclaves. Palestinian towns are besieged by tanks and armed vehicles blocking all access road s. West Bank villages too are surrounded by road blocks, preventing the movement of vehicles in and out: three successive mounds of rubble and earth, approximately 6 feet high, with 100 metre ga ps between them. All residents wishing to move in and out of the village—old or young, sick or well, pregnant or not—have to climb over the slippery mounds. At present, this policy seems to ha ve been perfected to an extent that it can be further institutionalised by long-term bureaucracy : a permit system, considerably worse than the “pass laws” imposed on blacks in Apartheid South Africa. 96 Little has changed since this assessment. Recently this state of affairs is being formalized by the construction of a series of security walls that not only fence in the Palestinians but also result in the effective seizure of la nd, especially around Jerusalem. 97 The wall encircles and isolates"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 Palestinian villages and divides properties and farmland in ways that make them inaccessible to their owners. 98 The current state of affairs would have been absolutely predictable simply by paying attention to the pronouncements and be havior of a critical subset of Israeli leaders over the last fifty years. Again, they have been the most radica l within the Israeli political spectrum. The clear message is that an important faction of the Is raeli political spectrum has had a long-term policy of expanding the state at the expense of the Pale stinians, dating from the beginnings of the state of Israel. Expansionism was well entrenched in the Labor Party, centered around David Ben- Gurion, and has been even more cen tral to the Likud co alition under the leader ship of Menachem Begin and, more recently, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon. The result is that the Palestinians have been left with little hope of obtaining a meani ngful state, desp ite the current “road map to peace” efforts. The next step ma y well be expulsion, already advocated by many on the right in Israel, although the strategy of oppression is in fact causing so me Palestinians to leave voluntarily. 99 Voluntary emigration has long been vi ewed as a solution by some, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (on the more “liber al” end of the Israeli political spectrum), who urged that Israel “create...conditi ons which would attract natural and voluntary migration of the refugees from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to Jordan.” 100 “Transfer,” whether voluntary or involuntary, has long been a fixture of Zionist thought going back to Herzl, Chaim Weizmann, and Ben-Gurion. 101 Ben-Gurion wrote in his diary in 1937: “the compulsory transfer of the Arabs from th e valleys of the projected Jewish state . . . we have to stick to this conclusion the same way we grabbed the Balfour Declaration, more than that, the same way we gr abbed at Zionism itself.” 102 A prominent recent proponent of expulsion is Rehavam Zeevi, a close associate of Sharon a nd Israel’s Minister of Tourism as well as a member of the powerful Security Cabinet until his assassination in October, 2001. Zeevi described Palestinians as “li ce” and advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Israeli- controlled areas. Zeevi said Pales tinians were living illegally in Israel and “We should get rid of the ones who are not Israel i citizens the same way you get rid of lice. We have to stop this cancer from spreading within us.” There are many ex amples, beginning no later than the mid-1980s, of leading Israeli politicians referring to the occu pied territories on the West Bank as “Judea and Samaria.” 103 The point is that movements that start out on the extreme of the Jewish political spectrum eventually end up driving the enti re process, so that in the en d not only American Jews but pro- Israeli non-Jewish politicians end up mouthing th e rhetoric that was formerly reserved for extremists within the Jewish community. In 2003, at a time when th ere are well over one hundred Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Gaza filled with fanatic fundamentalists and armed zealots intent on eradicating the Palestinians , it is revealing that Moshe Sharett, Israeli prime minister in the 1950s, wo rried that the border settlement s were composed of well-armed ex-soldiers—extremists who were intent on expa nding the borders of Isra el. Immediately after the armistice agreement of 1948 Israeli zealots, sometimes within the army and sometimes in the nascent settler movement, began a long string of provocations of Israel’s neighbors. 104 An operation of the Israeli army (under the leadersh ip of Ariel Sharon) that demolished homes and killed civilians at Qibya in 1953 was part of a broader plan: “The stronger the tensions in the region, the more demoralized the Arab populati ons and destabilized th e Arab regimes, the stronger the pressures for the transfer of the con centrations of Palestinia n refugees from places near the border away into th e interior of the Arab world—a nd the better it was for the preparation of the next war.” 105 At times the army engaged in provocative actions without Prime Minister Sharett’s knowledge, 106 as when David Ben-Gurion, Israel ’s first prime minister, led a raid in 1955 which resulted in a massacre of Arabs in Gaza. When confronted with his actions by an American Jew, Ben-Gurion “stood up. He looke d like an angry prophet out of the Bible and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 got red in the face. He shouted, ‘I am not goi ng to let anybody, American Jews or anyone else, tell me what I have to do to provi de for the security of my people.” 107 The war to occupy the West Bank did not take place until 1967, but Sharett describes plans by the Israeli army to occupy the West Ba nk dating from 1953. Throughout the period from 1948–1967 “some of the major and persistent accusa tions” by the Israeli right were that the Labor-dominated governments had accepted the partit ion of Palestine and had not attempted to “eradicate Palestinian bounda ries” during the 1948 war. 108 The annexation of East Jerusalem and the settlement of the West Bank began immedi ately after the 1967 war—exactly what would be expected on the assumption that this was a wa r of conquest. Menachem Begin, who accelerated the settlement process when he assumed power in 1977, noted, “In June 1967, we again had a choice. The Egyptian Army concentrations in th e Sinai approaches do not prove that [Egyptian President] Nasser was really abou t to attack us. We must be hone st with ourselves. We decided to attack him.” 109 Given the tendency for Jewish radicals to carry the day, it is worth describing the most radical Zionist fringe as it exists now. It is common among radical Zionists to project a much larger Israel that reflects G od’s covenant with Abraham. Theo dor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, maintained that the area of the Jewish stat e stretches: “From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.” 110 This reflects God’s covenant with Ab raham in Genesis 15: 18–20 and Joshua 1 3– 4: “To your descendants I give this land, from th e river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Kenite s, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” The flexibility of the ultimate aims of Zionism can also be seen by Ben-Gurion’s comment in 1936 that The acceptance of partition [of the Palestin ian Mandate] does not commit us to renounce Transjordan [i.e., the modern state of Jordan]; one does not demand from anybody to give up his vision. We shall accept a state in the boundaries fixed today. But the boundaries of Zionist aspirations are the concern of the Jewish people and no external factor will be able to limit them. 111 "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 Ben-Gurion’s vision of “the boundaries of Zioni st aspirations” included southern Lebanon, southern Syria, all of Jordan, and the Sinai. 112 (After conquering the Sina i in 1956, Ben-Gurion announced to the Knesset that “Our army di d not infringe on Egyptian territory.... Our operations were restricted to the Sinai Peninsula alone.” 113 Or consider Golda Meir’s statement that the borders of Israel “are where Jews live, not where there is a line on the map.” 114 These views are common among the more extreme Zionists today—especially the fundamentalists and the settler movement—notably Gush Emunim—who now set the tone in Israel. A prominent rabbi associated with these movements stated: “We must live in this land even at the price of war. Moreover, even if there is peace, we must instigate wars of liberation in order to conquer [the land].” 115 Indeed, in the opinion of Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky, “It is not unreasonable to assume that Gush Emuni m, if it possessed the power and control, would use nuclear weapons in warfare to attempt to achieve its purpose.” 116 This image of a “Greater Israel” is also much on the minds of activists in the Muslim world. For example, in a 1998 interview Osama bin Laden stated, [W]e know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the Western forces [in Saudi Arabia] and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion of what is called the Great Israel.... Their presence has no meaning save one and th at is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel. 117 To recap: A century ago Zionism was a minority movement within Diaspora Judaism, with the dominant assimilationist Jews in the West oppos ing it at least partly because Zionism raised the old dual loyalty issue, which has been a potent source of anti-Semitism throughout the ages. The vast majority of Jews eventually became Zionists, to the point that now not only are Diaspora Jews Zionists, they are indispensable supporters of the most fanatic elements within Israel. Within Israel, the radicals have also w on the day, and the state has evolved to the point where the influence of moderates in the tradit ion of Moshe Sharett is a distant memory. The fanatics keep pushing the envelope, forcing other Je ws to either go along with their agenda or to simply cease being part of the Jewish commun ity. Not long ago it wa s common to talk to American Jews who would say they support Israel but deplore the settlements. Now such talk among Jews is an anachronism, because support for Israel demands support for the settlements. The only refuge for such talk is the increasingly isolated Jewish critics of Israel, such as Israel Shamir 118 and, to a much lesser extent, Michael Lerner’s Tikkun. 119 The trajectory of Zionism has soared from its being a minority within a mino rity to its dominating the U.S. Congress, the executive branch, and the entire U.S. foreign policy apparatus. And because the Israeli occupati on and large-scale settlement of the West Bank unleashed a wave of terrorist-style violence ag ainst Israel, Jews perceive Isra el as under threat. As with any committed group, Jewish commitment increases in times of perceived threat to the community. The typical response of Diaspora Jews to the re cent violence has not been to renounce Jewish identity but to strongly support the Sharon govern ment and rationalize its actions. This has been typical of Jewish history in general. For example, during the 1967 an d 1973 wars there were huge upsurges of support for Israel and strengt hened Jewish identity among American Jews: Arthur Hertzberg, a prominent Zionist, wrote that “the immediate reaction of American Jewry to the crisis was far more intense and widespread than anyone could have foreseen. Many Jews would never have believed that grave danger to Israel could dom inate their thoughts and emotions to the exclusion of everything else.” 120 The same thing is happening now. The typical response to Israel’s current situa tion is for Jews to identify even more strongly with Israel and to exclude Jews who criticize Israel or support Palestinian claims in any way."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 This “rallying around the flag” in times of crisis fits well with the psychology of ethnocentrism: When under atta ck, groups become more unifi ed and more conscious of boundaries, and have a greater tend ency to form negative stereotypes of the outgroup. This has happened throughout Jewish history. 121 Several commentators have noted the void on th e Jewish left as the conflict with the Palestinians has escalated under the Sharon govern ment. As noted above, surveys in the 1980s routinely found that half of U.S. Jews oppos ed settlements on the West Bank and favored a Palestinian state. 122 Such sentiments have declined preci pitously in the current climate: At a progressive synagogue on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, Rabbi Rolando Matalo was torn between his longtime support for Palestinian human rights and his support for an Israel under siege. “There is a definite void on the left,” said Mata lo.... Many American Jewish leaders say Israel’s current state of emergency—and growing signs of anti-Semitism around the world—have unified the faithful here in a way not seen since the 1967 and 1973 wars.... These feelings shift back and forth, but right now they’re tilting toward tribalism. 123 Note that the author of this article, Josh Ge tlin, portrays Israel as be ing “under siege,” even though Israel is the occupying power and has killed far more Palestinians than the Palestinians have killed Israelis. “I don’t recall a time in modern history when Jews have felt so vulnerable,” said Rabbi Martin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.... This week, the center will be mailing out 600,000 “call to action” brochures that say “Israel is fighting for her life” and urge American Jews to contact government leaders a nd media organizations worldwide.... Rabbi Mark Diamond, executive vice president of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, said debate over the West Bank invasion and the attack on the Pales tinian Jenin refugee camp is overshadowed by “a strong sense that Israel needs us, that the world Jew ry needs us, that this is our wake-up call.” He said he has been overwhelmed in recent week s by numerous calls from members of synagogues asking what they can do to help or where they can send a check.... “I have American friends who might have been moderate before on the issue of negotiating peace, but now they think: ‘Our whole survival is at stake, so let’s just destroy them all,’” said Victor Nye, a Brooklyn, N.Y., businessman who describes himself as a passionate supporter of Israel. In this atmosphere, Jews who dissent are seen as traitors, and liberal Je ws have a great deal of anxiety that they will be ostracized from the Jewish community for criticizing Israel. 124 This phenomenon is not new. During the 1982 i nvasion of Lebanon, Richard Cohen of the Washington Post criticized the Begin government and wa s inundated with protests from Jews. “Here dissent becomes treason—and treason not to a state or even an ideal (Zionism), but to a people. There is tremendous pressure for confor mity, to show a united front and to adopt the view that what is best for Israel is something only the government there can know.” 125 During the same period, Nat Hentoff noted in the Village Voice , “I know staff workers for the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congr ess who agonize about th eir failure to speak out, even on their own time, agains t Israeli injustice. They don’t, because they figure they’ll get fired if they do.” 126 Reflecting the fact that Jews who advocate pea ce with the Palestinians are on the defensive, funding has dried up for causes associ ated with criticism of Israel. The follow ing is a note posted on the website of Tikkun by its editor, Michael Lerner: TIKKUN Magazine is in trouble—because we have con tinued to insist on the rights of the Palestinian people to full self-determination. For years we’ve called for an end to the Occupation and dismantling of the Israeli settlements. We’v e called on the Palestinian people to follow the example of Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela and Gandhi—and we ’ve critiqued terrorism against Israel, and insisted on Israel’s right to security. But we’ve also critiqued Israel’s house demolitions, torture, and grabbing of land. For y ears, we had much support. But since Intifada II"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 began this past September, many Jews have st opped supporting us—and we’ve lost subscribers and donors. Would you consider helping us out?” 127 Another sign that Jews who are “soft” on Israel are being pushe d out of the Jewish community is an article by Philip Weiss. 128 The refusal of liberal American Jews to make an independent stand has left the American left helpless. American liberalism has always draw n strength from Jews. They are among the largest contributors to the Democratic Party; they have brought a special perspective to any number of social-justice questions, from the advancement of blacks and women to free speech. They fostered multiculturalism.... The Holocaust continues to be the baseline reference for Jews when thinking about their relationship to the world, and the Pal estinians. A couple of months ago, I got an e-mail from a friend of a friend in Israel about the latest bus-bombing. “They’re going to kill us all,” was the headline. (No matter that Israel has one of largest armies in the world, and that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis). Once, wh en I suggested to a liberal journalist friend that Americans had a right to discuss issues involving Jewish success in the American power structure— just as we examined the WASP culture of the est ablishment a generation ago—he said, “Well, we know where that conversation ends up: in the ovens of Auschwitz.” Because of Jewish ethnocentrism and group commi tment, stories of Jews being killed are seen as the portending of another Holocaust and th e extinction of the Jewish people rather than a response to a savage occupation—a clear inst ance of moral particularism writ large. The same thing is happening in Canada wher e Jews are concerned about declining support by Canadians for Israel. “The past three year s have been extraordinarily tough on Jews in Canada and around the world,” said Keith Lan dy, national president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. “Every Jew has felt under attack in some form.” 129 The response has been increased activism by deeply committed wealthy Jews, including, most famously, Israel Asper, executive chairman of CanWest Global Communications Co rp. Asper has used his media empire to promote pro-Likud policies and has punished journa lists for any deviation from its strong pro- Israel editorial policies. 130 The efforts of these activists ar e aimed at consolidating Jewish organizations behind “hawkish” attitudes on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Older Jewish organizations, such as the Canada-Israel Comm ittee and the Canadian Jewish Congress, would be remodeled or driven out of existence to exclude Jews less committed to these attitudes. C ONCLUSION An important mechanism underlying all this is that of rallying around the flag during times of crisis, a phenomenon that is well understood by social psychologist s. Group identification processes are exaggerated in times of resource competition or other perceived sources of threat, 131 a finding that is highly compatible with an evolutionary perspective. 132 External threat tends to reduce internal divisions and maximize pe rceptions of common interest among ingroup members, as we have seen among American Jews in response to perceived crises in Israel, ranging from the Six-Day War of 1967 to the une nding crises of the 1990s and into the new millennium. 133 Jewish populations also respond to thr eat by developing me ssianic ideologies, rallying around charismatic leader s, and expelling dissenters from the community. Traditionally this has taken the form of relig ious fundamentalism, as among the Hasidim, but in the modern world these tendencies have been manifested in various forms of leftist radicalism, Zionism, and other Jewish intellectual and political movements. 134 Throughout Jewish history, this siege mentality has tended to increase conflict betw een Jews and non-Jews. In the context of the intense ethnic conflict of nine teenth-century Eastern Europe, th e conflict was exacerbated by an enormous increase in the Jewish population."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 And in all cases, the leaders of this process are the more ethnocentric, committed Jews. They are the ones who donate to Jewish causes, attend rallies, write le tters, join and support activist organizations. As J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the Forward , notes, Jews who identify themselves as doves feel much less strongly about Israel than those who identify themselves as hawks. “Jewish liberals give to the Sierra Fund. Jewish conserva tives are Jewish all the time. That’s the whole ball game. It’s not what six million American Jews feel is best — it’s what 50 Jewish organizations feel is best.” 135 In other words, it’s the most radical, committed elements of the Jewish community that determine the direction of the entire community. As a European in a society that is rapidl y becoming non-European, I can sympathize with Jabotinsky’s envy of the native Slavic peoples he observed in the earl y twentieth century: I look at them with envy. I have never known, and probably never will know, this completely organic feeling: so united and singular [is this] sense of a homeland, in which everything flows together, the past and the present, the legend a nd the hopes, the individual and the historical. 136 Every nation civilised or primitive, sees its land as its national home, where it wants to stay as the sole landlord forever. Such a nation will never willingly consent to new landlords or even to partnership. 137 It is the memory of this rapidly disappeari ng sense of historical rootedness and sense of impending dispossession that are at the root of the malaise experienced by many Europeans, not only in the U.S. but elsewhere. The triumph of Zionism took a mere fifty years from Herzl’s inspiration to the founding of the state of Isr ael. There is a tendency to overlook or ignore the powerful ethnocentrism at the hear t of Zionism that motivated pe ople like Jabotinsky, especially on the part of the American Jewish commun ity, which has been dedicated throughout the twentieth century to pathologizing and criminaliz ing the fragile vestiges of ethnocentrism among Europeans. 138 But the bottom line is that the Zionists were successful. Israel would not have become a state without a great many deeply ethnocentric Jews willing to engage in any means necessary to bring about their dream: a state that would be a ve hicle for their ethnic in terests. It would not have come about without the most radical among them—people like Jabotinsky, Begin, Shamir, Sharon, and their supporters—a group which now includes the entire organized American Jewish community. The impending dispossession of Europ eans will only be avoide d if people of their ilk can be found among the political class of Europeans. The final paper in this series will discuss neo-conservatism as a Jewish intellectual and political movement. A main point of that paper will be that Jewish ne o-conservatives are the current radicals who are charting the dire ction of the entire Jewish community.

Is neoconservatism a Jewish movement? Is it “anti-Semitic” to say so? The thesis presented here is that neoconser vatism is indeed a Jewish intellectual and political movement. This paper is the final installment in a three-part series on Jewish activism and reflects many of the themes of the first two articles. The first paper in this series focused on the traits of ethnocentrism, intelligence, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness. 1 These traits will be apparent here as well. The ethnocentris m of the neocons has enabled them to create highly organized, cohesive, and e ffective ethnic networks. Neoconser vatives have also exhibited the high intelligence necessary fo r attaining eminence in the acad emic world, in the elite media and think tanks, and at the highest levels of gove rnment. They have aggressively pursued their goals, not only in purging more traditional conservatives from their positions of power and influence, but also in reorienting US foreign policy in the direction of hegemony and empire. Neoconservatism also illustrates th e central theme of the second artic le in this seri es: In alliance with virtually the entir e organized American Jewish commun ity, neoconservatism is a vanguard Jewish movement with close ties to the most extreme nationalistic, aggressive, racialist and religiously fanatic elements within Israel. 2 Neoconservatism also reflects many of the char acteristics of Jewish intellectual movements studied in my book, The Culture of Critique 3 (see Table 1) . T ABLE 1: C HARACTERISTICS OF J EWISH I NTELLECTUAL M OVEMENTS • A deep concern with furthering specific Jewish interests, such as helping Israel or promoting immigration. • Issues are framed in a rhetoric of universalism rather than Jewish particularism. • Issues are framed in moral terms, a nd an attitude of moral superiority pervades the movement. • Centered around charismatic leaders (Boas, Trotsky, Freud). • Jews form a cohesive, mutually reinforcing core. • Non-Jews appear in highly visible ro les, often as spokespersons for the movement. • A pronounced ingroup/outgroup atmosphere within the movement— dissenters are portrayed as the pers onification of evil and are expunged from the movement. • The movement is irrational in the sense that it is fundamentally concerned with using available intellectual reso urces to advance a political cause."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 • The movement is associated with the most prestigious academic institutions in the society. • Access to prestigious and mainstream me dia sources, partly as a result of Jewish influence on the media. • Active involvement of the wider Je wish community in supporting the movement. However, neoconservatism also presents seve ral problems to any analysis, the main one being that the history of neoconservatism is re latively convoluted and complex compared to other Jewish intellectual and political movements. To an unusual extent, the history of neoconservatism presents a zigzag of positions and alliances, and a multiplicity of influences. This is perhaps inevitable in a fundamentally polit ical movement needing to adjust to changing circumstances and attempting to influence the very large, complex political culture of the United States. The main changes neoconserva tives have been forced to confront have been their loss of influence in the Democratic Party and the fa ll of the Soviet Union. Although there is a remarkable continuity in Jewish neoconservativ es' interests as Jews—the prime one being the safety and prosperity of Israel—these upheaval s required new political a lliances and produced a need for new work designed to reinvent the in tellectual foundation of American foreign policy. Neoconservatism also raises difficult problems of labeling. As described in the following, neoconservatism as a movement derives from the long association of Jews with the left. But contemporary neoconservatism is not simply a term for ex-liberals or leftists. Indeed, in its present incarnation, many sec ond-generation neoconservatives, such as David Frum, Jonah Goldberg, and Max Boot, have never had aff iliations with the American left. Rather, neoconservatism represents a fundamentally new vers ion of American conservatism, if it can be properly termed conservative at all. By di splacing traditional forms of conservatism, neoconservatism has actually solidified the hold of the left on political and cultural discourse in the United States. The deep and continuing chasm between neocons and more traditional American conservatives—a topic of this paper—i ndicates that this problem is far from being resolved. The multiplicity of influences among neoconservatives requires some comment. The current crop of neoconservatives has at time s been described as Trotskyists. 4 As will be seen, in some cases the intellectual influences of neoconservatives can be tra ced to Trotsky, but Trotskyism cannot be seen as a current influence with in the movement. And although the political philosopher Leo Strauss is indeed a guru for so me neoconservatives, his influence is by no means pervasive, and in any case provides only a very broad guide to what the neoconservatives advocate in the area of public policy. Indeed, by far the best predictor of neoconservative attitudes, on foreign policy at least, is what th e political right in Israel deems in Israel’s best interests. Neoconservatism does not fit the pa ttern of the Jewish intellectual movements described in The Culture of Critique , characterized by gurus (“ra bbis”) and their disciples centered around a tightly focused intellectual perspective in th e manner of Freud, Boas, or Marcuse. Neoconservatism is better described in general as a complex interlocking professional and family network centered around Jewish publicists and organizers flexib ly deployed to recruit the sympathies of both Jews and non-Jews in harnessing the wealth and power of the United States in the service of Israel. As such, neoconservatism should be considered a semicovert branch of the massive and highly effective pro -Israel lobby, which includes organizations like the America Israel Public Affairs Committ ee (AIPAC)—the most powerful lobbying group in Washington—and the Zionist Orga nization of America (ZOA). Indeed, as discussed below, prominent neoconservatives have been associated with such overtly pro-Is rael organizations as the Jewish Institute for National Security Affa irs (JINSA), the Washington Institute for Near"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 East Policy (WINEP), and ZOA.

Compared with their deep and emotionally in tense commitment to Israel, neoconservative attitudes on domestic policy seem more or less an afterthought, and they will not be the main focus here. In general, neoconservatives advocat e maintaining the social welfare, immigration, and civil rights policies typical of liberalism (and the wide r Jewish community) up to about 1970. Some of these policies represent clear examples of Jewish ethnic strategizing—in particular, the role of the entire Jewish polit ical spectrum and the entire organized Jewish community as the moving force behind the immigration law of 1965, which opened the floodgates to nonwhite immigra tion. (Jewish organizations st ill favor liberal immigration policies. In 2004, virtually all Am erican Jewish public affairs ag encies belong to the National Immigration Forum, the premier open borders immigration-lobbying group. 5 ) Since the neocons have developed a decisive influence in the main stream conservative movement, their support for"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 nonrestrictive immigration policies has perhaps more significance for the future of the United States than their support for Israel. As always when discussing Jewish involvement in intellectual movements, there is no implication that all or even most Jews are involved in these move ments. As discussed below, the organized Jewish community shares the neoc on commitment to the Likud Party in Israel. However, neoconservatism has never been a ma jority viewpoint in the American Jewish community, at least if being a neoconservative implies voting for the Republican Party. In the 2000 election, 80 percent of Jews voted for Al Gore. 6 These percentages may be misleading, si nce it was not widely known during the 2000 election that the top advisors of George W. Bush had very powerful Jewish connections, pro- Likud sympathies, and positive attitudes toward regi me change in Arab countries in the Middle East. Republican strategists are hoping fo r 35 percent of the Jewish vote in 2004. 7 President Bush’s May 18, 2004, speech to the national c onvention of AIPAC “r eceived a wild and sustained standing ovation in response to an au dience member’s call for ‘four more years.’ The majority of some 4,500 delegates at the national c onference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee leaped to their feet in support of the president.... Anecdotal evidence points to a sea change among Jewish voters, who historically ha ve trended toward the Democratic Party but may be heading to Bush’s camp due to his st ance on a single issue: his staunch support of Israel.” 8 Nevertheless, Democrats may not lose ma ny Jewish voters because John Kerry, the likely Democratic candidate, has a “100% record” for Israel and has promised to increase troop strength and retain the commitment to Iraq. 9 The critical issue is to determine the extent to which neoconservatism is a Jewish movement—the extent to which Jews dominate th e movement and are a critical component of its success. One must then document th e fact that the Jews involved in the movement have a Jewish identity and that they are Jewish ly motivated—that is, that they see their participation as aimed at achieving specific Jewish goals. In the case of neoconservatives, an important line of evidence is to show their deep connections to Israel—the ir “passionate attachment to a nation not their own,” as Pat Buchanan terms it, 10 and especially to the Likud Pa rty. As indicated above, I will argue that the main motivation for Jewish neoc onservatives has been to further the cause of Israel; however, even if that statement is true, it does not imply that all Jews are neoconservatives. I therefore reject the sort of arguments made by Rich ard Perle, who responded to charges that neoconservatives were predominantly Jews by noting that Jews always tend to be disproportionately involved in intellectual undert akings, and that many Jews oppose the neoconservatives. 11 This is indeed the case, but l eaves open the question of whether neoconservative Jews perceive their ideas as advancing Jewish interests and whether the movement itself is influential. An important point of the following, however, is that the organized Jewish community has played a critica l role in the success of neoconservatism and in preventing public discussion of its Jewish roots and Jewish agendas. N ON -J EWISH P ARTICIPATION IN N EOCONSERVATISM As with the other Jewish intellectual and political movements, non-Jews have been welcomed into the movement and often given highly visible roles as the public face of the movement. This of course lessens the percep tion that the movement is indeed a Jewish movement, and it makes excelle nt psychological sense to ha ve the spokespersons for any movement resemble the people they are trying to convince. That’s why Ahmed Chalabi (a Shiite Iraqi, a student of early neocon th eorist Albert Wohlstetter, a nd a close personal associate of prominent neocons, including Richard Perle) wa s the neocons’ choice to lead postwar Iraq. 12 There are many examples—including Freud’s famous comments on n eeding a non-Jew to"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 represent psychoanalysis (he got Carl Jung for a time until Jung balked at the role, and then Ernest Jones). Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedi ct were the most publicly recognized Boasian anthropologists, and there were a great many non- Jewish leftists and pr o-immigration advocates who were promoted to visible positions in Jewish dominated movements—and sometimes resented their role. 13 Albert Lindemann describes non-Jews among the leaders of the Bolshevik revolution as “jewified non-Jews”— “a term, freed of its ugly conno tations, [that] might be used to underline an often overlooked point: Even in Russia there were some non-Jews, whether Bolsheviks or not, who respecte d Jews, praised them abundantl y, imitated them, cared about their welfare, and established intimate fr iendships or romantic liaisons with them.” 14 There was a smattering of non-Jews among the New York Intellectua ls, who, as members of the anti-Stalinist left in the 1940s, were forerunners of the neoconservatives. Prominent examples were Dwight MacDonald (labeled by Michael Wrezin “a distinguished goy among the Partisanskies” 15 —i.e., the largely Jewish Partisan Review crowd), James T. Farrell, and Mary McCarthy. John Dewey also had close links to th e New York Intellectua ls and was lavishly promoted by them; 16 Dewey was also allied closely with his former student Sidney Hook, another major figure on the anti-Stalinist left. Dewey was a philosemite, stating: “After all, it was the Christians who made them ‘it’ [i.e., victims] . Living in New York where the Jews set the standard of living from department stores to ap artment houses, I often think that the Jews are the finest product of historical Ch ristianity.... Anyway, the finest li ving man, so far as I know, is a Jew—[humanitarian founder of the Internati onal Institute of Agriculture] David Lubin.” 17 This need for the involvement of non-Jews is especially acute for neoconservatism as a political movement: Because neoconservative Jews constitute a tiny percentage of the electorate, they need to make alliances with non-Jews whose perceived interests dovetail with theirs. Non- Jews have a variety of reasons for being associated with Jewi sh interests, including career advancement, close personal relationships or ad miration for individual Jews, and deeply held personal convictions. For example, as described below, Senator Henry Jackson, whose political ambitions were intimately bound up with the ne oconservatives, was a strong philosemite due partly to his experiences in ch ildhood; his alliance w ith neoconservatives also stemmed from his (entirely reasonable) belief that the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a deadly conflict and his belief that Israel was a valuable ally in that struggle. Because neoconservatives command a large and lucrative pr esence in the media, thinkt ankdom, and poli tical culture generally, it is hardly surpri sing that complex blends of o pportunism and personal conviction characterize participating non-Jews. U NIVERSITY AND M EDIA I NVOLVEMENT An important feature of the Jewish intellectua l and political movements I have studied has been their association with pr estigious universities and media sources. The university most closely associated with the curr ent crop of neoconservatives is the University of Chicago, the academic home not only of Leo Strauss, but also of Albert Wohlstetter, a mathematician turned foreign policy strategist, who was mentor to Ri chard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, both of whom have achieved power and influenc e in the George W. Bush admi nistration. The University of Chicago was also home to Strauss disciple Alla n Bloom, sociologist Ed ward Shils, and novelist Saul Bellow among the earlier ge neration of neoconservatives. Another important academic home for the neocons has been the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins Universit y. Wolfowitz spent most of the Clinton years as a professor at SAIS; the Director of the Strategic Studies Progra m at SAIS is Eliot Cohen, who has been a signatory to a number of the Projec t for a New American Century’s statements and letters, including the April 2002 lett er to President Bush on Israel a nd Iraq (see below); he is also"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 an advisor for Frank Gaffney’s Center for S ecurity Policy, an important neocon think tank. Cohen is famous for labeling the war ag ainst terrorism Worl d War IV. His book, Supreme Command , argues that civilian leaders should make the important decisions and not defer to military leaders. This message was understood by Cheney and Wolfowitz as underscoring the need to prevent the military from having too much influence, as in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War when Colin Powell as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been influential in opposing the removal of Saddam Hussein. 18 Unlike other Jewish intellectual movements, the neoconservatives have been forced to deal with major opposition from within the academy, esp ecially from Arabs and leftists in academic departments of Middle East stud ies. As a result, neoconservativ e activist groups, especially the WINEP and the MEF’s Campus Watch, have mon itored academic discourse and course content and organized protests against pr ofessors, and were behind congr essional legislation that will mandate U.S. government monitoring of pr ograms in Middle East studies (see below). Jewish intellectual and political movements also have typically had ready access to prestigious mainstream media outle ts, and this is certainly true for the neocons. Most notable are the Wall Street Journal, Commentary , The Public Interest, Basic Books (book publishing), and the media empires of Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns the Fox News Channel and the New York Post, and is the main source of funding for Bill Kristol’s Weekly Standard —all major neocon outlets. A good example illustrating these co nnections is Richard Perle. Pe rle is listed as a Resident Fellow of the AEI, and he is on the boards of directors of the Jerusalem Post and the Hollinger Corporation, a media company controlled by Conrad Black. Hollin ger owns major media properties in the U.S. ( Chicago Sun-Times ), England (the Daily Telegraph ), Israel ( Jerusalem Post ), and Canada (the National Post ; 50 percent ownershi p with CanWest Global Communications, which is controll ed by Israel Asper and his family; CanWest has aggressively clamped down on its journalists for any deviati on from its strong pro-Is rael editorial policies 19 ). Hollinger also owns dozens of sm aller publications in the U.S ., Canada, and England. All of these media outlets reflect the vigorously pro-Is rael stance espoused by Perle. Perle has written op-ed columns for Hollinger newspapers as well as for the New York Times . Neoconservatives such as Jonah Goldberg and Da vid Frum also have a very large influence on National Review , formerly a bastion of traditional c onservative thought in the U.S. Neocon think tanks such as the AEI have a great deal of cross-membership with Jewish activist organizations such as AIPAC, the main pro-Is rael lobbying organization in Washington, and the WINEP. (When President George W. Bush a ddressed the AEI on Iraq policy, the event was fittingly held in the Albert Wohlstetter Confer ence Center.) A major goal of the AEI is to maintain a high profile as pundits in the main stream media. A short list would include AEI fellow Michael Ledeen, who is extreme even among th e neocons in his lust for war against all of the Arab countries in the Middle East, is “resid ent scholar in the Freedom Chair at the AEI,” writes op-ed articles for The Scri pps Howard News Service and the Wall Street Journal , and appears on the Fox News Channel. Michael R ubin, visiting scholar at AEI, writes for the New Republic (controlled by staunchly pro-Israel Martin Peretz), the New York Times , and the Daily Telegraph . Reuel Marc Gerecht, a resident fellow at the AEI and director of the Middle East Initiative at PNAC, writes for the Weekly Standard and the New York Times . Another prominent AEI member is David Wurmser who formerly h eaded the Middle East Studies Program at the AEI until assuming a major role in providing intel ligence disinformation in the lead up to the war in Iraq (see below). His position at th e AEI was funded by Irving Moscowitz, a wealthy supporter of the settler movement in Israel and neocon activism in the US. 20 At the AEI Wurmser wrote op-ed pieces for the Washington Times , the Weekly Standard , and the Wall Street Journal."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 His book, Tyranny’s Ally: America’s Failu re to Defeat Saddam Hussein , advocated that the United States should use military force to achieve regime change in Iraq. The book was published by the AEI in 1999 with a Foreward by Richard Perle. Prior to the invasion of Iraq, the New York Times was deeply involved in spreading deception about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorist organizations. Judith Miller’s front-page articles were based on info rmation from Iraqi defectors well known to be untrustworthy because of their own interest in toppling Saddam. 21 Many of these sources, including the notorious Ahmed Chal abi, were also touted by the Office of Special Plans of the Department of Defense, which is associated with many of the most prominent Bush administration neocons (see below) . Miller’s indiscretions might be chalked up to incompetence were it not for her close connec tions to prominent neocon organi zations, in particular Daniel Pipes’s Middle East Forum (MEF), which avidly sought the war in Iraq. The MEF lists Miller as an expert speaker on Middle East issues, and she has published articles in MEF media, including the Middle East Quarterly and the MEF Wire. The MEF also threw a launch party for her book on Islamic fundamentalism, God Has Ninety-Nine Names . Miller, whose father is ethnically Jewish, has a strong Jewish consciousness: Her book One by One: Facing the Holocaust “tried to ... show how each [European] country that I lived and worked in, was suppressing or distorting or politically manipula ting the memory of the Holocaust.” 22 The New York Times has apologized for “coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been” but has thus far refused to single out Miller’s stories as worthy of special censure. 23 Indeed, the Times’ sfailure goes well beyond Miller: Some of the Times’ s coverage in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq was credulous; much of it was inappropriately italicized by lavish fr ont-page display and heavy-breathing headlines; and several fine articles by David Johnston, James Risen and others that provided perspective or challenged information in the faulty stories were played as quietly as a lullaby. Especially notable among these was Risen’s “C.I.A. Aides Feel Pressu re in Preparing Iraqi Reports,” which was completed several days before the invasion and unacc ountably held for a week. It didn't appear until three days after the war’s start, and even then was interred on Page B10. 24 As is well known, the New York Times is Jewish-owned and has often beenaccused of slanting its coverage on issues of importance to Jews. 25 It is perhaps anot her example of the legacy of Jacob Schiff, the Jewish activist/phila nthropist who backed Adolph Ochs’s purchase of the New York Times in 1896 because he believed he “could be of great service to the Jews generally.” 26 I NVOLVEMENT OF THE W IDER J EWISH C OMMUNITY Another common theme of Jewi sh intellectual and politica l movements has been the involvement and clout of the wider Jewish co mmunity. While the prominent neoconservatives represent a small fraction of th e American Jewish community, th ere is little d oubt that the organized Jewish community shares their commi tment to the Likud Party in Israel and, one might reasonably infer, Likud’s desire to see th e United States conquer and effectively control virtually the entire Arab world. 27 For example, representatives of all the major Jewish organizations serve on the executive commit tee of AIPAC, the most powerful lobby in Washington. Since the 1980s AI PAC has leaned toward Likud a nd only reluctantly went along with the Labor govern ment of the 1990s. 28 In October 2002, the Conf erence of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations issued a declaration of support for disarming the Iraqi regime. 29 Jack Rosen, the president of the American Jewish Congress, noted that “the final statement ought to be crystal clear in backing the President having to take unilateral action if necessary against Iraq to elimin ate weapons of mass destruction.” 30 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 The organized Jewish community also plays the role of creden tial validator, especially for non-Jews. For example, the neocon choice for the leader of Iran following regime change is Reza Pahlavi, son of the former Shah. As is the cas e with Ahmed Chalabi, who was promoted by the neocons as the leader of post-Saddam Iraq, Pahlav i has proven his commitment to Jewish causes and the wider Jewish community. He has addressed the board of JI NSA, given a public speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of To lerance in Los Angeles, met with American Jewish communal leaders, and is on friendly terms with Likud Party officials in Israel. 31 Most important, the main Jewish activist orga nizations have been qui ck to condemn those who have noted the Jewish commitments of the neoconservative activists in the Bush administration or seen the hand of the Jewish community in pus hing for war against Iraq and other Arab countries. For example, the ADL’s Abraham Foxman singled out Pat Buchanan, Joe Sobran, Rep. James Moran, Chris Matthews of MSNBC, James O. Goldsborough (a columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune ), columnist Robert Novak, and writer Ian Buruma as subscribers to “a canard that America’s going to war has little to do with disarming Saddam, but everything to do with Jews, the ‘Jewish lobby’ and the hawkish Jewish members of the Bush Administration who, according to this chorus, will favor a ny war that benefits Israel.” 32 Similarly, when Senator Ernest F. Hollings (D-SC) made a speech in the U.S. Senate and wrote a newspaper op-ed piece which claimed the war in Iraq was motivated by “President Bush’s policy to secure Israel” and advanced by a handful of Je wish officials and opinion leaders, Abe Foxman of the ADL stated, “when the de bate veers into anti-Jewish st ereotyping, it is tantamount to scapegoating and an appeal to ethnic hatred.... This is reminiscent of age-old, anti-Semitic canards about a Jewish conspiracy to control and manipulate government.” 33 Despite negative comments from Jewish activist organizations, and a great deal of coverage in the American Jewish press, there were no articl es on this story in any of the major U.S. national newspapers. 34 These mainstream media and political figures stand accused of anti-Semitism—the most deadly charge that can be imagined in th e contemporary world—by the most powerful Jewish activist organization in the U.S. The Simon Wies enthal Center has also charged Buchanan and Moran with anti-Semitism for their comments on this issue. 35 While Foxman feels no need to provide any argument at all, the SWC feels it is sufficient to note that Jews have varying opinions on the war. This of cour se is a nonissue. The real issue is whether it is legitimate to open up to debate the question of the degree to which the neocon activists in the Bush administration are motivated by their long ties to the Likud Party in Is rael and whether the organized Jewish community in the U.S. simila rly supports the Likud Party and its desire to enmesh the United States in wars that are in Is rael’s interest. (There’s not much doubt about how the SWC viewed the war with Iraq; Defense S ecretary Rumsfeld invite d Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Center, to briefings on the war.) 36 Of course, neocons in the media—most not ably David Frum, Max Boot, Lawrence F. Kaplan, Jonah Goldberg, and Alan Wald 37 —have also been busy labe ling their opponents “anti- Semites.” An early example concerned a 1988 sp eech given by Russell Kirk at the Heritage Foundation in which he remarked that “not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of United States”—what Sam Francis characterizes as “a wisecrack about the slavishly pro-Israel sympathies among neoconservatives.” 38 Midge Decter, a prominent neocon writer and wife of Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz, labeled the comment “a bl oody outrage, a piece of anti-Semitism by Kirk that impugns the loyalty of neoconservatives.” 39 Accusations of anti-Semitism have become a common response to suggestions that neoconservatives have promoted the war in Iraq for the benefit of Israel. 40 For example, Joshua Muravchik, whose ties to the neocons are elaborat ed below, authored an apologetic article in"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 Commentary aimed at denying that neoconservative fore ign policy prescriptions are tailored to benefit Israel and that imputations to that effect amount to “anti-Semitism.” 41 These accusations are notable for uniformly failing to honestly address the Jewish motivations and commitments of neoconservatives, the topic of a later section. Finally, the wider Jewish commun ity provides financial support for intellectual and political movements, as in the case of psychoanalysis, wh ere the Jewish community signed on as patients and as consumers of psychoanalytic literature. 42 This has also been the case with neoconservatism, as noted by Gary North: With respect to the close connection between Jew s and neoconservatism, it is worth citing [Robert] Nisbet’s assessment of the revival of hi s academic career after 1965. His only book, The Quest for Community (Oxford UP, 1953), had come back into print in paperback in 1962 as Community and Power . He then began to write for the neoconservativ e journals. Immediately, there were contracts for him to write a series of books on conserva tism, history, and culture, beginning with The Sociological Tradition , published in 1966 by Basic Books, the newly created neoconservative publishing house. Sometime in the late 1960’s, he told me: “I became an in-house sociologist for the Commentary-Public Interest crowd. Jews buy lots of academic books in America.” Some things are obvious but unstated. He could follow the money: book royalties. So could his publishers. 43 The support of the wider Jewish commun ity and the elaborate neoconservative infrastructure in the media and thinktankdom provi de irresistible profes sional opportunities for Jews and non-Jews alike. I am not saying that pe ople like Nisbet don’t belie ve what they write in neoconservative publications. I am simply saying that having opinions th at are attractive to neoconservatives can be very lucr ative and professionally rewarding. In the following I will first trace the historical roots of neoconservatism. This is followed by portraits of several important ne oconservatives that focus on thei r Jewish identities and their connections to pro- Israel activism. H ISTORICAL R OOTS O F N EOCONSERVATISM C OMING TO N EOCONSERVATISM FROM THE F AR L EFT All twentieth century Jewish intellectual a nd political movements stem from the deep involvement of Jews with the left. However, be ginning in the late 1920s, when the followers of Leon Trotsky broke off from the mainstream communi st movement, the Jewish left has not been unified. By all accounts the major figure linking Trotsky and the neoconservative movement is Max Shachtman, a Jew born in Poland in 1904 but br ought to the U.S. as an infant. Like other leftists during the 1920s, Shachtman was enthus iastic about the Soviet Union, writing in 1923 that it was “a brilliant red light in the darkness of capitalist gloom.” 44 Shachtman began as a follower of James P. Cannon, 45 who became converted to Trotsky’ s view that the Soviet Union should actively foment revolution. The Trotskyist movement had a Jewish m ilieu as Shachtman attracted young Jewish disciples—the familiar rabbi/disciple model of Jewish intellectual movements: “Youngsters around Shachtman made little effort to hide their New York background or in tellectual skills and tastes. Years later they could still hear Shachtman’s voice in one another’s speeches.” 46 To a much greater extent than the Communist Part y, which was much larger and was committed to following the Soviet line, the Tr otskyists survived as a sma ll group centered around charismatic leaders like Shachtman, who paid homage to th e famous Trotsky, who lurked in the background as an exile from the USSR living in Mexico. In the Jewish milieu of the movement, Shachtman was much admired as a speaker because of his ab ility in debate and in polemics. He became the quintessential rabbinical guru—the leader of a close, psychol ogically intense group: “He would"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 hug them and kiss [his followers]. He would pinch both their cheeks, hard, in a habit that some felt blended sadism and affection.” 47 Trotskyists took seriously the Marxist idea that the proletarian soci alist revolution should occur first in the economically advanced societies of the West rather than in backward Russia or China. They also thought that a revolution on ly in Russia was doomed to failure because the success of socialism in Russia depended inevitabl y on the world economy. The conclusion of this line of logic was that Ma rxists should advocate a permanen t revolution that would sweep away capitalism completely rather than concentrate on building so cialism in the Soviet Union. Shachtman broke with Trotsky over defense of the Soviet Union in World War II, setting out to develop his own brand of “third camp Marxism” that followed James Burnham in stressing internal democracy and analyzing the USSR as “bureaucratic collectivism.” In 1939– 1941, Shachtman battled leftist intellectuals like Sidney Hook, Max Eastman, and Dwight Macdonald, who were rejecting not only Stalinism but also Trotskyism as insufficiently open and democratic; they also saw Trotsky himself as guilty of some of the worst excesses of the early Bolshevik regime, especially his banning of opposition parties and his actions in crushing the Kronstadt sailors who had called for democr acy. Shachtman defended an open, democratic version of Marxism but was concerned that hi s critics were abandoning socialism—throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Hook, Eastman, Burnham, and Macdonald therefore constituted a “rightist” force within the anti-Stalinist left; it is this force that may with greater accuracy be labeled as one of the immediate intellectual ancestors of neoconservatism. By 1940, Macdonald was Shachtman’s only link to the Partisan Review crowd of the New York Intellectuals—another predominantly Jewish group—and the link became tenuous. James Burnham also broke with Shachtman in 1940. By 1941 Burnham rejected St alinism, fascism, and even the New Deal as bureaucratic menaces, staking out a position characterized by “jur idical defense, his criticism of managerial political tendencies, and his own defence of liberty,” 48 eventually becoming a fixture at National Review in the decades before it became a neoconservative journal. Shachtman himself became a Cold Warrior and social democrat in the late 1940s, attempting to build an all-inclusive left while his erstwhile Trotskyist allies in the Fourth International were bent on conti nuing their isolation in separate factions on the left. During this period, Shachtman saw the Stalinist takeover in East ern Europe as a far great er threat than U.S. power, a prelude to his support for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the U.S. role in Viet Nam. By the 1950s he rejected revolutiona ry socialism and stoppe d calling himself a Trotskyist; 49 during the 1960s he saw the Democratic Pa rty as the path to social democracy, while nevertheless retaining some commitment to Marxism and socialism. “Though he would insist for the rest of his life that he had found the keys to Marxism in his er a, he was recutting the keys as he went along. In the early 1950s he had spoken, written, and acted as a left-wing, though no longer revolutionary, social ist. By the late 1950s he m oved into the mainstream of U.S. social democracy” 50 with a strategy of pushing big busin ess and white Southerners out of the Democratic Party (the conve rse of Nixon’s “Southern strategy” for the Republican Party). In the 1960s “he suggested more openly than ever before that U.S. pow er could be used to promote democracy in the third world” 51 —a view that aligns him w ith later neoconservatives. In the 1960s, Michael Harrington, author of the influential The Other America , became the best known Shachtmanite, but they diverged wh en Harrington showed more sympathy toward the emerging multicultural, antiwar, feminist, “New Politics” influence in the Democratic Party while Shachtman remained committed to the Democrats as the party of organized labor and anti- communism. 52 Shachtman became an enemy of the New Left, which he saw as overly apologetic"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 toward the Soviet Union. “As I watch the New Le ft, I simply weep. If somebody set out to take the errors and stupidities of the Old Left and multiplied them to the nth degree, you would have the New Left of today.” 53 This was linked to disagreemen ts with Irving Howe, editor of Dissent , who published a wide range of authors, including Harrington, although Shachtman followers Carl Gershman and Tom Kahn rema ined on the editorial board of Dissent until 1971–1972. The main link between Shachtman and the poli tical mainstream was the influence he and his followers had on the AFL-CIO. In 1972, shor tly before his death, Shachtman, “as an open anti-communist and supporter of both the Vietnam War and Zionism,” 54 backed Senator Henry Jackson in the Democratic presidential primar y. Jackson was a strong supporter of Israel (see below), and by this time support for Israel had “become a litmus test for Shachtmanites.” 55 Jackson, who was closely associated with th e AFL-CIO, hired Tom Kahn, who had become a Shachtman follower in the 1950s. Kahn was executiv e secretary of the Shachtmanite League for Industrial Democracy, headed at the time by Tom Harrington, and he was also the head of the Department of International Affairs of the AFL- CIO, where he was an “obsessive promoter of Israel” 56 to the point that the AFL-CIO became the world’s largest non-Jewish holder of Israel bonds. His department had a budget of around $40 m illion, most of which was provided by the federally funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED). 57 During the Reagan administration, the AFL-CIO received approximate ly 40 percent of available funding from the NED, while no other funded group received more than 10 percent. That imbalance has prompted speculation that NED is effectively in the ha nds of the Social Democrats USA—Shachtman’s political heir (see below)—the membership of which today includes both NED president Carl Gershman and a number of AFL-CIO of ficials involved with the endowment. In 1972, under the leadership of Carl Gershman and the Shachtmanites, the Socialist Party USA changed its name to Social Democrats USA. 58 Working with Jackson, SD/USA’s members achieved little political power because of the dominance of the New Politics wing of the Democratic Party, with its str ong New Left influence from th e 1960s. With the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, however, key figures fr om SD/USA achieved positions of power and influence both in the labor movement and in the government. Among the latter were Reagan-era appointees such as United Nations Ambassador J eane Kirkpatrick, Assistan t Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott Abrams (son-i n-law of Podhoretz and Decter), Geneva arms talks negotiator Max Kampelman (aide to Hubert Humphrey and founding member of JINSA; he remains on its advisory board), and Gershman, who was an aide to UN Ambassador Kirkpatrick and head of the NED. 59 Other Shachtmanites in the Reagan administration included Joshua Muravchik, a member of SD/USA’s National Comm ittee, who wrote articles defending Reagan’s foreign policy, and Penn Kemble, an SD/USA vice-chairman, who headed Prodemca, an influential lobbying group for th e Contra opponents of the left ist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Abrams and Muravchik have contin ued to play an important role in neocon circles in the George W. Bush administration (see below). In ad dition to being associated with SD/USA, 60 Kirkpatrick has strong neocon credentials. She is on the JINSA Board and is a senior fellow at the AEI. She also has received several awards from Jewish organizations, incl uding the Defender of Israel Award [New York], given to non-Jews who stand up for the Jewish people (other neocon recipients include Henry Jackson and Bayard Rus tin), the Humanitarian Award of B’nai B’rith, and the 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Award from the prime minister of Israel (1998). 61 Kirkpatrick’s late husband Evron was a prom oter of Hubert Humphrey and long-time collaborator of neocon godf ather Irving Kristol. During the Reagan Administration, Lane Kirk land, the head of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, was also a Shachtmanite and an officer of th e SD/USA. As secretary- treasurer of the AFL- CIO during the 1970s, Kirkland was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger, a group of neoconservatives in which “prominent Jacks on supporters, advisers, and admirers from both"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 sides of the aisle predominated.” 62 Kirkland gave a eulogy at Henry Jackson’s funeral. Kirkland was not a Jew but was married to a Jew and, like Jackson, had very close ties to Jews: “Throughout his career Kirkland mainta ined a special affection for th e struggle of the Jews. It may be the result of his marriage to Irena [nee Neumann in 1973—his second marriage], a Czech survivor of the Holocaust and an inspiring figure in her own right. Or it may be because he recognized...that the caus e of the Jews and the cause of labor have been inseparable.” 63 Carl Gershman remains head of the NED, wh ich supports the U.S.-led invasion and nation- building effort in Iraq. 64 The general line of the NED is that Arab countr ies should “get over” the Arab-Israeli conflict and embrace democracy, Israel , and the United States. In reporting on talks with representatives of the Jewish community in Turkey, Gershman frames the issues in terms of ending anti-Semitism in Turkey by destroying Al Qaeda; there is no criticism of the role of Israel and its policies in producing hatred throughout the region. 65 During the 1980s, the NED supported nonviolent strategies to end apartheid in South Africa in association with the A. Philip Randolph Institute, headed by longtime civil rights activist and SD/USA neocon Bayard Rustin. 66 Critics of the NED, such as Rep. Ron Paul (R-T ex), have complained that the NED “is nothing more than a costly program that takes U.S. taxpayer funds to promote favored politicians and political parties abroad.” 67 Paul suggests that the NED’s s upport of former Co mmunists reflects Gershman’s leftist background. In general, at the present time SD/USA con tinues to support organized labor domestically and to take an active interest in using U.S. pow er to spread democracy abroad. A resolution of January 2003 stated that the main conflict in th e world was not between Islam and the West but between democratic and nondemocr atic governments, with Israel being the only democracy in the Middle East. 68 The SD/USA strongly supports demo cratic nation building in Iraq. A prominent member of SD/USA is Joshua Muravchik. A member of the SD/USA National Advisory Council, Muravchik is also a member of the advisory board of JINSA, a resident scholar at the AEI, and an adj unct scholar at WINEP. His book Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism 69 views socialism critically, but advocat es a reformist social democracy that falls short of socialism; he views socialism as a failed religion that is relatively poor at creating wealth and is incompatible with very pow erful human desires for private ownership. Another prominent member of SD/USA is Max Kampelman, whose article, posted on the SD/USA website, makes the standard neoconserva tive complaints about the UN dating from the 1970s, especially regarding its treatment of Israel: Since 1964,...the U.N. Security Council has pa ssed 88 resolutions against Israel—the only democracy in the area—and the General Assembly has passed more than 400 such resolutions, including one in 1975 declaring “Zionism as a form of racism.” When the terrorist leader of the Palestinians, Arafat, spoke in 1974 to the Genera l Assembly, he did so wearing a pistol on his hip and received a standing ovation. While totalitarian and repressive regimes are eligible and do serve on the U.N. Security Council, democratic Israel is barred by U.N. rules from serving in that senior body. 70 N EOCONSERVATIVES AS A C ONTINUATION OF C OLD W AR L IBERALISM ’ S “V ITAL C ENTER ” The other strand that merged into neoconserva tism stems from Cold War liberalism, which became dominant within the Democratic Party dur ing the Truman administration. It remained dominant until the rise of the New Politics infl uence in the party during the 1960s, culminating in the presidential nomination of George McGovern in 1972. 71 In the late 1940s, a key organization was Americans for Democratic Acti on, associated with such figures as Reinhold"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Niebuhr, Hubert Humphrey, and Art hur M. Schlesinger, Jr., whose book, The Vital Center (1947), distilled a liberal antico mmunist perspective which comb ined vigorous containment of communism with “the struggle within our country against oppression and stagnation.” 72 This general perspective was also evident in the Congress for Cultural Freedom, whose central figure was Sidney Hook. 73 The CCF was a group of anticommunist intellectuals organized in 1950 and funded by the CIA, and included a number of pr ominent liberals, such as Schlesinger. A new wrinkle, in comparison to earlier Jewish intellectual and political movements discussed in Culture of Critique, has been that the central figur es, Norman Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, have operated not so much as intellectua l gurus in the manner of Freud or Boas or even Shachtman, but more as promoters and publicists of views which they saw as advancing Jewish interests. Podhoretz’s Commentary (published by the American Jewish Committee) and Kristol’s The Public Interest became clearinghouses for neoconservativ e ideas, but many of the articles were written by people with strong academic creden tials. For example, in the area of foreign policy Robert W. Tucker and Walter Laqueur appear ed in these journals as critics of liberal foreign policy. 74 Their work updated the anticommunist tradition of the “vital center” by taking account of Western weakness apparent in the Ne w Politics liberalism of the Democratic Party and the American left, as well as the an ti-Western posturing of the third world. 75 This “vital center” intellectual framework typified key neoconser vatives at the origin of the movement in the late 1960s, in cluding the two most pivotal fi gures, Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz. In the area of foreign policy, a prim ary concern of Jewish ne oconservatives from the 1960s–1980s was the safety and prosperity of Israel , at a time when the Soviet Union was seen as hostile to Jews within its borders and was ma king alliances with Arab regimes against Israel. As they saw it, the world was gravely threatened by a totalitarian Soviet Union with aggressive outposts around the world and a Third World corrupt ed by vicious anti-Semitism...A major project of Moynihan, Kirkpatrick, and other neoconservativ es in and out of government was the defense of Israel.... By the mid-1970s, Israel was also under fire from the Soviet Union and the Third World and much of the West. The United States wa s the one exception, and the neoconservatives— stressing that Israel was a just, democratic state constantly threatened by vicious and aggressive neighbors—sought to deepen and strengthen this support. 76 Irving Kristol is quite frank in hi s view that the U.S. should support Israel even if it is not in its national interest to do so: Large nations, whose identity is ideological, like the Soviet Union of yesteryear and the United States of today, inevitably have ideol ogical interests in addition to more material concerns.... That is why we feel it necessary to defend Israel today, when its survival is threatened. No complicated geopolitical calcul ations of national in terest are necessary. 77 A watershed event in neoconservatism wa s the statement of November 1975 by UN Ambassador Daniel P. Moynihan in response to the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. Moynihan, whose work in the UN made him a neocon icon and soon a senator from New York, 78 argued against the “discredited” notion that “there are significant biological differences among clearly identifiable groups, and that these di fferences establish, in effect, different levels of humanity.” 79 (In this regard Moynihan may not have been entirely candid, since he appears to have been much impressed by Arthur Jensen’s rese arch on race differences in intelligence. As an advisor to President Nixon on domestic affairs, one of Moynihan’s jobs was to keep Nixon abreast of Jensen’s research. 80 ) In his UN speech, Moynihan ascrib ed the idea that Jews are a race to theorists like Houston Stewart Cham berlain, whose motivation was to find “new justifications...for excluding and persecuting Jews ” in an era in which religious ideology was losing its power to do so. Moynihan describes Zionism as a “National Liberation Movement,”"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 but one with no genetic basis: “Zionists defined th emselves merely as Jews, and declared to be Jewish anyone born of a Jewish mother or—and this is the absolutely crucial fact—anyone who converted to Judaism.” 81 Moynihan describes the Zionist movement as composed of a wide range of “racial stocks” (quotation marks in original )—“black Jews, brown Jews, white Jews, Jews from the Orient and Jews from the West.” Obviously, there is much to disagree with in these ideas. Jewish racial theorists, among them Zionists like Arthur Ruppin and Vladimir Jabotinsky (the hero of the Likud Party throughout its history), were in the forefront of racial theori zing about Jews from the late nineteenth century onwards. 82 And there is a great deal of ev idence that Jews, including most notably Orthodox and Conservative Jews and much of the settler movement that constitutes the vanguard of Zionism today, have been and continue to be vitally interested in maintaining their ethnic integrity. 83 (Indeed, as discussed below, Elliott Abrams has been a prominent neoconservative voice in favor of Jews marrying Jews and reta ining their ethnic cohesion.) Nevertheless, Moynihan’s speech is revealing in its depiction of Judaism as unconcerned about its ethnic cohesion, and for its denial of the biological reality of race. In general, neoconservatives have been staunch promoters of the racial zeitgeist of post-WWII liberal America. Indeed, as typical Cold War liberals up to the end of the 1 960s, many of the older neocons were in the forefront of the racial revolution in the Unite d States. It is also noteworthy that Moynihan’s UN speech is typical of the larg e apologetic literature by Jewish activists and intellectuals in response to the “Zio nism is racism” resolution, of which The Myth of the Jewish Race by Raphael Patai and Jennifer Patai is perhaps the best-known example. 84 The flagship neoconservative magazine Commentary , under the editor ship of Norman Podhoretz, has published many articles defending Israel. Ruth Wisse’s 1981 Commentary article “The Delegitimation of Israel” is described by Ma rk Gerson as “perhaps the best expression” of the neoconservative view that Israel “was a ju st, democratic state constantly threatened by vicious and aggressive neighbors.” 85 Wisse views hostility toward Israel as another example of the long history of anti-Jewish rhetoric that seeks to delegitimize Judaism. 86 This tradition is said to have begun with the Christian beliefs that Jews ought to be relegated to an inferior position because they had rejected Christ. This tradition culminated in twen tieth century Europe in hatred directed at secular Jews because of their failure to assimilate completely to European culture. The result was the Holocaust, which was “fro m the standpoint of its perpetrators and collaborators successful beyond belief.” 87 Israel, then, is an attempt at normalization in which Jews would be just another country fending for itse lf and seeking stability; it “should [also] have been the end of anti-Semitism, and the Jews may in any case be pardoned for feeling that they had earned a moment of rest in history.” 88 But the Arab countries never accepted the legitimacy of Israel, not only with their wars against the Jewish state, but also by the “Zionism as racism” UN resolution, which “institutionalized anti- Semitism in international politics.” 89 Wisse criticizes New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis for criticizi ng Israeli policies while failing to similarly criticize Arab states that fail to em body Western ideals of fr eedom of expression and respect for minority rights. Wisse also faults ce rtain American Jewish or ganizations and liberal Jews for criticizing the policies of the government of Menachem Begin. 90 The article stands out for its car toonish view that the history of anti-Jewish attitudes can be explained with broad generalizations according to which the behavior and attitudes of Jews are completely irrelevant for understanding the histor y of anti-Semitism. The message of the article is that Jews as innocent victims of the irrational hatred of Europ eans have a claim for “a respite” from history that Arabs are bound to honor by allowing the dis possession of the Palestinians. The article is also a testimony to the sea change among American Jews in their support for the Likud Party and its expansionist policies in Isra el. Since Wisse’s article appeared in 1981, the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 positive attitudes toward the Likud Party characteris tic of the neoconservatives have become the mainstream view of the organized American Je wish community, and the liberal Jewish critics attacked by Wisse have been relegated to th e fringe of the American Jewish community. 91 In the area of domestic policy, Jewish neoc onservatives were motivated by concerns that the radicalism of the New Left (many of whom were Jews) compromised Jewish interests as a highly intelligent, upwardly mobile group. Although Jews were major allies of blacks in the civil rights movement, by the late 1960s many Jews b itterly opposed black efforts at community control of schools in New York, because they th reatened Jewish hegemony in the educational system, including the teachers’ union. 92 Black-Jewish interests also diverged when affirmative action and quotas for black college admi ssion became a divisive issue in the 1970s. 93 It was not only neoconservatives who worried about affirm ative action: The main Jewish activist groups— the AJCommittee, the AJCongress, and the ADL—sid ed with Bakke in a la ndmark case on racial quota systems in the University of California– Davis medical school, thereby promoting their own interests as a highly intelligent minority living in a meritocracy. 94 Indeed, some neoconservatives, despite their re cord of youthful radicalism and support for the civil rights movement, began to see Jewish interests as bound up with those of the middle class. As Nathan Glazer noted in 1969, comm enting on black anti-Semitism and the murderous urges of the New Left toward the middle class: Anti-Semitism is only part of this whole syndro me, for if the members of the middle class do not deserve to hold on to their property, their positions, or even their lives, then certainly the Jews, the most middle-class of all, are going to be placed at the head of the column marked for liquidation. 95 The New Left also tended to have negative atti tudes toward Israel, with the result that many Jewish radicals eventually abandoned the left. In the late 1960s, the bl ack Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee described Zionism as “racist colonialism” 96 which massacred and oppressed Arabs. In Jewish eyes, a great many black leaders, including Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Touré), Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, and Andrew Young, were seen as entirely too pro-Palestinian. (Young lost his position as UN ambassador because he engaged in secret negotiations with the Palestinians.) During the 1960s, expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians by radical blacks, some of whom had adopted the Muslim religion, became a focus of neoconservative ire and resulted in many Jewish New Leftists leaving the movement. 97 Besides radical blacks, other Ne w Left figures, such as I. F. Stone and Noam Chomsky (both Jews), also criticized Israel and were pe rceived by neocons as ta king a pro-Soviet line. 98 The origins of neoconservatism as a Jewish movement are thus linked to the fact that the left, including the Soviet Union and leftist radicals in the United States, had become anti-Zionist. In 1970 Podhoretz transformed Commentary into a weapon against the New Left. 99 In December of that year National Review began, warily at first, to welcome neocons into the conservative tent, stating in 1971, “We will be de lighted when the new realism manifested in these articles is applied by Commentary to the full range of national and international issues.” 100 Irving Kristol supported Nixon in 1972 and became a Republican about ten years before most neocons made the switch. Nevertheless, even in the 1990s the neocons “con tinued to be distinct from traditional Midwestern and southern conser vatives for their northeas tern roots, combative style, and secularism” 101 —all ways of saying that neoconservatism retained its fundamentally Jewish milieu. The fault lines between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives were apparent during the Reagan administration in the bat tle over the appointment of the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, eventually won by the neoc onservative Bill Bennett. The campaign featured smear tactics and innuendo aimed at M. E. Bradfo rd, an academic literary critic and defender of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 Southern agrarian culture who was favored by tr aditional conservatives. After neocons accused him of being a “virulent racist” and an admirer of Hitler, Bradford was eventually rejected as a potential liability to the administration. 102 The entry of the neoconservatives into the conservative mainstream did not, therefore, proceed without a struggle. Samuel Francis w itnessed much of the early infighting among conservatives, won eventually by the neocons. Fr ancis recounts the “cata log of neoconservative efforts not merely to debate, criticize, and refu te the ideas of traditional conservatism but to denounce, vilify, and harm the careers of those Old Right figures and institutions they have targeted.” 103 There are countless stories of how neoconserva tives have succeeded in entering conservative institutions, forcing out or demoting traditional conservatives, and changing the positions and philosophy of such institutions in neoconservative directions.... Writers like M. E. Bradford, Joseph Sobran, Pat Buchanan, and Russell Kirk, and institutions like Chronicles , the Rockford Institute, the Philadelphia Society, and the Intercollegiate Studi es Institute have been among the most respected and distinguished names in American conserva tism. The dedication of their neoconservative enemies to driving them out of the movement they have taken over and demonizing them as marginal and dangerous figures has no legitimate basis in reality. It is clear evidence of the ulterior aspirations of those behind neoconservatism to do minate and subvert American conservatism from its original purposes and agenda and turn it to other purposes.... What neoconservatives really dislike about their “allies” among traditional conservativ es is simply the fact that the conservatives are conservatives at all—that they support “this notion of a Christian civilization,” as Midge Decter put it, that they oppose mass immigration, that they criticize Martin Luther King and reject the racial dispossession of white Western culture, that they support or approve of Joe McCarthy, that they entertain doubts or strong disagreement over American foreign policy in the Middle East, that they oppose reckless involvement in foreign wars and fo reign entanglements, and that, in company with the Founding Fathers of the United States, they rej ect the concept of a pure democracy and the belief that the United States is or should evolve toward it. 104 Most notably, neoconservatives have been staunch supporters of arguably the most destructive force associated wi th the left in the twentiet h century—massive non-European immigration. Support for massive non-European im migration has spanned the Jewish political spectrum throughout the twentieth century to the present. A principal motivation of the organized Jewish community for encouraging such immigration has involved a deeply felt animosity toward the people and culture respon sible for the immigration restriction of 1924– 1965—“this notion of a Ch ristian civilization.” 105 As neoconservative Ben Wattenberg has famously written, “The non-Europeanization of America is heartening news of an almost transcendental quality.” 106 The only exception—thus far without any influence—is that since 9/11 some Jewish activists, including neoconservative Da niel Pipes, head of the MEF, and Stephen Steinlight, senior fellow of the American Jewish Committee, have opposed Muslim—and only Muslim—immigration because of possible eff ects on pro-Israel sentiment in the U.S. 107 In general, neoconservatives have been far more attached to Jewish interests, and especially the interests of Israel, than to any other identifiable interest. It is revealing that as the war in Iraq has become an expensive quagmire in both lives and money, Bill Kristol has become willing to abandon the neoconservatives’ alliance with traditional conservatives by allying with John Kerry and the Democratic Party. This is because Kerr y has promised to increase troop strength and retain the commitment to Iraq, and because Ke rry has declared that he has “a 100 percent record—not a 99, a 100 percent reco rd—of sustaining the special re lationship and friendship that we have with Israel.” 108 As Pat Buchanan notes, the fact th at John Kerry “backs partial birth abortion, quotas, raising taxes, homosexual uni ons, liberals on the Supreme Court and has a voting record to the left of Teddy Kennedy” is less important than his stand on the fundamental issue of a foreign policy that is in the interest of Israel. 109 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 T HE F ALL OF H ENRY J ACKSON AND THE R ISE OF N EOCONSERVATISM IN THE R EPUBLICAN P ARTY The neoconservative takeover of the Republican Party and of American conservatism in general would have been unnecessary had not the De mocratic Party shifted markedly to the left in the late 1960s. Henry Jackson is the pivotal figure in the defection of the neocons from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party—the person whose political fortunes most determined the later trajectory of neoconser vatism. Jackson embodied the political attitudes and ambitions of a Jewish political network that saw Jewish interests as combining traditionally liberal social policies of the civil rights and Great Society era (but stopping short of advocating quota-type affirmative action policies or mi nority ethnic nationalism) with a Cold War posture that was at once aggressively pro-Israel a nd anticommunist at a time when the Soviet Union was perceived as the most powerful enemy of Israel. This “C old War liberal” faction was dominant in the Democratic Party until 1972 and the nomination of George McGovern. After the defeat of McGovern, the neoconservatives founded the Co mmittee for a Democratic Majority, whose attempt to resuscitate the Cold War coalition of the Democratic Party had a strong representation of Shachtmanite labor l eaders as well as people centered around Podhoretz’s Commentary : Podhoretz; Ben Wattenberg (who wrote speeches fo r Hubert Humphrey and was an aide to Jackson); Midge Decter; Max Kampelman (see a bove); Penn Kemble of the SD/USA; Jeane Kirkpatrick (who began writing for Commentary during this period); soci ologists Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, and Seymour Mart in Lipset; Michael Novak; Sovi et expert Richard Pipes; and Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Nevertheless, “by the end of 1974, the neoconservatives appeared to have reached a political dead end. As guardians of vital center liberalism, they had become a minority faction within the Democratic Party, unable to do more than protest the pa rty’s leftward drift.” 110 The basic story line is that after failing again in 1976 and 1980 to gain the presidential nomination for a candidate who represented their vi ews, this largely Jewish segment of political activists—now known as neoconservatives—switc hed allegiance to the Republican Party. The neocons had considerable influence in the Reag an years but less in th e George H. W. Bush administration, only to become a critically important force in the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration where, in the absence of a threat from the Soviet Union, neoconservatives have attempted to use the power of the United States to fundamentally alter the political landscape of the Middle East. Henry Jackson was an ideal vehicle for this role as champion of Jewish interests. He was a very conscious philosemite: “My mother was a Ch ristian who believed in a strong Judaism. She taught me to respect the Jews, help th e Jews! It was a lesson I never forgot.” 111 Jackson also had very positive personal e xperiences with Jews during his yout h. During his college years he was the beneficiary of generosity from a Jew who al lowed him to use a car to commute to college, and he developed lifelong friendshi ps with two Jews, Stan Golub and Paul Friedlander. He was also horrified after seeing Buchenwald, the WW II German concentration camp, an experience that made him more determined to help Israel and Jews. Entering Congress in 1940, Jackson was a strong supporter of Israel from its beginnings in 1948. By the 1970s he was widely viewed as Is rael’s best friend in Congress: “Jackson’s devotion to Israel made Ni xon and Kissinger’s look tepid.” 112 The Jackson-Vanik Amendment linking U.S.-Soviet trade to the ability of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union was passed over strenuous opposition from the Nixon administ ration. And despite deve loping a reputation as the “Senator from Boeing,” Jackson opposed the sale of Boeing-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia because of the possibility that they might harm the interests of Israel."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 Jackson’s experience of the Depression made hi m a liberal, deeply empathetic toward the suffering that was so common during the peri od. He defined himself as “vigilantly internationalist and anticommunist abroad but statist at home, committed to realizing the New Deal–Fair Deal vision of a strong, active federal government presiding over the economy, preserving and enhancing welfare prot ection, and extending civil rights.” 113 These attitudes of Jackson, and particularly his at titudes on foreign policy, brought hi m into the orbit of Jewish neoconservatives who held similar attitudes on do mestic issues and whose attitudes on foreign policy stemmed fundamentally from thei r devotion to the cause of Israel: Jackson’s visceral anticommunism and antitotalitarianism...brought him into the orbit of Jewish neoconservatives despite the subtle but important di stinction in their outlook. The senator viewed the threat to Israel as a manifestation of the to talitarian threat he considered paramount. Some neoconservatives viewed Soviet totalitarianism as the threat to Israel they considered paramount. 114 Jackson had developed close ties with a number of neocons who would later become important. Richard Perle was Jackson’s most im portant national security advisor between 1969 and 1979, and Jackson maintained close relations with Paul Wolfowitz, w ho began his career in Washington working with Perle in Jackson’s office. Jackson employed Perle even after credible evidence surfaced that he had spied for Israel: An FBI wiretap on the Israeli Embassy revealed Perle discussing classified information that had been supplied to him by someone on the National Security Council staff, presumably He lmut (“Hal”) Sonnenfeldt. (Sonnenfeldt, who was Jewish, “was known from previous wiretaps to ha ve close ties to the Is raelis as well as to Perle.... [He] had been repeatedly investigated by the FBI for other suspected leaks early in his career.” 115 ) As indicated below, several prominent ne ocons have been investigated on credible charges of spying for Israel: Perle, Wolfowitz, Stephen Brye n, Douglas Feith, and Michael Ledeen. Neocon Frank Gaffney, the non-Jewish pr esident of the CSP, a neocon thinktank, was also a Jackson aide. Jackson was also close to Bernard Lewis of Princeton University; Lewis is a Jewish expert on the Middle Ea st who has had an important in fluence on the ne ocons in the George W. Bush administration as well as close ties to Israel. 116 In the 1970s Jackson was involved with two of the most important neocon groups of the period. In 1976 he convened Team B, headed by Richard Pipes (a Harvar d University Soviet expert), and including Paul Nitze, Wolfowitz, a nd Seymour Weiss (former director of the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affair s). Albert Wohlstetter, who was Wolfowitz’s Ph.D. advisor at the University of Chicago, was a major catalyst for Team B. Jackson was also close to the Committee on the Pr esent Danger. Formed in November 1976, the committee was a Who’s Who of Jackson supporters, advisors, confidants, and admirers from both the Democratic and Republican parties, and includ ed several members associated with the SD/USA: Paul Nitze, Eugene Rostow, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Max Kampelman, Lane Kirkland, Richard Pipes, Seymour Martin Lipset, Bayard Rustin, and Norman Podhoretz. CPD was a sort of halfway house for Democratic neocons sliding toward the Republican Party. The result was that all the important neocons backed Jackson for president in 1972 and 1976. Jackson commanded a great deal of financ ial support from the Jewish community in Hollywood and elsewhere because of his strong support for Israel, but he failed to win the 1976 Democratic nomination, despite having more money than his riva ls. After Jackson’s defeat and the ascendance of the leftist tendencies of the Carter administration, many of Jackson’s allies went to work for Reagan with J ackson’s tacit approval, with the re sult that they were frozen out of the Democratic Party once Carter was defeated. 117 A large part of th e disillusionment of Jackson and his followers stemmed from the Carter administration’s attitude toward Israel. Carter alienated American Jews by his proposals for a more evenhanded policy toward Israel, in which Israel would return to it s 1967 borders in exchange for pe ace with the Arabs. Jews were also concerned because of the Andrew Young incident. (Young, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 and an African American, had been fired after failing to disclose to the State Department details of his unauthorized meeting with representatives of the Palestinians. Blacks charged that Jews were responsible for Young’s firing.) In October 1977 the Carter admi nistration, in a joint communi qué with the Soviet Union, suggested Israel pull back to the 1967 borders: “Jackson joined the ferocious attack on the administration that ensued from devotees of Ki ssinger’s incremental approach and from Israel’s supporters in the United States. He continued to regard unswerving U.S. support for Israel as not only a moral but a strategic imperative, and to in sist that the maintena nce of a strong, secure, militarily powerful Israel impeded rather than facilitated Soviet penetration of the Middle East.” 118 Jackson was particularly fond of pointing to maps of Israel showi ng how narrow Israel’s borders had been before its 1967 conquests. For hi s part, Carter threatened to ask the American people “to choose between those who supported th e national interest and those who supported a foreign interest such as Israel.” 119 There was one last attempt to mend the fences between the neocons and the Democrats, a 1980 White House meeting between Carter and major neocons, including Jeane Kirkpatrick, Norman Podhoretz, Midge Decter , Ben Wattenberg, Elliott Abrams (aide to neocon favorite Patrick Moynihan 120 ), Max Kampelman, and Penn Kemble. The meeting, which discussed attitudes toward the USSR, did not go well, and “henceforth, their disdain for Carter and dislike of Kennedy would impel the neoconservatives to turn away from the Democratic Party and vote for Reagan.” 121 “They had hoped to find a new Truman to rally around, a Democrat to promote their liberal ideas at home while fighting the cold war abroad. Not finding one, they embraced the Republican party and Ronald Reagan as the best alternative.” 122 Perle left Jackson’s office in March 1980 to go into business with John F. Lehman (Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administra tion and, as of this writing [2004] a member of the panel investigating the events of 9/11). Quite a few ne ocons assumed positions in the Reagan administration in the area of defense an d foreign policy: Kirkpatrick as UN ambassador (Kirkpatrick hired Joshua Muravchik, Kenneth Ad elman, and Carl Gershman as deputies); Perle as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Internatio nal Security Policy (Perle hired Frank Gaffney and Douglas Feith); Elliott Abrams as Assistan t Secretary of State fo r Human Rights Affairs; Max Kampelman as U.S. ambassador to the Helsi nki human rights conferen ce and later as chief U.S. arms negotiator); Wolfowitz as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs. Another Jewish neocon, Richard Pipes, was influential in putting together a paper on grand strategy toward the USSR. Nevertheless, Reagan kept th e neocons at arm’s length and ceased heeding their advice. He favored developing trust and confidence with Soviet leaders rather than escalating tensions by threat s of aggressive action. 123 Bill Clinton courted neocons who had defected to Reagan. Perle, Kirkpatrick, and Abrams remained Republicans, but thirty-three “modera te and neoconservative foreign policy experts” endorsed Clinton in 1992, including Nitze, Ke mble, and Muravchik, although Muravchik and several others later repudiated their endorsement, saying that Clin ton had returned to the left liberal foreign policy of th e Democrats since McGovern. 124 Ben Wattenberg and Robert Strauss remained Democrats “who have not written o ff the Jackson tradition in their own party.” 125 Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Democrat’s 2000 vice presidential nominee, is the heir to this tradition. R ESPONDING TO THE F ALL OF THE S OVIET U NION With the end of the Cold War, neoconservatives at first advocated a reduced role for the U.S., but this stance switched gradually to the view that U.S. intere sts required the vigorous"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 promotion of democracy in the rest of the world. 126 This aggressively pro-democracy theme, which appears first in the writings of Charles Krauthammer and then those of Elliot Abrams, 127 eventually became an incessant drumbeat in th e campaign for the war in Iraq. Krauthammer also broached the now familiar themes of unilateral intervention and he emph asized the danger that smaller states could develop weapons of mass dest ruction which could be used to threaten world security. 128 A cynic would argue that th is newfound interest in demo cracy was tailor-made as a program for advancing the interests of Israel. After all, Israel is advertised as the only democracy in the Middle East, and democracy has a certain emotional appeal for the United States, which has at times engaged in an idealistic foreign pol icy aimed at furthering the cause of human rights in other countries. It is ironic that during the Cold War the standa rd neocon criticism of President Carter’s foreign policy was that it was overly sensitive to human rights in countries that were opposed to the Soviet Union and insufficiently c ondemnatory of the human rights policies of the Soviet Union. The classic expression of this view was Jeane Kirkpatrick’s 1979 Commentary article, “Dictatorships and D ouble Standards.” In an essay th at would have been excellent reading prior to the invasion of Iraq, Kirkpatrick noted that in many countri es political power is tied to complex family and kinship networks resi stant to modernization. Nevertheless, “no idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated Am ericans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances.” 129 Democracies are said to make heavy demands on c itizens in terms of participation and restraint, and developing democracies is the work of “decades, if not centuries.” 130 My view is that democracy is a component of the uniquely Western suite of trai ts deriving from the evolution of Western peoples and their cultural history: monogamy, simple family structure, i ndividual rights against the state, representative government , moral universalism, and science. 131 This social structure cannot easily be exported to other societies, an d particularly to Middle Eastern societies whose traditional cultures exhibit traits opposite to these. It is revealing that, while neocons generally lost interest in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe after these areas were no longer points of contention in the Cold War, there was no lessening of interest in the Middle East. 132 Indeed, neoconserv atives and Jews in general failed to support President George H. W. Bush whe n, in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, his administration pressured Israel to make concessi ons to the Palestinians and resisted a proposal for $10 billion in loan guarantees for Israel. This occurred in the context of Secretary of State James A. Baker’s famous comment, “F uck the Jews. They didn’t vote for us.” 133 N EOCONSERVATIVE P ORTRAITS As with the other Jewish intellectual moveme nts I have studied, neoconservatives have a history of mutual admiration, close, mutually supportive personal, professional, and familial relationships, and focused cooperation in pur suit of common goals. For example, Norman Podhoretz, the former editor of Commentary , is the father of John Podhoretz, a neoconservative editor and columnist. Norman Podhoretz is also the father-in-law of Elliott Abrams, the former head of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (a neoconservative think tank) and the director of Near Eastern affairs at the National Security Council. Norman’s wife, Midge Decter, recently published a hagiographic biography of Secretary of Defense D onald Rumsfeld, whose number- two and number-three depu ties at the Pentagon, respectively, ar e Wolfowitz and Feith. Perle is a fellow at the AEI. 134 He originally helped Wolfowitz obt ain a job with the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1973. In 1982, Perle, as Deputy Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, hired Feith for a position as hi s Special Counsel, and then as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Negotiations Policy. In 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Wo lfowitz helped Feith"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 obtain an appointment as Undersec retary for Policy. Feith then a ppointed Perle as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. This is only the tip of a very large iceberg. Leo Strauss Leo Strauss is an important influence on seve ral important neoconservatives, particularly Irving and Bill Kristol. Strauss was a classicist and political philosopher at the University of Chicago. He had a very strong Jewish identity an d viewed his philosophy as a means of ensuring Jewish survival in the Diaspora. 135 As Strauss himself noted, “I believe I can say, without any exaggeration, that since a very, very early time th e main theme of my reflections has been what is called the ‘Jewish Question.’ ” 136 Much of Strauss’s early writing was on Jewish issues, and a constant theme in his writing was the idea that Western civilization was th e product of the “energizing tension” between Athens and Jerusalem—Greek rationalism and the Jewish emphasis on faith, revelation, and religious intensity. 137 Although Strauss believed that relig ion had effects on non-Jews that benefited Jews, there is little doubt that Strauss viewed religious fervor as an indispensable element of Jewish commitment and group loyalty—ethnocentrism by any other name: Some great love and loyalty to the Jewish people ar e in evidence in the life and works of Strauss.... Strauss was a good Jew. He knew the dignity and worth of love of one’s own. Love of the good, which is the same as love of the truth, is higher th an love of one’s own, but there is only one road to the truth, and it leads through love of one’s own. Strauss showed his loyalty to things Jewish in a way he was uniquely qualified to do, by showing generations of st udents how to treat Jewish texts with the utmost care and devotion. In this way he turned a number of his Jewish students in the direction of becoming better Jews. 138 Strauss believed that liberal, individualistic modern Western societies were best for Judaism because the illiberal alternatives of both the left (communism) and right (Nazism) were anti- Jewish. (By the 1950s, anti-Semitism had become an important force in the Soviet Union.) However, Strauss believed that liberal societie s were not ideal because they tended to break down group loyalties and group distinctiveness—bot h qualities essential to the survival of Judaism. And he thought that there is a danger that, like the Weimar Re public, liberal societies could give way to fascism, especially if traditional religious and cultural forms were overturned; hence the neoconservative attitude that traditional religious forms among non-Jews are good for Jews. 139 (Although Strauss believed in the importan ce of Israel for Jewish survival, his philosophy is not a defense of Israel but a blueprint for Jewish surv ival in a Diaspo ra in Western societies.) The fate of the Weimar Republic, combined with the emergence of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, had a formative influence on his thinking. As Stephen Holmes writes, “Strauss made his young Jewish-American students gulp by informing them that toleration [secular humanism] was dangerous and that the Enli ghtenment—rather than the failure of the Enlightenment—led direc tly to Adolph Hitler.” 140 Hitler was also at the center of Strauss’s admiration for Churchill—hence the roots of the ne ocon cult of Churchill: “The tyrant stood at the pinnacle of his power. The contrast betw een the indomitable and magnanimous statesman and the insane tyrant—this spectacle in its clear simplicity was one of the greatest lessons which men can learn, at any time.” 141 I suspect that, given Strauss’s str ong Jewish identity, a very large part of his admiration of Churchill was not that Churchill opposed tyrants, but that he went to war against an anti-Jewish tyrant at enormous co st to his own people and nation while allied with another tyrant, Joseph Stalin, who had by 1939 al ready murdered far more people than Hitler ever would."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Strauss has become a cult figure—the quintessen tial rabbinical guru, with devoted disciples such as Allan Bloom. 142 Strauss relished his role as a gur u to worshiping disc iples, once writing of “the love of the mature philosopher for the puppi es of his race, by whom he wants to be loved in turn.” 143 In turn, Strauss was a disciple of Herma nn Cohen, a philosopher at the University of Marburg, who ended his career teaching in a rabbi nical school; Cohen was a central figure in a school of neo-Kantian intellectuals whose main concern was to rationalize Jewish nonassimilation into German society. Strauss understood that inequali ties among humans were inevitable and advocated rule by an aristocratic elite of philosopher kings forced to pay lip service to the traditional religious and political beliefs of the masses while not believing them. 144 This elite should pursue its vision of the common good but must reach out to others using deception and manipul ation to achieve its goals. As Bill Kristol has descri bed it, elites have the duty to guide public opinion, but “one of the main teachings [of Strauss] is that all politic s are limited and none of them is really based on the truth.” 145 A more cynical characterization is provided by Stephen Holmes: “The good society, on this model, consists of the sedate d masses, the gentlemen rulers, the promising puppies, and the philosophers who pursue knowledge , manipulate the gentlemen, anesthetize the people, and housebreak th e most talented young” 146 —a comment that sounds to me like an alarmingly accurate description of the present situation in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world. Given Strauss’s central concern th at an acceptable political order be compatible with Jewish survival, it is reasonable to assume that Strauss believed th at the aristocracy would serve Jewish interests. Strauss’s philosophy is not really conservative. The rule by an aristocratic elite would require a complete political transformation in or der to create a society that was “as just as possible”: Nothing short of a total transformation of imbedded custom must be undertaken. To secure this inversion of the traditional hierarchies, the political, social and educational system must be subjected to a radical reformation. For justice to be possible the founders have to “wipe clean the dispositions of men,” that is, justice is possible only if the city and its citizens are not what they are : the weakest [i.e., the philosophic elite] is supposed to rule the strongest [the masses], the irrational is supposed to submit to the rule of the rational. 147 [emphasis in original] Strauss described the need for an external exoteric language directed at outsiders, and an internal esoteric language directed at ingroup members. 148 A general feature of the movements I have studied is that this Straus sian prescription has been followed: Issues are framed in language that appeals to non-Jews rather than explicitly in terms of Jewish interests, although Jewish interests always remain in the background if one cares to look a little deeper. The most common rhetoric used by Jewish intelle ctual and political movements ha s been the language of moral universalism and the language of science—languages that appeal to the educated elites of the modern Western world. 149 But beneath the rhetoric it is eas y to find statements describing the Jewish agendas of the principal actors. And th e language of moral universalism (e.g., advocating democracy as a universal moral imperative) go es hand in hand with a narrow Jewish moral particularism (altering governments that represent a danger to Israel). It is noteworthy in this respect that the split between the leftist critics of Strauss like Shadia Drury and Stephen Holmes versus Strauss’s di sciples like Allan Bloom and Harry V. Jaffa comes down to whether Strauss is pr operly seen as a universalist. Th e leftist critics claim that the moral universalism espoused by Strauss’s disciples is nothing more than a veneer for his vision of a hierarchical society based on manipulation of the masses. As noted, the use of a universalist rhetoric to mask par ticularist causes has a l ong history among Jewish intellectual and political movements, and it fits well with Strauss’s fa mous emphasis on esoteric messages embedded in"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 the texts of great thinkers. Moreove r, there is at least some textua l support for the leftist critique, although there can never be certaint y because of the intentionally enigmatic nature of Strauss’s writings. I am merely adding to the leftist critique th e idea that Strauss crafted his vision of an aristocratic elite manipulating th e masses as a Jewish survival st rategy. In doing s o, I am taking seriously Strauss’s own characte rization of his work as centra lly motivated by “the Jewish question” and by the excellent evidence for his strong commitment to the continuity of the Jewish people. At a fundamental level, based on my scholarship on Je wish intellectual and political movements, one cannot understand Stra uss’s well-attested stan ding as a Jewish guru— as an exemplar of the familiar pattern of an in tellectual leader in the manner of Boas or Freud surrounded by devoted Jewish disciples— unless he had a specifically Jewish message . The simple logic is as follows: Based on the data presented here, it is quite clear that Strauss understood that neither communi sm nor fascism was good for Jews in the long run. But democracy cannot be trusted given that Weimar ended with Hitler. A solution is to advocate democracy and the trappings of traditional religious culture, but managed by an elite able to manipulate the masses via control of the media a nd academic discourse. Jews have a long history as an elite in Western societies, so it is not in the least surprising that Strauss would advocate an ideal society in which Jews woul d be a central component of th e elite. In my view, this is Strauss’s esoteric message. The exoteric message is the universalist ve neer promulgated by Strauss’s disciples—a common enough pattern among Jewish intellectual and political movements. On the other hand, if one accepts at face value th e view of Strauss’s disciples that he should be understood as a theorist of eg alitarianism and democracy, then Strauss’s legacy becomes just another form of leftism, and a rather undistingui shed one at that. In th is version, the United States is seen as a “proposition nation” committed only to the ideals of democracy and egalitarianism—an ideology that originated with Jewish leftist intellectuals like Horace Kallen. 150 Such an ideology not only fails to protect th e ethnic interests of European Americans in maintaining their culture and demographic dominan ce, it fails as an adequate survival strategy for Jews because of the possibility that, like We imar Germany, the U.S. could be democratically transformed into a state that self-consciously opposes the ethnic interests of Jews. The most reasonable interpretation is that ne ocons see Strauss’s moral universalism as a powerful exoteric ideology. The ideology is powerful among non-Je ws because of the strong roots of democracy and egalitarianism in American history and in the history of the West; it is attractive to Jews because it has no ethnic content and is therefore useful in combating the ethnic interests of European Americans—its func tion for the Jewish left throughout the 20 th century. 151 But without the esoteric message that the proposition nation mu st be managed and manipulated by a covert, Jewish-dominated elite, such an id eology is inherently un stable and cannot be guaranteed to meet the long-term interests of Jews. And one must remember that the neocons’ public commitment to egalitarianism belies their own status as an elite who were educated at elite academic institutions and created an elite network at the highest levels of the government. Th ey form an elite that is deeply involved in deception, manipulation and espionage on issues relate d to Israel and the wa r in Iraq. They also established the massive neocon infrastructure in the elite media and think tanks. And they have often become wealthy in the pr ocess. Their public pronouncem ents advocating a democratic, egalitarian ideology have not prevented them fr om having strong ethnic identities and a strong sense of their own ethnic interests; nor have their public pronouncements supporting the Enlightenment ideals of egalitarianism and de mocracy prevented them from having a thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 anti-Enlightenment ethnic particularist commitment to the most nationalistic, aggressive, racialist elements within Israel—the Likud Party, the settle r movement, and the religious fanatics. At the end of the day, the only alternative to the existen ce of an esoteric Straussian message along the lines described here is massive self-deception. Sidney Hook Born in 1902, Sidney Hook was an important leader of the anti-Stalinist, non-Trotskyist left. Hook’s career is interesting because he illustrates an evolu tion toward neoconservatism that was in many ways parallel to the Shachtmanite s. Indeed, Hook ended up as honorary chairman of the SD/USA during the 1980s. 152 Hook became a socialist at a time when virtually all socialists supporte d the Bolshevik revolutio n as the only alternat ive to the anti-Jewish government of the tsar. 153 As a professional philosopher, he saw his role as an attempt to develop an intellectually respectable Marxism strengthene d with Dewey’s ideas. But until the Moscow Trials of the 1930s he was blind to the violence and oppression in the USSR. During a visit to the USSR in 1929, “I was completely oblivious at the time to the system atic repressions that were then going on against noncommunist elements and altogether ignorant of the liquidation of the so-called kulaks that had al ready begun that summer. I was not even curious enough to probe and pry, possibly for fear of what I would discover.” 154 During the 1930s, when the Communist Party exercised a dominant cultural influence in the United States, “the fear of fascism helped to blur our vision and blunt our hearing to the reports that kept trickling out of the Soviet Union.” 155 Even the Moscow Trials were dismissed by large s ectors of liberal opinion. It was the time of the Popular Front, where the fundamental principle was the defense of the Soviet Union. Liberal journals like the New Republic did not support inquiries into the trials, citing New York Times reporter Walter Duranty as an authority who believed in the truth of the confessions. Unlike the Shachtmanites, Hook ne ver accepted Trotsky because of his record of defending “every act of the Soviet regime, until he himself lost power.” 156 “To the very end Trotsky remained a blind, pitiless (even when pitiable) giant, defending the right of the minority vanguard of the proletariat—the Party—to exercise its dictatorship over ‘the backward layers of the proletariat’—i.e., those who disagr eed with the self-d esignated vanguard.” 157 Hook became a leader of the anti-Stalinist le ft in the 1930s and during the Cold War, usually with John Dewey as the most visible public persona in various orga nizations dedicated to opposing intellectual thought contro l. His main issue came to be openness versus totalitarianism rather than capitalism versus socialism. Like other neoconservatives, from the 1960s on he opposed the excesses of the New Left, includin g affirmative action. Sidney Hook received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan. Like many neoconservatives, he never abandoned many of his leftist views: In his ac ceptance speech, Hook stated that he was “an unreconstructed believer in the welfare state, steeply progressive income tax, a secular humanist,” and pr o-choice on abortion. 158 Sounding much like SD/USA stalwart Joshua Muravchik, 159 Hook noted that socialists like himsel f “never took the problem of incentives seriously enough.” 160 Like Strauss, Hook’s advocacy of the open so ciety stemmed from his belief that such societies were far better for Juda ism than either the to talitarian left or ri ght. Hook had a strong Jewish identification: He was a Zionist, a str ong supporter of Israel, and an advocate of Jewish education for Jewish children. 161 Hook developed an elaborate a pologia for Judaism and against anti-Semitism in the modern world, 162 and he was deeply concerned about the emergence of anti- Semitism in the USSR. 163 The ideal society is thus cu lturally diverse and democratic:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 No philosophy of Jewish life is required excep t one—identical with the democratic way of life—which enables Jews who for any reason at a ll accept their existen ce as Jews to lead a dignified and significant life, a life in whic h together with their fellowmen they strive collectively to improve the quality of democr atic, secular cultures and thus encourage a maximum of cultural diversity, both Jewish and non-Jewish. 164 Stephen Bryen Despite his low profile in the George W. Bush administration, Stephen Bryen is an important neocon. Bryen served as executive director of JINSA from 1979 to 1981 and remains on its advisory board. He is also affiliated with the AEI and the CSP. Richard Perle hired Bryen as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan ad ministration. At the Pentagon, Perle and Bryen led an effort to extend and stre ngthen the Export Administration Act to grant the Pentagon a major role in technology transfer policy. This po licy worked to the be nefit of Israel at the expense of Europe, as Israel alone had access to the most secret technology designs. 165 In 1988 Bryen and Perle temporarily received permi ssion to export sensitive klystron technology, used in antiballistic missiles, to Israel. “Two se nior colleagues in [the Department of Defense] who wish to remain anonymous have confirmed that this attempt by Br yen to obtain klystrons for his friends was not unusual, and was in fact ‘standard operating procedure’ for him, recalling numerous instances when U.S. companies were denied licenses to export sensitive technology, only to learn later that Israeli companies subsequently expor ted similar (U.S. derived) weapons and technology to the intended customers/governments.” 166 It is surprising that Perle was able to hire Bryen at all given that, be ginning in 1978, Bryen was investigated for offering classified documen ts to the Mossad stati on chief of the Israeli embassy in the presence of an AIPAC representative. 167 Bryen’s fingerprints were found on the documents in question despite his denials that he had ever had the documents in his possession. (Bryen refused to take a polygraph test.) Th e Bryen investigation was ultimately shut down because of the failure of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to grant access to the Justice Department to files important to the investigation, and becau se of the decision by Philip Heymann, the chief of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and later Deputy Attorney General in the Clinton Admini stration, to drop the case. Heymann is Jewish and had a close relations hip with Bryen’s lawyer, Nathan Lewin. Heymann’s Jewish consciousness can be seen from the fact that he participated in the campaign to free Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard and expunge his record —a major effort by a great many Jewish organizations and Jewish activists such as Alan Dershowitz. There were reports that Heymann was attempting to byp ass Attorney General Janet Reno by preparing a Justice Department recommendation for presidential clem ency, and that Heymann’s behavior may have been a factor in his resignation shortly thereafter. 168 Despite this history of covert pro-Israeli activism, in 2001 Bryen was appointed, at the urging of Paul Wolfowitz, to the China Commi ssion, which monitors illic it technology transfers to China, a position that requires top secret security clearance. 169 Many of the il licit technology transfers investigated by the commission ar e thought to have occurred via Israel. Charles Krauthammer In his 1995 book, John Ehrman regards Charle s Krauthammer as a key neoconservative foreign policy analyst because Krauthammer was on the cutting edge of neocon thinking on how to respond to the unipolar world created by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Krauthammer has consistently urged that the U.S. pursue a policy to remake the en tire Arab world—a view that"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 represents the “party line” among neoconserva tives (e.g., Michael Ledeen, Norman Podhoretz, Bill Kristol, David Frum, and Richard Perle 170 ). In a speech at th e AEI in February 2004, Krauthammer argued for a unilate ral confrontation with the en tire Arab-Muslim world (and nowhere else) in the interests of “democratic glob alism.” He advocated a U.S. foreign policy that is not “tied down” by “multilateralism”: “the w hole point of the multilateral enterprise: To reduce American freedom of action by making it subservient to, dependent on, constricted by the will—and interests—of other nations. To tie down Gulliver with a thousand strings. To domesticate the most undomesticated, most outsized, national intere st on the planet—ours.” 171 Democratic globalism is aimed at winning th e struggle with the Arab-Islamic world: Beyond power. Beyond interest. Beyond interest de fined as power. That is the credo of democratic globalism. Which explains its political appeal: Am erica is a nation uniquely built not on blood, race or consanguinity, but on a proposition—to whic h its sacred honor has been pledged for two centuries.... Today, post-9/11, we find ourselves in an...existential struggle but with a different enemy: not Soviet communism, but Arab -Islamic totalitarianism, both secular and religious...[D]emocratic globalism is an improvement over realism. What it can teach realism is that the spread of democracy is not just an end but a means, an indispensab le means for securing American interests. The reason is simple. Democracies are inherently more friendly to the United States, less belligerent to their neighbors, and gene rally more inclined to peace. Realists are right that to protect your interests you often have to go around the world bashing bad guys over the head. But that technique, no matter how satisfying, has its limits. At some point, you have to implant something, something organic and self-developing. And that something is democracy. But where? The danger of democratic globalism is its unive rsalism, its open-ended commitment to human freedom, its temptation to plant the flag of democracy everywhere. It must learn to say no. And indeed, it does say no. But when it says no to Liberia, or Congo, or Burma, or countenances alliances with authoritarian rulers in places like Paki stan or, for that matter, Russia, it stands accused of hypocrisy. Which is why we must articulate criteria for saying yes.... I propose a single criterion: where it counts.... And this is its axiom: We will support democracy everywhere, but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity—meaning, places central to the larger war against the existential enemy, the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom. Where does it count today? Where the overthrow of radicalism and the beginnings of democracy can have a decisive effect in the war against th e new global threat to freedom, the new existential enemy, the Arab-Islamic totalitarianis m that has threatened us in bo th its secular and religious forms for the quarter-century since the Khomeini revolu tion of 1979 ... There is not a single, remotely plausible, alternative strategy for attacking the m onster behind 9/11. It’s no t Osama bin Laden; it is the cauldron of political oppression, religious intole rance, and social ruin in the Arab-Islamic world—oppression transmuted and deflected by regim es with no legitimacy into virulent, murderous anti-Americanism. It’s not one man; it is a condition. 172 Krauthammer is a Jew and his Jewish identifica tion and pro-Israel motivation is typical of Jewish neoconservatives, as is his obeisance to the idea that America is a proposition nation, rather than a nation founded by a particular ethn ic group—an ethnocultural creation of Western Europe that should attempt to preserve this heritage. The same attitude can be seen in Irving Kristol’s comment that the U.S. is an “ide ological nation” committed to defend Israel independent of national interest (see above). This ideology was the creation of leftist Jewish intellectuals attempting to rationalize a multicultural America in which European-Americans were just one of ma ny cultural/ethnic groups. 173 He is a regular columnist for the Jerusalem Post and has written extens ively in support of hard-line policies in Israel and on what he interpre ts as a rise in age-old anti-Jewish attitudes in Europe. In 2002 Krauthammer was presented with Bar-Ilan University’s annual Guardian of Zion Award at the King David Hotel in Jerusale m. His acceptance speech reveals an observant Jew who is steeped in Jewish history and the Hebrew tradition. Th e 1993 Oslo Accords are termed “the most catastrophic a nd self- inflicted wound by any stat e in modern history”; this disastrous policy was based on “an extreme expression of post-Zionistic messianism.” 174 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 Krauthammer rejected the “secular messianism” of Shimon Peres as more dangerous than the religious messianism of Gush Emunim (a promin ent settler group with a message of Jewish racialism and a vision of a “Greater Israel” en compassing the lands promised to Abraham in Genesis—from the Nile to the Euphrates 175 ) or of certain followers of the Lubavitcher Rebbe because of its impact on shaping contemporary Jewish history. Krauthammer is also deeply concerned with anti-Semitism: What is odd is not the anti-Semitism of today [i n Europe], but its relative absence during the last half-century. That was the histori cal anomaly. Holocaust shame kept the demon corked for that half- century. But now the atonement is passed. The geni e is out again. This time, however, it is more sophisticated. It is not a blanket hatred of Jews. Jews can be tolerated, even accepted, but they must know their place. Jews are fine so long as they are powerless, passive and picturesque. What is intolerable is Jewish assertiveness, the Jewish refusal to accept victimhood. And nothing so embodies that as the Jewish state. 176 Another barometer of Jewish identification is Krauthammer’s take on Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ . In sentiments similar to those of ma ny other Jewish activists and writers, he terms ita “blood libel,” “a singu lar act of interreligious aggre ssion,” a “spectacul arly vicious” personal interpretation. 177 Gibson’s interpretations “point ov erwhelmingly in a single direction — to the villainy and culpability of the Jews.” The crucifixion is “a history of centuries of relentless, and at times savage, persecution of Jews in Christian lands.” One gets the impression of a writer searching as best he can to find the most extrem e terms possible to express his loathing of Gibson’s account of the Christian gospel. Paul Wolfowitz Paul Wolfowitz’s background indi cates a strong Jewish identi ty. His father Jacob was a committed Zionist throughout his life and in his la ter years organized protests against Soviet treatment of Jews. 178 Jacob was deeply concerned about the Holocaust, 179 and, in his own reminiscences of his teenage years, Paul recalls reading books about the Holocaust and traveling to Israel when his father was a visiting profe ssor at an Israeli university. Wolfowitz reads Hebrew, and his sister married an Israeli and lives in Israel. 180 At the University of Chicago the professors mentioned in his account of the period are all Jewish: 181 Albert Wohlstetter, his Ph.D. advisor; Leo Strauss (Wolfowitz’s original intent when enrolling at the University of Chicago was to study with Strauss, and he ended up taking two courses from him); Strauss’s disciple Alan Bloom, whose Closing of the American Mind: How Hi gher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today’s Students (1987) is a neocon classic; and Saul Bellow, the novelist. Also indicative of a strong Jewish identity is a conversation Wolf owitz had with Natan Sharansky, Israeli Cabinet Minister and leader of a right wing, pro-settleme nt political party, at a conference on Middle East policy in Aspen, Colorado, in 2002. The conference was arranged by Richard Perle under the auspices of the AEI. Wo lfowitz and Sharansky walked to a reception, because the latter, as an observant Jew, could not drive on the Sabbath. Sharansky noted that the walk “gave us a chance to talk about everythi ng — Arafat, internationa l terrorism, Iraq and Iran and, of course, Jewish hi story, our roots and so on.” 182 Wolfowitz is married to Clare Selgin, and they have three children, Sara, David, and Rachel. 183 Ravelstein is Bellow’s fictionalized but essentiall y accurate description of Alan Bloom and his circle at the University of Chicago. 184 It is of some interest because it recreates the Jewish atmosphere of Wolfowitz’s academic environmen t. Wolfowitz was a member of Bloom’s circle at Cornell University and chose the University of Chicago for hi s graduate training because of the presence there of Leo Strauss, most likely at the urging of Bloo m. Wolfowitz and Bloom"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 maintained a close relationship after Bloom m oved to the University of Chicago and during Wolfowitz’s later career in the government. Wolf owitz was one of the “favored students” of Bloom described in Robert Lock e’s comment that “Favored st udents of the usually haughty Bloom were gradually introduced to greater and greater intimacies with the master, culminating in exclusive dinner parties with him and Saul [Bellow] in Bloom’s lavishly furnished million- dollar apartment.” 185 As depicted by Bellow, Bloom emerges as the quintessential guru, surrounded by disciples—a “father” who attempts not only to di rect his disciples’ ca reers but their personal lives as well. 186 His disciples are described as “clones who dressed as he did, smoked the same Marlboros”; they were heading toward “the Promised Land of the intellect toward which Ravelstein, their Moses and their Socrates, led them.” 187 “To be cut off from his informants in Washington and Paris, from his students, the people he had trained, th e band of brothers, the initiates, the happy few made him extremely uncomfortable.” 188 Bloom in turn is depicted as a “disciple” of the Strauss charact er, Felix Davarr: “Ravelstein talk ed so much about him that in the end I was obliged to read some of his books. It had to be done if I was to understand what [Ravelstein] was all about.” 189 Bloom’s Ravelstein is depicted as very self -consciously Jewish. A theme is the contrast between “crude” Jewish behavior and genteel WA SP behavior—a theme described beautifully and authoritatively in the writings of John Murray Cuddihy. 190 And there is the acute consciousness of who is a Jew and who isn’t; all of Ravelstein’s close friends are Jews. There is an intense interest in whether non-Jews dislike Jews or have connections to fascism. And there is a fixation on the Holocaust and when it will happe n again: “They kill more than half of the European Jews...There’s no telling which corner it will come from next.” 191 Ravelstein thought of Jews as displacing WASPs: He “liked to th ink of living in one of the tony flat buildings formerly occupied by the exclusively WASP faculty.” 192 Following Strauss, Bloom thought of Western civilization as the product of Athens and Jerusalem, and is said to have preferred the fo rmer, at least until the end of his life, when Jerusalem loomed large: Bellow’s narrator wr ites, “I could see [R avelstein/Bloom] was following a trail of Jewish ideas or Jewish essences. It was unusual for him these days, in any conversation, to mention even Plato or T hucydides. He was full of Scripture now”—all connected to “the great evil,” the belief duri ng the World War II era “that almost everybody agreed that the Jews had no right to live...a vast collective agreement that the world would be improved by their disappearance and their extinction.” 193 Ravelstein’s conclusion is that “it is impossible to get rid of one’s origins, it is impossible not to remain a Jew. The Jews, Ravelstein...thought, following the line laid down by [his] teache r Davarr [Strauss], were historically witnesses to the absence of redemption.” 194 Ravelstein recounts a conversat ion with the Wolfowitz char acter, Philip Gorman, which reflects Wolfowitz’s well-known desi re to invade Iraq in 1991: Colin Powell and Baker have advised the President not to send the troops all the way to Baghdad. Bush will announce it tomorrow. They’re afraid of a few casualties. They send out a terrific army and give a demonstration of up-to-date high-tech warfare that flesh and blood can’t stand up to. But then they leave the dictator ship in place and steal away.... 195 Wolfowitz has had a close relationship with Richard Perle beginning with their service in the office of Sen. Henry Jackson. 196 He also has a long record of pro-Israel advocacy. In 1973 he was appointed to the Arms Control and Disarm ament Agency (ACDA); Mark Green notes that “Wolfowitz...brought to ACDA a strong attachment to Israel’s secu rity, and a certain confusion about his obligation to U.S. national security.” 197 In 1978, he was investigated for providing a"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 classified document to the Israeli government through an AIPAC intermediary, but the investigation ended without i ndictment. (As Paul Findley s hows, leakage of classified information to Israel by American Jews is routine within the Depa rtments of State and Defense—so routine that it is accepted as a part of life in these departments, and investigations of the source of leaks are seldom performed. 198 ) Later, in 1992, the Department of Defense discovered that Wolfowitz, as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, was promoting the export to Israel of advanced AIM-9M air-to-air missiles. The sale was canceled because Israel had been caught selling the previous version to the Chinese. Until his appointment as Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Bush administration, Wolfowitz was on the Advisory Board of WINEP, and was a patron of Dennis Ross, who was Ambassador to Israel in the Clinton Administration before becoming director of Policy and St rategic Planning at WINEP. Wolfowitz wrote a 1997 Weekly Standard article advocating removal of Saddam Hussein, and signed the public letter to President Clint on organized by Bill Kristol’s Project for the New American Century urging a regime change in Iraq. Within the George H. W. Bush administration, Wolfowitz was “t he intellectual godfather and fi ercest advocate for toppling Saddam.” 199 Wolfowitz has become famous as a key advocate for war with Iraq rather than Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of September 11. 200 Richard Clarke recounts an incident on September 12, 2001, in which President Bush asked a group at the White House for any information that Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 attacks. After Bush left, a staffer “stared at [Bush] with her mouth open. ‘Wolfowitz got to him.’” 201 Former CIA political analysts Kathleen and Bill Christison note that “One source inside the administration has described [Wolfowitz] frankl y as ‘over-the-top crazy when it comes to Israel.’” 202 Although they find such an assessment insu fficiently nuanced, they acknowledge that zealotry for Israel is a prime motivator for Wo lfowitz. Journalist Bill Keller is much more cautious: You hear from some of Wolfowitz’s critics, always off the record, that Israel exercises a powerful gravitational pull on the man. They may not know that as a teenager he spent his father’s sabbatical semester in Israel or that his sister is married to an Israeli, but they certainly know that he is friendly with Israel’s generals and diplomats and that he is something of a hero to the heavily Jewish neoconservative movement. Those who know hi m well say this—leaving aside the offensive suggestion of dual loyalty—is looki ng at Wolfowitz through the wr ong end of the telescope. As the Sadat story illustrates, he has generally been l ess excited by the security of Israel than by the promise of a more moderate Islam. 203 This is a remarkable statement. “The Sadat story” refers to Wolfowitz’s very positive reaction to Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat’s speech to the Knesset as part of the peace process between Israel and Egypt. Obviously, it is sill y to suppose that this event shows Wolfowitz’s relative disinterest in Israel’s security. Moreove r, statements linking Wolfowitz to Israel are always off the record, presumably because people fear retaliation for stating the obvious. Thus Bill Keller coyly manages to document the asso ciations between Wolfowitz and Israel while finding assertions of dual loyalty “offensiv e” rather than a well-grounded probability. One of Joshua Muravchik’s apologetic claims is that “in fact the careers of leading neoconservatives have rarely invol ved work on Middle East issues.\" 204 This is false. For example, Wolfowitz wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. During the Carter administration, he prepared the Limite d Contingency Study, which emphasized the “Iraqi threat” to the region, and during the Reagan administra tion he lobbied agains t selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia and against negotia ting with the Palestinians; during the George H. W. Bush administration he was Undersecretary of Defens e for Policy, a position where he “would once"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 again have responsibility for arms control, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, the areas to which he had devoted the ear ly years of his career.” 205 Richard Perle Like Wolfowitz and the Strauss-Bloom nexus at the University of Chicago, for Perle the defining moment in our history was certainl y the Holocaust.... It wa s the destruction, the genocide of a whole people, and it was the failure to respond in a timely fashion to a threat that was clearly gathering...We don't want that to ha ppen again...when we have the ability to stop totalitarian regimes we should do so, because wh en we fail to do so, the results are catastrophic. 206 Richard Perle first came into prominence in Washington as Senator Henry Jackson’s chief aide on foreign policy. He organized Congr essional support for the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which angered Russia by linking bilateral trade issues to freedom of emigration, primarily of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel and the United St ates. In 1970 Perle was recorded by the FBI discussing classified inform ation with the Israeli embassy. In 1981 he was on the payroll of an Israeli defense contractor s hortly before being appoint ed Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, a position responsible for monitoring U.S. defense technology exports. 207 During his tenure in the Reagan administration Perle recommended purchase of an artillery shell made by Soltan, an Israeli munitions manufacturer. After leaving his position in the Defense Department in 1987, he assumed a position with Soltan. Like many other former government officials, he has also used his reputation and contacts in the government to develop a highly lucrative busine ss career. For example, although he did not personally register as a lobbyist, he became a paid consultant to a firm headed by Douglas Feith that was established to lobby on behalf of Turkey. 208 At the present time, Perle is on the board of directors of Onset Technology, a technology company founded by Is raelis Gadi Mazor and Ron Maor with R&D in Israel. Onset Technology has cl ose ties to Israeli companies and investment funds. 209 He is a close personal friend of Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 210 Perle was the “Study Group Leader” of a 19 96 report titled “A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm” published by the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies (IASPS), an Israeli think tank. The membership of the study group illustrates the overlap between Israeli think tanks close to the Is raeli government, American policy makers and government officials, and pro-Is rael activists worki ng in the United States . Other members of this group who accepted positions in the George W. Bush administration or in pro-Israel activist organizations in the U.S. include Douglas Feith (Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy), David Wurmser (member of IASPS, a protégé of Pe rle at AEI, and senior advisor in the State Department), Mayrev Wurmser (head of the H udson Institute [a neocon thinktank]), James Colbert of JINSA,and Jonathan Torop (WINEP). Despite Joshua Muravchik’s apologetic claims, 211 the “Clean Break” report was clearly intended as advice for another of Perle’s personal friends, 212 Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then the new prime minister of Israel; there is no i ndication that it was an effort to further U.S. interests in the region. The pur pose was to “forge a peace proc ess and strategy based on an entirely new intellectual foundation , one that restores strategic in itiative and provides the nation the room to engage every possible energy on rebu ilding Zionism.” Indeed, the report advises the United States to avoid pressure on the Israelis to give land for peace, a st rategy “which required funneling American money to repressive and aggre ssive regimes, was risky, expensive, and very costly for both the U.S. and Israel, and placed th e United States in roles it should neither have nor want.” The authors of the repo rt speak as Jews and Israelis, no t as U.S. citizens: “Our claim to the land—to which we have clung for hope for 2000 years—is legitimate and noble.”Much of the focus is on removing the threat of Syria, and it is in this context that the report notes, “This"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq—an importa nt Israeli strategic objective in its own right—as a means of foiling Syria’s regional ambitions.” 213 Proposals for regime change, such as found in “A Clean Break,” ha ve a long history in Israeli thought. For example, in 1982 Israeli strategist Oded Yinon echoed a long line of Israeli strategists who argued that Israel should attempt to di ssolve all the existi ng Arab states into smaller, less potentially powerful states. These st ates would then become clients of Israel as a regional imperial power. Neocons ha ve advertised the war in Iraq as a crusade for a democratic, secular, Western-oriented, pro-Israel Iraq—a dream that has a great deal of appeal in the West, for obvious reasons. However, it is quite possible that the long-term result is that Iraq would fracture along ethnic and religious lines (Sunnis, Sh iites, Kurds). This would also be in Israel’s interests, because the resulting states would pose le ss of a threat than the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. As Yinon noted, “Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets . Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel.” 214 Former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson has sugge sted that the dissolu tion of Iraq may well have been a motive for the war: A more cynical reading of the agenda of certain Bu sh advisers could conclude that the Balkanization of Iraq was always an acceptable outcome, because Is rael would then find itself surrounded by small Arab countries worried about each other instead of forming a solid block against Israel. After all, Iraq was an artificial country that had always had a troublesome history. 215 And as the Iraqi insurgency has achieved moment um, there is evidence that Israeli military and intelligence units are operating in Kurdish regions of Iraq and that Israel is indeed encouraging the Kurds to form their own state. 216 There is little doubt that an independent Kurdish state would have major repercussions fo r Syria and Iran, as well as for Israel’s ally Turkey, and would lead to contin uing instability in the Middle Ea st. A senior Turkish official noted, “If you end up with a divi ded Iraq, it will bring more bl ood, tears, and pain to the Middle East, and [the U.S.] will be blamed...From Mexi co to Russia, everybody will claim that the United States had a secret agenda in Iraq: you ca me there to break up Iraq. If Iraq is divided, America cannot explain this to the world.” Elliott Abrams Some of Elliott Abrams’ neoconservative family and professional associations have been described above. In December 2002 Abrams became President Bush’s top Middle East advisor. He is closely associated with the Likud Party in Israel and with prom inent neocons (Richard Perle, Bill Kristol, Marc Paul Gerecht, Michae l Ledeen, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Paul Wolfowitz) and neocon think tanks (PNAC, AEI, CSP, JINSA). 217 Because of his reputation as a strongly identified Jew, Abrams was tapped for the role of rallying Jews in support of Reagan in the 1980 campaign. 218 Abrams is also an activist on behalf of Jewish continuity. The purpose of his book Faith and Fear: How Jews Can Survive in Christian America is to shore up Jewish religious identification, avoid intermarriage, and avoid secularization in orde r to assure Jewish continuity. In this regard it is interesti ng that other prominent neocons ha ve advocated interracial marriage between whites and blacks in the U.S. For exampl e, Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the AEI, has written that the offspring of interrac ial marriages “are the best hope for the future of American race relations.” 219 "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 In Faith and Fear, Abrams notes his own deep immersi on in the Yiddish-speaking culture of his parents and grandparents. In the grandpar ents’ generation, “all thei r children married Jews, and [they] kept Kosher homes.” 220 Abrams acknowledges that the mainstream Jewish community “clings to what is at bottom a dark vision of America, as a land permeated with anti-Semitism and always on the verge of anti-Semitic outbursts.” The result is that Jews have taken the lead in secularizing America, but that has not been a good strategy for Jews because Jews themselves have become less religious and therefore less inc lined to marry other Jews . (This “dark vision of America” is a critical source of the “Culture of Critique” pr oduced by Jewish intellectual movements; it is also a major reason why the Jewish community has been united in favor of large-scale nonwhite immigration to America: Diluting the white majority and lessening their power is seen as preventi ng an anti-Jewish outburst. 221 ) Following Strauss, therefore, Abrams thinks that a strong role for Christ ianity in America is good for Jews: In this century we have seen two gigantic experiments at postreligi ous societies where the traditional restraints of religion and morality were entirel y removed: Communism and Nazism. In both cases Jews became the special targets, but there was evil enough even without the scourge of anti- Semitism. For when the transcendental inhibition ag ainst evil is removed, when society becomes so purely secular that the restraints imposed by God on man are truly eradicated, minorities are but the earliest victims.” 222 Douglas Feith Like most of his cronies, Feith has been suspected of spying for Israel. In 1972 Feith was fired from a position with the National Security C ouncil because of an investigation into whether he had provided documents to the Israeli emba ssy. Nevertheless, Perle, who was Assistant Secretary for International Secur ity Policy, hired him as his “speci al counsel,” and then as his deputy. Feith worked for Perle until 1986, when he left government service to form a law firm, Feith and Zell, which was originally based in Israel and best known fo r obtaining a pardon for the notorious Marc Rich during the final days of th e Clinton administrati on. In 2001, Douglas Feith returned to the Department of Defense as Donald Rumsfeld’s Undersecretary for Policy, and it was in his office that Abraham Shulsky’s Office of Special Plans (OSP) was created. It was OSP that originated much of the fraudulen t intelligence that Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld have used to justify the attack on Iraq. A key member of OSP was David Wurmser who, as indicated above, is a pr otégé of Richard Perle. 223 Retired army officer Karen Kwiatkowski de scribes Feith as knowing little about the Pentagon and paying little attenti on to any issues except those relating to Israel and Iraq. 224 Feith is deferential to the Israeli m ilitary. As Kwiatkowski escorted a gr oup of Israeli gene rals into the Pentagon: The leader of the pack surged ah ead, his colleagues in close forma tion, leaving us to double-time behind the group as they sped to Undersecretary Feit h’s office on the fourth floor.... Once in Feith’s waiting room, the leader continued at speed to Feith’s closed door. An alert secretary saw this coming and had leapt from her desk to block the door. “Mr. Feith has a visitor. It will only be a few more minutes.” The leader craned his neck to look around the secretary’s head as he demanded, “Who is in there with him?” Unlike the usual practice, the Israeli generals di d not have to sign in, so there are no official records of their visits. 225 Kwiatkowski describes the anti-Arab, pro-Israel sentiment that pervaded the neocon network at the Department of Defens e. Career military officers who failed to go along with these attitudes were simply replaced. Feith has a strong Jewish identity and is an ac tivist on behalf of Israel. While in law school he collaborated with Joseph Churba, an associ ate and friend of Meir Kahane, founder of the racialist and anti-Western Jewish Defense League . During the late 1980s to early 1990s he wrote"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 pro-Likud op-ed pieces in Israeli newspapers, arguing that the West Bank is part of Israel, that the Palestinians belong in Jordan, and that there should be regime change in Iraq. He also headed the CSP and was a founding member of One Jerusa lem, an Israeli organi zation “determined to prevent any compromise with the Palestinians over the fate of any part of Jerusalem. 226 He is an officer of the Foundation for Jewish Studies, which is “dedicated to fostering Jewish learning and building communities of edu cated and committed Jews who are conscious of and faithful to the high ideals of Judaism.” 227 In 1997 Feith and his father (a member of Betar, the Zionist youth movement founded by Vladimir Ja botinsky) were given awards from the ZOA because of their work as pro-Israel activists. Th e ZOA is a staunch supporter of the most extreme elements within Israel. Feith’s law partner, L. Marc Zell of the firm’s Tel Aviv office, is a spokesman for the settler movement in Israel, a nd the firm itself is deeply involved in legal issues related to the reconstructi on of Iraq, a situation that has ra ised eyebrows because Feith is head of recons truction in Iraq. 228 Zell was one of many neocons close to Ahme d Chalabi but abandoned his support because Chalabi had not come through on his prewar ple dges regarding Israel—further evidence that aiding Israel was an important motive for the neocons. According to Ze ll, Chalabi “said he would end Iraq’s boycott of trade with Israel, an d would allow Israeli co mpanies to do business there. He said [the new Iraqi government] would agree to rebuild the pipeline from Mosul [in the northern Iraqi oil fields] to Haifa [the Israeli port, and the location of a major refinery].” 229 Another partner in the law firm of Feith and Zell is Salem Chalabi, Ahmed Chalabi’s nephew. Salem Chalabi is in charge of the trial of Saddam Hussein. 230 Abraham Shulsky Abram Shulsky is a student of Leo Strauss, a close friend of Paul Wolfowitz both at Cornell and the University of Chicago, 231 and yet another protégé of Richard Perle. He was an aide to neocon Senators Henry Jackson (along with Pe rle and Elliot Abrams) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and worked in the Department of De fense in the Reagan administration. During the George W. Bush administration, he was appointed head of the Office of Special Plans under Feith and Wolfowitz. The OSP became more infl uential on Iraq policy than the CIA or the Defense Intelligence Agency, 232 but is widely viewed by reti red intelligence operatives as manipulating intelligence data on Ir aq in order to influence policy. 233 Reports suggest that the OSP worked closely with Israeli intelligence to paint an exaggera ted picture of Iraqi capabilities in unconventional weapons. 234 It is tempting to link the acti ons of the OSP under Shulsky with Strauss’s idea of a “noble lie” carried out by th e elite to manipulate the masses, but I suppose that one doesn’t really need Strauss to understand the importance of lying in order to manipulate public opinion on behalf of Israel. The OSP included other neocons with no profe ssional qualifications in intelligence but long records of service in neoconservative thi nk tanks and pro-Israel activist organizations, especially the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Examples in clude Michael Rubin, who is affiliated with AEI and is an adjunct schol ar at WINEP, David Schenker, who has written books and articles on Middle East issues published by WINEP and the Middle East Quarterly (published by Daniel Pipes’ MEF, another pro-Israel activist organization), Elliott Abrams, David Wurmser, and Michael Ledeen. The OSP reli ed heavily on Iraqi defectors associated with Ahmed Chalabi, who, as indica ted above, had a close personal relationship with Wolfowitz, Perle, and other neocons. 235 Michael Ledeen"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 Michael Ledeen’s career illustrates the inte rconnectedness of the neoconservative network. Ledeen was the first executive director of JINSA (1977–1979) and remains on its board of advisors. He was hired by Richard Perle in the De fense Department during the Reagan years, and during the same period he was hired as special a dvisor by Wolfowitz in his role as head of the State Department Policy Planni ng Staff. Along with Stephen Br yen, Ledeen became a member of the China Commission during the George W. Bush administration. He was also a consultant to Abraham Shulsky’s OSP, the Defense Department organization most closely linked with the manufacture of fraudulent intell igence leading up to the Iraq War. The OSP was created by Douglas Feith, who in turn reports to Paul Wolfow itz. As noted above, he is resident scholar in the Freedom Chair at AEI. Ledeen has been suspecte d of spying for Israel. 236 During the Reagan years, he was regarded by the CIA as “an agent of influence of a fore ign government: Israel,” and was suspected of spying for Israel by his immediate superior at the Department of Defense, Noel Koch. 237 While working for the White House in 1984, Ledeen wa s also accused by Nati onal Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane of participating in an unauthorized meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres that led to the proposal to funnel arms throug h Israel to Iran in order to free U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon—the origins of the Irangate scandal. 238 Ledeen has been a major propagandist for forcing change on the entire Arab world. Ledeen’s revolutionary ideology stems not from Tr otsky or Marx, but from his favorable view of Italian fascism as a universalist (n onracial) revolutionary movement. 239 His book, War on the Terror Masters , is a program for complete restructuring of the Middle East by the U. S. couched in the rhetoric of universalism and moral concer n, not for Israel, but for the Arab peoples who would benefit from regime change. Ledeen is a revolutionary of the right, committed to “creative destruction” of the old social order: Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literatu re, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law. Our enemies have always hated this whirlwind of energy and creativity, which menaces their traditions (whatever they may be) and shames them for their inability to keep pace. Seeing America undo traditional societies, they fear us, for they do not wish to be undone. They cannot feel secure so long as we are there, for our very ex istence—our existence, not our politics—threatens their legitimacy. They must attack us in order to survive, just as we must destroy them to advance our historic mission.... Behind all the anti-American venom from the secular radicals in Baghdad, the religious fanatics in Tehran, the minority regime in Damascus, and th e multicultural kleptomaniacs in the Palestinian Authority is the knowledge that they are hated by their own people. Their power rests on terror, recently directed against us, but always, first a nd foremost, against their own citizens. Given the chance to express themselves freely, the Iraqi, Ira nian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian people would oust their current oppressors. Properly wage d, our revolutionary war will give them a chance. 240 Bernard Lewis The main intellectual source for imposing demo cracy on the Arab world is Bernard Lewis, the Princeton historian who argue s that Muslim cultures have an inferiority complex stemming from their relative decline compared to the West over the last three hundred years. (Such arguments minimize the role of Israel and U.S. support for Israel as a sourse of Arab malaise. However, there is good evidence that the motives of Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 conspirators derive much more from U.S. support for Israel than a general anti-Western animus. 241 ) He contends that Arab societies with their antiqua ted, kinship-based structure can only be changed by forcing democracy on them. 242 Wolfowitz has used Lewis as the intellectual underpinning of the invasion of Iraq: “Bernard has taught how to understand the complex and important history"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 of the Middle East, and use it to guide us wher e we will go next to build a better world for generations to come.” 243 During the 1970s Lewis was invited by Richard Perle to give a talk to Henry Jackson’s group, and, as Perl e notes, “Lewis became Jackson’ s guru, more or less.” Lewis also established ties with Daniel Patrick Moyni han and with Jackson’s other aides, including Wolfowitz, Abrams, and Gaffney. On e of Lewis’s main arguments is that the Palestinians have no historical claim to a state because they were not a state before the British Mandate in 1918. Lewis also argues that Arabs have a long history of consensus government, if not democracy, and that a modicum of outside force should be sufficient to democratize the area—a view that runs counter to th e huge cultural differences between the Middle East and the West that stem ultimately from very different evolutionary pressures. 244 Lewis, as a cultural historian, is in a poor position to understand the deep stru cture of the cultural differences between Europe and the Middle East. He seems completely unawar e of the differences in family and kinship structure between Europe and the Middle East, and he regards the difference in attitudes toward women as a mere cultural difference rather than as a marker for an entirely different social structure. 245 Lewis’s flawed beliefs about the Middle East have neverthe less been quite useful to Israel—reflecting the theme that Jewish inte llectual movements have often used available intellectual resources to advance a political cause. Not only did he provide an important intellectual rationale for the wa r against Iraq, he is very cl ose to governmental and academic circles in Israel—the confidant of successive Israeli Prime Mini sters from Golda Meir to Ariel Sharon. 246 Dick Cheney By several accounts, Vice President Cheney ha d a “fever” to invade Iraq and transform the politics of the Middle East and was the lead ing force within the ad ministration convincing President Bush of the need to do so. 247 As with the other Jewish intellectual and political movements I have reviewed, non-Jews have been welcomed into the movement and often given highly visible roles as the movement’s public f ace. Among the current cr op in this intellectual lineage, the most important non-Je ws are Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom have close professional and personal relationships with neoconservatives that long pre-date their present power and visibility. Both Cheney and Rums feld have been associated with Bill Kristol’s PNAC (which advocated a unilateral war for regi me change in Iraq at least as early as 1998) 248 and the CSP, two neocon think tanks; Cheney was presented with the ADL’s Distinguished Statesman Award in 1993 and was described by Abraham Foxman as “sensitive to Jewish concerns.” 249 When Cheney was a Congressman during the early 1980s, he attended lunches hosted for Republican Jewish l eaders by the House leadership. Cheney was described by Marshall Breger, a senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administration as “very interested in outreach and engaging the Jewish community.” 250 He was also a member of JINSA, a major pro-Israel activist organization, until assuming his office as vice president. Cheney has also had a close involvement with leading Israeli politicians, especially Natan Sharansky, Secretary of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs in the Likud government and the prime architect of the ideology that the key to peace between Israel and the Arab world, including the Palestinians, is Arab acceptance of democracy. Wh en President Bush articulated the importance of Palestinian democracy for the Middle East peace “roadmap” in his June 2002 policy speech, Sharansky could have written the speech himself, and, for that matter, may have had a direct hand in its drafting. The weekend prior to the speech, he spent long hours at a c onference [organized by Richard Perle and] sponsored by the AEI in Aspe n secluded together with Vice President Cheney and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. The Bush speech clearly represented a triumph"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 for the Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz axis in the administration over the State Department, which was eager to offer the Palestinians a provisional state immediately.” 251 Both Cheney and Rumsfeld have close pers onal relationships with Kenneth Adelman, a former Ford and Reagan administration official. 252 Adelman wrote op-ed pieces in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal in the period leading up to the war, and he, along with Wolfowitz and Irving Lewis “Scoot er” Libby (Cheney’s chief of st aff), were guests of Cheney for a victory celebration in the immediat e aftermath of the war (April 13, 2003). 253 Adelman has excellent neocon credentials. He was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger in the 1970s and UN Ambassador during the Reagan Administration, and worked under Donald Rumsfeld on three different occasions. He was a signatory to the April 3, 2002, letter of the Project for a New American Century to Presiden t Bush calling for Saddam Hussein’s ouster and increased support for Israel. The letter stated, “Israel is targeted in part because it is our friend, and in part because it is an island of liberal, democratic principles—A merican principles—in a sea of tyranny, intolerance, and hatred.” The advocacy of war with Iraq was linked to advancing Israeli interests: “If we do not move against Saddam Hussein an d his regime, the damage our Israeli friends and we have suffered until now may someday appear but a prelude to much greater horrors.... Israel’s fight against terrorism is our fight. Is rael’s victory is an important part of our victory. For reasons both mo ral and strategic, we need to stand with Israel in its fight against terrorism.” 254 Adelman’s wife, Carol, is affilia ted with the Hudson Institute, a neoconservative think tank. Cheney’s role in the ascendancy of the neocon s in the Bush administration is particularly important: As head of the transi tion team, he and Libby were able to staff the subcabinet levels of the State Department (John Bolton) and the De fense Department (Wolfowitz, Feith) with key supporters of the neocon agenda. Libby is a cl ose personal friend of Cheney whose views “echo many of Wolfowitz’s policies” ; he “is considered a hawk among hawks and was an early supporter of military action against terro rism and particularly against Iraq.” 255 He is Jewish and has a long history of involvement in Zionist cause s and as the attorney for the notorious Marc Rich. Libby and Cheney were involved in pressuring the CIA to color intelligence reports to fit with their desire for a war with Iraq. 256 Libby entered the neocon orbit when he was “captivated” while taking a political science course from Wolfowitz at Yale , and he worked under Wolfowitz in the Reagan and the Bush I administrations. 257 He was the coauthor (w ith Wolfowitz) of the ill- fated draft of the Defense Planning Guidan ce document of 1992, which advocated U.S. dominance over all of Eurasia and urged preven ting any other country from even contemplating challenging U.S. hegemony. 258 (Cheney was Secretary of Defense at that time.) After an uproar, the document was radically altered, but this bl ueprint for U.S. hegemony remains central to neocon attitudes since the coll apse of the Soviet Union. Donald Rumsfeld As noted above, Rumsfeld has deep links wi th neoconservative think tanks and individual Jews such as Ken Adelman, who began his career working for Rumsfeld when he headed the Office of Economic Opportunity in the Nixon admini stration. Another close associate is Robert A. Goldwin, a student of Leo Strauss and Rumsfe ld’s deputy both at NATO and at the Gerald Ford White House; Goldwin is now resident scholar at the AEI. Rumsfeld also has a long history of appealin g to Jewish and Israel i causes. In his 1964 campaign for reelection to Congre ss as representative from a district on the North Shore of Chicago with an important Jewish constituency, he emphasized Soviet persecution of Jews and introduced a bill on this topic in the House. After the 1967 war, he urged the U.S. not to demand that Israel withdraw to its previous borders a nd he criticized delays in sending U.S. military"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 hardware to Israel. 259 More recently, as Secretary of Defe nse in the Bush II administration, Rumsfeld was praised by the ZOA for distancing himself from the phrase “occupied territories,” referring to them as the “so-called occupied territories.” 260 Despite these links with neoconservatives and Jewish causes, Rumsfeld emerges as less an ideologue and less a passionate advocate for wa r with Iraq than Cheney. Robert Woodward describes him as lacking the feverish intens ity of Cheney, as a dispassionate “defense technocrat” who, unlike Cheney, Wo lfowitz, and Feith, would have b een content if the U.S. had not gone to war with Iraq. 261 Daniel Pipes Many neoconservatives work mainly as lobbyists and propagandists. Rather than attempt to describe this massive infrastructure in its en tirety, I profile Daniel Pipes as a prototypical example of the highly competent Jewish lobbyist. Pipes is the son of Richard Pipes, the Harvard professor who, as noted above, was an early neocon and an expert on the Soviet Union. He is the director of the MEF and a columnist at the New York Post and the Jerusalem Post, and appears on the Fox News Channel. Pipes is described as “An authorita tive commentator on the Middle East” by the Wall Street Journal , according to the mast head of his website. 262 A former official in the Departments of State and Defense, he has taught at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and the U.S. Naval War College. He is the author of twel ve books on the Middle East, Islam, and other political topics; his most recent book is Militant Islam Reaches America (published by W.W. Norton, 2002), a polemic against political Islam which argues that militant Islam is the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War. He serves on the “Special Task Force on Terrorism and Technology” at the Department of Defense, has testified before many congressional committees, and served on four presidential campaigns. Martin Kramer is the editor of the Forum’s jour nal. Kramer is also affiliated with Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center for Mi ddle Eastern and African Studies. His book, Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Midd le Eastern Studies in America , has been a major impetus behind the recent effort to prevent criticism of Israel on college campuses. The book was warmly reviewed in the Weekly Standard , whose editor, Bill Kristol, is a member of the MEF along with Kramer. Kristol wrote that “Kramer has performe d a crucial service by exposing intellectual rot in a scholarly field of capital importance to national wellbeing.” The MEF issues two regular qua si-academic publications, the Middle East Quarterly and the Middle East Intelligence Bulletin , the latter publishe d jointly with the United States Committee for a Free Lebanon. The Middle East Quarterly describes itself as “a bold, insightful, and controversial publication.” A r ecent article on weapons of mass destruction claims that Syria “has more destruct ive capabilities” than Iraq or Iran. The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin “specializes in covering the seamy si de of Lebanese and Syrian politics,” 263 an effort aimed at depicting these regimes as wo rthy of forcible change by the U.S. or Israeli military. The MEF also targets universities th rough its campus speakers bureau, seeking to correct “inaccurate Middle Easter n curricula in American educati on,” by addressing “biases” and “basic errors” and providing “better inform ation” than students can get from the many “irresponsible” professors that it be lieves lurk in U.S. universities. The MEF is behind Campus Watch, an organi zation responsible for repressing academic discussion of Middle East issues at U.S. universities. Campus Watch compiles profiles on professors who criticize Israel: A major purpose is to “identify key faculty who teach and write about contemporary affairs at unive rsity Middle East Studies departments in order to analyze and critique the work of these special ists for errors or biases.” The MEF also develops “a network of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 concerned students and faculty members intere sted in promoting Am erican interests on campus.” 264 Again we see the rhetoric of universalism and a concern with “American interests” produced by people who are ethnically Jewish and vitally concerned with the welfare of Israel. Recently Campus Watch has decided to disc ontinue its dossiers because over one hundred professors asked to be included in their directory of suspicious people. Nevertheless, Campus Watch continues to print names of people whose views on the Middle East differ from theirs. The MEF, along with major Jewish activist organi zations (the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the Anti-Defamati on League), has succeeded in getting the U.S. House of Representatives to overwhelmingly approve a bill that would authorize federal monitoring of government-funded Mi ddle East studies programs throughout U.S. universities. The bill would establish a federa l tribunal to investigate and monitor criticism of Israel on American college campuses. Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) Rather than profile all of the many neoconser vative think tanks and lobbying groups, I will describe JINSA as a prototypical example. JINSA attempts to “educate the American public about the importance of an eff ective U.S. defense capability so that our vital interests as Americans can be safeguarded [and to] inform the American defense and foreign affairs community about the important role Israel can and does play in bol stering democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.” 265 Typical of Jewish intellectual movements is that Jewish interests are submerged in a rhetoric of American interests and ethical universalism—in this case, the idea that Israel is a beacon of democracy. In addition to a core of prominent neoconser vative Jews (Stephen D. Bryen, Douglas Feith, Max Kampelman, Michael Ledeen, Joshua Muravchi k, Richard Perle, Stephen Solarz), JINSA’s advisory board includes a bevy of non-Jewish retir ed U.S. military officers and a variety of non- Jewish political figures (e.g., Dick Cheney) and fore ign policy analysts with access to the media (e.g., Jeane Kirkpatrick) who are st aunch supporters of Israel. As is typical of Jewish intellectual movements, JINSA is well funded and has succeeded in bringing in high-profile non-Jews who often act as spokesmen for its policies. For ex ample, the former head of the Iraq occupation government, General Jay Garner, signed a JINSA lett er stating that “the Israel Defense Forces have exercised remarkable restraint in the face of lethal violence orchestrated by the leadership of [the] Palestinian Authority.” JINSA reflects the recent trend of American Jewish activist groups not simply to support Israeli policies but to support th e Israeli right wing. For JINSA, “‘regime change’ by any means necessary in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority is an urgent imperative. Anyone who dissents—be it Colin Powell’s St ate Department, the CIA or career military officers—is committing heresy against articles of faith that effectively hold there is no difference between US and Israeli national security interest s, and that the only way to assure continued safety and prosperity for both countries is th rough hegemony in the Middle East—a hegemony achieved with the traditional Cold War recipe of feints, force, clientism and covert action.” 266 Note the exclusionary, us versus them attitude t ypical of the Jewish intellectual and political movements covered in The Culture of Critique. Part of JINSA’s effectiveness comes from recruiting non-Jews who gain by increased defense spending or are willing to be spokesmen in return for fees and travel to Israel. The bulk of JINSA’s budget is spent on taking a host of retire d U.S. generals and admirals to Israel, where JINSA facilitates meetings betwee n Israeli officials and retired but still-influential U.S. flag"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 officers. These officers then write op-ed pieces a nd sign letters and advertisements championing the Likudnik line. In one such statement, issued soon after the outbreak of the latest intifada, twenty-six JINSAns of retired flag rank, including many from the advisory board, struck a moralizing tone, characterizing Palestinian viol ence as a “perversion of military ethics” and holding that “America’s role as facilitator in this process s hould never yield to America’s responsibility as a friend to Israel,” because “friends don’t leave friends on the battlefield.” 267 Sowing seeds for the future, JINSA also takes U.S. service academy cadets to Israel each summer and sponsors a lecture series at th e Army, Navy, and Air Force academies. JINSA also patronizes companies in the defens e industry that stand to gain by the drive for total war. “Almost every retired officer who sits on JINSA’s board of advise rs or has participated in its Israel trips or signed a JINSA letter works or has worked with military contractors who do business with the Pentagon and Israel.” 268 For example, JINSA advisory board members Adm. Leon Edney, Adm. David Jeremiah, and Lieut. Gen. Charles May, all re tired, have served Northrop Grumman or its subsidiaries as eith er consultants or board members. Northrop Grumman has built ships for the Israeli Navy and sold F-16 avi onics and E-2C Hawkeye planes to the Israeli Air Force, as well as the Longbow ra dar system to the Israeli Army for use in its attack helicopters. It also works with Tamam, a subsidiary of Israeli Aircraft Industries, to produce an unmanned aerial vehicle. JINSA is supported not only by defense contra ctor money but also by deeply committed Zionists, notably Irving Moscowitz, the Califor nia bingo magnate who also provides financial support to the AEI. Moscowitz not only sends millions of dollars a year to far-right Israeli West Bank settler groups like Ateret Cohanim, he has also funded land purchases in key Arab areas around Jerusalem. Moscowitz provided the money that enabled the 1996 reopening of a tunnel under the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, which resu lted in seventy deaths due to rioting. Also involved in funding JINSA is New York inve stment banker Lawrence Kadish, who also contributes to Republican causes. Again, we see the effects of the most committed Jews. People like Moscowitz have an enormous effect be cause they use their wealth to advance their people’s interests, a very comm on pattern among wealthy Jews. 269 The integration of JINSA with the U.S. defense establishment can be seen in the program for its 2001 Jackson Award Dinner, an annual event named after Senator Henry Jackson that draws an “A-list” group of politicians and defense celebrities. At the dinner were representatives of U.S. defense industries (the dinner was sponsored by Boeing), as well as the following Defense Department personnel: Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ; Under Secretary of Defense Dov Zakheim (an ordained rabbi); Assist ant Secretary of the Navy John Young; Dr. Bill Synder, the Chairman of the Defense Science Board; the Honorable Ma rk Rosenker, Senior Military Advisor to the President; Admiral William Fallon, Vice Chief of Naval Operations; General John Keane, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; General Michael Williams, Vice Commandant of the Marines; Lieutenant General Lance Lord, Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Also present were a large number of U.S. flag and general officers who were alumni of JINSA trips to Israel, as well as asso rted Congressmen, a U.S. Senator, and a variety of Israeli military and political figures. The 2002 Jackson Award Dinner, sponsored by Northrup Grumman, honored Paul Wolfowitz. Dick Cheney was a previous recipient of the award. JINSA is a good illustration of the point that whatever the deeply held beliefs of the non- Jews who are involved in the neoconservative movement, financial motives and military careerism are also of considerable impor tance—a testimony to the extent to which neoconservatism has permeated the political and military establishments of the United States. A similar statement could be made about the deep influence of neoconservatism among intellectuals generally."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 C ONCLUSION The current situation in the United States is r eally an awesome display of Jewish power and influence. People who are very strongly identified as Jews main tain close ties to Israeli politicians and military figures and to Jewish activist organizations and pro-Israeli lobbying groups while occupying influential policy-maki ng positions in the defense and foreign policy establishment. These same people, as well as a chorus of other prominent Jews, have routine access to the most prestigious media outlets in the United States. People who criticize Israel are routinely vilified and subj ected to professional abuse. 270 Perhaps the most telling feature of this entire st ate of affairs is the surreal fact that in this entire discourse Jewish identity is not men tioned. When Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, Michael Rubin, William Safire, Robert Satloff, or the legions of other prominent media figures write their reflexively pro-Israel pieces in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, or the Los Angeles Times , or opine on the Fox News Network, ther e is never any mention that they are Jewish Americans who have an intense ethnic inte rest in Israel. When Richard Perle authors a report for an Israeli think tank; is on the board of directors of an Israeli newspaper; maintains close personal ties with prominent Israelis, especi ally those associated w ith the Likud Party; has worked for an Israeli defense company; and, acc ording to credible reports, was discovered by the FBI passing classified information to Israel—when, despite all of this, he is a central figure in the network of those pushing for wars to rearra nge the entire politics of the Middle East in Israel’s favor, and with nary a soul having th e courage to mention the obvious overriding Jewish loyalty apparent in Perle’s actions, that is indeed a br eathtaking display of power. One must contemplate the fact that American Jews have managed to maintain unquestioned support for Israel over the last thirty-seven years, despite Israel’s seizi ng land and engaging in a brutal suppression of the Palestin ians in the occupied territorie s—an occupation that will most likely end with expulsion or complete subjuga tion, degradation, and apartheid. During the same period Jewish organizations in America have b een a principal force—in my view the main force—for transforming America into a state dedicated to suppressing ethnic identification among Europeans, for encouraging massive multiethnic immigration into the U.S., and for erecting a legal system and cultura l ideology that is obsessively se nsitive to the complaints and interests of non-European ethnic minor ities—the culture of the Holocaust. 271 All this is done without a whisper of double sta ndards in the aboveground media. I have also provided a small glimpse of the in credible array of Jewish pro-Israel activist organizations, their funding, their access to the media, and their pow er over the political process. Taken as a whole, neoconservatism is an excellent illustration of th e key traits behind the success of Jewish activism: ethnocentrism, intelligence and wealth, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness. 272 Now imagine a similar level of organization, commitment, and funding directed toward changing the U.S. immigra tion system put into law in 1924 and 1952, or inaugurating the revolution in ci vil rights, or the pos t-1965 countercultural revolution: In the case of the immigration laws we see the same use of prominent non-Jews to attain Jewish goals, the same access to the major media, and the sa me ability to have a decisive influence on the political process by establishi ng lobbying organizations, recr uiting non-Jews as important players, funneling financial and media support to political candidates who agree with their point of view, and providing effectiv e leadership in government. 273 Given this state of affairs, one can easily see how Jews, despite being a tiny minority of the U.S. population, have been able to transform the country to serve their interests. It’s a story that has been played out many times in Western history, but the possibl e effects now seem enormous , not only for Europeans but literally for everyone on the planet , as Israel and its hegemonic ally restructure the politics of the world."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 History also suggests that anti -Jewish reactions deve lop as Jews increase their control over other peoples. 274 As always, it will be fascinat ing to observe the dénouement.

Buchanan 2004. 11 . B. Wattenberg interview with Rich ard Perle, PBS, November 14, 2002 ( www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1017.html ). The entire relevant passag e from the interview follows. Note Perle’s odd argument that it was not in Israel’s interest that the U.S. invade Iraq because Saddam Hussein posed a much greater threat to Israel than the U.S. Ben Wattenberg : As this argument has gotten rancorous, there is also an undertone that says that these neoconservative hawks, that so many of them are Jewish. Is that valid and how do you handle that? Richard Perle : Well, a number are. I see Trent Lott there and maybe that’s Newt Gingrich, I’m not sure, but by no means uniformly. Ben Wattenberg : Well, and of course the people who are executing policy, President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, C onnie Rice, they are not Jewish at last report. Richard Perle : No, they’re not. Well, you’re going to find a di sproportionate number of Jews in any sort of intellectual undertaking. Ben Wattenberg : On both sides. Richard Perle : On both sides. Jews gravitate toward that a nd I’ll tell you if you balance out the hawkish Jews against the dovish ones, then we are badly outnumbered, badly outnumbered. But look, there’s clearly an undertone of anti-Semitism about it. There’s no doubt. Ben Wattenberg : Well, and the linkage is that this war on Iraq if it comes about would help Israel and that that’s the hidden agenda, and th at’s sort of the way that works. Richard Perle : Well, sometimes there’s an out and out accusation that if you take the view that I take and some others take towards Saddam Hussein, we are so mehow motivated not by the best interest of the United States but by Israel’s best interest. There’s not a logical argument underpinning that. In fact, Israel is probably more exposed and vulnerable in the c ontext of a war with Saddam than we are because they’re right next door. Weapons that Saddam cannot today deliver against us could potentially be delivered against Israel. And for a long time the Is raelis themselves were very reluctant to take on Saddam Hussein. I’ve argued this issue with Israelis . But it’s a nasty line of argument to suggest that somehow we’re confused about where our loyalties are. Ben Wattenberg : It’s the old dual loyalty argument. 12 . Chalabi’s status with the neocons is in flux b ecause of doubts about his true allegiances. See Dizard 2004. 13 .

Wisse singles out Arthur Hertzberg as an example of an American Jew critical of Begin’s government. Hertzberg continues to be a critic of Isr aeli policies, especially of the settlement movement. In a New York Times op-ed piece “The price of not keeping peace” of August, 27, 2003, Hertzberg urges the United States to cease funding the expansion of Jewish settlements while also preventing the Palestinians' access to foreign funds used for violence against Israel: The United States must act now to disarm each side of the nasty things that they can do to each other. We must end the threat of the settlements to a Palestinian state of the future. The Palestinian militants must be forced to stop threatenin g the lives of Israelis, wherever they ma y be. A grand settlement is not in sight, but the United States can lead both parties to a more livable, untidy accommodation. 91 . Reviewed in MacDonald 2003. 92 . See Friedman 1995, 257ff. 93 .

They saw the invasion of Iraq as the precondition for a reorganization of the Middle East that would solve Is rael’s strategic problems, without the need for an accommodation with either the Palestinians or the ex isting Arab states. Chalabi assured them that the Iraqi democracy he would build would develop diplom atic and trade ties with Israel, and eschew Arab nationalism. Now some influential allies believe those assurances were part of an elaborate con, and that Chalabi has betrayed his promises on Israel while cozying up to Iranian Shia leaders. 230 .

In a later column, Rosenblum (2003) noted, Now [Sharansky] delivered the sa me message to Cheney: No matter how many conditions Bush placed on the creation of a Palestinian state under Arafat, an y such announcement would constitute a reward for two years of non-stop terror against Israeli civilians. The normally laconic Cheney shot to attention when he heard these words. ‘But your own government has already signed off on this ,’ he told Sharansky, confirming the latter’s worst suspicions. Sharansky neve rtheless repeated, as Cheney scribbled notes, that without the removal of Arafat and the entire junta fro m Tunis, the creation of an atmosphere in which Palestinians could express themselves without fear of reprisal, and the cessation of incitement against Israel in the Palestinian schools and media peace is impossible.

ZOA National Pr esident Morton A. Klein said: “Israel has the greater historical, legal, and moral right to Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. At the very least, those areas should be called disputed territories, not occupied te rritories, since the term ‘occupied’ clearly suggests that the ‘occupier’ has no right to be there. We strongly applaud Secretary Rumsfeld's courageous and principled stance in distancing himsel f from the ‘occupied territory’ fallacy.” www.zoa.org/pressrel2002/20020807a.htm . 261 .
