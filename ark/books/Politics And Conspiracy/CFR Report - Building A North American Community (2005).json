The Council does this by convening meetings; conducting a wide-ranging Studies program; publishing Foreign Affairs , the preeminent journal covering international affairs and U.S. foreign policy; maintaining a diverse membership; sponsoring Independent Task Forces; and providing up-to-date information about the world and U.S. foreign policy on the Council’s website, www.cfr.org. THE COUNCIL TAKES NO INSTITUTIONAL POSITION ON POLICY ISSUES AND HAS NO AFFILIATION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. ALL STATEMENTS OF FACT AND EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION CONTAINED IN ITS PUBLICATIONS ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS. The Council will sponsor an Independent Task Force when (1) an issue of current and critical importance to U.S. foreign policy arises, and (2) it seems that a group divers e in backgrounds and perspectives may, nonetheless, be able to reach a meaningful consensus on a policy through private and nonpartisan deliberations. Typically, a Task Force meets between two and five times over a brief period to ensure the relevance of its work. Upon reaching a conclusion, a Task Force issues a report, and the Council publishes its text and posts it on the Council website. Task Force reports reflect a strong and meaningful policy consensus, with Task Force members endorsing the general policy thrust and judgments reached by the group, though not necessarily every finding and recommendation. Task Force members who join the consen sus may submit additional or dissenting views, which are included in the final report. Upon reaching a conclusion, a Task Force may also ask individuals who were not members of the Task Force to associate themselves with the Task Force report to enhance its impact. All Task Force reports “benchmark” their findings against current administration policy in order to make explicit areas of agreement and disagreement. The Task Force is solely responsible for its report. The Council takes no institutional position on the findings or recommendations in the report. The Task Force on the Future of North America is sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in association with the Canadian Council of Chief Executives and the Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internacionales.

Visit our website at www.cfr.org . Founded in 1976, the Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE) is Canada’s premier business association, with an outstanding record of achievement in matching entrepreneurial initiative with sound public policy choices. Composed of the chief executives of 150 leading Canadian enterprises, the CCCE was the Canadian private sector leader in the development and promotion of the Canadian-U.S. Free Trade Agreement during the 1980s and of the subsequent trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement. The Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internacionales (COMEXI) is the only multidisciplinary organization committed to fostering sophisticated, broadly inclusive politic al discourse and analysis on the nature of Mexico’s participation in the international arena and the relative influence of Mexico’s increasingly global orientation on domestic priorities. The Council is an independent, nonprofit, pluralistic forum, with no government or institutional ties, that is financed exclusively by membership dues and corporate support. The main objectives of COMEXI are to provide information and analysis of interest to our associates, as well as to create a solid institutional framework for the exchange of ideas concerning pressing world issues that affect our country.

T his report of a Council-sponsored Independent Task Force on the Future of North Am erica is inten ded to help address this policy gap. In the more than a decad e since the N orth Am erican Free T rade Agr eem ent (NAFTA) took effect, ties am ong Canada, Mexico, and the United States have deepened dram atically. T he value of trade within North Am erica has m ore than doubled. Canada and Mexico are now the two largest exporters of o il, natural gas, and el ectricity to the United States. Since 9/11, we are not only one another’s m ajor commercial partne rs, we ar e joined in a n ef fort to m ake North Am erica less vulnerable to terrorist attack. This report exam ines these and other chang es that hav e taken place since NAFTA’s inception and m akes recomm endat ions to address the range of issues confronting North American policym akers to day: greater econom ic com petition from outside North Am erica, uneven developm ent within North Am erica, the growing dem and for energy, and threats to our borders.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the futures of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are sh ared as ne ver before. As a result, all three coun tries face a historic challenge: Do they co ntinue on th e path of co operation in prom oting more secure and more prosperous North Am erican societies or do they pursue divergent and ultim ately less secu re a nd less pros perous cou rses ? To a sk the que stio n is to answ er it; and yet, if important decisions are not pursu ed and im ple mented, th e three coun tries m ay well f ind th em selves on divergen t p aths. Such a developm ent would be a tragic m istake, one that can be readily avoide d if they stay th e cours e an d pursue a series of deliberate and cooperative steps that will enhance both the security and pr osperity of their citizens. At their m eeting in Waco, Texas, at the end of March 2005, U.S. President George W .

We welcom e this im portant developm ent and offe r this report to add urgency and specif ic recomm endations to strengthen their efforts. The three countries of No rth Am erica are each other’s largest trad ing partners. More than 80 percent of Cana dian and Mexican trad e is with its North Am erican Free Trade Agreem ent (NAFTA) partners. Alm ost one-t hird of U.S. trade is with Canad a and Mexico. Trade am ong these three co untries has tripled in value over the past decade. In addition, cross-border direct investm ent has increased sh arply, contributing to the integration of the three econom ies. North Am erica is also energy interdep endent, though not ener gy independent. In 2004, Canada and Mexico were the two largest exporters of oil to the United S tates. Canada supplies the United S tates with roughly 90 percent of its im ported natural gas and all of its im ported e lectricity. In addition, all three co unt ries face common security da ngers, from terrorism to drug trafficking to internati onal organized crim e.

As liberal de mocracies, the governm ents also share co mm on principles : protecting individual rights, upholding the ru le of law, and ensuring equality of opportunity for their citizens. North Am erica, in short, is more than an expression of geography. It is a partnership of sovereign st ates with overlapping econom ic and sec urity interests, where m ajor developm ents in one country can and do have a powerful impact on the other two. More than a decade ago, NAFTA took effect, liberalizing trade and investm ent, providing crucial protection for intellect ual property, creating pioneering dispute- resolution mechanism s, and establishing the fi rst regional devices to safeguard labor and environm ental standards. NAFTA helped unlock the region’s economic potential and dem onstrated that nations at different le vels of developm ent can prosper from the opportunities created by reciprocal free trade arrangem ents. Since then, however, global comm ercia l com petition h as gro wn m ore intense and international terrorism has em erged as a se rious regional and global danger. Deepening ties am ong the three countries of North Am eric a prom ise continued benefits for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. That said, th e trajecto ry to ward a m ore integ rated and prosperous North Am erica is neit her inevitable n or ir reve rsib le. In March 2005, the leaders of Canada, Mexico, and the U nited States adopted a Security and Prosperity Partnership of No rth Am erica (SPP), establishing m inisterial- level working groups to address key security and econom ic i ssues facing North Am erica and setting a short deadline for reporting pr ogress back to their governm ents. President Bush described the significan ce of the SPP as putting forw ard a comm on comm itment “to markets and dem ocracy, freedom and trade, an d m utual pro sperity and security.” The policy f ramework artic ulated by th e three lead ers is a sign ificant com mitm ent that will benefit from broad discussion a nd ad vice. The T ask Force is pleased to provide sp ecific advice on how the partnership can be pursued and realized. To that end, the Task Force proposes the creation by 2010 of a North Am erican community to enhance security, prosperi ty, and opportunity.

Its goa l will be to g uarantee a f ree, s ecu re, just, and pros perous North Am erica. W HAT W E F ACE Our countries face three common challeng es: Shared security threa ts. Over th e last decade, terro rist and crim inal activity has underscored North America’s vuln erability. All of the 9/11 terro rists succeeded in entering the United States directly from outsi de North Am erica, but the 1999 arrest of a person trying to cross the Canadian-U.S. border as part of a plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport sho ws that terrorists may also try to gain access to the United States th rough Canada and Mexico. This person was found to have cased C anadian targets as well, and al-Qaeda has publicly listed Canada as one of i ts prim e targets along with the United States. Failure to secure the ex ternal borders of North Am erica will inh ibit th e legitim ate move ment of people and goods within the contin ent. After the 9/11 attacks, delays at the Canadian-U.S. border prom pted parts shortage s in both countries, costing m anufacturers millions of dolla rs an hour. Trade across th e Mexican -U.S. border also suf fered in the imm ediate afterm ath of the attacks, which hindered U.S. econom ic growth. Continent- wide consequences m ean that Canada an d Mexico have an overriding commercial interest in increas ing North Am erican secur ity, apart from any other considerations. In addition, future terrorist assaults could target critical infrastruc ture or sites in any of the three countries. Beyond terrorism , all three countries m ust deal with a persistent flow of undocum ent ed immigrants. International crim inal activity also poses a continuing threat to public safety in the region, including drug- and gang-relate d violence along the Mexican-U.S. frontier. These cr oss-border threats cannot be adequately addressed by any one governm ent alone. 3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Failure to address secur ity issues will ultimate ly underm ine gains on other matters.

Shared challenges to our economic grow th and development.

Trade in certain sectors—su ch as natural resources, agriculture, and energy—rem ains far fr om free, and disputes in these areas have been a source of disagreem ent among our countries. Furthermore, the NAFTA partners have been unable to resolve a number of i mportant trade and investm ent disputes, which has created continuing tens ion in our comm ercial relationships. Leaders in our three countries have ac knowledged these cha llenges and discussed a wide range of responses during the 2005 Texas summ it. Those involving changes in form al trade agreem ents will of nec essity take tim e to negotia te and r atify. However, in other areas, notably regulatory cooperation and the expansion of transborder activities in critical sectors such as trans portation and financial services , there is a sh ared recognition that the three countries can and s hould act quickly in ways that would m ake a real dif ference in im proving the com petitiveness of firm s and individuals in North Am erica.

Progress m ay proceed at two speeds in som e spheres of policy.

Shared concerns rang e from regional econom ic growth to law enforcem ent, from energy secu rity to regu lato ry policy, from dispu te reso lution to continental defense. • North Am erica is different from other re gions of the world and m ust find its own cooperative route forward. A new North Am erican comm uni ty should rely m ore on the m arket and less on bureaucracy, m ore on pragm atic solutions to share d problem s than on grand schem es of confed eration or union, such as those in Europe.

Septem ber 11 highlighted the need for new approaches to border m anagem ent. In Decem ber 2001, Canada and th e United States signed the Sm art Border Declaration and an asso ciated 30-poin t Action Plan to secure border inf rastructur e, facilitate the se cure move ment of people and goods, and share inf orm ation.

The three countries should develop a secure North Am erican Border Pass with biometric identifiers. This docum ent would allow its bearers expedited passa ge through custom s, i mmigration, and airport security throughout the region. The program would be m odeled on the U.S.-Canadian “NEXUS” and the U.S.-Mexican “SENTRI” program s, which provide “smart cards” to allow swifter passage to those who pose no risk.

As founding m embers of the North At lantic Treaty Organization (NATO) , Canada and the United States are close m ilitary allies. When Canadian troops hunt terrorists and support democracy in Afghanistan, or when C anadian ships lead patrols in the Persian Gulf, they engage in the “forwa rd defense” of North Am erica by attacking the bases of support for international terroris m around the world.

Mexico is the firs t or second largest custom er of twenty -two states, and the second largest overall. North Am erica is now the largest free trade area in th e world.
