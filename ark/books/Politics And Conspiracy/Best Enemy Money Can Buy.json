It was after this invasion that President Jimmy Carter admitted publicly that it had taught him more about the inte ntions of the Soviets than everything he had ever learned. Never again would he kiss th e cheeks of Premier Brezhnev before the television cameras of the West. The Democrat-contro lled Senate even refused to ratify his SALT II treaty. (B y the way, President Reagan has been honoring its terms unofficially, and he alr eady has ordered the destruction of several Poseidon submarines, including the U.S.S. Sam Rayburn, the dismantling of which began in November of 1985, 1 and which cost a staggeri ng $21 million for the destruction of that one ship. 2 The Nathan Hale and the Andrew Jackson are scheduled for destruction in 1986. 3 To comply with SALT II, we will have to destroy an additional 2,500 Pose idon submarine warheads. \"Good faith,\" American diplomatic officials argue. (\"Good grief,\" you may be thinking.) The invasion of Afghanistan was a landmark shift in Soviet mili tary tactics. Departing from half a century of slow, ploddi ng, \"smother the enem y with raw power\" ta ctics, the Soviet military leadership adopted the lightning stri ke. Overnight, the Soviets had captured the Kabul airfield and had surrounded the capital city with tanks. 4 Tanks? In an overnight invasi on? How did 30-ton Soviet tanks roll from the Soviet border to the interior city of Kabul in one da y? What about the rugged Afghan terrain? The answer is simple: there are two highways from the Soviet Union to Kabul, including one which is 647 miles long. Their bridges can support tanks. Do you think that Afghan peasants built these roads for yak-drawn cart s? Do you think that Afghan peasants built these roads at all? No, you built them. In 1966, reports on this huge construction proj ect began to appear in obscure U.S. magainzes. The project was completed the foll owing year. It was pa rt of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Soviet and U.S.' engineers work ed side by side, spending U.S. foreign aid money and Soviet money, to get the highways bu ilt. One strip of roa d, 67 miles long, north through the Salang Pass to the U.S.S.R., co st $42 million, or $643,000 per mile. John W. Millers, the leader of the Un ited National survey team in Afghanistan, commented at the time that it was the most expe nsive bit of road he had ever seen. The Soviets trained and used 8,000 Afghans to build it. 5 If there were any justice in this world of in ternational foreign aid, the Soviet tanks should have rolled by signs that read: \"U .S. Highway Tax Dollars at Work.\" Nice guys, the Soviets. They just wanted to help a technologically backward nation. Nice g u y s, American forei g n aid officials.

The names have not been changed, so as not to protect the guilty. In the mid-1970's, the original version of this book led to the destru ction of Antony Sutton's career as a salaried academic researcher with the prestigious (and therefore, not quite ideologically tough enough) Hoover Instituti on on War, Revolution and Peace. That was a high price for Sutton to pay, but not nearly so high as the price you and I are going to be asked to pay because of the activities that this book describes in painstaking detail. Lenin is supposed to have ma de the following observation: \"If we were to announce today that we intend to hang all capitalists tomorrow, they would trip over each other trying to sell us the rope.\" I don't think he ever said it. However, so meone who really unders tood Lenin, Communism, and capitalist ethics said it. This book shows how accurate an observation it is. Antony Sutton is not about to offer the foll owing evidence in hi s own academic self- defense, so I will. Perhaps the best-informed Am erican scholar in the field of Soviet history and overall strategy is Prof. Richard Pipes of Harvard Univ ersity. In 1984, his chilling book appeared, Survival Is Not Enough: Soviet Re alities and America's Future (Simon & Schuster). His book tells at least part of the story of the Soviet Union's reliance on Western technology, including the infam ous Kama River truck plan t, which was built by the Pullman-Swindell company of Pittsburgh, Pennsyl vania, a subsidiary of M. W. Kellogg Co. Prof. Pipes remarks that the bulk of the Soviet merchant marine, the largest in the world, was built in foreign shipyards. He even tells the story (rel ated in greater detail in this book) of the Bryant Chucking Grinde r Company of Springfield, Verm ont, which sold the Soviet Union the ball-bearing machines that alone made possible the targeting mechanism of Soviet MIRV'ed ballistic missiles. And in footnote 29 on page 290, he reveals the following: In his three-volume detailed account of Soviet purchas es of Western equipment and technology . . . [Ant ony] Sutton comes to conclusions that are uncomfortable for many businessmen and economists. For this reason his work tends to be either dismi ssed out of hand as \"extreme \" or, more often, simply ignored. Prof. Pipes knows how the academic game is played. The game cost Sutton his academic career. But the academic game is very small pot atoes compared to the historic \"game\" of world conquest by the Soviet em pire. We are dealing with a me ssianic State which intends to impose its will on every nation' on earth — a goal which Soviet leaders have repeated constantly since they captured Russia in thei r nearly bloodless coup in October of 1917. Sutton identifies the deaf mute blindmen who sell the Soviets the equipment they need for world con q uest. But at least these deaf mute blindmen g et somethin g out of it: mone y . Not"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"soft currency\" Soviet rubles, ei ther; they get U.S. dollars from the Soviets, who in turn get long-term loans that are guarant eed by U.S. taxpayers. Their mo tivation is fairly easy to understand. But what do the academic drones get out of it? What do they get for their systematic suppression of the hi storical facts, and their callous treatment in book reviews of works such as Sutton's m onumental three-volume set, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development? What was in it, for example, for C. H. Feinstein of Clare College, Cambridge Unversity, who revi ewed Sutton's first volume, covering 1917-1930? He could not honestly fault Sutton's basic scholarship, nor did he try: . . . he has examined a vast amount of in formation, much of it previously unknown to scholars, regarding the tradi ng contacts and contracts between the U.S.S.R and the West, notably German y and the United States. The primary sources were the fascinating and extraord inarily detailed files of the U.S. State Department and the archives of the Ge rman Foreign Ministry, and these were supplemented by a wide-ra nging and multilingual se lection of books and journals. He even wrote that \"Sutton's prodigious research es (and this is appare ntly only the first of three projected volumes) have provided students of Soviet economic development with a detailed survey of the way in which 'Weste rn' technology was transferred to the Soviet Union, and for this we are inde bted to him.\" But having admi tted this —thereby preserving the surface appearance of professional integrit y —Feinstein then lo wered the academic boom: Unfortunately, his attempt to go beyond th is, and to assess the significance of this transfer and of the concessions po licy, is unsatisfactory and overstates the extent and impact of the concessions as well as th eir importance for Soviet economic development .... the defects of Sutton's approach . . . a similar lack of understanding... Sutton exaggerates... He further indulges his fondness for exaggeration .... 6 You get the basic thrust of the review. \"Facts are fine; we are all scholars here.\" But even the mildest sort of first-stage conclusions concerning the importance and significance of such facts are anathema, for th e facts show that th e Soviet economy shoul d have this sign over it: \"Made in the West.\" Su tton's subsequent two volumes we re never review ed in this specialized academic journal — the journal, above all other U.S. scholarly journals, in which it would have been most appropriate to include review s of scholarly books on Soviet economic history. The information blackout had begun, and it was augmented by the publisher's own blackout beginning in 19 73, a blackout discussed in this book. Less than three years after Feinstein's revi ew was published, Bryant Chucking Grinder Co. sold the Soviets the ball-bearing grinders that subsequently pl aced the West at the mercy of the Soviet tyrants. At last, they possessed th e technology which makes possible a relatively low-risk first-strike by Soviet missile s against our missile s and \"defenses.\" 7 Until Bryant supplied the technology, the Sovi ets couldn't build such offensive weapons, which is why they had lobbied from 1961 until 1972 to get the U.S. government 's authorization to buy the units. Within a few years after delivery, they had the missiles installed. Then they invaded Afghanistan.

But if the facts were not included, the book's thesis would be too far-fetched to ac cept. He therefore includes pages and pages of dull, dreary details — details that lead to an inescapable conclusion: that the West has been betrayed by its major co rporate leaders, with the fu ll compliance of its national political leaders. From this time forward, you can say in confid ence to anyone: \"The Unit ed States financed the economic and military development of the S oviet Union. Without th is aid, financed by U.S. taxpayers, there would be no significant Sovi et military threat, fo r there would be no Soviet economy to support the So viet military machine, let alone sophisticated military equipment.\" Should your listener scoff, you need only to ha nd him a copy of this book. it will stuff his mouth with footnotes. It probably will not change the scoffer's mind, however. Minds are seldom changed with facts, certainly not college-trained minds. Fact s did not change Prof. Feinstein's mind, after all. The book will only shut up the scoffer when in your presence. But even that is worth a lot these days. From this day forward, you should never take se riously any State Depart ment official (and certainly not the Secretary of State) who announces to the pre ss that this nation is now, and has always been, engaged in a worldwide struggle agai nst Communism and Soviet aggression. Once in a while, Secr etaries of State feel pressure d to give such speeches. They are nonsense. They are puffery for the folks out in middle America. You may note for future reference my observati on that Secretaries of Commerce never feel this pressure to make anti-Communist speech es. They, unlike Secretaries of State, speak directly for American corpor ate interests. They know wher e their bread is buttered, and more important, who controls the knife. When it comes to trading with the enemy, multinational corporat e leaders act in terms of the political philosophy of the le gendary George Washington Plunkett of Tammany Hall: \"I seen my opportunities, and I took 'em.\" Plunkett was defending \"honest graft\"; our modern grafters have raised the stakes considerabl y.

This is the infamous strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) which was implemented by former Secret ary of Defense (!! !) Robert Strange McNamara. If Soviet missiles were to take out the bulk of our land-based missiles in a first strike, we would have little choice but to surrender, since our submarine-launched missile s are too weak and too inaccurate to destroy hardened Soviet missile si los, and the Soviets could threaten a second wave of missiles against our cities if we were to attempt to retaliate.

BACK "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Author's Preface Back in 1973 this author published National Suicide: Militar y Aid to the Soviet Union, itself a sequel to a three volume academic study, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, published by the Hoover Instit ution, Stanford Univer sity. These four books are detailed verifiable catalogs of Western technology used a nd in use by the Soviet Union, acquired by gift, purchase, illegal diversion or theft. Taken together, these four vol umes constitute an extraord inary commentary on a basic weakness in the Soviet system and an equally extraordinar y weakness in Western policy making. The Soviets are heav ily dependent on Western t echnology and innovation not only in their civilian industries, but also in their military programs. Technology is, of course, the li fe blood of modern economic development: technology is the difference between the Third World and the advanced 21st century development epitomised by Silicon Valley in California. Regrettably, most economists are not qualified to explore the role of technology in economic development. Technology is assumed as a \"given,\" whereas it is in fact a dynamic factor, the most dynamic factor many woul d argue, in modern economic development. Similarly, State Department pla nners, essentially political scie ntists, are not at home with technology — sufficiently so that in 1963 State issued papers to the effect that the Soviets had only self-generated technology. Even t oday State and Commerce appear barely conversant with the extent of Soviet \"rever se engineering.\" Fortunately, Department of Defense is more attuned to technology and among all government departments is alone aware of the magnitude of the problem to be described in The Best Enemy Money Can Buy. The deaf mute blindmen — to quote from Lenin — are thos e multinational businessmen who see no further than the bottom line of the current c ontract. Unfortunately, these internationalist operators have disproporti onate influence in Washington. Consequently, arguments based on the flimsiest of evidence and the most absurd logic that fly in the face of all we know about th e Soviets are able not only to be heard in Wa shington, but even form the basis of our policy. An inevitable conclusion from the evidence in this book is th at we have totally ignored a policy that would enable us to neutralize Soviet global am bitions while simultaneously reducing the defense budget and th e tax load on American citizen s. Whether we like it or not, technology is a political tool in today's world. And if we want to su rvive in the face of Soviet ambitions, we wi ll have to use this weapon soone r or later. At the moment the combined efforts of the deaf mute blindmen have been successful. Only an informed, aroused electorate has sufficie nt potential power to counter their suicidal ambitions. Antony C.

These men range from historians in Department of St ate, top level officials in Depa rtment of Commerce, engineers working for IBM, to academics in America's leading universities. In each case threats and pressures which le d to censorship, firing, and excommunication track back to the deaf mute blindmen, and their associates in political Washington. Who are the deaf mute blindmen? The Russian revolutionary Vladim ir Ilych (Ulyanov) Lenin coin ed the phrase, and whatever we think of Lenin's revolutionary philosophy, we cannot deny his genius in the analysis of capitalists and their motivations. Here is Lenin on the \"deaf mute blindmen.\" The Capitalists of the worl d and their governments, in pursuit of conquest of the Soviet market, will clos e their eyes to the indicated higher reality and thus will turn into deaf mute blindmen. They will exte nd credits, which will strengthen for us the Communist Party in their countries and giving us the materials and technology we lack, they will restore our military industry, indispensable for our futu re victorious attacks on our suppliers. In other words, they will labor for the preparation for their own suicide. 1 The Suppressed Higher Reality What is this \"higher reality\" th at Lenin identifies? It is simply that the Soviet system cannot generate sufficient innovation and technology to become a world power, yet Soviet global ambitions demand that its social ist system challenge and surp ass the capitalist systems of the West. Lenin deduced just before he died in 1923 that Soviet comm unism had an Achilles heel, a fatal defect. In a remarkable about-face Le nin then introduced the New Economic Policy, a return to limited free enterprise an d a prelude to a long-lasting cooperation with Western capita lists — the deaf mute blindm en. This policy was repeated by Communist China in the early 1980s. It is knowledge of this \"highe r reality\" that has been ruth lessly suppressed by successive Administrations under political pressure from internationa list businessmen. The State De p artment, for exam p le, has a dis g raceful record of attem p tin g to black out information"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"and present a false picture of historical events. Under John Fo ster Dulles, Dr . G. Bernard Noble, a Rhodes scholar and an enemy of any attempt to cha nge the Establishment's party- line, was promoted to take charge of the Historical Of fice at State De partment. Two historians, Dr. Donald Dozer and Dr. Bryton Barron, who protes ted the official policy of distorting information and suppr essing historical documents, we re railroaded out of the State Department. Dr . Barron, in his book, Inside the State Department, 2 specifically charged the State Depar tment with responsibility for the exportation of mili tary technology to the Soviet Union, and listed four examples of highly strategic tools whose export to the USSR was urged by officials of the State Department. 1. Boring mills for manufactur e of tanks, artillery, ai rcraft, and the atomic reactors used in submarines. 2. Vertical boring mills for manufacture of jet engines. 3. Dynamic balance machines used to balance shafts on engines for jet airplanes and guided missiles. 4. External cylindrical grinding machines which a Defense De partment expert testified were essential in making engi ne parts, guided missiles, and radar. Bryton Barron concludes: It should be evident that we cannot trust the present personnel of the Department to apply our agreements in the nation's interest any more than we can trust it to give us the full facts about our treaties and other international commitments. Breathtakingly inaccurate are the only words th at can describe Stat e Department claims regarding our military assistance to the Soviet Union. The general Stat e Department line is that the Soviets have a self-developed technol ogy, that trade is always peaceful, that we have controls on the export of strategic goods, a nd that there is no co nceivable relationship between our export to the Soviet Un ion and Soviet armaments production· An example will make the point. Here is a statement by Ambassador Trezise to the Senate: Ambassador Trezise: We, I think, are sometimes guilty, Senator, of a degree of false and unwarranted pride in our industrial and technol ogical might, a kind of arrogance, if you will · . . we are ahead of the Sovi et Union in many areas of industry and technology. But a nation that can accompli sh the scientific and technological feats the Soviet Union has accomplished in recent years is clearly not a primitive, mudhut economy .... It is a big, vigorous, strong, and highly capable national entity, and its performan ce in the space field and in other fields has given us ever y indication that Soviet engineers, technicians, scientists, are in the forefront of the sc ientists, engineers, technicians of the world. Senator Muskie: So that the urge towards increased trade with Eastern European countries has not resulted in a weakening of the restrictions related to strate g ic g oods?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Ambassador Trezise: I think that is an accurate statement, Senator. Now we have, we think, quit e an effective system of handling items which are in the military area or so closely re lated thereto that they become strategic items by everybody's agreement. In fact, at the very time Trezise was making the above so othing statement, critical shipments of strategic materials and equipmen t were going forward to the Soviet Union. The so-called Export Control la ws were a leaky sieve due to outright inefficiency in Departments of State and Commerce. Censorship has enabled politically appointed officials and the permanent Washington bureaucracy to make such unbelievably inaccurate statements without f ear of challenge in Congress or by the American public. The State Department files are crammed with information concerning U.S. technical and economic assistance to the Sovi et Union. The author of this book required three substantial volumes (see Bibliography) just to summarize this assistan ce for the years 1917-1970. Yet former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, presumably acting on th e advice of State Department researchers, stated in 1961, \"It would seem clear that the Sovi et Union derives only the most marginal help in its economic development fr om the amount of U.S. goods it receives.\" A statement flatly contradictory to the massive evidence available in departmental files. In 1968 Nicholas de B. Katzenba ch, Assistant Secretary of Stat e, made a statement that was similarly inconsistent with observable fact, and displayed a fundamental lack of common- sense reasoning: We should have no illusions. If we do not sell peaceful goods to the nations of Eastern Europe, others will . If we erect barriers to our trade with Eastern Europe, we will lose the trade and East ern Europe will buy elsewhere. But we will not make any easier our task of stopping aggression in Vietnam nor in building security for the United States. 3 In fact, aggression in South Vi etnam would have been impossibl e without U.S. assistance to the Soviet Union. Much of the key \"Eur opean\" technology cited derives from U.S. subsidiaries. Jack N. Behrman, former Deputy Assistant S ecretary for International Affairs at the Department of Commerce, repeated the same theme on behalf of the Commerce Department: This is the old problem of economic dependency. However, I do not believe that Russia would in fact permit he rself to become de pendent upon imported sources of strategic goods. Rather she would import amounts additional to her strategic needs, thereby relieving th e pressure on her ec onomy by not risking dependence. 4 In fact, Jack Behrman to the contrary notwith standing, Soviet Russia is the most dependent lar g e nation in modern histor y , for wheat as well as technolo gy ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Here's another statement from former Secr etary of Commerce Ma urice H.

A : Under the circumstances, we might be very foolish not to accept business which could create jobs in the United Stat es, when refusing to sell to the Soviet Union would in no way deter their progress. 5 Suppression of Information Information suppression concerni ng Soviet relations with the United States may be found in all administrations, Democrat and Republican, from President Wilson to President Reagan. For example, on November 28, 1917, just a fe w weeks after the Petrograd and Moscow Bolsheviks had overthrown th e democratic and constituti onal government of Russia, \"Colonel\" House (then in Paris) intervened on behalf of the Bolsheviks and cabled President Wilson and the Secretary of Stat e in the \"Special Green\" cipher of the State Department as follows: There has been cabled over and publishe d here [Paris] statements made by American papers to the effect that Russi a should be treated as an enemy. It is exceedingly important that such criticisms should be suppressed... 6 Suppression of information critic al of the Soviet Union and our military assistance to the Soviets may be traced in the St ate Department files from this 1917 House cable down to the present day, when export licenses issued for ad mittedly military equi pment exports to the USSR are not available fo r public information. In fact, Soviet sources must be used to trace the impact of some American technology on Soviet military devel opment. The Soviet Register of Shipping, for example, publishes th e technical specifications of main engines in Russian vessels (including country of manufactur e): this information is not available from U.S. official sources. In November 1971, Krasnaya Zvezda published an article with specific reference to the contri bution of the basic Soviet indus trial structure to the Soviet military power — a cont ribution that representatives of the U.S. Executive Branch have explicitly denied to the public and to Congress. Even today U.S. assistance to the Soviet military-industrial comp lex and its weapons systems cannot be documented from open U. S. sources alone because export license memoranda are classified data. Unless the technical nature of our shipments to the USSR is known, it is impossible to dete rmine their contribution to th e Soviet military complex. The national security argument is not acceptable as a defense fo r classification because the Soviets know what they are buying. So does the United States government. So do U.S. firms. So do the deaf mute blindmen. The group left out in the cold is the American taxpayer-voter. From time to time bills have been intr oduced in Congress to make export-license information freely available. These bills have never received Administration support. Nonavailability of current in formation means that decisions affecting all Americans are made by a relatively few government official s without impartial outside scrutiny, and under p olitical p ressure from internationlist businessmen. In man y cases these decisions would not"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"be sustained if subjected to public examination and criticism. It is argued by policy-makers that decisions affecting nationa l security and intern ational relations ca nnot be made in a goldfish bowl. The obvious answer to this is the history of the past se venty years: we have had one catastrophic inte rnational problem after another — and in the light of history, the outcome would have been far less costly if the decisions had been made in a goldfish bowl. For instance, little more than a decade af ter House's appeal to Wilson, Senator Smoot inquired of the State Departme nt about the possible military end-uses of an aluminum powder plant to be erec ted in the Soviet Union by W. Ha hn, an American engineer. State Department files contain a re cently declassified document which states why no reply was ever given to Senator Smoot: No reply was made to Senator Smoot by the Department as the Secretary did not desire to indicate that the Depar tment had no objection to the rendering by Mr. Hahn of technical assistance to the Soviet authorities in the production of aluminum powder, in view of the possib ility of its use as war material, and preferred to take no position at th e time in regard to the matter. 7 Congressional action in the Freedom on Inform ation Act and administrative claims of speedy declassification have not changed this basic situation. Major significant documents covering the history of the past seventy years are buried, and they will remain buried until an outraged public opinion puts some pressure on Congress. Congress has on the other hand investigated a nd subsequently publishe d several reports on the export of strategic material s to the Soviet Union. One such instance, called \"a life and death matter\" by Congress, conc erned the proposed shipment of ball bearing machines to the USSR. 8 The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company acce pted a Soviet order for thirty-five Centalign-B machines for processing miniature ball bearings. All such precision ball bearings in the United States , used by the Department of Defense for missile guidance systems, were processed on seventy-tw o Bryant Centalign Model-B machines. In 1961 the Department of Commerce approved export of thirty-five su ch machines to the USSR, which would have given th e Soviets capability about equa l to 50 percent of the U.S. capability. The Soviets had no e quipment for such mass production pr ocessing, and neither the USSR nor any European manufacturer could manufacture such equipment. A Department of Commerce statement that ther e were other manufacturers was shown to be inaccurate. Commerce proposed to give the Soviet Union an ability to use its higher-thrust rockets with much greater accuracy and so pull ahead of the United States. Subsequently, a congressional investigation yi elded accurate information not otherwise available to independent nongovernment resear chers and the general public. Congressional investigatio ns have also unearthed extraord inary \"errors\" of judgment by high officials. For example, in 1961 a dispute arose in U.S. government circles over the \"Transfermatic Case\" — a proposal to ship to the USSR two transfer lines (with a total value of $4.3 million) for th e production of truck engines. In a statement dated February 23, 1961, the Department of De fense went on record against shi p ment of the transfer lines on the g rounds that \"the technolo gy contained in these"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Transfermatic machines produced in the United States is the most advanced in the world,\" and that \"so far as this depa rtment knows, the USSR has not installed this type of machinery. The receipt of this equipment by the USSR will contribute to the Soviet military and economic warfare potential.\" This argument was arbitrarily overturned by the incoming Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Secr etary McNamara did not allow for the known fact that most Soviet milita ry trucks came from two Ameri can-built plants even then receiving equipment from the United States. The Transfer matic machines approved by McNamara had clear and obvious military uses — as the De partment of Defense had previously argued. Yet McNamara allowed them to go forward. Yet another calculated decept ion of the American public can be traced to the Johnson Administration. In 1966 the U.S. Department of State produced a beautiful, extravagantly illustrated brochure of American hand tools. This was printed in Russian, for distribution in Russia, with a preface — in Russian — by Lyndon Johnson. Requests to the State Department for a copy of this brochure went unanswered. The book is not listed in official catalogues of government publications. It is not available or even known to the general public. No printer's name appears on the back co ver. The publisher is not listed. The author obtained a copy from Russia. Here is the preface: Hand Tools — USA 9 Welcome to the \"Hand T ools — USA\" exhibit — the eighth consecutive exhibit arranged for citizens of the Soviet Union. At this exhibit you will see sample s of various hand tools currently manufactured in the United States — tools that facilitate manual work and make it possible to produce better-qua lity industrial goods at a much lower cost. Since the very early days of the histor y of our country, Americans of all ages have worked with hand tools. In indus try and at home, in factories and on farms, in workshops and schools, the ha nd tool has become indispensable in our lives. Some of these tools have retained their original simplicity of design; others have acquired entirely new forms and ar e now used to perform new functions. We sincerely hope that this exhibit will lead to a better understanding of the American people and their way of life. /s/ Lyndon B. Johnson Why all the secrecy? Imagine the public react ion in 1966, when the Soviets were supplying the North Viets with weapons to kill Americans (over 5,000 were killed that year), if it had become known that the State De partment had published lavish booklets in Russian for free distribution in Russia at taxpayers' expense. However, the point at issue is not the wisdom of publication, but the wisdom of concealment. The p ublic is not told because the p ublic mi g ht p rotest. In other words, the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"public cannot be trusted to see things in th e same light as the policymakers, and the policymakers are unwilling to defend their positions. Further, what would have been the domestic political conse quences if it had been known that a U.S. President had signe d a document in Russ ian, lavishly produced at the taxpayers' expense for free distribution in Russia, while Russian weapons were killing Americans in Vietnam with assistance from our own deaf mute blindmen ? The citizen-taxpayer does not share the expensive illusions of the Washi ngton elite., The political reaction by the taxpayer, and his few s upporters in Congress, would have been harsh and very much to the point. The Deaf Mute Blindmen The key party interested in concealment of information a bout our export to the Soviet Union is, of course, the Americ an firms and individuals promin ently associated with such exports, i.e., the deaf mute blindmen themselves. In general, the American public has a basic right to know what is being shipped and who is shipping it, if the Soviets are using the material ag ainst us. The public al so has a right to know about the personal interests of presidenti al appointees and prev ious employment with firms prominent in trade with the USSR. Until recently, the fi rms involved could publicly claim ig norance of the use to which the Soviets put imported Western t echnology. It is not a good claim, but it was made. From the 1970's on, ignorance of end-use is not a valid claim. The ev idence is clear , overwhelming, and readily available: the Soviets have used American technology to kill Americans and their allies. The claim that publication of license information would give undue ad vantage to competitors is not the kind of argument that an honest bus inessman would make. It is only necessary to publish certain ba sic elementary information: date, name of firm, amount, destination in the USSR, and a brief statement of the technical aspects. Every industry has a \"grapevine\" and potential business in an industry is always common knowledge. In any event, suppose there was adverse comment about a particular sale to the Soviets? Is this a bad thing? If our policies are indeed vi able, why fear public opi nion? Or are certain sectors of our society to be immune from public criticism? Soviet dependency on our technology, and th eir use of this te chnology for military purposes, could have been known to Congress on a continuing basis in the 1950s and 1960s if export license information had been freely available. The problem was suspected, but the compilation of the proof had to wait several decades until the evidence became available from Soviet sources. In the m eantime, Administration and busin ess spokesmen were able to make absurd statements to Congress wit hout fear of challenge. In general, only those who had already made up their minds that Soviet trade was desirable had access to license information. These were the deaf mute blindmen only able to s ee their own conception of events and blind to the fact that we had contributed to c onstruction of Soviet military p ower."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"In 1968, for example, the Gleason Company of Ro chester, New York shipped equipment to the Gorki automobile plant in Russia, a plant previously built by the Ford Motor Company. The information about shipment did not come fr om 'the censored licens es but from foreign press sources. Knowledge of license applicati on for any equipment to be used to Gorki would have elicited vigorous pr otests to Congress. Why? Be cause the Gorki plant produces a wide range of military vehi cles and equipment. Many of th e trucks used on the Ho Chi Minh trail were GAZ vehicles from Gorki. Th e rocket-launchers used against Israel are mounted on GAZ-69 chassis made at Gorki. They have Ford-type engines made at Gorki. Thus, a screen of censorship vigorously supported by multinational businessmen has withheld knowledge of a secret shift in direction of U.S. foreign policy. This shift can be summarized as follows: 1. Our long-run technical assistance to th e Soviet Union has built a first-order military threat to our very existence. 2. Our lengthy history of technical assist ance to the Soviet military structure was known to successive ad ministrations, but has onl y recently (1982) been admitted to Congress or to the American public. 3. Current military assistance is also known, but is admitted only on a case-by- case basis when information to form ulate a question can be obtained from nongovernment sources. 4. As a general rule, deta iled data on export licens es, which are required to establish the continuing and long-run dependence of the Soviet military- industrial complex on the United States, have been made available to Congress only by special request, and have been denied comple tely to the American public at large. In brief, all presidential admi nistrations, from that of Woodr ow Wilson to th at of Ronald Reagan, have followed a bipa rtisan foreign policy of building up the Soviet Union. This policy is censored. It is a policy of suicide. Persistent pressure from nongovernmental re searchers and knowledgeable individuals has today forced the Administration to at least publicly acknowledge the nature of the problem but still do very little about it. For instance, in an in terview on March 8, 1982, William Casey, Director of the Central Intelligence Ag ency, made the following revealing statement: We have determined that the Soviet strategic advances depend on Western technology to a far greater degree than anybody ever dream ed of. It just doesn't make any sense for us to spend addi tional billions of do llars to protect ourselves against the capabi lities that the Soviets have developed largely by virtue of having pretty much of a free ride on our research and development. They use every method you can imagine — purchase, legal and illegal; theft; bribery; espionage; scientific exchange ; study of trade press, and invoking the Freedom of Information Act — to get this information.

They have been recruiting about 100 young scientists and engineers a year for the last 15 years. They roam the wo rld looking for technology to pick up. Back in Moscow there are 400 or 500 a ssessing what they might need and where they might get it — doing their ta rgeting and then assessing what they get. It's a very sophisticated and farflung operation. 10 Unfortunately, Mr. Casey, who plead s surprise at the discovery, is still concealing the whole story. This author (not alone) made this known to Depart ment of Defense over 15 years ago , with a request for informati on to develop the full nature of the problem. This exchange of letters is reproduced as Appendix A. No thing was done in 1971. In the past 15 years there has been a superficial change — the Re agan Administration is now willing to admit the existence of the problem. It has not yet been w illing to face the pol icy challenge. Until the deaf mute blindmen are ne utralized, our assistance for S oviet strategic advances will continue.

Pravda, July 20, 1927 At the end of World War II the U.S. governme nt appointed an inte ragency committee to consider the future of the German automobile industry and its war-ma king potential. This committee concluded that any motor vehicle industry in any country is an important factor in that country's war potential. More than half U.S. tanks, almost all armored and half-track vehicles and one-third of guns over 33 millimeter were manuf actured in U.S. civilian motor vehicle plants. Consequently, the committ ee unanimously recommended: 1. Any vehicle industry is a major force for war. 2. German automotive manufacturing shoul d be prohibited because it was a war industry. 3. Numerous military pr oducts can be made by the automobile industry, including aerial torpedoes, aircraft cannon, aircraft instruments, aircraft engines, aircraft engines pa rts, aircraft ignition test ers, aircraft machine guns, aircraft propeller subassemblies, aircra ft propellers, airc raft servicing and testing equipment, aircraft struts, airf rames, and so on. A to tal of 300 items of military equipment was listed. A comparison of the recommendati ons from this committee with subsequent administrative recommendations and policies for the export of automobile-manufacturing plants to the Soviet Union demonstrates ex traordinary inconsistencies. If automobile-manufacturing capacity has \"warlike\" potential for Germany and the United States, then it also has \"warlike\" potential for the Soviet Union. But the recommendations for post-war Germany and the Soviet Union are totally di vergent. Some of the same Washington bureaucrats (for example, Charle s R. Weaver of the Department of Commerce) participated in making both decisions. In brief, any automobile or tractor plant can be used to produce tanks , armored cars, military trucks, other military vehicles and equipm ent. A major conclusion reached by a U.S. interagency committee formed to study the war-making poten tial of the U.S. and German automotive industries was that a motor vehi cle industry has enorm ous military potential. \"The Committee reco g nized without dissent that [German y 's] motor vehicle industr y was an"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"important factor in her waging of war during World War II.\" On the basis of its findings, th e committee recommended that the manufacture of complete automobiles in Germany be prohibited, that the manufac ture of certain parts and subassemblies be \"specifically prohibited,\" and that Germany \"should not be permitted to retain in her possession any types of vehicles or particular military application, such as track-laying vehicles, multi-axle vehicles, etc.\" The committee further listed mo re than 300 \"war products manu factured by the automotive industry.\" These conclusions have been ignored for the Soviet automobile industry, even while the Soviets themselves officially stated their intention to use foreign automobile technology for military vehicles as early as 1927 . V. V. Ossinsky, a top planner, wrote a series of articles for Pravda (July 20, 21 and 22, 1927) with the following warning: If in a future war we use the Russian peasant cart against the American or European automobile, the result to say the least will be disproportionately heavy losses, the inevitable consequen ces of technical weakness. This is certainly not industrialized defense. The Soviet military-civilian vehicle manufacturing industry, as subsequently developed, produces a limited range of utilitarian truc ks and automobiles in a few large plants designed, built by, and almost entirely equi pped with Western, primarily American, technical assistance and machin ery. These motor vehicle plants mostly manufacture their own components and ship these to assembly plants elsewhere in the Soviet Union. There is a high degree of in tegration between Russian milita ry and civilian vehicle models. Military and civilian vehicles have interchangeable parts and Soviet policy is to maximize unification of military and civi lian designs to assist model change-over in case of war. This unification of military and civilian auto mobile design has been described by the Soviet economist A. N. Lagovskiy: The fewer design changes be tween the old and the ne w type of product, the easier and more rapidly the enterpri se will shift to new production. If, for example, chassis, motors, and other parts of a motor vehicle of a civilian model are used for a military motor vehicle, or course, the shift to the mass production of the military motor vehicle will occu r considerably faster and more easily than if the design of all the main parts were different. Lagovskiy notes that Soviet \"c ivilian\" agricultural tractors and motor vehicles can be used directly as military vehicles without major conversion. Soviet tractors (direct copies of Caterpillar models) were used as artillery tractors in World Wa r II and Korea. General G. I. Pokrovski makes a similar ar gument about the U.S. 106-m illimeter recoilless weapon mounted on a Willys jeep and comments that \"eve n relatively powerful recoilless artillery systems can, at the present ti me, be mounted on a light auto mobile without reducing the number of men accomodated.\" 11 Almost all — p ossibl y 95 p ercent — of Soviet militar y vehicles are p roduced in ver y lar g e"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"plants designed by American engineers in the 1930s through the 1970s. The Soviet Military Truck Industry Soviet civilian and military tr ucks are produced in the same plants and have extensive interchangeability of parts and components. For example, the ZIL- 131 was the main 31/2- ton 6x6 Soviet milit ary truck used in Vietnam and Afgha nistan and is produced also in a civilian 4 x 2 version as the ZIL-130. Over 60 percent of the parts in the ZIL-131 military truck are common to the ZIL-130 civilian truck. All Soviet truck technology and a large part of So viet truck-manufacturing equipment has come from the West, mainly from the United St ates. While some elemen tary transfers-lines and individual machines for ve hicle production are made in the Soviet Union, these are copies of Western machines a nd always obsolete in design. Many major American companies have been prominent in building up the Soviet truck industry. The Ford Motor Company, the A. J. Brandt Company, the Austin Company, General Electric, Swindell-Dressi er, and others supplied the technical assist ance, design work, and equipment of th e original giant plants. This Soviet military-civilian truck industry originally compri sed two main groups of plants, plus five newer giant plants. The first group used models, tec hnical assistance, and parts and components from the Ford-built Gorki autom obile plant (GAZ is the model designation). The second group of product ion plants used models, parts, and components from the A. J. Brandt-rebuilt ZIL plan t in Moscow (Zavod imeni Likhach ev, formerly the AMO and later the Stalin plant). Consequently this plant was called the BBH-ZIL plant after the three companies involved in its reconstruction and expansion in the 1930s: A. J. Brandt, Budd, and Hamilton Foundry. There is a fundamental difference between the Ford and Br andt companies. Brandt had only one contract in the USSR, to rebuild the old AMO plan t in 1929. AMO in 1930 had a production of 30,000 trucks per year , compared to the Gorki plan t, designed from scratch by Ford for an output of 140,000 vehi cles per year. Ford is still in terested in Russian business. Brandt is not interested and has not been since 1930. The Ford-Gorki group of assembly plants includes the plants at Ulyanovsk (model designation UAZ), Odessa (m odel designation OAZ), and Pavlovo (model designation PAZ). The BBH-ZIL group includes the truc k plants at Mytischiy (MMZ model designation), Miass (or URAL Zis), Dnepr opetrovsk (model designation DAZ), Kutaisi (KAZ model), and Lvov (LAZ model). Besides these main gr oups there are also five independent plants. The Minsk truck plant (MAZ) wa s built with German assistance. The Hercules-Yaroslavl truck plan t (YaAz) was built by the Hercules Motor Company. The MZMA plant in Moscow, which manufactures sm all automobiles, was also built by Ford Motor Company. In the late 1960s came the so-c alled Fiat-Togliatti auto plan t. Three-quarters of this equipment came from the Un ited States. Then in 1972 the U.S. government issued $1 billion in licenses to export equipment and t echnical assistance for the Kama truck plant. Planned as the lar g est truck p lant in the world, it covers 36 s q uare miles and p roduces more"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"heavy trucks, including military trucks, than the output of all U.S. heavy truck manufacturers combined. (Togliatti and Kama are described in Chapter Three below.) This comprises the complete Soviet vehicle manufacturing industry — all built with Western, primarily Am erican, technical assi stance and technology. Military models are produced in these plants utilizing the same components as the civi lian models. The two main vehicle production centers, Gorki and ZIL, manufacture more than two-thirds of all Soviet civilian vehicles (excluding the new Togliatti and Kama pl ants) and almost all current military vehicles. The Ford Gorki \"Automobile\" Plant In May 1929 the Soviets signed an agreement wi th the Ford Motor Company of Detroit. The Soviets agreed to purchase $13 million worth of autom obiles and parts a nd Ford agreed to give technical assistance until 1938 to construct an integr ated automobile-manufacturing plant at Nizhni-Novgorod. Construction was co mpleted in 1933 by the Austin Company for production of the Ford Model-A passenger car and light truck. Today this plant is known as Gorki. With its original equipment suppl emented by imports and domestic copies of imported equipment, Gorki produces the GAZ ra nge of automobiles, trucks, and military vehicles. All Soviet vehicles with the model prefix GAZ ( Gorki Avtomobilnyi Zavod) are from Gorki, and models wi th prefixes UAX, OdAZ, and PAZ are made from Gorki components. In 1930 Gorki produced the Ford Model-A (know n as GAZ-A) and th e Ford light truck (called GAZ-AA). Both these Ford models were immediately adopted for military use . By the late 1930s production at Gorki was 80,00 0-90,000 \"Russian Ford\" vehicles per year. The engine production facilities at Gorki were designed under a t echnical assistance agreement with the Brown Lipe Gear Comp any for gear-cutting technology and Timken- Detroit Axle Company for rear and front axles. Furthermore, U.S. equipment has been shi pped in substantial quantifies to Gorki and subsidiary plants since the 1930s — indeed so me shipments were made from the United States in 1968 during the Vietnamese War. As soon as Ford's engineers left Gorki in 1930 the Soviets began production of military vehicles. The Soviet BA armored car of the 1930s was the GAZ-A (Ford Model-A) chassis, intended for passenger cars, but converted to an armored car with the addition of a DT machine gun. The BA was followed by the BA-10 — the Ford Model-A truck chassis with a mount containing either a 37-millimeter gun or a 12.7-millimeter heavy machine gun. A Red Army staff car was also based on th e Ford Model-A in the pre-war period. During World War II Gorki pr oduced the GAZ-60 — a hybrid ha lf-track personnel carrier that combined the GAZ-63 chassi s. In the late 1940s the plant switched to production of an amphibious carrier — The GAZ- 46. This was a standard GA Z-69 chassis with a U.S. quarter-ton amphibious body. In the mid-1950s Gorki produced the GAZ-47 armored amphibious cargo carrier with space for nine men. Its en g ine was the GAZ-61, a 74-horse p ower For d -t yp e 6-c y linder in-line"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"gasoline engine — the basic Gorki engine. In the 1960s and 1970s producti on continued with an impr oved version of the BAZ-47 armored cargo carrier, usi ng a GAZ-53 V-8 type engine developing 115 horsepower. In brief, the Ford-Gorki plan t has a continuous hi story of production of armored cars and wheeled vehicles for Soviet ar my use: those used against th e United States in Korea and Vietnam. In addition to armored cars, the Ford-Gorki factory manufactures a ra nge of truck-mounted weapons. This series began in the early thirties with a 76.2-millimeter field howitzer mounted on the Ford-GAZ Mode l-A truck. Two similar weapon s from Gorki before World War II were a twin 25-milli meter antiaircraft machine gun and a quad 7.62-millimeter Maxim antiaircraft machine gun — also m ounted on the Ford-GAZ truck chassis. During World War II Gorki produced several ro cket-launchers mounted on trucks. First the 12-rail, 300-millimeter launc her; then, from 1944 onwar ds, the M-8, M-13, and M-31 rocket-launchers mounted on GAZo63 trucks. (T he GAZ-63 is an obvious direct copy of the U.S. Army's 21/2-ton truck.) Also during World War II Gorki produced the GAZ-203, 85- horsepower engine for the SU-76 self-p ropelled gun produced at Uralmashzavod. (Uralmash was designed and equipped by American and German companies.) After World War II Gorki produc tion of rocket-launchers continued with the BM-31, which had twelve 300-millimeter t ubes mounted on a GAZ-63 truck chassis. In the late 1950s another model was produced with twelve 140-millimeter tube s on a GAZ-63 truck chassis. In the 1960s yet another model with eight 140-millimeter tube was produced on a GAZ-63 chassis. Finally, in 1964 Gorki produced the first Soviet wire-guided missile antitank system. This consisted of four rocket-launchers mounted on a GAZ-69 chassis. These weapons turned up in Israel in the late 1960s. The GAZ-69 chassis produced at Gorki is also widely used in the Soviet Army as a command vehicle and scout car. Soviet airborne troops use it as a tow for the 57-millimeter antitank gun and the 14.5-millimeter double-ba rrelled antiaircraft gun. Other Gorki vehicles used by the Soviet milit ary include the GAZ-69 truck, used for towing the 107-millimeter recoilless rifle (RP-107), the GAZ-46, or S oviet jeep, and the GAZ-54, a 1 1/2-ton military cargo truck. In brief, the Gorki plant, built by the Fo rd Motor Company the Austin Company and modernized by numerous other U.S. companie s under the policy of \"peaceful trade,\" is today a major producer of Soviet army vehicles and weapons carriers. The A. J. Brandt-ZIL Plant A technical assistance agreement was conc luded in 1929 with the Arthur J. Brandt Company of Detroit for the reorganization and expansion of the tsarist AMO truck plant, previously equipped in 1917 with new U.S. equipment. Design work for this expansion was handled in Brandt's Detroit of fice and plant and American engi neers were sent to Russia. The AMO p lant was a g ain ex p anded in 1936 b y the Budd Com p an y and Hamilton Foundr y"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and its name was changed to ZIS (now ZIL). During World War II the original equipment was removed to establis h the URALS plant and the ZIS plant was re-estab lished with Lend- Lease equipment. The first armored vehicle produced at AMO was an adaptati on of the civilian ZIL-6 truck produced after the Brandt reorganization in 1930. This vehicle was converted into a mount for several self-propelled weapons, including the single 76.2-millimete r antiaircraft gun and the 76.2-millimeter antitank gun. In World War II the ZI L-6 was adapted for the 85-millime ter antitank and an tiaircraft guns, quadruple 7.62 Maxims, and several self-propell ed rocket-launchers, including the M-8 36- rail, 80-millimeter, and the Katyusha m odel M-13/A 16-rail, 130- millimeter rocket- launcher. In the immediate postwar peri od the ZIL-150 truck chassis wa s used as a mount for the model M-13 rocket-launcher and the ZIL-151 truck was used as a mount for the M-31 rocket-launcher. In addition, the ZIL-151 tr uck was used as a prime mover for the 82- millimeter gun. In 1953 the ZIL-151 truck was adapted for several other weapons, including the BM-24, 240-millimeter, 12-tube rocket-l auncher; the RM-131-millimeter , 32-tube rocket-launcher; the BM-14, 140-millimeter, 16-tube rocket-launcher, and the 20 0-millimeter, 4-tube rocket- launcher. In the 1960s the ZIL-157 truck became a mount for the GOA-SA-2 antiaircraft missile, and a prime mover for another rocket system. The ZIL plant has also produced unarmored car go and troop vehicles for the Soviet Army. In 1932 the ZIL-33 was developed; an unarmored half-track used as a troop carrier. In 1936 the ZIL-6 was developed as a half-track and during World War II the ZIL-42 was developed as a 21/2-ton tracked weapons carrier. In th e postwar period the ZI L-151 truck chassis was adapted for the BTR-152 armore d troop carrier. In the 1950s th e ZIL-485 was developed; a replica of the American DUKW mounted on a ZIL-151 truck, and followed by an improved DUKW mounted on a ZIL-157 truck. From 1954 onwards new versions of the BTR-152 were adde d, based on the ZIL-157 truck. In the 1960s a new BTR-60 (8 x 8) amphibious personnel carrier was de veloped with a ZIL- 375 gasoline engine. Other ZIL vehicles are also us ed for military purposes. For ex ample the ZIL-111 is used as a radar and computer truck fo r antiaircraft systems and as a tow for the M-38 short 122- millimeter howitzer The ZIL-111 is copied from Studebaker 6 x 6 trucks supplied under Lend-Lease. There is a great deal of interc hangeability between the military and civilian versions of the ZIL family of vehicles. For example, an article in Ordnance states: In the 1940s the ZIL-151, a 21/2-ton 6 x 6 was the work horse of the Soviet Army. It was replaced in the 1950s by the ZIL-157, an apparent product im p roved version. In the 1960s, howe ver, this vehicle class re q uirement was"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"met by the ZIL-131, a 31/2-ton 6 x 6 vehicle, essentially a military design. It is of interest to note that a civilian version was mark eted as the ZIL-130 in a 4 x 2 configuration. Over 60 percent of the components in the military version are common to the civilian vehicle. Thus the ZIL plant, originally designed and rebui lt under the supervision of the A. J. Brandt Company of Detroit in 1930 and equipped by other Americ an companies, was again expanded by Budd and Hamilton Foundry in 19;36. Rebuilt with Lend-Lease equipment and periodically updated with late model imports, ZIL has had a long and continuous history of producing Soviet military cargo trucks and weapons carriers. On April 19, 1972, the U.S. Navy photogra phed a Russian freight er bound for Haiphong with a full load of militar y cargo, including a deck load of ZIL-130 cargo tr ucks and ZIL- 555 dump trucks (Human Events, May 13, 1972). Thus the \"peacef ul trade\" of the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, 1960s and the 1970s was used to kill Americans in Vietnam, and commit genocide in Afghanistan. The original 1930 equipment was removed from ZIL in 1944 and used to build the Miass plant. It was replac ed by Lend-Lease equipment, was supplemented by equipment imports in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The Urals plant at Miass (known as Urals ZIS or ZIL) was bu ilt in 1944 and largely tooled with equipment evacauted form the Moscow ZIL plant. The Urals Miass plant started production with the Urals-5 light truck, utilizing an engine wi th the specifications of the 1920 Fordson (original Ford Motor Company equipment supplied in the late 1920s was used, supplemented by Lend-Lea se equipment). The Urals pl ant today produces weapons models: for example, a prime mover for guns, including the long-range 130-millimeter cannon, and two versions — tracked and wheeled — of a 12-ton prime mover. Possibly there may have been doubt as to Soviet end-use of truck plants back in the 20s and ;30s, but the above information certainl y was known to Washington at least by the mid 1960s when this author's firs t volume was published. The next chapter presents official Washington's suicidal reaction to this information, under pressure from the deaf mute blindmen.

Under intense political pressure from the deaf mute blindmen, U.S. politicians, particularly in the Johnson and Nixon administrations unde r the prodding of Henr y Kissinger (a long- time employee of the Rockefeller family), allowed the Togliatti (Volgograd) and Kama River plants to be built. The Volgograd automobile plant, built between 1968 and 1971, ha s a capacity of 600,000 vehicles per year, three times more than th e Ford-built Gorki plan t, which up to 1968 had been the largest auto plant in the USSR. Although Volgograd is described in Western literature as the \"T ogliatti plant\" or the \"Fiat- Soviet auto plant,\" and does indeed produce a ve rsion of the Fiat-124 sedan, the core of the technology is American. Three-qua rters of the equipment, incl uding the key transfer lines and automatics, came from the Un ited States. It is truly extr aordinary that a plant with known military potential could have been equippe d from the United States in the middle of the Vietnamese War, a war in which the No rth Vietnamese receive d 80 percent of their supplies from the Soviet Union. The construction contract, awar ded to Fiat S.p.A., a firm cl osely associated with Chase Manhattan Bank, included an engineering fee of $65 million. The agre ement between Fiat and the Soviet government included: The supply of drawing and engineeri ng data for two automobile models, substantially similar to the Fiat t ypes of current produc tion, but with the modifications required by the particular climatic and road conditions of the country; the supply of a complete ma nufacturing plant project, with the definition of the machine to ols, toolings, control appa ratus, etc.; the supply of the necessary know-how, personnel training, plant start-up assistance, and other similar services. All key machine tools and transfer lines came fr om the United States. While the tooling and fixtures were designed by Fiat , over $50 million worth of the key special equipment came from U.S. suppliers. This included: 1. Foundr y machines and heat-treatin g e q ui p ment, mainl y flask and core"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"molding machines to produce cast ir on and aluminum parts and continuous heat-treating furnaces. 2. Transfer lines for engine parts, including four lines for pistons , lathes, and grinding machines for engine crank-sh afts, and boring and honing machines for cylinder linings and shaft housings. 3. Transfer lines and mach ines for other components, including transfer lines for machining of differen tial carriers and housing, au tomatic lathes, machine tools for production of gears, transmissi on sliding sleeves, splined shafts, and hubs. 4. Machines for body parts, including body panel presses, sheet straighteners, parts for painting installations, a nd upholstery processing equipment. 5. Materials-handling, maintenance, a nd inspection equipment consisting of overhead twin-rail Webb-type conveyors, assembly and storage lines, special tool 'sharpeners for automatic machines, and inspection devices. Some equipment was on the U.S. Export Control and Co-Corn lists as strategic, but this proved no setback to the Johnson Administrati on: the restrictions were arbitrarily abandoned. Leading U.S. machine-tool firms participated in supplying the equipment: TRW, Inc. of Cleveland supplie d steering linkages; U.S. Industr ies, Inc. supplied a \"major portion\" of the presses; Gleason Works of Ro chester, New York (well known as a Gorki supplier) supplied gear-cutti ng and heat-treating equipm ent; New Britain Machine Company supplied automatic la thes. Other equipment was s upplied by U.S. subsidiary companies in Europe and some came directly from European firms (for example, Hawker- Siddeley Dynamics of the United Kingdom supplied six i ndustrial robots). In all, approximately 75 percent of the production equipment came fr om the United States and some 25 percent from Italy and other countri es in Europe, including U.S. subsidiary companies. In 1930, when Henry Ford undertook to build th e Gorki plant, contem porary Western press releases extolled the peaceful nature of the Ford automobile, even though Pravda had openly stated that the Ford au tomobile was wanted for milita ry purposes. Notwithstanding naive Western press releases, Gork i military vehicles were later used to help kill Americans in Korea and Vietnam. In 1968 Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow once ag ain extolled the peacef ul nature of the automobile, specifically in reference to the Volgograd plant. Unfortunately for the credibility of Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow, there exists a proven military vehicle with an engine of the same capacity as the one produced at the Volgograd plant. Moreover, we have the Gorki and ZIL experience. Further, the U. S. government's own co mmittees have stated in writing and at de tailed length that any motor vehicle plant has war potential. Even further, both Rusk and Rostow made expl icit statements to Congress denying that Volgograd had military potential. It must be noted that these Executive Branch st atements were made in the face of clear and known evidence to the contrary. In other words, the statements can only be considered as deliberate falsehoods to mislead Con g ress and the American p ublic."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"It was argued by Washington politicia ns that a U.S. jeep engine is more powerful than the engine built at Togliatti. The engine is indeed about two-thirds as powerful as the jeep engine, but a proven vehicle of excellent capabilities utiliz ing a 1,500 cc. 4-cylinder Opel engine developing 36 horsepower : this same engine later powered the Moskvitch-401 and the Moskvitch-402 (Moskva) military cross- country 4-wheel driv e version of the 401, produced at the MZMA in Moscow. In brief, there already existed a tested and usable military ve hicle capable of transporting men or adaptable for weapons use and powered by a !,500 cc. engine, the same size as the engine supplied for Toglia tti. Therefore statements by U.S. officials to the effect that the Togliatti plant has no military capabilities are erroneous. Military possibilities for such a small engine include use in a special-purpose small military vehicle (like the Americ an jeep), or as a propulsive unit in a specially de signed vehicle for carrying either personnel or weapons. Soviet stra tegy is currently toward supply of wars of \"national liberation.\" The Togliatti vehicle is an excellent replacemen t for the bicycle used in Vietnam. The GAZ-46 is the Soviet version of the U.S. j eep, and we know that such a vehicle figures in Sovi et strategic thinking. The War Potential of the Kama Truck Plant Up to 1968 American construc tion of Soviet military truc k plants was presented as \"peaceful trade.\" In the late 1960s Soviet planne rs decided to build th e largest truck factory in the world. This plant, spread over 36 square miles situated on the Kama River, has an annual output of 100,000 multi-axle 10-ton trucks, trailers, and off-the-road vehicles. It was evident from the outset, given absence of Sovi et technology in the au tomotive industry, that the design, engineering work, and key equipment for such a facility would have to come from the United States. In 1972, under President Nixon and National Security Adviser He nry Kissinger, the pretense of \"peaceful trade\" was abandoned and the Department of Commerce admitted (Human Events, Dec. 1971) that the proposed Kama pl ant had military potential. Not only that, but according to a department spokesma n, the military capability was taken into account when the export licenses were issued for Kama. The following American firms received major contracts to supply pr oduction equipment for the gigantic Kama heavy truck plant: Glidden Machine & Tool, Inc., Nort h Tonawanda, New York — Milling machines and other machine tools.

The concept original ly came from National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, who reportedly sold President Nixon on the idea that giving military technology to the Soviets would temper their globa l territorial ambitions. How Henr y arrived at th is gigantic non sequitur is not known. Su fficient to state that he arous ed considerable concern over his motivations. Not least that Henr y had been a paid family empl oyee of the Rockefellers since 1958 and has served as International Advi sory Committee Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, a Rockefeller concern. The U.S.-Soviet trade accords including Kama and other proj ects were signed by George Pratt Shultz, later to become Secretary of State in the Re agan Administration and long known as a proponent of more aid and trade to the Soviets. Shul tz is former President of Bechtel Corporation, a multi-national contractor and engineering firm. American taxpayers underwrote Kama financ ing through the Export-Import Bank. The head of Export-Import Bank at that time was William J. Casey, a former associate of Armand Hammer and now (1985) Direct or of the Central Intellig ence Agency. Financing was arranged by Chase Manhattan Bank, whose then Ch airman was David Rockefeller. Chase is the former employer of Paul Volcker, now Ch airman of the Federal Reserve Bank. Today, William Casey denies knowledge of the military applica tions (see page 195), although this was emphatically pointed out to official Washington 15 years ago. We cite these names to demonstrate the tight interlocking hold proponents of miltiary aid to the Soviet Union maintain on t op policy making govern ment positions. On the other hand, critics of se lling U.S. military technology ha ve been ruthlessly silenced and suppressed. Critics of Kama Silenced and Su pp ressed"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"For two decades rumors have surfaced that crit ics of aid to the Sovi et Union have been silenced. Back in the 1930s General Electric wa rned its employees in the Soviet Union not to discuss their work in the US SR under penalty of dismissal. In the 1950s and 1960s IBM fired engineers w ho publicly opposed sale of IBM computers to the USSR. Let's detail two cases for the record; obviously this topic requires Congressional investigation. At some point the American public needs to know who has suppressed this information, and to give these peri sons an opportunity to defend thei r actions in public. The most publicized case is that of La wrence J. Brady, now Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Administration. Ten years a go Brady was a strong critic of exporting the Kama River truck technology. In his own words (in 1982 befo re a Senate Investigating Committee) is Brady's view on Kama River. Mr. Brady : Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege fo r me to be here again. I have testified before this subcommittee previous ly. As a matter of fact, it is 3 years ago this month that I testified over on the House side befo re the House Armed Services Committee in which I disagreed with the political appointees of the Carter administration and indicated that the technology which we were licensing to the Soviet Union, specifical ly for the Kama Rive r plant, was being diverted to the Soviet mili tary. It is 10 years ago this month that the President of the United States inaugurated the er a of detente with a trip to Moscow. A central component of that historic tr ip was the hope that greatly expanded trade ties between the East and the West would lead to mutual cooperation and understanding. Obviously, those hopes have not taken place . In that 10-year period, as we in the administration have indicated in the last year, we have been exploited both legally and illegally by the Soviet Un ion and Eastern Eur ope. This technology which has helped the Soviet immensely in their military industrial infrastruture. Again, 3 years ago, I person ally disclosed the fail ures of the Commerce Department in the licensing process, referring to it, as I said in my testimony, as a shambles. 12 Brady went on to note that his reward for surfacing vital information was criticism and suppression. Chairman Roth [presiding]: Thank you, Mr. Brady. Mr. Brady, the members of the subcommittee are, of course, aware of your pe rsonal commitment to this important area, but | believ e it is important that the record reflect fully your position on the specific question of export technology and particularly reference the efforts some years ago to help the Soviet Union construct some trucking facilities. Would you, for the purposes of the record, explain your role in this matter? Mr. Brad y : Mr. Chairman, about 3 y ears a g o, the Ex p ort Administration Act"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"was up for review for extension. As pa rt of that review, the House Armed Services Committee decided that it was going to hold hearings on that extension, in addition to the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, namely the Foreign Affairs Committee on the House side. There were some statements be ing made on both sides in C ongress that were not totally consistent with the facts. We had intelligence information that trucks were being produced at the Kama River plant for th e Soviet military and, in fact , being distributed to Eastern Europe for use in East European endeavors. An administration witness was asked about that and denied it. I was asked about it and confirmed it. And, as a re sult of that, I was labeled a whis tleblower and eventually left the Department of Commerce. In poi nt of fact, that was the tip of the iceberg. There had been apparently intelligence through the 1970s, partic ularly the latter half of the seventies, indicating that there was substantial diversio n taking place (and) . . . for some reason the intelligence just didn't get to the top. So th at was my role. I eventually had to leave Government for it. 13 However, Mr. Brady was unaware of a similar and much earlier story of suppression in the Kama case which paralleled his own. In the years 1960-1974 this writer auth ored a three volume series, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, published between 1968 and 197:3 by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where the author was Research Fellow. This series cataloged the origins of Soviet technology fr om 1917 down to the early 1970s. The series excluded the military aspect s of technical transfers. However, the work totally contradicted U.S. Government public statements. For exampl e, in 1963 State Department claimed in its public pronouncements that all Soviet technology was indigenous , a clear misunderstanding or dismissal of the facts. By the early 1970s it was clear to this author that a significant pa rt of Soviet military capability also came from the West, even though this assessmen t was also refuted by U.S. government analysts. Quietly, without govern ment or private funding, this author researched and wrote National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union. The manuscript was accepted by Arlington House. Both author and publisher maintained absolute silence about the existence of the ma nuscript until publication date. When news of publication reached Stanford , there was immediate reaction — a hostile reaction. A series of meetings was called by Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Cam pbell. Campbell's objectives were: 1) to withdraw the book from publication, 2) failing that, to disassoci ate Hoover Institution from the book and the author. Campbell initially claimed that National Suicide was a plagiarism of the author's works published by Hoover. This was shown to be nonsense. In any event an author can hardly plagiarize himself. The objectiv e, of course, was to persua de author and publisher to withhold p ublication. Both the author and Arlin g ton House refused to withdraw the book"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and continued with publication. The book was published and sold over 50,000 copies. After the unsuccessful attempt at suppression Glenn Campbell arbitrarily removed the title Research Fellow from the author and removed bot h his name and that of his secretary from the personnel roll of the Hoover Instituti on. This effectively disassociated Hoover Institution from the book and it s contents. The author became a non-person. Two years later the author voluntarily left Hoover Instituti on and assumed a private role unconnected with any research foundation or orga nization. These events happened some years before Mr. Brady of Commerce took his own personal stand and suffered a similar fate. By a strange quirk of fate, Gl enn Campbell is today Chairman of Mr. Reagan's Intelligence Oversight Committee. Who were the Deaf Mute Bl indmen at Kama River? Clearly, the Nixon Administrati on at the highest levels produced more than a normal number of deaf mutes — those of ficials who knew the story of our assistance to the Soviets but for their own reasons were willing to push forward a policy that could only work to the long run advantage of the United States. It is paradoxical that an Administration that was noisy in its public anti-commu nist stance, and quick to point out the human cost of the Soviet system, was also an Administration th at gave a gigantic boost to Soviet military truck capacity. Possibly campaign contribut ions had something to do with it. Multina-tionals listed below as prime contractors on Kama Ri ver were also major political contributors. However, the significant link never explored by Congress is that Henry Kissinge r, the key promoter of the Kama River truck plant at the policy level, was a former and long-time employee of the Rockefeller family — and the Rockefellers are the largest single shareholders in Chase Manhattan Bank (David was then Chairman of the Board) and Chase was the lead financier for Kama River . This is more than the much cr iticised \"revolving door.\" It is close to an arm's length relationship, i.e., the use of public policy for private ends.

The industrial revolution of the late 18th and 19t h centuries was based on canals and iron. Railroads were a fundame ntal innovation of the fi rst third of the 19th century. In the late 19th century the Bessemer process enabled ma ss production of cheap steel. The internal combustion engine in the 190 0s began another revolution. Atomic energy in the 1940s started the atomic age. In the 1970s the semi-conductor was first mass produced in California. The economy of the 21st century will evolve around the silicon chip, i.e., the integrat ed circuit memory chip and semi-conductor components. No country large or small will make any progress in the late 20th century without an ability to manufacture integrated circui ts and associated devices. These are the core of the new industrial revolution, both civilian and military, and e ssentially the same device is used for both military and civilian end uses. A silicon chip is a sili con chip, except that military quality requirements may be more strict than civilian ones. This electronic revolution originated in Sa nta Clara Valley, California in the 1950s and roughly centers around Stanford University. Stanford is also in many ways at the core of the debate over transfer of our military technology to the Soviet Uni on. Congressman Ed Zschau (Re p. Menlo Park) represents the Silicon Valley area and is a str ong proponent of more aid to the Soviets. On the other hand, also in Silicon Valley, this author's six books critical of our technological transfers to the Soviets originated, and three were published at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University (See Bibliography for titles). Silicon Valley gets its name from the essential element silicon used in integrated circuits. An essential component of inte grated circuits is the semi-c onductor usually made of silicon and linked to other components such as transist ors into a single circuit. By 1971 an entire computer could be produced on a single chip, in itself probably the most significant industrial breakthrough since the discovery that steel could be manufactured on a large scale from iron."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The semi-conductor revolution be gan in the Silicon Valley and was a challenge to the socialist world to duplicate. Th is they could not do. Every sing le Soviet weapon system has semi-conductor technology which originated in California and whic h has been bought, stolen or acquired from the United States. Early Soviet Electr onic Acquisitions Back in 1929 Pravda commented that without the autom obile the Soviet Army would be helpless in any future war. Western multinationals Ford Motor Company, Hercules Gear, IBM and others helped USSR bridge the gap of the 1920s. Identical aid can be found for electronics. In August 1971 the U.S. Department of Defense paid $2 million to Hamilton Watch Company for precision watchmaking equipmen t. Watchmaking equipment is used in fabricating bomb and artillery sh ell fuses, aircraft timing gear , pinions, and similar military components. Most Soviet watch-manufac turing equipment has been supplied from the United States and Swit zerland; in some cases the Soviets use copies of these foreign machines. In 1929 the old Miemza concession factory, formerly a ts arist plant, received the complete equipment of the Ansonia Clock Compan y of New York, purchased for $500,000. This became the Second State Watch Factory in Moscow , brought into production by American and German engineers, and adapted to military products. In 1920 the complete Deuber-Ham pton Company plant at Canton, Ohio, was transferred to the Soviet Union, and brought into production by forty American technicians. Up to 1930 all watch components used in the Soviet Union had been importe d from the United States and Switzerland. This new U.S.-origin manufacturing capability made possible the production of fuses and precisi on gears for military purposes; during World War II it was supplemented by Lend-Leas e supplies and machinery. After World War II Soviet adva nces in military instrument ation were based on U.S. and British devices, although the German contribution was heavy in the 1950s. About 65 percent of the production facilities removed from Germany were for the manufacture of power and lighting equipment, telephone, tele graph, and communications equipment, and cable and wire. The remainder consisted of German plants to manufacture ra dio tubes and radios, and military electronics facilities for such items as secret teleprinters and anti- aircraft equipment. Many German wartime military electronic de velopments were made at the Reichpost Forschungsinstitut (whose direct or later went to the USSR) and these developments were absorbed by the Soviets, incl uding television, infrared devices, radar, electrical coatings, acoustical fuses, and similar equipment. But although 80 percen t of the German electrical and military electronics indu stries were removed, the Sovi ets did not acquire modern computer, control instrumentation, or electr onic technologies from Germany: these they acquired from the U.S. Brid g in g the Semi-conductor Ga p"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Taking semi-conductors as an example, three st ages can be identified in the transfer process. The Soviets were ab le to import or manufacture sm all laboratory quantities of semi-conductors from an early date. What they could not do, as in many other technologies, was mass produce components with high quality char acteristics. This si tuation is described by Dr. Lara Baker, a Soviet com puter expert, before Congress: The Soviet system in prep roduction can manage to pro duce a few of almost any product they want, provided th ey are willing to devote the resources to it. The best example of this would be the Soviet 'civilian' space program, in which they managed to put people in orbit before th e United States did, but at a high cost. In the area of serial production, that is, the day to day production of large quantities of a product, th e differences between the two systems become most obvious. Serial production is th e Achilles heel of the S oviet bloc. Especially in high technology areas, the bi g problem the Soviets have is quality assurance they count products, not quality products. This is the area where the Soviets exhibit weakness and need the most help. 14 The first phase for the Soviets was to Identify the technology needed, in this case a semi- conductor plant, to bridge the chasm between the 19th century and the 21st century. The second phase was to obtain the equipment to establish a manufacturing plant. The third phase was to bring this plant into pr oduction and make the best use of its output in an economy where developmental engineering re sources do not exist in depth and military objectives have absolute priority. We shall demonstrate in Chapter Five how the Soviets achieved the first of these tasks — with the help of the Control Data Corpora tion, Mr. William Norris, Chairman. The second phase was achieved through an illegal espionage network, the Bruchhausen network. The third phase is today in progress, although the pha ses one and two are alr eady in place in the Soviet military complex. The emphasis in this critical transfer of semi-conductor technology was not reverse engineering as, for example, th e Soviet Agatha computer is reverse engineered from the Apple II computer, but use of U.S. manufacturing techniques and equipment to bridge a gigantic gap in Soviet engine ering capabilities. The Soviet system does not generate the wealth of technology common in the West. It cannot choose the most efficient among numerous methods of achieving a technical objective because th e Marxist system lacks the abundant fruits of an enterprise system. The emphasis in semi-conductors is transfer of a complete manufacturing technology to produce high quality products for known military end uses WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES, WITHOUT FUNDAMENTA L CHANGES IN THEIR SYSTEM. In brief, in electronics th e key is not copying Western technology as for example the Caterpillar tractor was duplicat ed by the millions, but to tr ansfer specialized production equipment to mass produce critical components. This assertion has been fully supported by expert witnesses before Congressional committees. For exam p le, the followin g statement was made in 1952 to the Senate b y Dr."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Stephen D. Bryen, Deputy Assi stant Secretary of Defense, International Economics, Trade and Security Policy. Senator Nunn: Dr. Bryen, you made reference in your testimony to the effort by the Soviets to build and equip a se miconductor plant using equivalent know- how from the United States. Could the Soviets have built and equippe d such a plant in the late 1970s and early 1950s without U.S. machinery, equipment and know-how? Dr. Bryen: My answer is they could not. That doesn't mean that equipment necessarily came from this country. It could have been transferred from Europe or elsewhere. In fact, it could have b een transferred from another country that bought that equipment — it could have b een on the secondary market. There is a secondary market in this sort of mach inery. These are terrib ly difficult things to trace. What we know in the first instance is that a lot had to be U.S. equipment, that the system was full of holes, it was porous, it was easy for them to get it and they got it. The microelectronics area has enabled the Soviets to upgrade their military equipment. 15 And a similar comment from a former Russian engineer, Joseph Arkov, again in Senate testimony. By using — not copying — the American high technology products, they move closer to their goal of tec hnical self-sufficiency. Whethe r they will ever become self-sufficient in high tech nology is a debatable point. My own view is that this course of action gives them quick gains, but over the long run, it will result in their being permanently behind the Unit ed States, forever having to rely on American products to manufacture their own. However, being behind us in technology is a relative condition. The Soviets can make progress in a technical sense and, at the same time , trail the United States, but by their standards, they will ha ve achieved much. Their accomplishments will have been made with limited cost to th em because the ba sic research and development will have been paid for by the Americans. To repeat, then, the Soviet strategy in obtaining Amer ican high technology products includes efforts to copy and duplicate, but the Soviets' primary objective is to obtain machin ery which they can use in the manufacture of their own high technology equipment. This distinction — the diff erence between c opying of technology and the use of it — is an important one because it provides the Un ited States with a key insight into which products the Soviets ar e the most anxious to obtain. It also can influence American policymakers in deciding which products the United States can afford to sell th e Soviet Union, and which com p onents should not be"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"sold to them. Soviet strategy in using American pr oducts can be seen in the following illustration. Let us say, for example, that the Soviet s have 100 plants involved in producing components for use in space flight. Each of the plants could use a certain kind of American computer. But they cannot obtain 100 computers; that is, one for each plant. Inst ead, they are able to obtai n three or four American computers of the desired type. They use th e computers as best they can in those three or four plants where they can do the most good. They are not inclined to use them as non-producing models to be studied in a laboratory for the purpose of copying. Moreover, if the American product obtai ned in another transaction — if, for example, the product is a sophisticated oven used in the heating of microchips — then they are even less interested in copying or imitating. They will use the oven to produce microchips. There is no civilian use for equipment used to manufacture integrated circuits or semi-conductors. 16 How the Deaf Mute Blindmen Helped the Soviets into the 21st Century With these insights into Soviet technological acquisition strate gy we can identi fy the stages by which the Soviets acquire d semi-conductor technology. Chronologically these are: DATE EVENT 1951 Semi-conductor developed in Santa Clara Valley, California. From this point on Soviets import chips and then manufacture on a laboratory scale. 1971 \"Computer in a chip\" development. Soviets still unable to mass produce even primitive semi- conductor devices. 1973 Control Data Corporati on (CDC) agrees to supply Soviets with a wide range of scientific and engineering information including construction and design of a large fast computer (75 to 100 million instructions per second is fast even in 1985) and manufacturing techniques for semi-conductors and associated technologies (See Chapter Five). 1977-80 Soviets acquire technology for a semi-conductor plant through the Bruchhausen network and Continental Trading Corp. (CTC). The CDC agreement gives Soviets suff icient information to set up a purchasing and espion age program. CDC told the Soviets what they needed to buy. 1981-82 Commerce Department lax in enforcing export control regulations. U.S. Customs Service makes"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The Bruchhausen Network The second phase of the ac quisition of semi-conductor ma ss production technology was the Bruchhausen network. This network comprised a syndica te of 20 or so \"front\" elec tronics companies established by Werner J. Bruchhausen, ag e 34, a West German national. The key component was a group of companies with the initials CTC (C ontinental Trading Corporation), managed by Anatoli Maluta, a Russian-born naturalized U.S. citizen. A Congre ssional subcommittee devoted considerable time and resources to re construction of the activities of the CTC- Maluta operation. This network of companies, controlled fr om West Germany, gave the Soviets the technology for a major leap forward in moderniz ing military electronics capability. Dr. Lara H. Baker, Jr., who had pers onal knowledge of the CTC-Malu ta case, was one of the subcommittee's sources in reconstructing the network. Other sources included the Departments of Commerce and Justic e and the U.S. Customs Service. Using Werner Bruchhausen's co mpanies and accomplices in Western Europe as freight forwarders and transshipment points, Maluta sent more than $10 mil lion of American-made high technology equipment to th e Soviet Union from 1977 to 1980. the machinery was used to equip a Soviet plant for the manufacture and testing of semiconductors. The equipment went from California to West ern Europe to the USSR. To Dr. Baker, the CTC-Maluta case proved a point: that the Soviet s know precisely what U.S. technology they want, and leave li ttle to chance. Dr. Baker explained: Of particular interest to me in the (CTC -Maluta) case is the information it gives us about Soviet intentions . We delude ourselves if we think the Soviets enter the black market in search of strategic components in a helter-skelter style, buying up dual-use commodities without rhyme or reason. The truth of the matter is that the S oviets and their surroga tes buy nothing they don't have specific, well defined needs for. They know exactly what they want — right down to the model number — and wh at they want is part of a carefully crafted desi g n. determined efforts to st op export of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment. 1985 Soviets establish plant for semi-conductor mass production. Soviet military equipment based on this new output. 1986 U.S. taxpayer continues to support a defense budget of over $300 billion a year. Without these transfers Soviet military could not have been computerised and U.S. defense budget reduced."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The carefully crafted design in this instance was a semi-c onductor manufacturing plant, an essential part of the Soviet need to close the technological gap between themselves and the U.S. in the integrated circuit/microcomputer industry. We shall see in Chapter Five how Control Data Corporation provide d the key basic information on what to acquire. Dr. Baker, who testified in the 1981 successful prosecution of Maluta and his associate, Sabina Dorn Tittel, studied 400 separate air waybills and other shipping documents used by the CTC network. The conclusion was inescapable that the Soviets we re equipping a semi- conductor plant. Soviet use of components of U.S. origin dem onstrated their determination to make the facility as efficient and modern as any in the world: ...(the Soviets) have purchased clandest inely all the hardwa re they need for equipping a good integrated ci rcuit production plant. Th ey showed no interest in purchasing production equipment that wa s not state of the art. They showed very good taste. Stressing the point that, th rough the CTC-Maluta combine, the Soviets bought everything needed for a semi-conductor manf acturing plant, Dr. Baker test ified to the Senate that among the equipment bought in the period 1977 through 1980 were saws for cutting silicon crystals, equipment for making ma sks for integrated circuit pr oduction, plotters to draw the circuits, basic computer-aided design systems for integrated circuit design, diffusion ovens for circuit production ion-impl antation systems for circui t production, photo-lithographic systems for integrated circuit production, scribe rs for separating integrated circuits on wafers, testers for testing integrated circ uits on wafers, bonding equipment for bonding connecting leads to integrated circuits, and pa ckaging equipment for packaging the circuits. Dr. Baker added: High quality integrated circuits are the basis of modern military electronics. Integrated circuits form the basis for military system s which are more flexible, more capable and more reliable than systems us ing discrete electronic components. The production tooling a nd equipment obtained by the Soviets (from the CTC-Maluta network) will significantly improve the Soviets' capability to produce such circuits. Further support for the asserti on that the Soviets relied on American technology to equip their semi-conductor plant came from John D. Mars hall, a chemist and speci alist in facilities that manufacture semiconductors. Marshall owns a high technology busin ess in Silicon Vall ey and testified to Congress that in the winter of 1975 he made tw o trips to the Soviet Union. Led by a West German named Richard Mueller to believe that the Soviets wanted to retain his consultative services in connection with their plans to manufact ure electronic watches, Marshall learned on the second trip to Moscow that what was actua lly wanted was expertise to equip a semi- conductor plant. Marshall told the subcommittee: On the second trip, we met several S oviets who purported to be technical people. They were not very well trained and we re not familiar with sophisticated technological thinking. But it was apparent to me by the questions the y asked and the sub j ects the y discussed that the Soviets had built a semi-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"conductor manfuacturing and assembly plan t and they were anxious to equip it. They wanted American semi-conductor manufacturing equipment and they had detailed literature on the precise kind of equipment they wanted. They also wanted me to obtain for them certain semi-conductor components. It was clear to me that Mueller had deceived me as to the Soviets' intentions, that it was not merely electronic watc hes the Soviets wanted to manufacture. Marshall realized that to cooper ate further with the Soviets woul d be illegal. He refused to meet further with the Soviets and left Moscow. As he returned to the United States, Marshall recalled convers ations he had overheard that at the time had not made.sense to him on th e way to Moscow. Marshall and Mueller had stopped in Hamburg where Mueller introduced hi m to a Canadian, also providing technical assistance to the Soviets, that his mission was to show them how to make integrated circuits and to use equipment now on the way. In Moscow, Marshall said, he met a woman who spoke Englis h with a German accent who planned to ship certain Amer ican-made photolithography materi als to the Soviet Union via East Berlin. Photolithography materials are critical in semi-conductor manufacture. In West Germany, Marshall wa s introduced to Volker Nast, identified by Mueller as his partner. Nast was involved in il legal diversions of the U.S. technology to the Soviet Union. The significance of 1975 as the year the Soviets expressed th eir desire for American-made semi-conductor equipment has been explai ned by Marshall. In 1975 the U.S. was preeminent in the field of semi- conductor technology. Marshall said: It is my view that the S oviets had built their manufactu ring plant, or plants, to specifications for American -made equipment — for th e manufacture, assembly and testing of integrated ci rcuits. Now that the faciliti es were constructed, they were, in the winter of 1975, confronted with the next step, which was to equip the facilities. According to Marshall, the S oviets' primary interest in 1975 was the manufacture and assembly phases of semi-conductor production. By 1977, he said, the Soviets needed to stock the facility with test equipment, and software development equipment. Dr. Lara Baker, in his testimony before C ongress, agreed with Marshall. In the 1978-79 time frame the CTC-Maluta syndicate purch ased production equipment. In the 1979-1980 period, the CTC-Maluta netw ork bought semi-conductor test equipment. Said Baker, \"Marshall's testimony is quite cons istent with my information.\" U.S. Customs Service investigations conf irmed not only the Bruchhausen network but subsidiary networks operating in cooperation with the Soviets for illegal purchase of semi- conductor manufacturing equipment. Information about the Soviets' efforts to build a semi-conductor industry — and, in so doin g , make a ma j or lea p forward in militar y electronics — was g iven to a Senate"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"subcommittee by Charles L. McLeod, a Special Agent with the U.S. Customs Service. McLeod said the same Richar Mueller who had brought John Ma rshall to Moscow had been active in several other schemes. In fact, McLeod said, Mueller was an operative in a syndica te whose mission was to export by illegal means semi-conductor manufacturing e quipment from the United States to the Soviet Union. Other operatives in the networ k included Volker Na st, Luther Heidecke, Peter Gessner and Frederick Linnhoff, all West Germans. In the U.S ., their associates included Robert C. Johnson, Gera ld R. Starek and Carl E. Storey, office rs in high technology firms. McLeod, of the San Francisco office of U.S. Customs, investigating technology diversions originating in nearby Santa Clara County, said inquiries into two Si licon Valley electronics firms — II Industries and Kaspar Electronics — led to the conc lusion that the Soviets were trying in the mid-1970s to \"cons truct a semi-conductor manufactu ring facility by using U.S. technology and equipment.\" A loosely knit or ganization of electronics producers and brokers in West Germany and Northern California assisted the Soviets. The first diversion of semi-conductor manufact uring equipment occurred in 1974. McLeod said participants in the diversion incl uded Luther Heidecke, a representative of Honeywell/West Germany, AG, and Peter Gessner, the European sales representative for Applied Materials, a Northern Califo rnia firm which produced semi-conductor manufacturing equipment. Gessner had other jobs as well, serving as the European salesman for II Industries and Kaspar Electronics. In addition, Ge ssner was employed by Richard Mueller. Processing orders through Honeywell/West Ge rmany for the purchas e of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Heidecke arranged fo r the export of II I ndustries and Kaspar Electronics machinery to West Germany and ultimately to the Soviet Union. Heidecke's activities came to the attention of the West German authorities, who prosecuted him for giving the Soviet s national security information. McLeod described a second diversion. A Mays Landing, New Jersey export firm known as Semi-Con, formed by a West German Rich ard Mueller and ma naged by a former intelligence agent, shipped semiconductor manuf acturing equipment to the Soviet Union. The equipment was from II Indus tries and Kaspar Electronics. The identification of the Bruc hhausen network does not reflec t favorably upon the operating efficiency of the Commerce Department's Offi ce of Export Control and specifically its Compliance Division. (As the situation exis ted in 1980, it may possibly have improved since that time.) The existence of the CTC netw ork of companies was first br ought to the attention of the U.S. government in 1977 and 1978 when two anonymous letters were received at the American Consulate in Dusseldorf, Germany. Th e State Department tr anslated the letters into English and referred them to the Comp liance Division in Commer ce. The letters were received by the Compliance Division in 1978 a nd no effort was made to investigate the allegations. After recei p t of the letters, two U.S. p roducers of dual-use technolo gy also re p orted to the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Commerce Department that they were susp icious of the CTC co mpanies. Again no Commerce action. A Commerce Department special agent did in terview CTC's principal executive in Los Angeles, the naturalized Russi an-born American citizen Anat oli Maluta, also known as Tony Maluta and Tony Metz. Maluta told the sp ecial agent from Complian ce that he did not know anything about export controls , or the need to have vali dated export licenses to ship certain controlled commodities. However, Maluta said, because of the agent's interest, he would cancel the suspicious order. There was no further investig ation of the CTC network until a second letter arrived at Compliance Division from a nother high-technology producer, also suspicious about the CTC companies. Early in 1980, a second Compliance Division agent, Robert Ri ce, was assigned to the case and conducted a comprehensive preliminary inqui ry. Rice, the most senior agent in the Division, found considerable information indi cating widespread violations of export controls. The evidence went to the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles in March 1980. A major inquiry wa s begun by the U.S. Attorney's office, under the direction of Assistant U.S. Attorney Theodore W. Wu and the U.S. Customs Services. Customs ultimately assigned about 15 agents to the case in California, Texas, New York, and Western Europe. Compliance Division Spec ial Agent Rice was the only Commerce Department representative assigned to the case on a regular basis. Indictments were brought agai nst Bruchhausen and Dietmar Ulrichshofer, both of whom remained in Europe out of reach, and two Lo s Angeles associates — Maluta and Sabina Dorn Tittel. Maluta and Tittel were convicted. The CTC case demonstrated tech nology diversions of about $10 million and is considered by law enforcement and national security speci alists one of the mo st important export control cases ever brought to trial. The inquiry showed that: First, the Compliance Divisi on did not move quickly to establish the value of the anonymous letters. Second, the Compliance Division did not connec t the anonymous letters to the allegations reported by two U.S. manufacturers. Third, when Compliance Division Agent Rice tu rned over the results of his inquiry to Assistant U.S. Attorney Wu in Los Angeles, it was apparent to Wu that considerable expenditures of resources woul d be needed. Trained investig ators would be required to conduct interviews, evaluate sh ipping documents, surveil suspec ted violators, and carry out other aspects of a traditional law enfo rcement full-scale field investigation. Commerce's contribution to that effort was Ag ent Rice, a competent investigator in whom Wu had confidence. But he needed more than one agent, and enlisted assistance of the Customs Service. Later assistance was provide d by trained criminal i nvestigators from the IRS. Fourth, at an earl y p oint in the in q uir y it was necessar y to seize shi p ments. Commerce had"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"neither the authority nor the manpower to seize shipments. Customs did. Fifth, at another point in the inquiry it was necessary to search the premises of CTC companies and certain of employees in the United States and Europe. The Compliance Division had insufficient resources to im plement simultaneous search warrants. The Compliance Division had no law enforcement capa bilities in Western Eu rope to work with German customs to coordinate searches abroad. Customs executed the warrants in the United States and, through its agreements wi th West German customs, arranged for the execution of warrants in Germany. Sixth, to substitute sand for one of CTC's shipments to Mosc ow, a sizable expenditure of funds was needed. The Complian ce Division balked at the sh ipment substitution strategy and refused to pay the cost of recrating the sand and airfre ight. Customs officials approved of the substitution and ag reed to pay the cost. Seventh, extensive overseas coordination, in addi tion to the search wa rrants, was called for with West German Customs and other overseas law enforcement contacts. Eighth, extensive surveillance was necessary. Armed Customs agents and armed Internal Revenue Service crimin al investigators and an unarmed Compliance Division Special Agent Rice provided this work. Two suspects under surveillance had firearms in the back seat of thei r. car. The firearms were not used. But it was an important la w enforcement advantage for the agents on surveillance to be armed as well. Ninth, experienced supervisors with law enfo rcement background and training were needed to direct the inquiry in the fiel d. The Office of the U.S. Attorn ey for the Central District of California, working with supervisorial pers onnel in the Customs Service, provided the needed direction. Cont act with supervisorial personnel in the Compliance Division, who remained in Washington, was made on the te lephone and the persons who worked on the case in California did not consider such communication to be satisfactory. Tenth, when the appropriate time came to a pprehend Anatoli Maluta and Sabina Dorn Tittle, IRS agents made the arre sts. Customs agents, like the IRS criminal investigators, are authorized to make arrests. Even had the Compliance Di vision dispatched sufficient numbers of agents to assist in the inquiry, they could not have arrested the suspects. The Type of Equipment Shipped to the USSR The Bruchhausen network was extremely effici ent at obtaining the type of equipment needed by the Soviets for their semiconductor plant.

Norris, Chairman Control Data Corporation To make any progress in developing weapons systems the Soviets mu st utilize modern high-speed computers. The computers and the necessary computer technology, both hardware and software, have come from the West, almost exclusiv ely from the United States. At the end of the 1950s the Un ited States had about 5,000 co mputers in use, while the Soviet Union had only about 120. These Soviet computers, as repor ted by well-qualified observers, were technically we ll behind those of the West a nd barely out of the first- generation stage even as late as the 1960s. In the late fifties the Soviets produced about thirty to forty BESM-type computers for research and development work on atomic energy and rockets a nd missiles. In general, the BESM type has most of the feat ures typical of early U.S. co mputers. The original version had 7,000 tubes; the later version had 3,000 tubes and germanium diodes. The only Soviet computer in continuous production in the 1960s was the URAL-I, followed by the URAL-II and URAL -IV modifications of the origin al model. The URAL-I has an average speed of 100 operations per second, compared to 2,500 operations per second on U.S. World War II machines and 15,000 operations per second for large U.S. machines of the 1950s, and 1-10 million oper ations per second common in the early 1970s. Occupying 40 square meters of floor space, URAL-I contains 800 t ubes and 3,000 germanium diodes; its storage units include a ma gnetic drum of 1,024 cells and a magnetic tape of up to 40,000 cells — considerably less than U.S. ma chines of the 1960s. URAL-II and URAL-IV incorporate slightly improve d characteristics. The URAL series is based on U.S. technology. Production methods for both th e URAL and the BESM comp uters were the same as American methods. Until the mid-1960s direct import of computers from th e United States was heavily restricted by export control regulations. In 1965 only $5,000 wort h of electronic computers and parts were shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union, and only $2,000 worth in 1966. This changed in 1967. Computer expor ts increased to $1,079,000 and a higher rate of export of U.S. electronic computers to the U SSR has been maintained to the present time under constant lobbying pressure from U.S. businessmen and their trade associations.

American computer sales as opposed to Soviet theft may be traced from 1959 with sale of a Model-802 National-Elliott so ld by Elliott Automation, Lt d., of the United Kingdom. (Elliott Automation is a subsidiary of General Electric in the United States.) Towards the end of the sixties Soviet purch ases of computers were ste pped up, and by late i969 it was estimated that Western computer sales to all of Communist Eur ope, including the USSR, were running at $40 million annuall y, in great part from European subsidiaries of American companies. In 1964-65 Elliott Automation deli a ;red five Model-503 computers to the USSR, including one for installation in the Moscow Academy of Sc iences. Other General Electric made in Europe machines, for example, a Model-400 made in France by Compagnie des Machines Bull, were also sold to the USSR. Olivetti-General Electric of Milan, Italy has b een a major supplier of GE computers in the USSR. In I967 the Olivetti fi rm delivered $2.4 million worth of data-processing equipment systems to the USSR in addition to Model-400 and Model-115 machines. In sum, General Electric from 1959 onwards sold to the Soviet Uni on through its European subsidiaries a range of its medium-capacity computers. Of perhaps even greater signif icance for the 1960 era were sa les by English Electric, which include third-generati on microcircuit computers utilizi ng Radio Corporation of America technology. In 1967 English Elect ric sold to the USSR its System Four machine with microcircuits; this machine incorporates RCA patent and was similar to the RCA Spectra-70 series. The largest single supplier of computers to th e USSR has been International Computers and Tabulation, Ltd. of the United Kingdom, which also licenses RCA technology, and by 1970 had supplied at least twenty-seven of the thir ty-three large computer s then in Russia. In November I969, for example, fi ve of the firm's 1900-seri es computers (valued at $12 million) went to the USSR. These large high- speed units with integrated circuits were, without question, considerably in advance of an ything the Soviet s were able to manufacture. Such machines were certainly capable of so lving military and sp ace problems. Indeed, a computer cannot distinguish between civilian and military problems. In 1971 the USSR and East Eur opean family of general pur pose computers known as the RYAD series was announced. These are base d substantially on IBM 360 and 370 computers illegally diverted into the USSR . This had an important effect of making available to them a tremendous library of co mputer software that was RYAD compatible. Dr. Baker has commented on th e current RYAD position: In the area of available manpower, one of the seri ous problems afflicting the Soviet economy is the lack of qualified, highly traine d, technical people in the areas of computers and micr oelectronics. One cause of this is the lack of enough computing and electr onic equipment to train th e next generation of scientists and en g ineers.

The Soviets are trying to alleviate this problem by producing large, for them, numbers of RYAD comput ers — copies of the U.S. IBM System 360's and 370's. 17 Soviet Agatha - American Apple II In mid 1983 the Soviets introduced their first personal computer —the AGATHA (a rather curious name for a Russian product). Produced at Zelenograd, outside Moscow, the Agatha was reversed engineered from the APPLE II. Specifications are similar to the APPLE and the components are either Soviet produced from reverse engineered U.S. co mponents or imported and bought openly or clandestinely in Europe or Japan. Officials at the Academy of Pe dagogical Sciences have admitte d that the APPLE II served as a \"prototype\" for the Soviet Agatha. In 1985 COCOM set up some new rules for micr ocomputers and made it legal to export without license low powered 8-bi t computers. Such a machine sells in the West for $100 to $500. The response was a flood of computer manufact urers attempting to make elaborate sales pitches to the multimilli on Soviet microcomputer market. If history is any j udge, the Soviets will buy a few thousand and then attempt to reverse engineer and produce in the Soviet Union. Presumably the microcomputers, although low powered, c ould have military applications and indeed this was openly admitted by a major computer manufacturer (New York Times, February 8, 1985): \"We have no illusions. Some of th ese are headed for the military.\" Military End Use Confirmation of military end use comes fro m unimpeachable sources — Soviet engineers who have worked on copying or reverse engineer ing in the Soviet Uni on and later defected to the West. These engineers ha ve testified before Congress and provide firsthand evidence of Soviet military use of our technology. Here is a st atement from Joseph Arkov, who graduated from a Soviet engineering school in 1970 and who now resi des in the United States. Arkov worked in Sovi et research installations. If, for example, a new American comput er has been obtained by the Soviets, they will make a military a pplication of it rather th an a civilian application,\" 18 and In my work in the second research in stallation I had the assignment of copying Western and Japanese high technology. Arkov makes the interestin g p oint that the Soviets are now so far behind technolo g icall y"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"that they can no longer just reverse engineer as previously — they must import even the technology to manufact ure high technology: They do not have the human resources or the fine tuned equipment required to produce the high technology machinery they try to copy. Once they know what makes a given piece of machinery work, they find that they do not have the technical know-how and equipment to pr oduce the product themselves. That is why they want Western high technology machines that will enable them to produce the products. And the Western produc ts they desire the most are those produced in the United States. That is why they want American high technology machines with which they can produce the components for high technology products. Under Senate questioning Arkov confirmed that the major application of our high technology is for military end uses. Mr. Arkov: Well, the task of copying Western technology . . . part of their assignment was for military. Is that the question? Senator Rudman: Yes, let me just follow that up. You spoke in your prepared statement about the use of sophisticated American computers in various Soviet military operations, and also about the use of semiconductor technology. There are those in this country who feel that had we not transferred that technology legally to the Soviet Union — we sold them certain semiconductor technology and certain sophisticated computer tec hnology in the late sixties and early seventies — the Soviets would not have achieved the advantages in missilery which they have made in terms of the enormous throw weight and precision of their guidance systems. Do you agree with that assessment? Do you think that the sale of those semiconductors an d those computers has given them a tremendous step forward in their t echnology in the defense area from your background and your knowledge? Mr. Arkov: Yes, I think so. I can't tell exactly. It's hard to estimate the degree of advantage they got. But they gained there, using American computers and American semiconductors.19 Control Data Deception The 1973 Control Data Corporation technical a ssistance agreement with the Soviet Union enabled the Soviets to comple te phase one of their semic onductor manufacturing plant (see Chapter Four). Highly significant is a compar ison of Control Data Corporation's public argument to the media and Congress with this 1973 agreement a nd its totally one-sided presentation of the national security argument. One can only conclude that so me CDC statements are delibera te untruths. We make this statement by comparing Control Data public statements, partic ularly those of Chairman William Norris, with internal documents and a g reements with the Soviet Union. These"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"documents are confidential, but copies are in our possession. On December 19, 1973 William No rris wrote Congressman Rich ard T. Hanna concerning public criticism of the CDC proposal to expo rt advanced Cyber computers to the USSR. We extract some statements fr om the letter (reproduced in fu ll as Appendix C) and compare it to extracts from CDC internal documen ts reproduced on pages 61-67. For example, Norris: We have offered the Socialist co untries only standard commercial computers and these offerings have been in full compliance with the export control and administrative directives of the Department of Commerce. Comment: Reference to the 1973 Protocol of Inte nt between CDC and the USSR marked CONFIDENTIAL and reproduced here tells a vastly different story. Norris: Many persons including some of the witnesses before your Committee mistake the offering for sale of old or ev en current state of the art hardware for transfer of advanced technology. This is not unusual because in many cases it is difficult for those who ar e not technically well informed to distinguish advanced computer technology. Comment: Norris is comparing apples and oranges. What is \"old\" or \"current\" in the United States is far beyond \"state of the art\" in the Soviet Un ion. When Norris was offering a million operations per second CYBER computer to the Soviets, the ru n-of-the-mill Soviet technology was in the order of several thousands of operations per second, and that was on copies of import ed equipment. If multinational businessmen like William Norris were honestly mistaken in their information or somewhat shaky in their logic, then perhaps they could be forgiven. After all, to err is human. Unfortunately, evidence proves beyond doubt that at least some of these deaf mute businessmen have deceived both Congress and th e American public in an unseemly haste to make a buck. We have documentary evidence in the case of Control Data Corporation and its Chairman, William Norris. In the following pages we prin t a series of letters from C ontrol Data Corporation to a concerned member of the public and contra cts betweeen CDC and the Soviet Union: * Exhibit A Letter from American Counc il for World Freedom to its supporters identifying William Norris and CDC as exporters of valuable military technology to the Soviets. * Exhibit B Reply from William Norris, \"Dear Yellow Card Sender,\" dated May 5, 1978.

Publisher's Note: At this point the original manuscript contained actual photo copies of documents. Due to the quality of the copies, the documents we re also reset in full and placed in Appendix D of the original manuscript. Due to the difficulty of repr oducing the documents in an efficient manner, we will refer anyone wishing to read the documents to Appendix D . The Deceptive World View of Control Data Corporation William Norris, Chairman of Control Data, has a lively correspondence with Americans anxious to learn his rationale for supporting the Soviet Union. We quote below an extract from a letter wr itten by William Norris to an inquirer: You also made reference [wrote Norr is] in your letter to Russia's first democratic government that was ove rthrown by the communists. You are incorrect on this point. Ther e never has been any democracy in Russia — as a matter of fact, the Russian standard of living today is higher than it was under the tsars. Further, you don't find a great deal of unhappiness in the Soviet Union over living conditions and the comm unist regime for two reasons — (1) they have never know [sic] wh at democracy is, and (2) life is better than it used to be. Here are the errors in the above Norris paragraph: z \"There has never been a ny democracy in Russia.\" Incorrect.

Mr. Norris should look out the window of his Moscow office at the uniform drab blocks of apartme nts. How many families live in one room? How often do severa l families live in one apartment? How about the hours spent in food lines, and th e limited choice of consumer goods in a guns-before-butter economy? Just how many individual Russians has Mr. Norris freely spoken with? Not th ose of the \"nomenklatura,\" but average Russians in the street. We venture to guess none at all. z \"... standard of living today is higher than under the tsars.\" Take one item — wheat. In 1906 Russi a was the world' s largest wheat exporter and the world's largest whea t producer. The climate is the same today as in 1906, yet is us ed as a forlorn excuse for Soviet pitiful wheat production. In fact, 80% of Russian bread today is made from imported wheat, the home-grown is only fit for cattle feed. Without Western wheat, Russia today would starve. Is that a truly higher standard of living? Anyway, Russians today don't co mpare their standards to those of tsarist times but to the Western world. William Norris only sees what he wants to see, hears what he wants to hear, and presumably speaks from these limited im pressions of the world. In conclusion, we can thank Mr. Norris and C ontrol Data Corporation that Soviet military has been able to break into the electronics based warfare of the la te 20th and early 21st century. CDC fulfilled phase one of th e Soviet program fo r acquisition of Western semiconductor technology and mass production facilities.

Afterwards we could find the White House. Without U.S. help the S oviet military system woul d collapse in 1½ years. — Avraham Shifrin, former Soviet Defense Ministry official Signal rockets were used in the Russian Ts arist Army as early as 1717. Present Russian theoretical work in rockets, beginning in 1903, stems from K. E. Tsiolkovskii, who investigated atmospheric resist ance, rocket motion, and similar problems. This Tsarist work was continued in the Soviet Union during th e twenties and thirties. In I928 pioneer Tsiolkovskii suggested that the value of his contributi on had been in theoretical calculations. Nothing had been achieve d in practical rocket engineering. Then in 1936, V. F. Glushke designed and bu ilt a prototype rocket engine, the ORM-65. This rocket used nitric acid and kerosene as propellants. The Soviets then developed the ZhRD R-3395, an aircraft jato ro cket using nitric acid and anili ne as a propellant. Du Pont provided technical assistance and equipment for the construction of larg e nitric acid plants. During World War II, Soviet rockets used \"Russian cordite,\" which was 56.5 percent nitrocellulose. The ni trocellulose was manuf actured under a technical -assistance agreement made in 1930 with the Hercules Powder Company of the United States. Finally, under Lend-Lease, 3,000 rocket-launchers and large quantities of propellants were shipped from the United States to the USSR. German Assistance fo r Soviet Rockets A major boost to Soviet ambiti ons in rocketry came from Ge rmany at the end of World War II. Facilities transferred to th e USSR included the rocket test ing stations of Blizna and Peenemunde, captured intact and removed to th e USSR; the extensive production facilities for the V-1 and V-2 at Nordhaus en and Prague; the records of reliability tests on some 6,000 German V-2; and 6,000 German technicians (not the top theoretical men), most of whom were not released from Russia until the late 1950s. The German rocket pr ogram was in an advanced stat e of development in 1945. About 32,050 V-1 \"Flying bomb\" weapons had been produced in the Volkswagen plant at Fallersleben and in the underground Central Works at Nordhausen. In addition, 6,900 V-2 rockets had been produced — 6,400 at the unde rground Mittelwerke at Nordhausen and 500 at Peenemunde. Rocket fuel f acilities had been de veloped in the Sovi et Zone: liquid oxygen plants at Schmeidebach in Th uringia and at Nordhausen, a nd a hydrogan peroxide plant at Peenemunde."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Germans undertook two and one-half years of experimental work and statistical flight and reliability evaluation on the V-2 before the end of the war. There were 264 developmental launchings at Peenemunde alone. Mittelwerke at Nordhausen wa s visited in June 1946 by U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey teams who reported that the enormous underg round plant could manufact ure V-1s and V-2s as well as Junkers-87 bombers. V-2 rock ets were manufactured in twenty-seven underground tunnels. The plant was well equipped with machine tools a nd with \"a very well set up assembly line for the rocket power unit. \" Its output at the end of the war was about 400 V-2s per month, and its potential output was projected at 900-1,000 per month. When the Soviets occupied part of the Americ an Zone in July 1945 u nder arrangement with General (later President) Eise nhower, the Nordhausen plant wa s removed completely to the USSR. The United States and Britain never did gain a ccess to German rock et-testing sites in Poland. The Sanders Mission reached the Blizna te st station, after cons iderable delays in Moscow, only to find that its e quipment had been removed \"in su ch a methodical way as to suggest strongly to the mission's leader that the evacuation wa s made with a view to the equipment being reerected elsewhere.\" The Sa nders Mission accumulate d 1.5 tons of rocket parts. Unfortunately, when the mission reached home it found that the ro cket parts had been intercepted by the Soviets. Rocket specimens so carefully crated in Blizna for shipment to London and the United States were last seen in Moscow. The crates arrived at the Air Ministry in London, but containe d several tons of \"old and hi ghly familiar aircraft parts when they were opened.\" The Blizna rocket specimens had vanished. Many German rocket technicians went or were taken to the S oviet Union. The most senior was Helmut Groettrup, who had be en an aide to the director of electr onics at Peenemunde. Two hundred other former Peenem unde technicians are reported to have been transferred. Among those were Waldemar Wolf, chief of ballis tics for Krupp; engine er Peter Lertes; and Hans Hock, an Austrian specialis t in computers. Most of thes e persons went in the October 22-23 round-up of ninety-two trainloads comprising 6,000 German specialists and 20,000 members of their families. Aska nia technicians, specialists in rocket-tracking devices, and electronics people from Lorenz, Siemens, and Telefunken were am ong the deportees, as were experts from the Walter Ra kententriebwerke in Prague. Asher Lee sums up the transfer of German rocket technology: The whole range of Luft waffe and German Army radio-guided missiles and equipment fell into Russian hands. Ther e were the two Henschel radar-guided bombs, the Hs-293 and the larger FX- 1400 . . the U.S.S.R. also acquired samples of German antiair craft radio-guided missiles like the X-4, the Hs-298 air-to-air projectile with a range of a bout a mile and a half, the Rheintochter which was fitted with a radar proximity fuse, and the very promising Schmetterling which even in 1945 ha d an operational ceiling of over 45,000 feet and a planned radius of action of about twenty mile s. It could be ground- or air-launched and was one of the most a dvanced of the German small-calibre radio-guided defensive rockets; of thes e various projectiles the Henschel-293 bomb and the defensive Schmetterling and Hs-298 [the V-3] are undergoing development at Omsk and Irkutsk . . . [and later at] fact ories near Riga, Lenin g rad, Kiev, Khaborovsk, Vo ronezh, and elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Other plants produced improved radars base d on the Wurzberg sy stem; the airborne Lichenstein and Naxos systems were repor ted in large-scale production in the 1950s. The Soviets froze rocket design in the late 1950s on developments based on German ideas. The German technical speciali sts were sent home. By 1959 th e Soviets landed a rocket on the moon. Sputnik, Lunik and the Soyuz Programs From the German V-2 rockets, associated German production faci lities, and the all- important German reliability tests, stem the contemporary Soviet ICBM and space rockets. In the 1960s there were four types of large li quid rockets in the Sovi et Union: the Soviet version of the V-2, the R-10 (a 77,000 pound thrust scale-up of the German V-2), the R-14 (a scaled up V-2 with 220,000 pound thrust), and a modificati on known as R-14A (based on the R-14). The R-14 was designed and devel oped by a joint German-Rusian team. The Germans were sent home in the late 1950s. The Soviets did not until fairly recently use single boosters — they use dusters of rockets strapped onto a central core. Th e strap-ons were the scaled- up and modified German V-2. Thus, for example, Sputnik I and Sputnik II had a first stage of two R-14A units, a second stage of two R-14A units, and a third stage of a single R-10 (the German V-2 produced in the Soviet Union). Lunik was a similar cluster of six rocket units. The Vostok and Polyot series are clusters of six units. The planetary rockets, Cosmos series and Soyuz family are seven-unit clusters. An excellent photograph of one of these cluster ve hicles is to be found in Leonid Vladimirov's book, The Russian Space Bluff. 20 In the mid-sixties, any foolhar dy person who insisted that the United States would be first on the moon because the Russians were tec hnologically backward was dismissed as a dimwitted neanderthal. But at l east two skilled observers with firsthand access to the Soviet program made a detailed case, one in 1958 and one in 1969. Lloyd Mallan wrote Russia and the Big Red Lie in 1958, after an almost unrestricted 14,000 mile trip through Russia to visit thirty-eight Soviet scientists. He took 6,000 photographs. It was Mallan who first drew attention to the Soviet pr actice of illustrating space-pr ogram press releases with photographs from the American trade and scie ntific press. The Remington Rand Univac computer was used in the fiftie s to illustrate an article in Red Star on the Soviet computer program — the captions were tr anslated into Russian. In 1969, Tass issued a photograph for use in American newspapers purporting to show a Russian sp ace station at the time when one Soviet space ship was in or bit and another en route. The Tass photograph was reproduced from Scientific American (Feb. 1962) and was identical to an advertisement in Sperry Gyroscope Company of Great Neck, New York. Sperry commented, \"Apparently it is the same as the ad we ran.\" This author personally remember s an incident from the earl y 1960s which illustrates the extraordinary success of Soviet propaganda in molding the U.S. concept of Russian technology. After giving a s hort speech to a Los Angele s audience on technological transfers to the Soviets, a member of the audi ence asked a sensible question: \"Who will be first on the moon, the U. S. or the Soviets?\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The answer as closely as can be recalled was to the effect th at the Soviets did not have the technology to be first on the moon, and by them selves could not make it in this century. The response from the audience was an instan taneous and loud laugh — how ridiculous was the general audience response, \"everyone knows\" the Soviets ar e far ahead of the United States in space. In fact, the Soviets could not even have achi eved their Soyuz program without U.S. help. The docking mechanism is a direct c opy of the U.S. docking mechanism. Unfortunately, NASA and U.S. planners have a conflict of interest. If they publish what they know about the backwardness and dependency of the Soviet space program, it reduces the urgency in our program. This urgency is vital to get Congre ssional funds. Without transfers of technology the U.S. is in effect racing with itself, not a very appealing argument to place before Congress. Why Did the Soviets Embark on a Space Program? From an economic viewpoint, a Soviet space pr ogram makes no sense at all: such a program only makes sense from a geopolitical viewpoint. In 1957, the year of Sputnik , the Soviet Union had fewe r telephones than Japan (3.3 million in the USSR versus 3.7 million in Japan). On a per-hundred population basis, the Soviet Union could provide only 3.58 telephone s compared to 49.8 in the United States. Even Spain provided 9.6 tele phones per 100 of population, or three times more than the Soviet Union. In automobiles, the Soviet Union was even less affluent. In 1964 the Soviet Union had a stock of 919,000 automobiles, all produced in Weste rn-built plants, only slightly more than Argentina (800,000) and far less than Japan (1.6 million) a nd the United States (71.9 million). Even today the Soviet Union is so backward in automobile technology that is has to go to Italy and the United States for automobile and truck technology. Although we in the West might see this technical backwardness as a natural reason for not going into space, the Soviets saw it as a co mpelling reason to embark on a space program. A \"technical extravaganza\" was necessary to demonstrate Soviet \"technical superiority\" to the world an d maintain the myth of sel f-generated Soviet military might. The Soviet economic problem in the mid-1950s was acute. The Soviet economy had shown good rates of growth, but this was due to the impetus given by Lend-Lease equipment and by war reparations. There were no signs of technical viabi lity. Numerous industries were decades out of date with no indigenous progress on the horizon. The only solution was a massive program of acquiring complete plants and up-to- date technology in the West. Beginning in the late 1950s a nd continuing through to the 1980s , this program had to be dis g uised because of obvious militar y im p lications. One facet of the dis g uise was the s p ace"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"program. The usual stock of reasons for back wardness had run dry (t he Civil War, the Revolution, intervention, warmonge ring capitalists) — even the damage done by the Nazis could only be spread so far. So two new elements made their appearance: 1. A space program — to get the Western world looking upwards and outwards, literally away from the Sovi et Union and its internal problems. 2. Concurrent articles and press releases in the We st on Soviet technical \"achievements,\" spotted part icularly in Western trade journals and more naive newspapers, such as the New York Times. Around the same time in the ' 60s and '70s, the West (or rather the United States and Germany) resurrected Edwin Gay's 1918 proposal to mellow the Bolsheviks, and this proposal now became \"bridges for peace\" to provide a rational explanation for the massive transfers of Western technology th at were required to fulfill Soviet programs. The United States appears, in historical perspective, to have been almost desper ate in its attempts to help the Soviets in space. Of course, if the S oviets did not succeed in space, there could be no \"competing\" American space program and many politicians, bureaucrats, and politically oriented scientists we re determined — for their own good re asons — that there had to be a major American space effort. There also had to be U.S. assistance for the Soviet space program. In the ten years between December 1959 and December 1969, the United States made eighteen approaches to the US SR for space \"cooperations.\" In December 1959, NASA Administrator R. Keith Glennan offered assistance in tracking Soviet manned flights. On Ma rch 7, 1962 President Kennedy proposed an exchange of information from tracking and data-ac quisition stations, and on September 20, 1963 President Kennery proposed join t exploration of the moon, an offer later repeated by President Johnson. On December 8, 1964 the admini stration proposed an exchange of teams to visit deep-space tracki ng and data-acquisition faci lities. On May 3, 1965 NASA suggested joint communicati ons tests via the Soviet Molnlya I . On August 25, 1965 NASA asked the Soviet Academy of Sciences to send a representative to the Gemini VI launch, and on November 16, NASA inquired about joint Molnlya I communications tests. Four U.S. offers were made in 1966; in January NASA inquired about Venus probes; on March 24, and May 23 Administrator Ja mes Webb suggested that the Soviets propose subjects for discussion; and in September Ambassador Art hur Goldberg again ra ised the question of tracking coverage by the United States for Soviet missiles. Soviet Aircraft Development In 1913 in St. Petersburg, Igor Sikorsky (who later founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Company in America) designed the \"Russki-Vityazyi.\" Weighing 5 tons with a load of seven passengers, this four-engined pl ane established a contemporary endurance record of 1 hour and 54 minutes aloft. By 1917 a fleet of seventy-five IM (\" Ilya Mourometz\") four-engined bombers, based on the original 1913 model, were in service — several decades before the American four-engined bomber fleets of Worl d War II. So tsarist Russia produced and successfully flew the world's first four-engine d bomber, a quarter of a century before the United States develo p ed one.

Obviously there was nothing wr ong with indigenous Russian aeronautical talent half a century ago. While Russians have a natural affinity and geographic impulse towards aeronautics, the Soviets have only kept up with the West by reverse engineering, prolific \"borrowing\" and importation of technology and manufacturing eq uipment. Russian dependency on Western aeronautical design and production equipment and techniques goes back to the early 1920s. At that time, soon after th e Bolshevik Revolution, the Russ ian aircraft industry depended heavily on foreign aircraft a nd engine imports. There was considerable Soviet design activity, but this work was not converted into usable aircra ft technology. Consequently, in the early 1930s the Soviet stoc k of military planes was almo st completely foreign: 260 fighters comprising 160 De Havilland Type 9a (from Great Britain) and 100 Heinkel HD-43 fighters (from Germany); 80 Avre 504-K training biplanes (from Great Britain) and some Moraine-Saulnier monoplanes (from France); 52 R-3 biplanes (Russi an TsAGI design); 20 R-6 reconnaissance planes (Russian TsAGI design); 242 I-4 Jupiter- engine,planes (from Great Britain); 80 Ju-30 and ANT-6 (Junke rs design); 20 ANT-6 bomber seaplanes (Russian design; 18 Avro-504L seaplanes (from Great Brit ain); 40 Savoia S-62 scouting flying boats (from Italy); 150 Heinkel HD- 55 scouting flying boats (from Germany); 46 MR-4 (Savoia S-62 license) flying boats (from Italy); 12 TBI (Russi an TsAGI design); and 43 Ju-30 naval bombers (from Germany). From about 1932 onward, and particularly af ter 1936, there was extensive acquisition of Western aeronautical advances, wh ich were then integrated wi th the developments of the 1920s. Fortuitously for the Soviet Union, this much-needed acquisition coincided with a period of increased compet ition among Western aircraft manufacturers. In many cases, military aircraft were designed in the West on Soviet account and the heavy, slow, underpowered Russian designs of the early 1930s were replaced by efficient Western designs. By 1937 the Soviet government was convinced that the Am erican method of building aircraft was the best for Russi an conditions, as the American system of manufacture could more easily be adapted to mass production than any of the European systems. The United States thus became the main source of Soviet aircraft technology, partic ularly as a builder of new Soviet aircraft plants. Between 1932 and I940 more than twenty American companies supplied either aircraft, accessories, or technical assist ance for complete planes and aircraft manufacturing plants. Technica l assistance agreements were made for Vultee attack bombers, the Consolidated Ca talina, the Martin Ocean fl ying boat and Martin bombers, Republic and Sikorsky amphibians, Seversky amphibians and heavy bombers, Douglas DC- 2 and DC-3 transports, the Douglas flying boa t, and other aircraft. Kilmarx has well summarized this acquisition: The objectives of the Soviet Union were more straight forward than its methods. By monitoring aeronautical progress an d taking advantage of commercial practices and lax security standards in the West, the Russians sought to acquire advanced equipment, designs, and proces ses on a selective ba sis. Emphasis was placed on the legitimate procuremen t of aircraft, e ngines (including superchargers), propellers, naviga tional equipment, and armament; specifications and perfor mance data; design, producti on and test information and methods; machine tools, j i g s and dies; semi-fabricat es and critical raw"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"materials. Licenses were obtained to manufacture certain modern military aircraft and engines in the U.S.S.R. At the same time, a number of Soviet scientists and engineers were educated at the best technical institutes in the West. Soviet techniques also include d assigning purchasing missions abroad, placing inspectors and traine es in foreign factories, and contracting for the services of foreign engineers, technici ans and consultants in Soviet plants. 21 In 1937 the Soviet Union possessed the world' s first commercial plane able to fly the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, with a payload of 7,500 pounds. Known as the Martin Ocean Transport, Model-156, with four 1,000 horsepower Wright Cyclone engines, it was built by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore. Model-156 cost the Soviet Union $1 million. Although capable of being flown directly to the Soviet Uni on, it was flown only to New York, then was dismantled and shipped to the USSR by boat. Also in 1937 the Martin Company agreed to design a Soviet bomber. Loy Henderson, the U.S. charge in Moscow, reported: ...since January 1, 1937, the Embassy gran ted visas to fourteen Soviet engineers and specialists who are proceeding to Baltimore to the Glenn L. Martin factory. This informat ion would appear to be si gnificant in view of the statements that the Martin Company is to design and deve lop a new type of large plane for the Soviet air force inst ead of selling somewh at obsolete models which may have been released for export by the American milit ary authorities. . . 22 In May 1937 the New York Times reported a $780,000 Soviet contract with Seversky Aircraft Corporation involving construction of , and manufacturing rights for, Seversky amphibians, which then held the amphibian world speed record of 230.4 miles per hour. Under a technical-assistance agreement, Seversky Aircraft provided assistance for manufacture of these planes in the Sovi et Union at the rate of ten per day. Alexander P. de Seversky, presid ent of the company, then in formed the State Department that the Soviets had contract ed to purchase from the comp any a large number of bombing planes of a new type to be designed by him. After being informed that a license would be granted if the planes involve d no military secrets, Severs ky suggested that the War and Navy Departments might object to its exportation \"merely\" on the ground that the new bomber would be superior to any bombing plane then in existence. Seversky indicated that he intended to address his request for an e xport license to the Stat e Department, \"in hope that the Department might expedite action in this.\" The first domestic flying boats under the Soviets were c onstructed at Leningrad and Taganrog. In 1932, Plant No. 23 in Leningrad produced 18 Avro 504-L seaplanes and 40 Savoia S-62 scouting flying boats, the latter under a license from the Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia of Milan —an out standing designer of high-performance flyi ng boats. Also in 1932, Taganrog Plant No. 31 produced 196 flyi ng boats: 150 scouting HD-55s and 46 MR- 5s, both built under license from Heinkel. The Soviets also acquired a license from the Macchi Company of Italy to produce the MBR series of Russian flying boats. Then in 1937 came an agreement with the Consolidated Aircra ft Company of San Diego for technical assistance for Catalina fl y in g boats under su p ervision of Etienne Dormo y . With"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the Catalina flying boat we once again see the extraordinary ability of the Soviets to acquire anything they set thei r hearts on. The very first commercial Consolidat ed PBY (\"Catalina\") off the assembly, line in San Diego was sold to the American Museum of Natural History — which promptly transferred it to the Soviets. 23 This is not the first time the American Museum of Natural History tu rns up in the Soviet files. In 1919 a shipload of Soviet propaganda was seized — en route to the Unit ed States and addressed to the American Museum of Natural History. 24 Also in 1937-38, the Vultee Airc raft Division of Aviation Manufacturing Corporation of Downey, California built a fighter airc raft plant for the Soviets in Moscow. Equally as important, the Soviets acquired rights to build the famous Douglas DC-3, probably the most successful transport plane in the history of av iation. Donald Douglas produced his first DC-3 in March1935 and within one year the Soviets decided this was to be the basic transport plane for the USSR. A technical-assistance agreement with the Douglas Aircraft Company was signed on July 15, 1936 for three years. Within thirty days of contract signature, Douglas delivered the blueprint mate rials required to fulfill the assistance contract. In October 1937 the Soviet airc raft industry placed a $1.15 mi llion order with Douglas for additional parts, tools, assemblies, and materi als. The order included one complete DC-3 in subassembly and another in \"first-stage\" produc tion. In addition, aluminum extrusions were ordered for another fifty aircra ft, together with two complete sets of raw materials and twenty-five sets of finishing materials ra nging from ash trays to zippers. Construction facilities, ordered at the same time, included one complete set of 6,485 templates, a set of 350 lead and zinc drop hammer di es, three sets of hydraulic mechanisms, all the necessary wood and plaster patterns, drill and assembly fixtures, a co mplete set of drop-hammer stamps, hydraulic-press parts, tw o crowning machines, and a set of 125 special tools.

This threat would not exist if President Richard Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger had heed ed warnings in 1970 from its own Department of Defense and outside experts that th e Soviets were lagging in mis sile production technology and required specific technologies from the West to MIRV their fourth generation ICBMs. MIRV capability is the abilit y to deploy a number of warhead s from the same missile, thus vastly increasing throw weight. Soviet third generation missiles did not have th is capability. As stated by a Department of Defense report: \"... it was not until the fourth generation that the technology became available to the Soviet s allowing greater thro w weight and greatly improved accuracy so that high yield MIRVs could be carried by operational missiles\" The phrase \"became available\" is a subtle way for DOD to st ate what has been concealed from the public: that the U.S. made the tec hnology available (as we sh all show below). The fourth generation ICBMs are the SS-17, the SS-18 and the SS-19, wh ich today have the capability to destroy most of our 1,000 U.S. Minuteman missiles now operational with only a portion of their warheads. American Accelerometers for Soviet Missiles Let's go back to the start of our help for the Soviet missile program. Accelerometers are small but vital instrument s used in missiles and aircraft to measure gravitational pull. In 1965-68 th e Soviets displayed an extracur ricular interest in American accelerometers, and a So viet United Nations diplomat was forced to hurriedly leave the United States before being picked up for espionage involving acqui sitions of U.S. ac- celerometers. Testimony of Leonard I. Epstein, vice pres ident of Trans-American Machinery and Equipment Corporation of New Jersey, to the House Un-American Activities Committee detailed Soviet interest in this American technology. Mr. Epst ein related to the committee how he met Vadim Isakov, a Russi an employee of UNICEF (U nited Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) on July 15, 1965, and how Isakov la ter visited Ep stein's plant in New Jersey with a list of four items fo r purchase, including \"an accelerorneter made by American Bosch Arma Cor p oration or similar com p an y . The accelerometer is an intricate"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"device which measures the pull of gravity on any vehicle such as a missile or space-orbiting device. The device costs about $6,000.\" Mr. Epstein, under instru ctions from the FBI, met several times with Isakov to \"find out what he wanted.\" In October 1965, \"Isakov began to push for deli very on the ac-celerorneter. [Epstein] surmised that the urgency had something to do with the fact that the Soviets had smashed three vehicles onto th e surface of the moon.\" Although Epstei n was able to stall for \"quite some time\" on various grounds, Isakov late r became \"quite anxious to obtain an accelerometer.\" When Epstein pleaded export problems, Isa kov suggested he would use the Soviet diplom atic pouch. Eighteen months later, in August 1967, another Russian, in tensively interested in accelerometers, turned up in the United States , this time under the auspices of the State Department Academic Exchange Program. From August 1967 to June 1968, Anatoliy K. Kochev of the Kalinin Polytechni cal Institute of Leni ngrad was at Catholic University in the United States working on \"construction methods of e quipment to measure small accelerations and displacement,\" that is, the manufacture of accelerorneters. Is there any connection between Isakov's uns uccessful espionage attempts to purchase accelerometers and Kochev's \"academic\" work on accelerometer manufac ture in the United States, courtesy of the Stat e Department? There are indeed obsolete accelerometers and sophisticated accelerometers. Th e Soviets know the difference. They know how to make the obsolete versions, but do not have the techni cal ability to make more sophisticated instruments. The trick is in the manufacturi ng process — that is, in knowing how to build into the instrument the sensitivity necessary to measure small gravit ational pulls quickly and accurately. It is the manufacturing te chnique that was important to the Soviets — much more important than a boatful of purchased accelerometers. Why did Kochev come to the United States in 19677 The State Departme nt reports the title of his project as \"constructi on methods of equipm ent to measure sma ll accelerations.\" Ten months would be sufficient ti me for a competent engineer to determine the most modern methods in this field, and given the ra ther careless manner in which advanced accelerometers have found their way into used electronic equipment stores, it is unlikely that Kochev had major problems in adding to his knowledge of the state of the art. Why did the State Department make an agreem ent in 1966 to allow a S oviet engineer into the United States to study the manufacture of accelerometers only a few months after another Soviet national had been fo iled by the FBI in attempting to purchase an accelerometer? We have no answer for that. American Ball Bearings fo r Missile Guidance System In the late 1960s Soviet missiles were extrem ely inaccurate. According to Abraham Shifrin, a former Defense Ministry official, they coul d hardly find the United States, let alone a specific target. By the late 1970s their accu racy was so improved that Soviets could guarantee a high proportion of hits on a ta rget as small as the White House. The technological roadblock was mass production of miniaturised precision ball bearings for g uidance s y stems."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"In the early 1960s Soviets attempted to buy U.S. technology for mass production of miniaturised precision bearings. The te chnology was denied. However, in 1972 the necessary grinders were sold by Bryant Chucking Grinder Company and its products are today used in Soviet guided mis sile systems and gyroscopes. Sp ecifically, the Soviets were then able to MIRY their missi les and increase their accuracy. This is how the tragedy came about. Ball bearings are an integral part of weapons systems, there is no substitute. The entire ball bearing production capability of the Soviet Union is of Western origin — utilizing equipment from the United Stat es, Sweden, Germany, a nd Italy. This transfer has been fully documented elsewhere by this au thor (see Bibliography). Al l Soviet tanks and military vehicles run on bearings ma nufactured on Western equipmen t or copies of Western equipment. All Soviet missiles and relate d systems including guidance systems have bearings manufactured on Western equipment or Soviet dupli cates of this equipment. One firm in particular, the Bryant Chucking Grinder Compa ny of Springfield, Vermont, has been an outstanding supplier of ball bearing processing equipm ent to the Soviets. In 1931 Bryant shipped 32.2 percent of its output to the USSR. In 1934, 55.3 percent of its output went to Russia. There were no luther shipments until 1938, when the Soviets again bought one-quarter of Bryant's annua l output. Major shipments were also made under Lend-Lease. Soviet dependence on the West for ball bearings technolo gy peaked after the years 1959-61, when the Soviets required a capability for ma ss production, rather than laboratory or batch production, of miniature precisi on ball bearings for weapons systems. The onl y company in the world that could supply the required mach ine for a key operation in processing the races for precision bearings (the Centalign-B) was the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company. The Soviet Union had no such mass production capabi lity. Its miniature ball bearings in 1951 were either imported or made in small lo ts on Italian and other imported equipment. In 1960 there were sixty-six Centalign-B machin es in the United St ates. Twenty-five of these machines were operated by the Mini ature Precision Beari ng Company, Inc., the largest manufacturer of precision ball beari ngs, and 85 percent of Miniature Precision's output went to military applications. In 196 0 the USSR entered an order with Bryant Chucking for forty-five simila r machines. Bryant consulted the Department of Commerce. When the department indicated its willingness to grant a licens e, Bryant accepted the order. The Commerce Department's ar gument for granting a license turned on the following points: (1) the process achieve d by the Centalign was only a single process among several required for ball bearing produc tion, (2) the machine could be bought elsewhere, and (3) the Russians were already able to make ball bearings. The Department of Defense ente red a strong objection to the e xport of the machines on the following grounds: In the specific case of the granting of the export license for high-frequency grinders manufactured by Bryant Chucki ng Grinder after receiving the request for DOD's opinion from the Department of Commerce, it was determined that all of the machines of this type curren tly available in the United States were being utilized for the produc tion of bearings utilized in strategic components for militar y end items. It was also deter mined from information that was"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"available to us that the Soviets did not produce a mach ine of this type or one that would be comparable in enabling the production of miniature ball bearings of the tolerances and precision require d. A further consideration was whether machines of comparable capacity and si ze can be made available from Western Europe. In this connection, our invest igation revealed that none was in production that would meet the specificati ons that had been established by the Russians for these machines. In the light of these considerations it was our opinion that the license should not be granted. The Inter-Departmental Adviso ry Committee on Export Contro l, which includes members from the Commerce and State Depa rtments as well as the CIA, overruled the Department of Defense opinion, and \"a decision was made to approve the granting of the license.\" The Department of Defense made further protests , demanding proof that either the USSR or Western Europe was capa ble of producing such machines. No such proof was forthcoming. The following is a summary of the objections of the Department of Defense representative: (a) I expressed dissatisfac tion and suggested that th e Department of Defense not concur in the initial request of the Department of Commerce. (b) The official member of the Depart ment of Defense in this connection concurred and, at a series of meetings of the A dvisory Committee on Export Control, spoke against the proposal that an export license be granted. (c) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Supply and Logistics, after reviewing some of the circumstances, re quested that I do whatever was possible to stop the shipment of these machines. (d) A letter was transmitted from the O ffice of the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of Commerce, approximately November 1, 1960, saying it [sic] spoke to the Department of Defens e and requesting a further review. (e) At two meetings where the matter was reviewed, th e Department of Defense maintained nonconcurrence in the shipment of the equipment. As of this writing I am still convinced that it would be a tragic mistake to ship this equipment. The reference to a \"tra gic mistake\" refers to the known fa ct at that time that miniature precision ball bearings are essential for missile s. Granting the license would give the USSR a miniature ball bearing productio n capability equal to two-thirds that of the United States. In 1961 a Senate subcommittee i nvestigated the grant of this license to Bryant. Its final report stated: The Senate Subcommittee on Internal Secu rity has undertaken its investigation of this matter not in any desire to find sc apegoats, but because we felt that the larger issue involved in the Bryant case was, potentially, of life-or-death importance to America and the free world.

Gilbert, of Keene, N.H., and I am president of Miniature Precision Bearings, Inc., and I would like to express my appreciation for having an opportunity to be here wi th you and come particularly at this time, when I know that ever yone is so busy, and at su ch short notice. As the name implies, my company produces mi niature ball beari ngs of precision quality, 85 percent of which are used in the national defense effort. All but 1 percent of our sales are within the United States, and most of these bearings are produced by machines manufactured by Bryant Chucking Grinder Co., of Springfield, Vt. Our company owns about 25 of these machines out of the 66 which, I believe, presently exist in the United States. This machine was developed over a long period of years, and much of the know- how, Mr. Chairman, in the latest model, was contributed by our company. Several months ago Russia ordered 45 of these machines from Bryant, and the Department of Commerce has granted an export license. I was very much disturbed when I learne d of this, and I and Mr. Patterson over there — whom I will further identify as one of the de velopers of this machine — we have attempted to demonstrate to the Department of Commerce the tragedy of these machines being sold to Russia. Unfortunately, we have not met with su ccess, and I would like to assure you, Mr. Chairman, that if these machines are sold, it means absolutely no commercial or financial difference to us as a company or to me as an individual. I have no fear as far as Russia selli ng in our markets is concerned, and our company does not do any significant am ount of bearing business in their markets. I am here because I think that this is folly which would undermine our defenses. The Department of Commerce has attempted to justify its decision with four or five arguments, none of which, in our op inion, appears to be valid, and I would like to touch on these. First, they say these machines could be purchased in Europe, and consequently, Bryant might as well benefit by their sale here. I am thoroughly familiar with the machin es which are in production in Europe.

Unfortunately, it is on Soviet ships.\" — Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, May 25, 1983, to graduating class at Annapolis (re ported in U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, August 1983, pp. 73-4) Only one Soviet battleship was bui lt before World War II — the Tretii International (\"Third International\"), laid down on July 15, 1939 in the Leningrad yards. The guns, turrets, armor, and boilers for this 35,000 ton battleship were pur chased in the United States and Germany. The ship was completed in the la te 1940s. Other prewar Soviet battleships — the Marat, Kommuna, and Oktyabrskyaya Revolutsla — were reconditioned and refitted ex-tsarist vessels. Attempts to bu ild three battleships of the Italian Vittorio Veneto class were abandoned. Three aircraft carriers were under construction at the end of the 1930s. The Stalin (formerly the tsarist Admiral Kornilov ), a 9,000-ton ship built in 1914, redesigned in 1929, and completed in 1939 as an aircraft carrier. Tw o other carriers of 12,000 tons each were built \"on the basis of American blueprints\" — the Krasnoye Znamye and the Voroshilov , laid down at Leningrad in 1939 and 1940. World War II Soviet cruisers were refi tted tsarist-era vessels, including the Krasni Kavkaz (formerly the Admiral Lazarov , built in 1916 at Kinoleav), the Profintern (formerly the Svetlana , built in 1915 at Reval [now Talli nn] and refitted in 1937), and the Chevonagy Ukraina (formerly the Admiral Nakhimov , built in 1915). The firs t Soviet attempt at cruiser construction was the Kirov class of 8,000 tons. Three sh ips were laid down in 1934- 35 with Tosi engines manufacture d in Italy and built to Italian plans at Putilovets (the Kirov and Maxim Gorki ) and at Nikoleav (the Kulbyshev ) under the technical direction of Sansaldo, an Italian firm. There were three groups of Sovi et destroyers before World War II. First, fourteen tsarist vessels — four in the Petrovski class (built in 1917 -18), nine in the Uritski class (built in 1914-15), and one ex- Novik (built in 1911). Second, some ne w classes of destroyers were built under the Soviets to French and It alian designs. Between 1935 and 1939, fifteen destroyers of 2,900 tons e ach, based on French drawi ngs, were built as the Leningrad class: six in the Leningrad yards, ei ght on the Black Sea, and one at Vladivostok. The first units, supervised by French engineers, were similar to French vessels. The third category encompassed the Stemitelnie class, the largest Sovi et destroyer class of the 1930s. Between 1936 and 1939, thirt y -five of these 1,800-ton shi p s were built under"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Italian supervision, mainly in Leningrad and the Black Sea yard s, utilizing an Italian Odero- Terni-Orlando design and Britis h machinery. Their engines we re Tosi (Italy) 50,000-shaft- horsepower geared turbines. In addition, the Tashkent , another Odero-Terni-Orlando design, was built in It aly — the only Soviet surface warship built abroad in the 1930s. In January 1939 the American firm of Gibbs and Cox, nava l architects, designed two destroyers and a 45,000-ton battleship for the Soviet Union in the United States. From 1939 to 1941 the Soviets rece ived German military assistance. The Nazis sent the partly finished cruiser Lu tzow, laid down at Bremen in 1937, and in May 1941 \"construction of the cruiser 'L' in Leningrad was proceeding according to plan.\" In the Leningrad yards German technici ans took over construction and repa ir of Soviet ships. This cooperation lasted for eighteen mont hs, from late 1939 until May 1941. All told, in 1941 the Soviet fleet comprised 3 battleships, 8 cruise rs, 85 destroyers and torpedo boats, 24 minelayers, 75 minesweepers, 300 motor to rpedo boats and gunboats, and 250 submarines. Most were built in the West or to Western designs. U.S. Lend-Lease added 491 ships to this to tal: 46 110-foot submar ine chasers and 59 65- foot submarine chasers, 221 torpedo boats ( 24 of them from the United Kingdom), 77 minesweepers, 28 frigates, 52 sm all landing craft, 2 large la nding craft from the United Kingdom, and 6 cargo barges. In addition to combat vesse ls, Lend-Lease transferred merchant ships and marine engines. In terms of tonnage, Lend-Lea se probably doubled the size of the Soviet Navy. Only a small number of these naval ships have been retu rned, although the Lend-Le ase master agreement required the return of all vessels. Since World War II, assistance to the Soviet naval construction pr ogram has taken two forms: export of shipbuilding e quipment and shi pyard cranes from Eu ropean countries and the United States, and use of plans and designs obtained from the United States and NATO through espionage. For exampl e, the sophisticated equipment of the U.S.S. Pueblo , transferred by the North Koreans to the USSR, wa s at least fifteen year s ahead of anything the Soviets had in the late 1960s. In other words, the Pueblo capture took the Soviets in one leap from postwar German and Lend-Lease tec hnical developments to the most modern of U.S. technology. Current Soviet acquisitions of naval equi pment are highly signifi cant and evidence of failure by the West to maintain a realistic de fense posture. The Soviets have concentrated th eir acquisitions in areas related to aircraft carriers, deep sea diving capabilities, sensor sy stems for antisub-ma rine warfare and navigation, and ship maintenance facilities. In the maintenance ar ea, two huge floating dr ydocks purchased from Japan, supposedly for civilian use, have been di verted to military use. Drydocks are critical for both routine and fast repair of ships damaged in warfare. In 1978, when the Soviets took possession of one of the drydocks, they diverted it to the Pacific Naval Fleet. The other was sent to the Northern Fleet in 1981. These drydocks are so large that they can carr y several naval ships. More importantly, they are the onl y dr y dock facilities in either of the two ma j or Soviet fleet areas — Northern or"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Pacific — capable of servicing the new Kiev -class V/STOL aircra ft carriers. Soviet advanced submarines carrying ba llistic missiles, Soviet Kiev aircraft carriers, and Soviet destroyers were among the first ships repaired in these drydocks. The drydocks are so large that no Soviet shipyard is capable of accommodating their cons truction without major facility modifications, associat e capital expenditures, and in terruption of present weapons programs. Their importance will be even more pronounced when the Soviets construct the still larger carriers (for high -performance aircraft) projected for the 1990s. The Soviets have acquired Western aircraft carri er catapult equipment and doc umentation for this larger carrier; catapult technology, though relatively common in the West, is outside Soviet experience and capabilities. In the 1980s, the USSR has contracted for or purchased foreign-built oceanographic survey ships equipped with some of the most modern Western-manufactured equipment. In place of U.S. equipment that was embargoed, other Western equipment has been installed on the ships. This modernization of the world' s largest oceanographic fleet with Western technology will supp ort the development of Soviet weapon systems programs and antisubmarine systems used against the West. Ship and submarine construction requires sheet st eel, steel plate, and steel sections. Armor- plate is produced by rolling high- alloy steel, which is then heat-treated to develop its ballistic properties. Multiple la yers are used for armor protec tion. Therefore, assistance to the Soviet iron and steel i ndustry — which is significant and continuing — is also assistance to Soviet sh ip-construction programs. A U.S. government agency report has assert ed that \"any shipyard capable of building a merchant ship hull is equally capable of building a combatant ship of the same length.\" The report also states that mercha nt ships can be designed for c onversion into naval ships, and that in any event the facilities required to build a steel merchant ship are exactly the same as the facilities required to build a steel warship. The main diff erences are the armament and the varying specifications fo r engines and other equipment. Almost 70 percent of the present Soviet merchant fleet has been built outside the Sovi et Union. This has released Soviet shipyards and materials for Soviet naval construction. All diesel engines in Soviet ships use a technology originating outside the Soviet Union. The Soviets provided 80 percen t of the supplies for the Nort h during the war in Vietnam. Most of these supplies were transported by merchant sh ip. The ocean-going capacity required to supply the North Viet namese on this scale and so keep them in the war was dependent upon ships previously built outside the USSR. The same process can be identified in Central America and Africa. While the supply of maritime technology has been formally forbidden by Congress, grossly inefficien t administration of the export control laws has allowed the Soviets to acquire a massive military tran sportation capacity. Origins of the Soviet Merchant Marine There are two extraordinary facts about the gi gantic strategic Soviet merchant marine: First: over two-thirds of its ship tonnage has been built outside the Soviet Union. The remaining one-third was built in Soviet yard s and to a great extent with shipbuilding e q ui p ment from the West, p articularl y Finland and NATO allie s, Great Britain and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Germany. Second: four-fifths of the main marine diesel engines used to propel the vessels of the Soviet merchant marine were ac tually built in the West. In ot her words, only one -fifth of the main diesel engines were built in the USSR. Moreover, even this startling stat istic does not reflect the full nature of Soviet dependenc e on foreign marine di esel technology because all of the main engines manufactured in th e USSR are built to foreign designs. The full scope of the dependence of Sovi et marine-diesel technology on foreign assistance is shown in Table 8-1. The manufacture of marine dies els in the Soviet Union has re ceived considerable foreign technical assistance. Technica l-assistance agreem ents were made with both M.A.N. and Sulzer in the 1920s, and the Sovi et Union has continued since that time to receive M.A.N. (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg) and Sul zer technology, in addi tion to assistance agreements with Burmeister & Wain of Denmark and Skoda of Czechoslovakia. An important basic agreement was signed in early 1959 in Copenhagen by Niels Munck, mana g in g director of Burmeiste"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" CHAPTER IX The Leaky Pipeline Embargo 27 \"It seems beyond doub t now that the pattern of Soviet-Cuban-East German intervention constitutes a si ngle apparatus with a seri ous purpose. It merits a serious American response.\" — Wall Street Journal, December 29, 1980 Siberia is a vast store house of oil and gas re serves. In the 1970s the Soviets brought off an almost unbelievable deal to develop these reserves. A known Soviet objective in ec onomic warfare is to make We stern Europe dependent on the Soviet Union. Such dependenc e will severely reduce Europe an options in case of war with the Soviet Union. The Soviets designed a massive pipeline pr oject large enough to change the entire Siberian infrastructure to ch annel these Siberian natural gas reserves to gas deficient Europe, thus maki ng Europe dependent on a vital en ergy resource. At the same time the Soviets convinced the Western deaf mu te blindmen to financ e this $22 billion deal and so finance their own destruct ion — just as Lenin predicted. The Siberian gas deal, known as \"Russia No. 6\" to the financing ba nkers, is a 2,800 miles gas export pipeline from the Urengoy gas field in Siberia to Uzhgorod on the Czech-Soviet border, where it feeds into the West European gas pipeline network. Daily throughput is 2.8 billion cubic feet. Initially, even the U.S. State Department (October 1982) objected to the deal on the following grounds: • Russia No. 6 would make Europe 20%-30% dependent on Russian gas, thus crossing \"the threshold of pr udent dependence on the USSR,\" • the financing offered by Western banke rs \"amounts to a subsidy of Soviet economic development,\" • resulting hard currency earnings from sale of the gas will \"have a strategic impact by allowing the USSR to cont inue to import Western goods and high technology equipment, alleviating se rious domestic resource constraints.\" 28 In the late summer of 1981, the Soviet Union c ontracted with U.S., French, West German, and Italian engineering firms fo r equipment for the Siberian pi peline. The Sovi ets required each European country to make available subs tantial export financing to be eligible for pipeline contracts. Financi ng offers by the European expor t credit agencies were for subsidized interest rates, in most cases under 8%, at a time when interest rates ran g ed from"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"11% to more than 20%. Using credit, th e Soviets purchased power turbines, gas compressors, and monitoring, fire fighting, and control equipmen t. Large diameter pipe was purchased and financed as part of bulk orders of Western stee l pipe regularly imported by the Soviets. In late 1981 and early 1982, long-te rm gas supply contracts based on the new pipeline were signed between the Soviet Unio n and gas distribution compan ies in West Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, and later Italy. The new contracts signifi cantly increased West European dependence on the Soviet Union for na tural gas, in some cases pushing it above 30% (see Table 9-1). Such a level of de pendence on Siberian gas is unwise because: • gas is a fuel partic ularly hard to replace at short notice because of the way it is transported and stored; • gas is used in the politically sensitiv e residential and comm ercial sectors of Europe.

Explosives require chemical technology and, for example, und er wartime circumstan ces fertilizer plants can be quickly converted to manufacture of e xplosives. Many nerve gases require chemical technologies similar to those used for production of agricu ltural insecticides. This interrelationship between chem ical technology and warfare is well known in Washington, yet the Soviets have traditiona lly been allowed access to the latest of Western chemical technology under so-called coope ration agreements, through \"tur n-key\" plants which have been used for military end uses. A Central Intelligence Agency assessment report 30 made in the late 1970s concluded that the \"USSR is highly dependen t on Western chemical technol ogy.\" At that time the CIA estimated that Western equipped plants account ed for the following proportions of Soviet chemical production: 40 percent of complex fertilizers 60 percent of polyethylene 75-80 percent of polyester fiber 85 percent of ammonia production The CIA report did not, however , report on another critical fact: that Soviet plants producing these and other chemicals use almo st entirely technology copied or reverse engineered from Western equi pment. There is no indigenous Soviet chemical technology. State Department Concurs in Explosives Manufacture Import of U.S. chemical tec hnology for military purposes goe s back to the 1920s and has always received State Department support. A 1929 agreement stipulated that the Soviets could us e Du Pont processe s for the oxidation of ammonia to manufacture 50- 65 percent nitric acid. Du P ont agreed \"to place at the disposal of Chemstroi sufficient data, inform ation and facts with re spect to the design, construction and operation of such plants as will enable Chem stroi to design, construct and operate ammonia oxidation plants.\" Later in 1932, negotiations were concluded between Du Pont a nd the Soviets for construction of a g i g antic nitric acid p lant with a ca p acit y of 1,000 tons p er da y . This"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"approximates 350,000 tons annuall y. Twenty-five years later, in 1957, the largest Du Pont- process nitric acid plant in the United Stat es, at Hopewell, had an annual capacity of 425,000 tons. Under the 1929 earlier contract, Du P ont also supplied technical assistance to the USSR for a period of five years. The firm inquired of the State Department whether this plant of \"excessively large ca pacity\" would meet with objections from the U.S. government: \"While we have no knowledge of the purpose of the proposed plant, yet the excessively large capacity contemplated leads us to be lieve that the purpose may be a military one.\" 31 The State Department positi on is summarized in a memora ndum of April 6, 1932, which reviewed export of military mate rials to the Soviet Union and concluded that the department would have no objection to construction of such a large nitric acid plant. 32 The Soviets bought from Du Pont its ammonia oxidation and ni tric acid technologies. Du Pont had expended over $27 mi llion developing these processes. In requesting advice from the State Department, Du Pont argued that the process was ne ither secret nor covered by patents, that the end-use of nitr ic acid is the manufacture of fertil izer, that if Du Pont did not supply the process, it could be bought elsewhere, a nd that several plants had already been erected in the USSR by Casale and Nitrogen Engineering of New York. The letter from Du Pont to He nry L. Stimson of th e State Department w ith reference to the proposed contract (dated April 20, 1929) states in part, \"It is true of course that nitric acid is used in the manufacture of munitions.\" Du Pont then claimed, \"It is impossible to distinguish between chemicals us ed for strictly comm ercial purposes and chemicals used for strictly munitions purposes.\" And as justification for its proposal, the fi rm said, \"We submit that the contemplated contr act will in no way give assi stance for the manufacture of munitions which cannot easily be ac quired elsewhere by the Soviets.\" Further, the company argued, there was nothing exclusive about the Du Pont process. The copy of the agreement in the State Departme nt files indicates that the Soviet union [wishes] to use in Russia the Du Pont process for the oxida tion of ammonia and [Du Pont] to place at its disposal sufficient data with respect to the design, construction and general information as to permit the satisfactory operation of such plants... the Company shall serve th e Russian Corporation in an advisory capacity and furnish upon reque st services of engineers and chemists so as to accomplish the purpose of the contract. By the late 1930s a Nitrogen Engineering- designed complex at Berezniki employed 25,000 workers and manufactured thermi te, powder, and nitroglycerin. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the Soviets lagged in all areas of che mical production outside the basic chemical technology absorbed in th e 1930s and 1940s. This lag had major military implications and since 1958 has inspired a massive purchasing campagin in the West. In the three years 1959-61 alone, the S oviet Union purchased at leas t fifty comple te chemical plants or equipment for such plants from no n-Soviet sources. The Am erican trade journal Chemical Week commented, with perhaps more accuracy than it realized, that the Soviet Union \"behaves as if it had no chemical i ndustry at all.\" Not onl y was Soviet industry producing little beyond ba sic heavy chemicals, but of great er consequence, it did not have the technical means of achieving substantial technical modernizatio n and expansion in a p roduct ran g e essential for a modern militar y state."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Western firms supplied designs and specif ications, process technology, engineering capability, equipment, and star tup and training programs. These contracts were package deals that provided more than the typical Wes tern \"turn-key\" contr act. Such contracts are unusual in the West (except pe rhaps in underdeveloped areas lacking elementary skills and facilities) but were very attractive an d highly profitable to Western firms. Many of the chemical plants built in the 1960 and 1970s programs had di rect military applications. In 1964 a British company — Power Gas Corporati on, Ltd. — built a $14 million plant for the manufacture of acetic acid in the US SR. In 1973 Lurnmus Engineering built another vast acetic ac id plant with Monsanto tec hnology and U.S. Export-Import bank loans. Hygrotherm Engineering, Ltd. of London contracted to suppl y an automatic heating and cooling plant (with heat generators, circula ting pumps, and control equipment) and other equipment for use in the manufacture of s ynthetic resisn. A plant was supplied for the production of synthetic glyceri n, which is used in explosiv es manufacture. Other plants were for the production of et hyl urea, synthetic fatty acids , sodium tripolyphosphate, carbon black, and germanium. All these pr oducts have military end-uses. Sulfuric acid, the most important of inorganic acids and industrial chem icals, is required in large quantities for explosives manufacture. Pr oduction of sulfuric acid in Russia increased from 121,000 tons in 1913 to just under 3,000,000 tons in 1953, 4,804,000 tons in 1958, and 8,518,000 tons in 1965. The Soviets have always util ized basic Western processes for the manufacture of their supply of sulfuric ac id and have reverse engineered th e equipment in their own machine- building plants. A recent Russian paper on sulfuric-a cid manufacture indica tes that in the mid-1960s, 63 percent of sulfuric-acid pr oduction was carried out according to a standardized version of one Western process. The remainder was produced by a \"Soviet process\" (utilizing fluidized bed roaster, electr ic precipator, towers, and contact apparatus) similar to the contact processes in use in the West. In 1965 Nordac , Ltd. of the United Kingdom sold a sulfuric-acid c oncentration plant with a capaci ty of 24 tons per day of 78 percent sulfuric acid to update S oviet sulfuric acid technology. Up to 1960 Russian output of fertilizers was mostly in the form of low-quality straight fertilizers. There was no producti on of the concentrated and mixe d fertilizers that are used in the West. Fertilizer plants ar e easily converted to explosives plants. Part of the fertilizer expansion program of the 1960s was the purch ase from the Joy Manufacturing Company of Pittsburgh of $10 million worth of equipment for potash mining. Congressman Lipscomb protested the issue of a license for this sale (Congressional Record, Aug. 28, 1963). While Lipscomb pointed out that potash can be used for manufacture of explosives, Forrest D. Hockersmith, of the Office of Export Control in the Departme nt of Commerce, replied, \"Our decision to license was heavily weighed by the fact that potassium fertilizer can best be characterized as 'peaceful goods'\" (Aug. 21, 1963). Hockersmit h did not, of course, deny that potash had an explosives end-use. A cluster of ten gigantic fert ilizer plants for the Soviets was arranged by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Armand Hammer's company) and built by Woodall-Duckham Construction Company, Ltd., and Newton Cham bers & Company, Lt d., of the United Kingdom.

Possibly the reported export of ballbearing machines to Russia to produce bearings for Soviet missiles may leave some readers with an uneasy feeling, but also with a vague need to co me to grips more concretely with the alliance. In Angola the most skeptical reader can see the al liance working on a daily basis. Angola, a one time Portuguese colony, was \"lib erated\" ten years ago by the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), a Marxist organization in alliance wi th Angolian nationalist groups. The MP LA was not elected and has neve r held elections. MPLA seized power and has been kept in power by 36,000 Cubans and about 1,200 Soviet military personnel. The Cubans and the Soviets are in Angola for the same reason Angolan Marxists will not allow free elections: because Marxis m does not represent th e people of Angola. The United States has been inhibited from en couraging democratic, fr eely-elected forces by groups within the U.S. State Department and the so-called Clark Amendment (repealed in 1985), sponsored by former Senator Clark, which forbade the U.S. from assisting any group that might challenge the Angolan Marxists. Yet the Soviets in Angola are ch allenged as they have never be en challenged before; for the first time in 60 years a Marxist regime is in danger of overthrow by internal democratic forces. Angolan guerrillas, know n as UNITA (National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola) have taken over one-thi rd of Angola, about 250,000 square miles, and control most of the countryside, particularly in the south. UNITA is an unusual organizati on. It is not American-backed. In fact, it is American corporations and the U.S. St ate Department that have st opped a UNITA victory. UNITA is unusual also in that it believes in free enterprise, free and secr et elections, pr ivate property, and decentralization of polit ical power. UNITA is led by Jonas Savimbi, aged 51, a ferocious-looking gentleman reminiscent of tele vision's \"Mr. T.\" Savimbi is a European educated black intellectual who believes in individual freedom.

The muddled, confused thinking of the United St ates is well illustra ted by a statement made by former U.S. Ambassador to Un ited Nations Donald McHenry, to the effect that the U.S. should not be surprised that the Soviets are aiding Angolan Marxists: \"That the Soviets are present to assist the Angolans and to assi st the Namibians... is no different from the presence of the United States in El Salv ador and U.S. assistance to E1 Salvador.\" The point, of course, that McHe nry avoids is that the Soviet objective, more than clearly demonstrated in the past 60 ye ars, is a totalitarian controll ed society without individual freedom. The Soviets have indeed assisted Marxist A ngola. As far back as 1981 Soviet military officers up to the rank of Colonel were killed and captured in Angol a. Soviet Air Force personnel have been captured in Angola (see Now , January 16, 1981.) The real oddity in Angola is th at the single most important factor preventing a free open society is an American multinational corpor ation. As succinctly stated by Congressman William L. Dickinson (July 1985), \"These Cuban troops ar e protecting American oil interests and they are preventing UNITA from overrunning the MPLA.\" In northeast Angola is the Cabinda oil comp lex owned by Gulf Oil Corporation (since March 1984, part of Chevron Oil of California ). CABINDA PROVID ES AT LEAST 80 PERCENT OF MARXIST ANGOLA'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE. The balance comes from diamond concessions operate d by Anglo-American Corpor ation. Soviet and Cuban assistance is paid for from these foreign exchange earnings. When we look closely at Chevron Gulf, we find that no less than a former U.S. Secretary of Defense, David Packard, has been in a position to thwart Gulf backing for Soviet Angola — yet did nothing. Gulf Oil Corporation owns Cabinda, and Gulf itself was taken over by Chevron in March 1984. Thus, we have two sets of directors to lo ok at, the original Gulf Oil directors who for a decade allowed the Gulf Cabinda operation to finance Marxist Angola, and the Chevron directors who had the opportunity to change corporate policy toward s subsidy of Marxist warfare.

At the same annual meeting that approved th e Chevron takeover of Gulf and so lent Chevron support to Marxist Angola, a Chevron director resigned. This was David Packard, Chairman of Hewlett-Packard a nd a former Secretary of Defens e. There is no record that Packard protested either Gulf support of Marxism or objected that Chevron should not join the band of American corporations who have aided world revolution. We doubt that Packard resigned on grounds of principle, becau se Packard was an Overseer of the Hoover Institution and Chairman of its Financial Committee back in the early 1970s when Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell attempted to put pre ssure on this author to stop publication of the earlier version of this book, National Suicide: Milita ry Aid to the Soviet Union. Another interesting facet to th is story of Soviet-multinationa l cooperation is in the amount of federal taxes paid by these gi ant firms. In 1976 Gulf had a fe deral tax rate of 2%. In 1984 Gulf claimed a tax refund, ev en while showing a profit of $313 million. Gulf 1984 tax rate was minus 8.3% (with a refund of $26 million). So in the same year that Gulf contributed most of Marxist Angola's foreign exchange and paid Angolan taxe s, it demanded $26 million refund from U.S. taxpaye rs.

Consequently, agricultural tractor, locomotive and automotive plants can be — and are — used to produce tanks, although mass production of tanks requi res equipment changes and new machine installations. Such civilian-to-milit ary plant conversions for tank and armored-car production have been successfully undertaken in automobile and locomotive pl ants in many countries. In the United States the Ford Motor Company, Cadill ac, and Chrysler have mass-produced tanks. In Italy the Fiat Company and in Fran ce the Renault Company, Citroen, and other automobile manufacturers have produced ta nks. In England the Vauxhall Motor Company was a tank producer in World War II. Am ong locomotive manufacturers both Baldwin Locomotive and American Locomotive in the United States produced tanks in World War II. Tractor plants have been successfully converted to ta nk production — for example, Massey Harris in the United States and all Ca terpillar tractor plants in the Soviet Union. A tractor plant is well suited to tank and self-propelled gun pr oduction. The tractor plants at Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabi nsk, erected with almost comp lete American assistance and equipment, and the Kirov plant in Leningr ad, reconstructed by Fo rd, were used from the start to produce Soviet tanks, armored ca rs, and self-propelled guns. The enthusiasm with which this tank and ar mored-vehicle program was pursued, and the diversion of the best Russian engineers and mate rial priorities to military purposes, have been responsible for at least part of the current Soviet pr oblem of lagging tractor production and periodic famines. Since 1931, up to a half of the productive capacity of these \"tractor\" plants has been used for tank and armored-car production. 34 In both the State Department and the Germ an Oberkommando files, there are reports confirming the planned adaptability of Soviet general-e quipment plants for war use — that is, the plants were originally planned for war use. For example, \"The heavy industry plants are fitted with special attachme nts and equipment held in reserve which in a few hours will convert the p lants into munitions factories.\" 35 "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Tank assembly, like the production of autom obiles, trucks, and tractors, is normally straight-line with components fed into the main assembly operation from subassembly lines. The components required for tanks are usually peculiar to such weapons. Tank power-plants and tank power-trains are not normally used in commercial-type vehicles in the West. However, in the Soviet Union commercial engi nes have been used in tank installations by combining two power plants in one tank, for example, the SU-76 self-propelled gun with two standard Dodge autom obile engines, or by adapting aircraft engines. 36 Machinery and machine tools for tank production ar e similar to those us ed in the production of heavy equipment, with additional special- purpose tools. Transfer machines required for automotive-type engines, large boring mills, larg e planers, radial drills, and heavy welding equipment are also utilized. Consequently, any automobile, truck, locomotive or tractor production plant with straight- line assembly operations can be converted to the mass production of tanks by the addition of certain specialized equipment and by u tilizing components and subassemblies made elsewhere for the specific tank vehicle to be assembled. Soviet tractor plants were established in th e early I930s with major U.S. technical and equipment assistance. The Stalingrad tractor plan t was completely built in the United States, shipped to Stalingrad, and then installed in pr efabricated steel buildings also purchased in the United States. This unit, together with the Kharkov and Chelyabinsk plants and the rebuilt Kirov plant in Leningrad, comprised the Soviet tractor industry at that time, and a considerable part of the S oviet tank industry as well. During the war, equipment from Kharkov was evacuated and installed behind the Ur als to form the Altai tractor plant, which opened in 1943. Three postwar tractor plants were in opera tion by 1950: the Valdimir plant opened in 1944, the Lipetsk plant in 1947, the Minsk plant a nd the Kharkov assembly plant in I950. This was the basic structure of the Soviet tractor industry in the 1960s and 1970s. These plants produced tractors with a heavy emphasis on crawler (cater pillar-tread) models rather than the rubber-tired tractors more commonly used in the United States. The 1959 USDA technical delegation esti mated that 50 percent of the current output was in crawler models, as contrasted to only 4 percent in the United States. The mili tary implications of this product mix is obvi ous from Table 12-1.

From this stock of Western m odels, together with technical- assistance agreements with foreign firms and the continui ng purchase of foreign protot ypes, the Soviets developed a formidable tank force for World War II. The Carden-Lloyd (the predecessor of the Br itish Brengun carrier of World War II) was a 1.69-ton machine-gun carrier first produced by Vickers-Armstrong, Ltd., in 1929. The Mark-VI model sold to the Soviets had a Ford Model-T 4-cylinde r 22.5-horsepower water- cooled engine and a Ford pl anetary transmission. This b ecame the Soviet T-27 light reconnaissance tank produced at th e Bolshevik plant in Leningrad. The Ordzhonikidze Tractor Plant at Kharkov started work on the T-26, based on the British Vickers-Armstrong 6-tonner at a bout the same time. There were three versions — A, B and C — of which B and C became the standard Soviet mode ls produced until 1941. Similarly, the Soviet T-37 and T-38 amphibious vehicles were based on the Carden-Lloyd Amphibian, known as the Model-A4 E 11 in the British Army.

Numerous Soviet versions of Christie tanks and armore d vehicles were produced in the late 1920s and 1930s. Two chassis of th e Christie M-1931 mode l medium tank (MB) were purchased by the Soviet Union in 1932 from the U.S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation. After further development work this became not only the Soviet T-32 (the basic Soviet tank of World War II), but also seve ral other development models in the USSR: first the BT (12 tons), followed by the BT-5 and the BT-28 produced at Chelyabinsk. The Soviet T-34 and the American M-3, both based on the Christie, had the same 12- cylinder aero engine, a V-t ype Liberty of 338 horsepower. Ogorkiewicz comments on the Christie model series as follows: The power-weight ratio was act ually higher than could be efficiently used, but the Russians copied it all and confined their development la rgely to armament, which increased from a 37-millimeter gun on the original models of 1931, to 45-millimeter guns on BT-5 of 1935, and eventually to short 76.2-millimeter guns on some of the final models of the series. Both the Soviet T-28 medium 29-ton tank and the T-35 45-ton heavy tank resembled British models — the A-6 medium ta nk and the A-1 Vickers Indepe ndent, respectively. Imported French Renault designs also contributed to Russian tank knowledge. During the 1933 entente between France and th e Soviet Union, the Renault Company delivered $11 million worth of \"small fast tanks a nd artillery tractors\" to the S oviet Union and supplied experts from the Schneider works and Panhard Levasseur , skilled in the armored-car and tank field. The Famous T-34 Medium Tank The Soviet T-34 and the modified T-34/85 were first introduced in World War II and used extensively against Americans in the Kor ean War. The model was later used in the Hungarian revolt and in \"wars of liberation\" to the present day. The T-34 is an excellent design and a formidable weapon. It emphasizes th e ability of the Sovi ets to design weapons while still dependent on the West for production facilities and basic technical advances.

The Russians copied these, built Chri stie tanks, and then incorporated the Christie suspension system into the T-34. The first Russian Christies had the same engines as the U.S. Christie — a Liberty 12-cylinder V-type of 338 horsepower with forced-water cooling. In the 1920s the Chase National Bank of New York (now Chase Manhattan) attempted to arrange illegal export of large quantit ies of these Liberty engines to the Soviet Union at the price of $2,000 each. In any event, the T-34 incor porated the Christie suspensi on from the Unite d States, but generally used a 500-horsepower V-type diesel developed from the German B.M.W. diesel engine. The T-34/85 was the T-34 with significan tly increased firepower. Ball bearings on the T-34 and T-34/85 were manufac tured on Swedish equipment. The welding work on the T-34 was at first immensely crude, but as The Welding Engineer (Dec. 1952) pointed out: \"The T-34 was designed wi th one idea in mind — to provide firepower. Any humanitarian considerations, like protection of th e crew, are purely secondary.\" The original T-34s were built from several million tons of armor-plate imported from the United States. In July 1934 Henry Disston & Sons, Inc. requested War Department permission to accede to a Soviet request, \"in training their technicians to make tank armorplate of the same quality as they now make for this Government\" (Russia 400.114, War Office). The T-34 was followed by the improved T-44 a nd then by the T-54, with the basic T-44 chassis and using Christie-system torsion-bar suspension. This was the standard Soviet tank until recently; it was used in the Hungarian revolt in 1956, in South Vietnam in 1972, and still in use in most Warsaw Pact countries. The Red Army has always used diesel engines in its medi um and heavy tanks. This tank- engine series is the V-2 a nd V-12 water-cooled, rated to 550 brake horsepower (bhp) at 2,150 revolutions per minute (rpm). According to Ogorkiewicz, the original Russian water- cooled V-12 engine was a successful diesel adaptation of contemporary aero-engine designs. Used on all Soviet medium and hea vy tanks up to World War II, it was a large 2,860 cubic-inch engine, based on a German B.M.W. aircraft design, and developed about 500 bhp. Soviet em-ephasis on diesel s has continued since World War II, while other Soviet armored vehicles have used automobile gaso line engines. The T- 70 light tank uses two GAZ-202 70-horsepower engines from the Ford-Gor ki plant.

The public plea of internationlist businessmen is that trade brings peace. This is usually phrased along the following lines. This example is from Maur ice Stans, friend of Richard Nixon, former Secretary of Comm erce, and Wall Street invest ment banker: \"History has shown that where there is increasing trade be tween countries... there is a tendency toward increasing understanding.\" Unfortunately for Maurice Stans' credibility, no historian or politici an has ever produced evidence that trade necessarily and automatical ly leads to increa sed understanding. The statement has no empirical justification at all. It sounds good, that's all. Why not? Because no such evidence exists. While it is true that peace encourages trade, this does not mean that trade encour ages peace. In fact, trade has often enabled aggressive countries to go to war —witne ss the aviation gasoline and stee l scrap shipments to Japan and Standard Oil's agr eements on hydrogenation patents with I.G. Farben of Germany prior to World War II. The blunt truth is that trade with the Soviet Union from 1917 to the present has built the Free World an enemy of the first order. Mo reover, the technological component of this continuing trade enables the Sovi et Union to pursue its programs of world conquest. It costs the American taxpayer $300 billion a year to counter this Soviet threat. Obviously, claims that incr easing trade is accompanied by increasing understanding are false. A more accurate characterization in the S oviet case appears to be that increasing trade is accompanied by increasing conflict (i.e., misunderstanding), because the Kremlin is encouraged to believe that capitalists are be having as Lenin predicted they would behave. The concept of \"peaceful trade\" with Communi st countries assumes some positive causal link between trade and peace. It is a false assumption. The overlooked link is the relationshi p between trade and casualties, and is contained in one"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"word: technology. From the Soviet viewpoint, th e benefit of U.S.-Soviet trad e is the acquisition from the United States of the technology required fo r building and maintain ing the Soviet power base. This subsidized technology is the basis of the Soviet military struct ure, as is proved by the Soviets' own statements. The armament s produced by Russia's American-subsidized military-industrial complex are used to promote Soviet global expansion. There are four logical steps in this process: 41 1. Trade between the United States and the USSR (with its key technological component). 2. Consequent buildup of the Sovi et military-industrial complex. 3. Use of the U.S.-subsidized Sovi et military-industrial complex to provide inputs for Soviet armaments production. 4. Use of these armanents against the United States and its allies. This is the \"trade-technology-a rmaments-war\" cycle. It sugge sts that \"peaceful trade\" promoted by successive administrations should be entitled \"war trade.\" If any of the links in this cy cle can be broken (or shown to be false), the argument collapses. However, no link is demonstrably false. Indeed, there is evidence that the trade-casualties link is stronger than even the mo st pessimistic have envisaged. We trade freely with European nations because these nations ha ve no deceitful intent to use the technological component of this trade against the United States. Nor has the United States any hostile intent towards these European countries. Free trade is vital and necessary, and both sides benefit from its advantages. However, gains from free trade utlimately depend on intent . Where countries are potentially hosti le and make hostile use of imported technology, the gains from free trade must be modified by the hostile intent of the trading partner. In other words, \"peaceful trade\" is only peaceful if Soviet intent is peaceful. Why isn't this information and logic made available to the public? Then at least the DMB would have official oppos ition to their sp urious arguments. For some reason or another the Washington bureaucracy in State and Commerce has by and large, with some exceptions, taken a position inconsistent with its own files. The Bureaucrats' View of \"Peaceful Trade\" The State and Commerce Depa rtments have consistently rejected the argument that \"peaceful trade\" can assi st Soviet military objectives. Fo r example, a 1969 State Department leaflet asserts (under the heading \"US exports do not help Hanoi\"): Over two-thirds of our exports to th e Soviet Union and East Europe are foodstuffs and raw materials for consumpt ion within their economies. There is no evidence that our ex p orts of such g oods to these countries release resources"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"for manufacturing war materials for North Vietnam. 42 What is wrong with this statement? The Soviet Union needs — and receives — U.S. technology, not \"foodstuffs and raw materials.\" The bureaucracy may claim U.S. wheat does not go to Vi etnam and Cuba, but it avoids the crucial point that export of our wheat to the Sovi ets released Soviet wheat for export to Hanoi. No economist wi ll deny that our technical tran sfers release Soviet domestic resources for armaments produc tion. The State De partment assertion is therefore a compound of distortion and ignorance. These unsubstantiated distortions are given to Congress as verifiable truth. For example, Edwin M. Martin, Assistant Se cretary of State for Economic Affairs, made the following statement to Congress in 1961: \"I don't think there is convincing evidence that the net advantage to the Soviet Union of the conti nuation of trade is a major factor — or a particularly significant factor in the rate of their overall eco nomic developmen t in the long term.\" 43 This is an untrue statement. There is also confusion concerning the S oviet practice of copying. For example, the following exchange took place before a congressional committee in 1961. Mr. Lipscomb: Does the Department of Co mmerce feel that Russia has developed a great deal of their agricultural equipment from prototypes obtained both legally and illegally from the United States? Mr. Behrman: No sir, I don't think that the ev idence we have indicates that the equipment that they themselves produce copies — that they produce copies of equipment which we have supplied. 44 Again, a wildly untrue statement. Even well-informed members of Congress have taken positions directly opposed to the evidence. Senator Jacob Javits of New York co mmented: \"Trade with the West as a general matter must necessarily be a marginal factor in the performance and potentialities of the Soviet economy.\" 45 There exist, presumably unknown to Senator Javits and the others quoted above, three volumes of detailed evidence that totally refutes these statements. 46 A popular book in the 1930s was You Can't Do Business with Hitler! The moral and national-security arguments in this book appa rently apply only to Hitler's brand of totalitarianism. There is extraordinary in consistency in the treatment of Hitlerian totalitarianism and Soviet totalitarianism. Ind eed, there is some direct evidence and a great deal of indirect evidence th at the policymakers in Washington do not view the Soviet Union as a totalitarian power at all. At the end of World War II, the conclusi on of an interagency committee on German industr y , with members from the State and Commerce De p artments, was as follows:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Committee is unanimously of the opinion that the major force for war represented in a motor vehicle industry is its availability as a major machine shop aggregation, under able manageme nt and engineering, which can be turned, by conversion, to production of an extremely wide va riety of military products. Its role as a produ cer of combat and military transport vehicles ranks second in significance. 47 Yet today State and Commerce argue that the e xport of equipment for a motor vehicle industry is \"peaceful trade\" — even when milltary vehicles produced by previously exported technology are ph otographed in Vietnam, Cuba, Afghanistan, Angola and Nicaragua. Obviously, no amount of hard evidence can shake these people from their illusions. The policymakers are locked onto a brand of totali tarianism which, to them, is morally and strategically acceptable. U.S. assistance to the Marxist brand of totalitari anism is not limited to the Soviet Union. In 1971, for example, the State Depart ment attempted to help Allend e, the Marxist president of Chile, to purchase aircra ft and paratroop equipmen t in the United States (Indianapolis News, July 1971). Three months later Allende attempted to impose complete Marxist control in Chile. Once again th e State Department wants to he lp a Marxist clique to impose its rule on an unwilling population. The assertion that we should exchange our technology for Sovi et raw materials will not stand penetrating analysis. Soviet raw materi als only become competit ive to our enormous low-grade domestic reserves if their extracti on is subsidized by U.S. loans and guarantees — to the disadvantage of the American taxpaye r. From the national security viewpoint, the \"exchange\" is absurd. Once our technology is passed to the Soviet Union it cannot be reclaimed, it becomes an integr al part of their military in dustrial operations. But Russian raw material supplies, developed with our a ssistance, can be cut off any time the Soviets wish. In other words, once again our polic ymakers exchange some thing for nothing and charge it to the Americ an taxpayer and citizen. Useless Pinpricks as Policy In early May 1985, President Reagan embargoed U.S. trade with Nica ragua. This followed what a State Department official described as a \"disturbing pattern of behavior\" on the part of Nicaragua. But the White House mi ssed a point — and an opportunity. Nicaragua and its \"distu rbing behavior\" is a mere incide nt in a vast ever-expanding global game. Moreover, the Nicaraguan embargo has loophol es that make it virtually ineffective. For example, foreign affiliates of U.S. firms ar e not embargoed. In brief, if the invoice is on foreign subsidiary, that's legal. And don't th ink American firms won't scramble for the loophole. The global problem is not pinpric k Nicaragua — it is th e unholy alliance of the multinationals and the Soviet Union. Follow these logica: steps: • The Sandanista revolution onl y survives because of Marxist su pp ression and"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Soviet logistical backing. • The Soviets survive and have become militarily awesome because the West has a sixty-year-old policy of technical , economic, financia l and even political subsidy of the Soviet Union. • The multinationals are the mainspri ng for technical and economic subsidy, from Kama River to the latest CDC com puters. And they are more than willing to bend the truth to make a buck. • Our political esta blishment, as exemplified in the Council on Foreign Relations, is the mainspring behind politi cal subsidy of the Soviet Union, as exemplified in the Yalta agreement, National Security Memorandum No. 68 and so-called \"detente.\" Under this system the Soviet Union is never he ld fully accountable for its international acts. For example: • The Soviets illegally occupy the l ong independent countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. • The Soviet Union has occupied the long independent nation of Afghanistan. • Soviet troops are based in Poland, Hungary, Rumania and Czechoslovakia. • Soviet troops are active in Cuba, A ngola, and a dozen other hot spots around the world including Nicaragua. This adds up to global aggression. Yet the political establishment and its Congressional allies told us that peaceful coexistence a nd detente with the Soviets would bring peace. The American public has never been told by any Administration the Soviet definition of \"peaceful coexistence.\" That detente in the S oviet interpretation includes the RIGHT to continue so-called wars of liberation and to further encroach upon the Western world. Western governments have persisted in the il lusion of detente as peace, knowing full well that the Marxist interpretation of peaceful co existence is aggression, that peace is indeed war. It is this official inaction that has encourag ed the deaf mute blindm en to further Soviet ambitions for their own personal gain. Multinational Businessmen an d the Politics of Greed Who benefits from technological transfers to the Soviet Un ion? Basically two groups: the Soviets themselves and the comparative handful of companies, almost all multinationals, who set up and profit fr om Soviet contracts. Soviet business is profitable. Some American companies have been sucking in this profit since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Chase National was involved in ille g al ex p orts to"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, while Chas e Manhattan was the lead financing bank for the Kama River project. Caterp illar Tractor was involved in th e First Five Year Plan in 1930, and still involved in the Siberian pipe line \"Russia No. 6\" project in the 1980s. The hundreds of examples cited here are not accidents. Many individual congressmen and persons outside government have attempted to stop the expor t of military goods to the Soviet Union in the face of business pressu res. Samuel Gompers tr ied in the 1920s. U.S. Navy of-ricers risked court-martia l in the 1930s in their effort to stop President Franklin D. Roosevelt from approving the sale of military equipment to the Soviets. The Senate investigated the \"machine tools\" case in 1945 -46 when Commerce officials tried to send tank-gun milling equipment to the Soviet Un ion. Warnings were ra ised in the 1950s by Congressman Lipscomb and others about the results of building up Soviet military strength. In the 1960s individual American firms and engi neers protested agains t the export of ball bearings processing e quipment which could only be used to process bearings for Soviet missile-guidance systems. In th e 1980s Department of Defense has raised a clear warning. Are we to believe that Mr. Nicholaas Leyds, general manage r of Bryant Chucking Grinder Company of Springfie ld, Vermont, did not know that his grinding mach ines are used to process the races for ball bear ings in missile-guidance system s? When Bryant has sold the same machine to the U.S. government for the same purpose? Or that the Hammer family does not know the re sults of its seventy year association with the USSR? In 1919 Dr. Julius Ha mmer was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist party of the United States a nd in 1985 Armand Hammer (his son and early business partner) is described as America's \"No. 1 Capitalist.\" It is not an accident. The deaf mute blindmen have always known the exact end-uses of the exported equipment. They have been brazen enough to persis t in building up the Soviet military-industrial complex whil e pleading \"civilizing the Bo lsheviks\" (1918) and \"peaceful trade\" (1985). Above all there are se veral disturbing aspects to this whole business of selling our technology to the Soviets. Fi rst, multinational banks and business groups have their own people in all administrations pus hing for their self-interested pr ofitable projects. Second, the more prominent of these businessmen (Arm and Hammer and David Ro ckefeller come to mind) deal directly with the Soviet Union almost as independent fiefdoms. The business and personal relati onships of Henry Kissinger and the Rockefeller family, for instance, are too close for administrative obj ectivity. Neither has He nry Kissinger been on the receiving end of a bullet, he doesn't have to pay the price for his policies. Indeed, in most cases policymakers have never undertak en any occupation wh ere the cost of a wrong decision fell upon their own should ers - and that may be one of the major problems. The following extract is from th e conclusion of Kissinger's book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (p. 431): A statesman must act as if his inspirations were already experience, as if his aspirations were truth. He must bridge the gap between society's experience and his vision, between its tradition and its future."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Note the words \"act as if.\" Act \"as if\" fantasy were reality is the clear implication. Act \"as if\" objectives (whatever they may be) are always moral. In other words, anything is real if you wish it to be, and anything is mo ral if you want it to be. Is it then accidental that Kissinger's devastating detente pol icy was only beneficial to his proteges? (For example, the Rockefel ler controlled Chase Manhattan Bank). Then the amoral two-facedness of many DMBs has been commented on by several observers: At times it seemed that the busine ss world preferred to ignore the policy makers in Washington. One prominent member of the council [The U.S.- U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council ] remembers meeting after Nixon's resignation with four other industrialists, several admir als, and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff late in 1974. One admiral bewailed the military disadvantages U.S. forces suffered becau se of certain technology transfers. The next day, the same industria list attended a private di nner in New York given by a major investment ba nking house. The guest of honor was Dzhermen Gvishiani, the Soviet official whos e specialty was buying high technology in the West. One after another, the thirty other businessmen at the dinner rose to boast about the last big transaction they had made with Gvishiani. 'The dichotomy between the l uncheon in Washington and the dinner in New York was just astounding,' the businessman reca lled. 'These guys were bragging as if they had just sold a ton of frankfurters.' 48 This atmosphere of \"bragging as if they had just sold a t on of frankfurters\" has been officially encouraged because until very recently, no offici al in any Admi nistration has stood up in public and castigated the deaf mute blindmen. In recent years Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger and Assistant Secret ary of Defense Richard Perle have to some extent changed the nature of the public deba te — but State and Comm erce still drag their feet. Motivated by the lure of profit and in the abse nce of official chasti sement, the deaf mute blindmen have run the show where tr ade with the Soviets is concerned. Through the Export-Import Bank they have recei ved official, less than market loaves, subsidised by the taxpayer, for projects w ith military potential. Ex-Im provided $153 million for Kama River, $180 million for Occidental 's string of chemical plants — at half the prime rate. When this latt er venture was approved, Willia m J. Casey was Chairman of Export Import Bank even while publicly today Casey disclaim s knowledge of our build-up of the USSR. Other businessmen have appeared before Congr ess and made statements inconsistent with the bulk of the evidence. For example, we know that the Soviets have successfully reverse- engineered thousands of U.S. processes. Yet one businessm an appeared before Congress and denied the usefulness of the process: Senator Nunn: You say reversing engineering is very difficult and time consuming even if they have the eq uipment itself, and all the plans and s p ecifications?"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Mr. Bell: To put it in production. That is true. You can get a lot of valuable information off of it. But to put that equipment into production, even if you had what I said, they do not have the com ponents. That is th e key to the whole thing. The best system engineer in the world, that is what we do in system engineering, is only as good as the elements he has to work with. They do not have the components in the Soviet Union. 49 Again Charles Lecht, former President of Advanced Comput er Techniques Corp., tried to advance the line that the only Soviet interest was curiosity rather than technological need: Primarily I have come to the conclusion that the conc ept that the Soviets want U.S. technology because they can't make it themselves or they can't buy it themselves is a fallacious one. I have concluded that the Soviet technology establishment — in the country which pr oduces more scientific literature than any other country in the world — is capab le of producing what it wants. I have thus concluded that the Soviets ha ve been looking for U.S. technology primarily because they want to find out how our mil itary materiel work, our missiles, our aircraft, our rada r, our sonar, and the like. 50 In brief, the bottom line is greed and the gr eed has been allowed to reign supreme because official Washington has openly enc ouraged technological transfers.

BACK "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" CONCLUSIONS Treason \"Technology cannot be kept from th e Soviets by endless paperwork requirements. Americans w ho ship crucial weapons a nd documents to them are criminals: criminals are glad to sign papers.\"  — George Gilder, New York Times Are these businessmen, the deaf mu te blindmen internationalists, also guilty of treason? It is interesting to initially look at this question from the viewpoint of the other side, the Soviet side. Avraham Shifrin, a former Soviet Defense official, ha s a blunt conclu sion. Shifrin calls the transfers treason and \"they (the businessmen) should be shot\" (page 21). To take another example from the other side, the Marxist rebels in El Salvador, the Faranbundo Marti National Liberation Front, recei ve aid from the Soviet Union. At the same time they claim that our aid to the el ected Salvadoran Government makes our military advisors in El Salvador legitima te targets for assassination, i.e., the U.S. is an enemy just by virtue of economic subsidy. In brief, the other side interprets aid, even with no technological component, as equivalent to treason. In the original version of this book, National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union, published in 1974, we declined to term subsidy to the Soviets as treason because the vital element of intent was missing. This conclusion was phrased as follows: Do the actions described in this book [i.e. National Suicide] constitute \"adhering\" to these enemies, \"g iving them Aid and Comfort\"? The actions do not legally constitute treason. The Cons titution defines the term strictly, for the intention of the framers, with good reason, was to deny Congress the right to in terpret treason too freel y. Moreover, the body of relevant case law is not substantial. The Cramer and Haupt cases after World War I suggest that both intent to commit treason and overt treasonable acts are required, in addition to thorough proof. Wh ile the actions described here could be interpreted as giving immediate \"Aid and Comfort\" to the Soviet Union, there is no specific eviden ce of intent, and in-. te nt is a vital requirement. Idiocy, inefficiency, intelle ctual myopia, and so on, do not suggest intent (p. 240). We need to pose the question again, given the accumulating evidence of the last 11 years. Does this sequence of events and actions fall within the meaning of treason? Specifically, does military aid to the Soviet Union constitute \"adhering to their enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort\"? as defined in Article III, Sect ion 3 of the Constitution of the United States. 51 "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Are the Soviets Enemies? The Soviets have always been explicit about their intenti ons — so was Hitler in Mein Kampf. Objective truth has no place in Communist morality, by their own statements. Any statement that will a dvance the cause of world communi sm is regarded as truthful, acceptable, and perfectly normal. As far back as 1919, Zinoviev put it well in a statement that applies to the Viet C ong and the Sandanistas as mu ch as to the revolutionary Bolsheviks: We are willing to sign an unfavorable peace. It would only mean we should put no trust whatever in the piece of paper we should sign. We should use the breathing space so obtained in order to gather our strength. 52 This immoral dogma — moral only in Marx ist ideology — was emphasized by Joseph Stalin: Words must have no relations to actions — otherwise what kind of diplomacy is it? Words are one thing, actions another. Good words are a mask for concealment of bad deeds. Sincere diplomacy is no more possible than dry water or wooden iron. 53 In 1955 the staff of the U.S. Senate Co mmittee on the Judiciary examined the Soviet historical record and, not unexpectedly in the light of the foregoing statements, came to the following conclusion: The staff studied nearly a thousand treaties and agreements ... both bilateral and multilateral, which the Soviets have entered into not only with the United States, but with countries all over the world. The staff found that in the 38 short years since the Soviet Union came into existence, its Gove rnment had broken its word to virtually every country to which it ever gave a signed promise. It signed treaties of nonaggression with ne ighboring states and then absorbed those states. It signed promises to refrain from revol utionary activity inside the countries with which it sought \"friends hip\" and then cynically broke those promises. It was violating the first agreement it ever signed with the United States at the very moment the Soviet envoy, Litvinov, was putting his signature to that agreement, and it is still violating the same agreement in 1955. It broke the promises it made to the Western na tions during previous meetings \"at the summit\" in Teheran and Yalt a. It broke lend-lease agre ements offered to it by the United States in order to keep Stal in from surrendering to the Nazis. It violated the charter of the United Nations . It keeps no internat ional promises at all unless doing so is clearly advantageous to the Soviet Union. [We] seriously doubt whether during the w hole history of civi lization any great nation has ever made as perfidious a record as this in so short a time. 54 More recently in the 1970s and 1980s the Sovi ets have broken the SALT treaties and used the era of detente to develo p an awe-ins p irin g wea p ons arsenal."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Consequently, the history of S oviet foreign relations from 1917 to the present suggests, for those who can interpret history, two conclusions: 1. The Soviets will not keep their word in any foreign agreement. 2. Their intent is self-admittedly aggr essive, with world conquest as the ultimate goal. The 1970s era of detente was a sham. Increased U.S.-Soviet trade, allegedly designed to lower tensions, was entirely contrary to historical observation and rational deduction. Mikhail Suslov, longtime Russian Communist Party theoretici an, stated in 1972 that the U.S.-Soviet detente was temporary and that, so far as the Soviet Union is concerned, merely an interlude to gain strength fo r the next stage of th e battle against \"imp erialist aggression.\" Suslov in 1972 repeated and reinforced Zinoviev 's 1919 statement; there is no change of heart or direction. The Soviet Record of Aggression A review of the human cost of Soviet double-dealing emphasi zes not only the risk we run by attempts to mellow Soviet st atism, but the extreme seriousne ss of the actions of the deaf mute blindmen. In every year since the Bolshevik Revolution the Soviets have murdered their own citizens for political reasons: that is, fo r alleged or real opposition to the Soviet state. The AFL-CIO has mapped Soviet forced labor camps. Moreover, in every ye ar since 1917 the Soviets have attacked other countries or interfered massively in their internal affairs. 55 The human cost of the Bolshe vik Revolution and the ensuing civil war in Ru ssia has been estimated at 7 million Russians. Between 1930 and 1950 more than 20 million Russians died in forced labor camps. Khrushchev pers onally supervised the massacre of more than 10,000 Ukrainians at Vinnitsa. Soviet agents were in Spain before the Sp anish Civil War of 1936 and unquestionably had some role in starting it (cost: 275,000 killed). The supply of Soviet armament s to the Spanish Republic is known from material in the records of the German military attache at Ankara, Turkey. 56 Soviet arms shipments began in September 1936. Soviet intelligence agents, operating in Spain before the war broke out, were under General Ulansky, who wa s also responsible for logistic s. In addition to supplies, the Soviets sent 920 military \"a dvisers\": 70 air force of-ricers, 100 other officers (as early as September 1936), and 750 enlisted men. From September 1936 to March 1938 about 110 shiploads of Russian military s upplies left Odessa en route to Spain, almost all from plants built by the deaf mute blindmen. Foreshadow ing the situation when the USSR supplied Cuba and North Vietnam, only th irty-two of these ships were under the Soviet flag — and most of these Soviet-flag vesse ls were foreign-built. These 110 vessels carried the following armaments to Spain from the new Western-built S oviet plants: Tanks and armored cars 731 Planes (mostly fighter aircraft) 242 Guns 707 Antiaircraft Guns 27 Trucks 1,386"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"What was the U.S. technical component of these arms? The tanks sent to Spain in 1936 were based on British Vicker s or U.S. Christie designs. Soviet aviation technology was mainly Ameri can (except for French Potez and Italian seaplane designs).

After this, in 1937, Stalin's Red Army purge killed 30,000 — the cr eam of the Soviet military. Two years later, in 1939, Russia attacked Fi nland. Cost: 273,000 Finns and Russians killed.

The weapons spectrum for which this range of data is required are the production models of: tanks (heavy, medium and light), armored cars, self propelled guns, trucks and tractors, guns of all types (from tank guns down to hand guns), ammunition, planes, naval craft, rocket launc hers, missiles. In other words the standard models in the broad weapons spectrum.

This appendix contains the testimony presented by the author before the Republican Party National Security Subcommittee at the 1972 Miami Beach convention. The author's appearance was made under the auspices of the American Conservative Union; the chairman of the subcommittee was Senator John Tower of Texas. Edith Kermit Roosevelt subsequently used this testimony for her syndicat ed column in such newspapers as the Union Leader (Manchester, N.H.). Both major wire services received copies from the American Conservative Union; they were not distri buted. Congressman John G. Schmitz then arranged for duplicate copies to be ha nd-delivered to both UPI and AP. The wire services would not carry the testimony although the author is an internationally known academic researcher with three books published at Stanford University, and a forthcoming book fr om the U.S. Naval Institute. The testimony was later re printed in full in Human Events (under the title of \"The Soviet Military-Industrial Complex\") and Review of the News (under the title of \"Suppressed Testimony of Antony C.

I am here because I believe — and Congressman Ashbrook be lieves — that the American public should have these facts. I have s p ent ten y ears in research on Soviet technolo gy . What it is — w hat it can do — and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"particularly where it came from. I have published three books and several articles summarizing the work. It was privately financ ed. But the results have been avai lable to the Government. On the other hand I have had major difficulti es with U.S. Government censorship. I have 15 minutes to tell you about this work. In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet technol ogy. Almost all — perhaps 90-95 percent — came directly or indirectly from the United Stat es and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries have built the S oviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive constructi on job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been carried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance. Listening to Administration spokesmen — or some newspaper pundits — you get the impression that trade with the Soviet Uni on is some new miracle cure for the world's problems. That's not quite accurate. The idea that trade with the Soviets might bring peace goes back to 1917. The earliest proposal is dated December 1917-just a few weeks after th e start of the Bolshevik Revolution. It was implemented in 1920 whil e the Bolsheviks we re still trying to consolidate their hold on Russia. The result was to guarantee that the Bolsheviks held power: they needed foreign supplies to survive. The history of our construction of the Soviet Union has been blacked out — much of the key information is still clas sified — along with the other mistakes of the Washington bureaucracy. Why has the history been blacked out? Because 50 years of dealings with the Soviet s has been an economic success for the USSR and a political failure for the United States. It has not stopped war, it has not given us peace. The United States is spendi ng $80 billion a year on defense against an enemy built by the United States and West Europe. Even stranger, the U.S. apparent ly wants to make sure this en emy remains in the business of being an enemy. Now at this point I've probably lost some of you. What I have sa id is contrary to everything you've heard from the intellec tual elite, the Administrati on, and the business world, and numerous well-regarded Senato rs — just about everyone. Let me bring you back to earth. First an authentic statement. It's authentic because it was part of a conversation between Stalin and W. Averell Harrim an. Ambassador Harrima n has been prominent in Soviet trade since the 1930's and is an outs poken supporter of yet more trad e. This is what Ambassador Harriman reported back to the State De partment at the end of World War II: \"Stalin p aid tribute to the assistance rendered b y the United States to Soviet industr y before"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"and during the War. Stalin * said that about. two-thirds of all the large indus trial enterprises in the Soviet Union has been built with the United States' help or technical assistance.\" I repeat: \"two-thirds of all the large industrial enterprises in th e Soviet Union had been built with the United States' help or technical assistance.\" Two-thirds. Two out of three. Stalin could have said that th e other one-third of large indus trial enterprises were built by firms from Germany, Fran ce, Britain and Italy. Stalin could have said also that the tank pl ants, the aircraft plants, the explosive and ammunition plants originated in the U.S. That was June 1944. The massive technical assi stance continues right down to the present day. Now the ability of the Soviet Union to create any kind of military mach ine, to ship missiles to Cuba, to supply arms to North Vietnam, to supply arms for use agai nst Israel — all this depends on its domestic industry. In the Soviet Union about three-quarters of the military budget goes on purchases from Soviet factories. This expenditure in Soviet industry makes sens e. No Army has a mach ine that churns out tanks. Tanks are made from alloy steel, plastics, rubber and so forth. The alloy steel, plastics and rubber are made in Soviet factories to mil itary specifications. Just like in the United States. Missiles are not produced on missile-making m achines. Missiles are fabricated from aluminum alloys, stainl ess steel, electrical wi ring, pumps and so forth. The aluminum, steel, copper wire and pumps are also made in Soviet factories. In other words the Soviet military gets its pa rts and materials from S oviet industry. There is a Soviet military-industrial complex just as there is an Americ an military-industrial complex. This kind of reasoning makes sense to the ma n in the street. The farmer in Kansas knows what I mean. The salesman in California knows what I mean. Th e taxi driver in New York knows what I mean. But the policy makers in Washington do not accept this kind of common sense reasoning, and never have done. So let's take a look at the Sovi et industry that provides the part s and the materials for Soviet armaments: the guns, tanks, aircraft. The Soviets have the largest iron and steel plant in the world. It was built by McKee Cor p oration. It is a co py of the U.S. Steel p lant in Gar y , Indiana."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"All Soviet iron and steel tec hnology comes from the U.S. a nd its allies. The Soviets use open hearth, American el ectric furnaces, American wide stri p mills, Sendzimir mills and so on — all developed in the West and shipped in as peaceful trade. The Soviets have the largest t ube and pipe mill in Europe — one million tons a year. The equipment is Fretz-Moon, Salem, Aetna Sta ndard, Mannesman, etc. Those are not Russian names. All Soviet tube and pipe maki ng technology comes from the U.S. and its allies . If you know anyone in the space business ask them how many miles of tubes and pipes go into a missile. The Soviets have the largest me rchant marine in the world — about 6,000 ships. I have the specifications for each ship. About two-thir ds were built outside the Soviet Union. About four-fifths of the engines for these ship s were also built outside the Soviet Union. There are no ship engines of Soviet design. Those built in side the USSR are built with foreign technical assistance. The Bryansk plan t makes the largest mari ne diesels. In 1959, the Bryansk plant made a technical assistan ce agreement with Burmeister & Wain of Copenhagen, Denmark, (a NATO ally), approved as peaceful trade by the State Dept. The ships that carried Soviet missiles to Cuba te n years ago used these same Burmeister and Wain engines. The ships were in the POLTAVA class. Some have Danish engines made in Denmark and some have Danish engines ma de at Bryansk in the Soviet Union. About 100 Soviet ships are used on the Haiphong run to carry Soviet weapons and supplies for Hanoi's annual aggression. I was able to identify 84 of these ships. None of the main engines in these ships was designed and manufactured inside the USSR. All the larger and faster vessels on th e Haiphong run were built outside the USSR. All shipbuilding technology in the USSR comes dire ctly or indirectly fr om the U.S. or its NATO allies. Let's take one industry in mo re detail: motor vehicles. All Soviet automobile, truck and engine technology comes from the West: chiefly the United States. In my books I have listed each Soviet plant, its equipment a nd who supplied the equipment. The Soviet mi litary has over 300,000 tr ucks — all from these U.S. built plants. Up to 1968 the largest motor vehicle plant in the USSR was at Gorki. Gorki produces many of the trucks American pilots see on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Gorki produces the chassis for the GAZ-69 rocket launcher used against Israel . Gorki produces the Soviet jeep and half a dozen other military vehicles. And Gorki was built by the Ford Motor Comp any and the Austin Co mpany — as peaceful trade. In 1968 while Gorki was building vehicles to be used in Vietnam and Israel further e q ui p ment for Gorki was ordered and shi pp ed from the U.S."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Also in 1968 we had the so-calle d \"FIAT deal\" — to build a pl ant at Volgograd three times bigger than Gorki. Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow told Congress and the American public this was peaceful trade — the FIAT plant could not produce military vehicles. Don't let's kid ourselves. Any automobile manufacturing plant can produce military vehicles. I can show anyone who is intere sted the technical specificati on of a proven military vehicle (with cross-country capability) us ing the same capacity engine as the Russian FIAT plant produces. The term \"FIAT deal\" is misleading. FIAT in Italy doesn't make auto mobile manufacturing equipment — FIAT plants in Ital y have U.S. equipment. FIAT did send 1,000 men to Russia for erection of the plant — but over half , perhaps well over ha lf, of the equipment came from the United States. From Gleason, TRW of Cleveland and New Britain Machine Co. So in the middle of a war that has killed 46,000 Americ ans (so far) and countless Vietnamese with Soviet wea pons and supplies, the Johnson Administration doubled Soviet auto output. And supplied false information to Congress and the American public. Finally, we get to 1972 under President Nixon. The Soviets are receiving now — today, equipment and technology for the largest heavy truck plant in the world: known as the Kama plant. It will pr oduce 100,000 heavy ten-ton trucks per year — that's more than ALL U.S. manufacturers put together. This will also be the largest plant in the world, period. It will occupy 36 square miles. Will the Kama truck plant have military potential? The Soviets themselves have answered this one . The Kama truck will be 50 per cent more productive than the ZIL-130 truc k. Well, that's nice, because the ZIL series trucks are standard Soviet army trucks used in Vietna m and the Middle East. Who built the ZIL plant? It was built by th e Arthur J. Brandt Company of Detroit, Michigan. Who's building the Kama truck plant? That's classified \"se cret\" by the Washington policy makers.

Control Data Corp. Minneapolis, Minn., December 19, 1973. Hon. Richard T. Hanna, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D. C. My Dear Congressman Ha nna: On Wednesday, Decembe r 5, 1973, testimony was given before the Subcommittee on In ternational Cooperation in Sc ience and Space of the House Science & Astronautics Committee by Mr. Benjam in Schemmer, Editor, Armed Forces Journal International. This testimony included the statemen t that Control Data Corporation had advanced the status of S oviet Computer technology by fift een years with the sale of a Control Data 6200 computer. Such a statement regarding transf er of technology to the USSR is simply not factual and we are prepared to correct that misstatement as well as other incorrect and misleading references to Control Data's activities with the USSR at the pleasu re of your Committee. Meanwhile we respectfully request the consideration of the following. We have offered to the Social ist countries only standard comm ercial computers, and these offerings have been in full compliance with the export contro l and administrative directives of the Department of Commerce. The statement regarding a propos ed sale of the CYBER comput er is thoroughly confused. CYBER is a generic name denoting a line of computers. The least powerful model is the Control Data 6200 which is inst alled at the Dubna Nuclear Rese arch facility near Moscow. Another is the CYBER 76 which is the most powerful and appears to be the model Mr. Schemmer is referencing. At the appropriate time we will seek advisory opinions and submit to the government export license requests for approval for applications in such areas as weather forecasti ng, simulation in the Worldw ide Weather Watch Program, in econometric modeling and in edu cation. Competition from West Europe and Japan will be expected to address these applications with th e same kind of technol ogies that we offer. Many persons, including some of the witnes ses before your Committee, mistake the offering for sale of old or even current state of the art hardware for transfer of advanced technology. This is not unusual be cause in many cases it is di fficult for those who are not technically well-informed to distingush advanced computer technology. Attempting to treat such a broad and complex subject in an informative and accurat e manner in a brief statement results in inaccurate, unsubstantia ted and misinterpreted inferences and conclusions.

For this reason it is not possible to properly respond to Mr. Schemmer's remarks in a short letter, howev er the following are ex amples of those which need to be carefully examined before conclusions are reached. All countries including the Socialists have a substantial base of computer hardware technology on which to build furt her advances in the state of the art. The major strength of the U.S. in computer technology is its ability to market superi or cost/performance computer systems for a wide range of applications. This does not mean that fo r any given application or group of applicat ions, another country cannot build the equivalent as far as performance is concerned or even exceed wh at the United States has availa ble. Also, there is no evidence to my knowledge that the USSR has ever b een prevented from car rying out a military project because of the lack of adequate computer technology. Further advances in hardware are less significant than are so ftware advances for applying computers. We believe that the Un ited States stands to gain significantly from transfer of Soviet knowledge in the basic sciences. The USSR has many mo re scientists and engineers than do we, and the better ones in Russia have concen trated on the theoretic al fields, such as physics, chemistry and mathematic s -- the latter discipline bei ng of particular value in the design of logic and software in the computer field. We respectfully request that your Commit tee review the above points and consider incorporating them into the re cord.

There's no doubt in my mind that if we ACWF Supporters fo rce Control Data to stop building the Soviet war machine, then other sell-out comp anies like General Electric and Union Carbide will also stop aiding a nd abetting our Communist enemies.

CONTROL DATA CORPORATION May 5, 1978 Dear Yellow Card Sender: You are grossly unfair, woefully ignorant or being led around by the nose. I suspect it is the latter, otherwise you wouldn't have signed a card with a canned message, along with a request to contribute money to the author — a pparently a Mr. Schlafly of American Council for World Freedom. Why didn't you write and ask a bout Control Data's position on trade with the Communists before signing a form card? You obviously have little know ledge about Control Data's position or activities, nor does Mr . Schlafly. He has not contacted anyone in Control Data. I would have furnished him inform ation or I would have been gl ad to respond to a letter from you asking for information. Then if you still disagreed strongly — so be it — at least you would have acted sensibly a nd fairly by first getting ade quate information. Then you probably wouldn't have resorted to the use of such words as \"disgrace\" and \"outrage\", because that is akin to the Communist pro cedure of not fairly weighing the evidence. You obviously are deeply concerned about th e Soviet military thr eat, and I certainly understand that, because I share that concern. I think about the subject a gr eat deal and several points are clear, including that: 1. The U.S. should maintain a very str ong military capability. Control Data's products and services cont ribute significantly to our nation's defense system. 2. The U.S. can gain much more by doing business with the Soviet Union than by trying to withhold many things. This la tter procedure hasn't been effective where it has been tried. 3. Most important to maintaining a str ong international position is that we maintain a strong domestic economy w ith an adequate number of jobs, especially for young, disadvantaged person s.

IV. In order to launch the a bove noted programs into viab le, successful im plementations, Control Data Corporation is pr epared to advance long term cr edit on mutually beneficial terms through Commercial Credit Company, its fina ncial affiliate. It is expected that the total volume of credit required for financing of the full dime nsions of the Scientific and Technological Agreement may re ach 500 million dollars. It is further expected that repayment of such credit will be made in the form of Wes tern currencies. Commercial Credit Company is prepared to assist the U SSR in obtaining such currencies by working jointly with the appropriate au thorities in the USSR in the worldwide marketing of Soviet products and in the developmen t of natural resources for wh ich sustained world demand exists. In the process of developing sp ecific programs to generate curr ency for credit repayment, Control Data Corporation offered the following proposals for consideration: A. Financing — Control Data Corporation is pr epared to assist the USSR in obtaining the financing needed to acc omplish the above noted objectives. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Commercial Credit Company, Control Data Corporation can marshal substantial long term credit to facilitate Soviet purchases of equipment and technology pr ojected under the Agreement, as well as credit for potential customers for worldwide sales of Soviet products and materials. Commercial Credit Company will take the initiative in assembling consortiums of major leaders to extend long term cred it to the USSR on mutually beneficial terms. Commercial Credit Company is also prepared to use its Luxembourg facility to make use of U.S. Export/Import Bank financ ing to the extent such credit is available to fi nance the export of Control Data Corporation equipment to the USSR. B . Joint Venture Marketing Company — A marketing company jointly owned by a competent Sovi et organization and Comme rcial Credit Company will be established. The company would be incorporated in Western Europe and would be a self-sufficien t, profit oriented entity. The prime purpose of the company would be to sell the service non-computer- related Soviet p roducts in the Western world on the o p en market. In addition to"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"selling the products of the USSR the Joint Venture Marke ting Company will develop, in conjunction with Commerci al Credit Company, economic and trade forecasts for the near to medium term future in the Western world that will indicate market trends, re quirements and shortages, which can be fed back into the USSR five-year planning activities to insure that future USSR exports meet the requirements of future Western markets. C . Natural Resource Development — Soviet natural reso urces are the largest of any single country in the world. The key to world trade in excess natural resources, not required for do mestic use, is the creati on of additional facilities to obtain and profitably dis pose of these resources. The financial resources and worldwide industry associations of Commercial Credit Company will be employed to crea te appropriate consortia having four major functional entities: a. finan ce b. resource extraction and processing expertise c. construction and operation expertise d. sales outlet for processed products Natural resources to be considered w ould include, but not be restricted to: timber products, non-ferrous metals, pr ecious metals and stones, asbestos, apatite, cement, synthetic rubber and resins, and coal.

(T his letter demonstrates that the identification of Deaf Mute Blindmen must be made with care) TI's Fred Bucy Warns Agains t Selling Technology Know-How and Turnkey Semiconductor Plants to Communist Nations Even as West and East Bloc countries di scuss relaxing the trade embargo on high technology, a sharp disagree ment has developed betwee n two major semiconductor manufacturers on how far this relaxation shoul d extend. One viewpoint is exemplified in last month's Wescon speech by C. Lester Hogan, president of Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp., who wants few restrictions made in East-West semiconductor trade. Hogan stands ready to sell se miconductor products as well as the production equipment, technology, and management know -how to the Communist count ries. This would mean the Communists would manufacture high-level semi conductor products themselves. The French company, Sescosem, a division of Thomson-CSF, has already br oken the ice with the first turnkey semiconductor plant -- so ld to Poland -- and Fairchild, waiting for the trade detente, does not deny having one quote outstanding on an MOS plant for Pola nd, and another two behind that for Russia. On the opposite side is Texas In struments, whose executives take a dim view indeed of trade agreements with the Communist bloc, on the grounds that such agreements are not protected by patent rights and do not offer either open markets or the opportunity to build a decent market share. J. Fred Bucy, vice presiden t of Texas Instruments, points out that \"it's one thing to sell high-technology products in th e foreign market, but quite another to sell the know-how to make these produc ts.\" He is adamant against turnkey contracts, and sees an equal risk in selling th e Communists such pieces of production equipment as line-and- expose towers, diffusion furnaces, epitaxial re actors, and the like. \"I t's axiomatic in high- technology industries,\" says Bucy, \"that the onl y adequate payment for know-how is market share. No lump-sum payment or turnkey-service fee can be great enough to fund the research and development necessary to enable th e seller to maintain his advantage. You can be sure,\" he emphasizes, \"tha t if we give away the know-how without obtaining a market share, they won't buy a dime from us -- devices or equipment. We will be giving away the crown jewels.\" In Bucy's eyes, a big question with East-West trade is pate nt recognition. Because of the longstanding embargo on high-t echnology trade, few Western semiconductor patents are recognized by the Russians or other Eastern Europeans. \"Sin ce we can sell into the Communist community only through their governme nts,\" says Bucy, \"t he only way we can p artici p ate in their markets is for them to a g ree to reco g nize our p atents retroactivel y , p a y us"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"full royalties, and/or give us access to sell directly in th eir markets on an equal footing against their state-owned factories.\" Bucy also feels \"that if the free world is footloose with its technology, it ma y be building a monster that soon will gobble up domestic markets. The Communist countries will build their semiconductor capability with Wester n-supplied production equipment and know- how, and/or with Western -built turnkey plants protected by high tariff barriers,\" he says, and when they get their costs down and their ow n markets saturated, they will be \"right out there exporting into ours.\" This means that any semiconduc tor plant set up in Eastern European countries capable of anywhere near the capacity of typical Western manufacturing facilities will quickly saturate the domestic Communist market and be ready to export their overcapacity to the West. The semiconductor capability of the Comecon has been gr eatly exaggerated as well, according to Bucy. \"The shell game they're pl aying,\" says Bucy, \"is taking small quantities of laboratory-developed devices, giving them to people who are visiting Russia, and saying 'look at our capability -- now w hy not sell us the equipment to manufacture this, because we can do it ourselves anyway.' If they can, let th em do it. The truth is, they don't have the capability of producing in large quantities at high yields.

Irwin Miller) and Financing of Ma rxist Revolutionary Activities Within the United States. I. INTRODUCTION This Section has been reviewing available da ta on various; philanthr opic foundations in an effort to determine if their activities are consistent with their announced goals. In this instance we have made n pre liminary analysis of the Cu mmins Eugine Foundation which although a legitimate phi lanthropic enterprise, nonetheless would appear to serve as a conduit for funds to support black militants and organi zations which are known to consistently promote radical revolutionary activities. This analysis roughly outlines th e data presently available. O bviously, there is considerably more to be learned concerning CEF's overall activities. Additi onal inquiries to the Fill are contemplated and liaison has al ready been established with the Internal Revenue Service in an effort to develop our respective interests. Unfortunately, the complex na ture of this tax exempt foundation does not le nd itself to an easy explanation. It is suggested that the read er make frequent refe rence to the attached chart which will hopefully enhance understanding of the organization. II. BACKGROUND The Cummins Engine Foundation (CEF) was established in 1954 as a philanthropic organization by J. Irwin Miller, Chirman of the Board, Cummins Engine Coral)any, Columbus, Indiana. Mr. Miller is a highly respected 62-year ol d civic leader who in recent years has devoted much of his time and money to various ch arities and religious pursuits. He is regarded as a part of the \"ava nt garde of the civil rights movement.\" CEF is financed solely by Cummins Engine Co mpany, which is the parent of a worldwide concern reputed to be the larg est independent produ cer of high speed di esel engines. In 1970 CEC's pretax profit was $44,564,365.00, of whic h five percent was allocated to CEF. CEF generally receives one to three million dollars annually.

There appear to be no auditing procedures once th e funds have been allocated by CEF to the program directors. This situat ion creates broad opportuni ties for misdirection or misappropriation of monies. The overall thrust of th is report, therefore, is to illustrate how a seemingly munificent activ ity can, by divers m eans, serve to aid the objectives of radical individuals and organizations. Specifically, CEF has provi ded a vehicle whereby: (1) Monies were given to one organization ea rmarked for the use of another organization which in turn has recruited black activists to participate in revolutionary training in Communist China in December 1971: (2) CEF contributed $5,500.00 during 1970 to the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS).

III . DETAILS To date the primary area of investigation into CEF activitie s has been concentrated in Baltimore, Maryland. The paucit y of information concerning CE F funded activities in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and New York stems from the fact that i nvestigation bas not yet been actively instituted in those areas. For this reason the scope of this report will be limited mainly to those activities of CEF in the Baltimore, Maryland area. The CEF Program Director in Baltimore is Wal ter Lively, a 29-year ol d black activist who since 1961 has been variously involved with the Socialist party, CORE, U-JOIN (a jobs for blacks pro,ram he organized in Baltimore), SNCC and the Urban Coalition.

Presumably, CEF money en abled Lively to establish the Liberation House Press. whic h currently offers a full rang e of printing services at cut- rates to \"radical groups.\" Lively, with his fellow BNC officers, Austin Sydnor and Kenya Kiongozi, also operates the Liberation Bookstore . The BNC, the Libera tion House Press, Liberation Bookstore, and an office of the International Black Workers Congress (IBWC) are all located at the same address in Baltim ore. Lively, Sydnor and Kiongozi also maintain close liaison with the UBWC, the Black Panther Party (BPP) and SOUL, School (SS), and significantly, these indivi duals were arrested and indicted for inciting to riot at a BPP-SS rally at the Maryland State Penitentiary in October 1970. In December 1970, Lively purchased fo r $15,000.00 a 130-acre fa rm in Bedford. Pennsylvania, where Liberation Press and SOUL School are to build a youth camp to \"train children in self-defense and African culture. \" (SOUL School is a \" non-profit educational institution\" whose literature in the past has advocated black revolution.) The matador in which BNC f unds are expended seems to s uggest a lack of auditing procedures. From Decembe r 21. 1970 to September 17, 19 71 a total of $46,-887.62 was withdrawn from the BNC acc ount. Of this amount, checks totaling $17.135.00 were made payable to Cash or an officer of the BNC, usually for reason of \"materials\" or \"supplies.\" It should be noted that checks totaling $2,-830.14 were made payable to companies which deal in paper and printi ng supplies and $11,50S.00 was with drawn for purchase of a printing press. Similarly suspect are the activities of organizat ions which have received CEF funds through BNC and Lively. In 1971 CEF made available $12,000.00 to BNC desi gnated for the Nationa l Association of Black Students (NABS). an organization whose stated purpose is to provide a communications network for black college students. As of Novem-her 1971 NABS was recruiting revolutionary black students to trav el to China with a gr oup recruited by William Epton's Marxist-Leninist Collect ive. The express purpose of the trip is to pr ovide training for student organizers to further revolution in the United States. At least $5,000.00 from CEF was sent to BN C in 1971 marked for the Frantz Fanon Institute (EFI). FFI is allege dly an educational en tity dedicated to inculcating Marxist- Leninist teachings in the mi nds of workers and students. Although a reference to its inception was made by radical activist Jame s Forman at a NABS meeting in December 1970. the actual location of FFI is presently unknown. The available description of FFI's structure anti program was found attached to an International Black Workers Congress (IBWC) mailing list. It should be noted that James Forman founded IBWC and traveled to Algeria in 1970 obstensibly to gather inform ation for a book he was writing about Frantz Fanon. In September 1971 the three officers of the BN C traveled to Gary. Indiana for the IBWC conference called by James Forma n. The purpose of the conferen ce war to instruct local chapters in the techniques of organizing work ers in factories to further the cause of destroying capitalism and buildi ng a socialist state. Forman, who traveled to Hanoi and Peking in July 1971, had copies of the 16 page Manifesto of the IBWC distributed to the 200 conferees, who were present by invitati on only. This document includes, among other objectives: the elimination of \"par asitic capitalistic vultures\"; total disarmament of the U.S.; destruction of all police forces and their replacement with pe oples militia; and an end to the blockade of Cuba.

We have circulated certain information in our possession to close associates. Without exception they are shocked, shaken, disbelieving... and angry. Before we spell out the details for you, how do we define treason? Treason is defined in the Constitution as \"aid and comfort\" to an enemy of the United States. Second, following this how do we define an enemy? We spend $300 bi llion a year on defense against the Soviet Union, so logical ly the Soviet Union is an enemy. We cannot SIMULTANEOUSLY have a $ 300 billion defense budget against the Soviet Union and give \"aid and comfort\" for the Soviet milita ry structure without ra ising the question of treason. This topic is discussed at length in a forthcoming book, The Best Enemy Money Can Buy. Who is this secret group? Why do we suggest treason? US-USSR Trade And Economic Council, Inc.

For our example here we select Alexander Y. Markov , listed as a Project Engineer . These two men jointly screen American business companies a nd if they find the offered t echnology interesting, attempt to draw the firm into the TEC net. We can dismiss Alexander Markov briefly. Markov is a Soviet citizen, chemical engineer, suspected KGB, resident in New York for almost three years. Ma rkov's job is to identify the usefulness of technology to the Soviet military complex. As Markov is a Soviet national, the question of treason does not arise. So fa r as we know Markov is a patrioti c Soviet citizen doing his job. His only def ect (that we have identified) is a habit of chainsmoking Turkish type oval cigarettes which overwhelms American visitors (unused to the pungent odor) in clouds of smoke. Alfred Murrer deserves more attention because he is a U.S. citizen, born Rochester, New York 1923, educated MIT and University of Rochester. Before joining TEC, Murrer was Chairman of the Board of the Gleason Works, with 42 years service. The Gleason Works is a long established pres cision tool maker speci alizing in precision machine tools for cutting a nd grinding straight, zerol, sp iral, bevel, hyphoid gears and curvic couplings with associ ated tooling and equipment. It is vital to note that Gleason Works is in bad financial shape, with heavy losses during the past few years. Every last machine tool produced by Gleason Works has military applications .

Details of the case, which involves efforts by th e Soviet bloc to obtain equipment crucial to the production of highly sought computer semic onductors and integrated circuits, emerged when a Spanish company that maintains offices in Illinois agreed to pa y a criminal fine of $1 million for illegally exporting high-technology e quipment between 1979 and 1982. U.S. Attorney Joseph E. diGenova issued a statement saying the violation, by Piher Semiconductores, S.A., of Barcelona , was \"one of the most signifi cant in the area of United States high-technol ogy transfer.\" Under an agreement between th e Department of Justice and Piher, the company pleaded guilty to two felony counts, waived indictment by a grand jury a nd agreed to pay the fine. In addition, the company, which already has been barred for two and a half years from exporting U.S.-made products, will remain barred for an additional nine months. Equipment valued at $2.4 million was shipped to the Soviet Union and Cuba, and other highly sensitive items did not get through, according to Pentagon and Department of Commerce officials familiar with the case. Those officials described the lot as items at the top of the Soviets' list of material needed to help them move into the age of highly sophisticated, computer-dependent weapons. \"They have a major need for it in the military,\" said one Pe ntagon official, speaking on the condition he not be identified. \"It would probably narrow the gap considerably in weapons systems, lending a qualitative edge to their quantitative edge.\" Officials said the Soviet Uni on, which in the past has trie d to obtain semiconductors and integrated circuits produced in the West, recently ha d shifted its emphasi s to obtaining the equipment needed to manufacture the circuitry — the miniature wires that carry electronic data in such common gadgets as pocket calculato rs and digital watches, as well as in the most sophisticated space weapons. \"Such equipment is among the Soviet bloc's most highly sought American high-technology goods needed for expanding and improving the bloc's lagging microprocessor and semiconductor production capability,\" said D onald Creed, a Department of Commerce s p okesman."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"He said departmental docume nts confirm that $2.4 million of these goods were illegally re- exported to Cuba and Russia... The most sensitive, state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment went to the Soviet Union,\" after firs t being shipped to Switzerland. Creed said the material shipped to Cuba, a nd additional equipment th e Cubans were unable to obtain, \"would have given th em the capability to produce semiconductors and integrated circuits.\" \"As far as we know, the plant didn't get in to production,\" he sa id. \"They didn't get everything they needed.\" However, according to the agreement accepted by Piher, Cuba already has a semiconductor manufactur ing facility in Pinar del Rio. The indictment said two senior officers of the Spanish company, Jose Puig Alabern and Francesc Sole I Planas, reached agreements with Soviet and Cuban trade organizations to obtain the equipment from U.S. manufacturers. Th e two are believed to be in Spain and out of reach of U.S. law enforcement officials. Piher itself apparently does not make semi conductor manufacturing equipment, according to a spokesman for a Silicon Valley market research firm. \"To my knowledge, they don't ma ke equipment,\" said Jerry Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc., a San Jose company that does market research on the semiconductor industry. The indictment states that Pu ig reached an agreement with Imexin, a Cuban foreign trade organization, \"to provide and erect a complete integrated circuit manufacturing facility\" valued at $19 million. It said Puig and Sole, who eventually quit the company, ne gotiated with Technoproimport, a Soviet foreign trade or ganization, to sell the Soviets \"t wo highly sophisticated U.S.-origin integrated circuit manufacturing systems.\" U.S. officials and information in the indictment said U.S. officials in Spain, checking at Piher facilities to dete rmine whether the falsely complete d export license documents were being adhered to, were shown fake equipment intended to resemble that exported by Piher.
