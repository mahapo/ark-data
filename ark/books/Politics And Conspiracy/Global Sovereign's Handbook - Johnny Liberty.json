Look around. These are dangerous times to be exercising your rights and liberties in these united states of America. These are also exciting and momentous times to be alive and take a stand for freedom at home and around the planet. The times they are a changing still. The current tide is shifting away from tyranny and towards enhanced and expanded freedoms. The chains of human bondage will be broken and a new generation will unleash a mighty power rarely seen on earth. Stand up and be counted. Stand up for your individual sovereignty. Challenge authority and the established world view. Examine your beliefs and free your minds. Have compassion and love your enemies. One True America Where is the true America? The true America is not to be found in our current government. For these are too ignorant, blind and cowardly to defend our most precious rights. For these are bent on destroying the U.S. Constitution and shredding it for their own self-interest and power. The true America is not to found in the brain-dead, stupefied public without the willpower to defend their most basic self-interest, rights and freedom. For these are lost sheep. For these are all too willing to accept their conditioning and indoctrination without questioning authority or the source of the beliefs. Do not look towards any of these false America’s or listen to false prophets for the answers. For the answers are not to be found there. The true America is not to be found in our current leadership or on television. New leadership is emerging and there will you find the hope and the prayers for future generations. These leaders are invisible, sometimes hard to find, but existent nonetheless. They are not born, but made. Desire Freedom and the Truth How much do you desire freedom? How much do you desire your own sovereignty? How much do you love yourself? A life unquestioned and unexamined is not a life worth living. So you have a choice. To examine your life, your beliefs and to learn from history or to be condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past. How many more people will die without knowing the purpose of their lives? How many more will suffer lack in the land of plenty? Sleepwalk or Awaken? Do you continue sleepwalking through your existence or do you awaken to the drumbeat for freedom, sovereignty and consciousness emerging worldwide? Do you turn away from a friend, a neighbor, a family member or your countrymen, or do you stand besides them in their hour of need? For if you do not stand for them, then who will stand for you? The courage and sacrifice that made America great will make America great again, but in a new way. Everybody Wins, No Plunder This time everybody wins. There is plenty for everyone. There is no need for racism, bigotry or genocide of any indigenous culture. The future is inclusive and everybody has their share. But everybody must also respect the rights and properties of each other. There can be no legal plunder and no excuse, no law justified to steal from one and give to another. Each and everyman and woman is responsible for their own creations, their own productivity and the consequences of their actions. Protect the life, liberty and property of each other and you will also be protected. Plunder each other and you will be plundered. Honesty Please, No Tyranny And most of all, there must be honesty, please. Enough of the lies, deceit and dishonesty that has crafted a grand illusion upon the state of the nation. Enough of the false promises of security and comfort leading ever more dangerously towards tyranny. Let’s tell the whole truth and nothing but. That’s a sacred vow of honor to dare to speak the truth. If you are blind to the tyranny arising around you, then take a good look around. If you fail to notice the signs, the writing on the wall, then you may also fail to notice your liberties and property are under attack, not by enemies from foreign countries, but from within by your own so-called “government.” Government as a Fraud This “government” of ours in America today is a monumental fraud. The income tax is a fraud. The leaders who promise the stars and deliver nothing but lies are a fraud. Stop believing in the lies around you. The least we can do is tell the truth about that. - 8 -"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Preface Dangerous & Exciting Times This book and the editions that preceded it had a mission. That mission was to uncover and to reveal the hidden truths about American history, law, economics and politics so you and you and I could reclaim our God-given rights and liberties as a sovereign people.

The story begins one dark evening on route to the New Wo rld. After a long sea voyage, his ancestors were about to arrive in the promised land of their generation. Their hope and prayer was that they might live in a land where liberty and justice prevailed. Although this New World was filled with opportunity and danger, they were committed to the journey. There was no security, little comfort and basic survival was always a concern but there was no turning back. He can almost remember being there and sensing the fright and excitement of their arrival. The moment they set foot upon the ground, they fell to their knees and prayed. They gave thanks for the success of their long journey and prayed that the future would still hold promise, seven generations later. The rest is history – a history that many of us have forgotten, or have chosen not to remember. Our ancestors from whatever race, culture or nation laid a path for us to follow. And we have a responsibility to them to fulfill the promise of the New World. The story continues early one morning over eight years ago. Like many of his neighbors, he had fallen into a deep sleep. He was raising a family of three children, working two jobs that could barely sustain them, and was not able to make ends meet. It was that chilly morning that he took a hard look in the mirror: What am I doing with my life? Why is it such a struggle? I work so hard; yet can barely stay ahead of the bills. What’s wrong with this picture? There must be something more. What is my purpose for being here? He looked hard into that mirror for an answer. But the mirror was silent. All he could see was his face worn with age and stress. But beneath that face was a spirit - ready to burst into a smile. There was something so familiar within him that was alive and committed to the journey. Once again, there was no security, little comfort and basic survival was often a concern. This is when he knew that his life was about to change forever. He sensed the fear of not knowing what the future had in store. But he also sensed the excitement of his decision. He gave thanks for this turning point when he recommitted to the hopes and prayers of his ancestors that he might again one day soon, live in a land where liberty and justice prevailed. He knew it would be a hard road, but had the courage and strength to travel upon it. It was the truth that ultimately set him free. It wasn’t a truth that he was told. It wasn’t somebody else’s version of the truth. It was a truth that he discovered on the path of self- discovery and experience. His goal was nothing less than being a successful human being. This is how it began: First, there was the issue of money. He believed that if he only had enough money all his problems would go away. Does this sound familiar? Yet the more money he made, the more problems he had, and the more bills. So he started to research the nature of money, how it was created, and who controlled it. What he discovered was astounding and shocking. In truth, he didn’t have any real “money” nor had he been paid any real “money” his entire life. This set him on a new course. He was committed to not only learn about the nature of money, but to teach others what he discovered. As you will discover in this course, he had issues with his own thinking that kept money away from him. And there was also a design to the creation and distribution of money that kept it from circulating. - 9 -"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook So there were both internal and external controls over money that had to be liberated so that he could be financially free. The issue of money, and not having enough of it, was a big one. But there was more. As he learned about money, he also learned about history. Although he had taken some history classes in school, it had not been a subject that interested him - until now. He discovered that by learning about history, he could better understand his present condition, much like he understood his ancestor’s story. What he found is that history was always written by the victors in war - but there were always two sides to the story. One side of the story was told as the official version and the other side ... was silenced. Even today our history is being revised, popularized and retold by the media. The story of history is always told with a bias. As an individual committed to serious research, he knew he must know both sides of the story, and then decide for himself. So how did he verify history and uncover the missing side of the story? Some of this was done by reading carefully between the lines of the source materials and compiling cross-references. But mostly it was uncovered by discovering the law. Very little law was taught in school, except as it related to history. What he discovered is that law is a very precise and accurate record that has been handed down from generation to generation and is available in the public records for verification. Histories could be lost and the stories retold, but the law remained as a permanent record of events. To comprehend history, one must learn the language and the context of law. One piece of information led to another like a great detective story. In the tradition of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, he uncovered piece after piece of a gigantic jigsaw puzzle that made no sense whatsoever, until all the pieces were finally put together. Then the light went on and he saw for the first time a grand design that was so obvious once uncovered – crystal clear to anyone who sought the truth. All was connected in an indivisible system. The money system was linked to both the context of law and to the history that created nations on a political level. And all of that was tied to our inner world - the physical, emotional, spiritual and mental aspects of our lives. So he had to pull the wool away from his eyes and refocus his efforts on synthesizing these materials into what is now called, “the seven aspects of sovereignty”. This has been further expanded to include all aspects of free enterprise business development and success education. When he began this work, the political landscape was different than it is today. This work rose on the coat sleeves of the Clinton Administration over the last eight years. He began as an avid supporter of Clinton and a Democrat, and ended renouncing the entire political system of Democrats and Republicans. He discovered that he was in the midst of a cultural, economic and political war currently being waged against the minds and property of the people of the world. He knew that he was an individual who could reclaim the liberty and justice sought by his ancestors, and live an incredibly successful life. The mountain of ignorance that he confronted in the beginning of this work has eroded. It has transformed into clear choices one can make to stand as a truly free individual. In the future, one will either be a sovereign or a slave. There will be no riding the fence ... no gray area in between. In this course, you will learn about freedom and how to live the seven aspects of sovereignty. This is the foundation for seeking truth ... and everything that will follow.

Scott Fitzgerald We the American People have been grossly deceived about our true and lawful sovereign American National OR “state” Citizenship. This has occurred through an onslaught of public policy and practice, government lies, deception, and propaganda, public media and education, and bureaucratic threat, duress and coercion, and the manipulation of the political, economic and legal system since the Civil War. “If the government is moving it’s lips, they’re lying.” 1 We the People have been stripped naked of our sovereignty and our basic, unalienable rights of self-determination guaranteed by the Declaration of Independence (1776), the American Revolution (1775—1781), Articles of Confederation (1781), and the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain (1783). The limited authority and jurisdiction placed upon federal government via the Constitution for the united States (1789) and the Bill of Rights (1791) has been usurped and ignored for generations. Unless We the People wake up from a long, deep sleep, these powerful instruments of American law, our protectors of freedom and liberty will be banished forever from our homeland. “Americans may wake up one day soon, homeless in the land of their forefathers.” 2 We the People are caught in the crossfire of a global assault on the sovereignty of both Citizens and the Law of Nations. The casualties of this assault are our freedoms, property rights, due process of the law, basic unalienable rights for all people, and our beloved country—the united states of America. An “invisible” and secret war is being waged against the united states of America for the benefit of a elite aristocracy and consortium of international bankers bent on attaining global empire at the expense of the American people and all the Citizens of the world. 3 America is at risk of losing its cherished freedoms and becoming a tyrannical, totalitarian, high technology police state. Our government is arrogant with power and forgetful of its responsibility to serve the American people. The government has stepped up its continued assault upon the people through litigation, foreclosures, forfeitures of property and the so-called “war on crime and drugs.” The government is bankrupt politically, morally and economically, and has not been honest in disclosing the consequences of its spending policies and priorities. Thus We the People are on the brink of an economic and political disaster. We the American People are the political, economic prisoners of a foreign, sovereign, invisible Power structure operating through corporate federal, State and local governments, the Federal Reserve Bank and its foreign principals, and domestic and foreign corporations. We the People have a gut feeling that something is terribly wrong, a discontent and anger that indicates the extent of the exploitation, domination, and control to which we are subject, yet are often at a loss to either articulate or comprehend what is in fact occurring. The nature of the oppression is mostly invisible, “legal,” and economic. We the People are being taxed to death and indebted into “economic slavery” by individuals and institutions that have no moral or lawful authority under the American system of law. 4 We the American People have been systematically robbed and bankrupted by special interests, and public officials that profit immensely from political and legal systems put into place to serve their ends. Laws are passed “by the Power structure and for the Power structure.” We the American People are taxed without representation by federal, State and local governments that no longer serve our best interests. Instead, they perpetuate and protect their own unlimited growth, at our expense. Our military is presently under the command of foreign powers intent on creating a New World Order, a one-world government and world army through the militarization of the United Nations (UN). “A treaty signed by former President George Bush places the assessment and collection of all taxes, even local property taxes, under UN auspices and sets up an international enforcement corps and an international data bank.” 5 “ It could probably be shown by facts and figure s that there is no distinctly native America n criminal class except Congress. ” —Mark Twain We the People have been programmed, conditioned and educated to see, feel, think, and act socially and “politically correct.” Political correctness is social programming promulgated by the traditional Left—don’t ask, don’t speak, don’t dissent. It corresponds perfectly with the religious fundamentalist programming of the traditional Right. Both are mind numbing, mind-controlling propaganda machines. This is in alignment with a global design and strategy that’s so subtle, so invisible, yet so pervasive that very few of our best intellects have broken the veil. Our flag-waving, hollow patriotism often doesn’t reflect the actual realities of America today as much as it worships the hollow, superficial and mythological symbols of our past. Most Americans still “believe” we’re living in a “free” country under a “free enterprise” system. Most Americans still trust and expect big government to take care of them, and believe - 13 -"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook that the government is well meaning and good. Yet we all know there is no “free” lunch (especially the schoolchildren). We the People receive small fragments of crucial news and information from the mainstream media (1% facts), but have barely begun to comprehend American history, law, economics and politics as a whole system. Without the whole global picture, We the People are hopelessly enslaved. We must break through this veil of deception and lies. We must speak the truth whatever the cost. We must take effective actions in unison to effect change. We must create alternatives to the New World Order. We must come together as a new nation and rediscover America for the all the people, regardless of race, creed, sex, or color. This is our vision of rediscovering America. This is UnCommon Sense ! “ It is incredible how as soon as a people becomes subject, it promptly falls into such complete forgetfulness of its freedom that it can hardly be roused to the point of regaining it, obeying so easily and willingly that one is led to say ...that this people has not so much lost its liberty as won its enslavement.” —Etienne de la Boetie In summary, the power of sovereignty is: 1. Based on the inherent nature of the free individual; 2. It is the source of authority from which all laws and governments arise; 3. It is based on the action of the individual being supreme; 4. It is a gift that you choose to give yourself. Online Version with additional links for our Success Education customers, go to: www.ICResource.com/SE/SE1SOURCE/CD1of12Track5.0.ht ml Truth is an Endangered Species UnCommon Sense will rock the foundations of your beliefs about American and world history, law, economics and politics. You will discover that the federal United States government has been bankrupt numerous times since 1933, 6 and has systematically concealed this from the American people. You will discover that Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) are not lawful “money,’’ but promissory notes obligating taxpayers and U.S. citizens to return income “taxes” to the Federal Reserve Bank, not the U.S. Government. You will discover that the Federal Reserve Bank is a private, joint-stock trust, not part of the United States government. All allodial land and lawful “money” (i.e., gold/silver) in the united states of America has been “hypothecated” to the Federal Reserve Bank since 1913 as collateral and “payment” against an unpayable federal debt. Property, motor vehicles, birth certificates, national parks and forests, and the assets of all non-profit and for-profit corporations have been pledged as collateral against the federal debt — a debt that can never be paid off. You cannot tender “payment” of a debt with Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs), only with lawful “money.” The Federal Reserve Bank and its foreign principals/creditors control the federal United States government, and directs all legislative action and public policy through its lending and monetary policies. The U.S. Congress is simply a “trustee” for the continued bankruptcy of the United States government corporation. The IRS is a collection agency for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) collecting from a bankrupt Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). Your income tax does not go to the United States government, but to service your individual obligation toward the federal debt. Your income tax does not provide basic government services which are paid for through excise, sales and other taxes. “ When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic.” —Dresden James U.S. citizens cannot “own” true and lawful title to land unless you’ve updated the land patent and removed any encumbrances or liens as a American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen. The United States government corporation has quit-claim deeded all the property in the united states of America to the foreign principles/creditors as collateral against the un- payable debt. When you “purchased” your property or real estate, you received a “deed,” not an allodial title. A “deed” only represents equitable or beneficial interest in a trust property “owned” by the State acting as a trustee. Without an allodial title held in your sovereign capacity, banks loaning you so-called “money” can attach a lien on your property until it’s “discharged” in full. If you fail to pay the mortgage the bank will foreclose on the property. Even if it’s paid in full with FRN’s after thirty- years, you still don’t hold the true title, only possession in fee simple. - 14 -"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter One Truth is an Endangered Species U.S. citizens do not “own” their “motor vehicles.” As trustee, the State holds the true title, and has legal “ownership” in the property. You get a “Certificate of Title” that certifies that you are a “beneficial holder.” The legal “owner” has the right to require the “beneficial holder” to get it registered with State- issued plates, have a State-issued driver’s license and insurance. In essence, you are renting the use of a “government-owned” vehicle. The legislative intent of the Motor Vehicle Code is to regulate the commercial operation of motor vehicles only. There are hidden liens on your “person,” your property and your future productivity toward “discharging” the un- payable federal debt. Most Americans are fundamentally bankrupt, and have not been paid real “money” for working in their entire lives. Ninety-two percent of all American’s are bankrupt at age sixty-two. Unless you get educated and protect what remains of your assets now, Americans will wake up, one day soon as Thomas Jefferson warned, shake their weary heads and wonder what the heck happened. Homelessness and the proliferation of social, racial and political violence are advanced symptoms of undeclared State and federal bankruptcies. We the People and our political leaders have unwittingly “sold out” our country, our freedoms and our children’s future for privileges, benefits, temporary entitlements and the short-term “success” of a privileged few. U.S. citizens are not “Citizens” at all, but subjects and property of the District of Columbia, residents and franchisees of the bankrupt federal United States government corporation organized under municipal law. You will discover that the Constitution for the united states of America and the Bill of Rights does not apply to “U.S. citizens.” U.S. citizens are subjects and property governed under “statutory,” Admiralty and Maritime law, Military and Martial law under the undisclosed presumption of an international contract. U.S. citizens have no constitutional protections or unalienable rights, only privileges and “rights” granted by the government. Legal “persons,” born or naturalized in the federal United States were created exclusively by the 14th Amendment after the Civil War. The 14th Amendment was never lawfully ratified. Your vote is purely advisory and does not directly elect, affect or create public law. Your vote obligates you to pay Municipal, County and State bonds through property taxes. If your vote ever really changed anything, it would’ve been illegal a long time ago. The gold-fringed Admiralty and Military flag, not the American flag, flies in the President’s oval office and in most of the so-called “courts” in this country. U.S. citizens are legally “disabled,” “wards of the State,” considered incompetent children incapable of making their own decisions, acting judicially or in their sovereign capacity. We the People must reclaim our power of attorney to act judicially in our sovereign capacity, and stop the government from acting on our behalf without our consent. We the People must reclaim the American system of law and restore our unalienable sovereign rights. We the People have the unilateral power of declaration by affidavit and legal notice, the unlimited power and right to contract and to organize our affairs with little or no government involvement. We the People have the power to form grand juries to prosecute public officials who are violating our unalienable or constitutionally-protected rights under “color of law” through Title 42, §§§1983, 1985, 1986 OR Title 18, §§241, 242 actions. We the People must make our government accountable to the U.S. Constitution, the sovereignty of the people and the American system of common law. You have forgotten what “country” you live in. The federal “United States” government is a foreign corporation with regards to the “united states of America,” not the country you live in or owe allegiance to. 7 We the People are sovereign, “state” Citizens and nationals under the supremacy of the state and federal constitutions. We the People unknowingly elected away our unalienable rights and property by becoming 14th Amendment, “U.S. citizens” under the jurisdiction of the federal “United States.” Social security benefits and the income tax, with a few exceptions for foreign-earned income, are voluntary contracts made mandatory for federal government employees and U.S. citizens who receive benefits from the government. We the People can lawfully reclaim our true, sovereign, American National OR “state” Citizenship and take back our government from those who would destroy our country for their own self-interest. “ I used to have a country but they sold it down the river. Like a repossessed farm auctioned off to the highest bidder.” —Bruce Cockburn 8 Seven Aspects Summary Every aspect of sovereignty defines the realm of a responsible individual. It takes courage, faith, kindness and contentment to reach the levels of joy we are capable of in our lives. The seven aspects of sovereignty are: 1. Attaining physical health and wellbeing; 2. Attaining emotional health and balance; 3. Practicing spiritual sovereignty and the golden rule - 15 -"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook 4. Free yourself from mental slavery; 5. Achieving economic sovereignty and financial independence; 6. Choosing your Citizenship; 7. Establishing true independence in your nation of choice. These are the seven aspects of sovereignty. Sovereignty is an attitude. It’s a way of being. It’s a way of life. Beyond Denial– Being Responsible The greatest challenge in reclaiming our sovereign Citizenship is breaking the chains of denial and taking responsibility for freeing ourselves from mental, emotional and economic slavery. It takes courage to open our eyes and witness an “economic holocaust” 9 of mass proportions and forge the appropriate, human response. Independence Day It takes an independent, thinking and compassionate human being to discriminate between “reality,” and the false images projected through lies, propaganda, advertising, distractions, and deception. > REALITY EROSION —the inability to discriminate between what is real and what is fiction. Restoring Discrimination We must extract and separate our individual moral conscience and intelligence from overwhelming, addictive, under-informed, commercial, public information, non-news media that has contaminated our ability to discriminate between what is real, and what is fiction. This inability to discriminate, to make distinctions, and our often apparent indifference and apathy, is described as “reality erosion,” and it is accelerating on a daily basis. Discrimination and integration are two inherent faculties of the human mind, essential for survival. We must learn to think for ourselves. 10 “ We suffer primarily not fro m our vices or our weaknesses , but from our illusions . We are haunted, not by reality , but by those image s we have put in their place. ” —Daniel Boorstin 11 Restoring Response-Ability After generations of being educated and programmed for irresponsibility, to look after number one, to get mine, to do your own thing, the American people have surrendered virtue for vice, rights for privileges, long-term sustainability for short-term profits and pleasures. Without “response-ability” (i.e., the ability to respond), the American people will be hopelessly enslaved. 12 Return to Virtue Without a return to virtue, to ethics and morality evident in the natural law, the American people will self-destruct in a democratic tyranny of mob violence. Just consider the brutality evident in the mass media and the glorification of victim-hood in the soap operas. Even if we reach beyond denial, take response-ability and apply intelligent virtue, the immensity of the issues, concerns and problems presenting themselves simul- taneously are paralyzing us into inaction, despite our having access to intelligent information, solutions and strategies. Ignorance is not bliss. “ If a problem portrayed... appears to involve more effort or sacrifice than we can imagine, or if even maximum effort... would fail to prevent the tragedy, we are tempted to sever the link between stimulus and emotional response.” —Al Gore, Former Vice President of the United States 13 Mental Sovereignty Summary In summary, mental sovereignty includes: 1. You have your own mind, your own thoughts, ideas and conclusions; 2. One function of the mind is for memory or storage; 3. Another function of the mind is for focusing thought and energy; 4. You must train your mind to focus both intention and attention; 5. You must learn to make distinctions in your own mind; 6. To embrace higher truths, our way of thinking must shift to embrace the paradox; 7. Mental sovereignty is about doing your own thinking and making your own choices; 8. Come up with an original idea in 30 days or less; 9. Defeat all mind control systems by being vigilant and perceptive; 10. Reconsider political correctness; 11. Free yourself from blind spots that keep the same old mental patterns operating; 12. Develop your mindset into a powerful attitude for achieving success in your life.

Most of it is hype, innuendo, entertainment and propaganda intended to distract us from reality and the truth. - 16 -"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter One An Independent Press Evening Snooze The mainstream and alternative media is spoon-fed on government propaganda and public information through the public relations departments of the national, federal, State and local governments and transnational corporations. To think for ourselves, we must fast from both the mainstream and alternative media and obey this maxim. NO GARBAGE IN — NO GARBAGE OUT The Power structure and global elite controls all five big television networks, public broadcasting and cable networks including PBS and CNN. Most Americans get 90% of their news, information and world view from the television. What passes off as news these days is appalling to anyone with intelligence and insulting to those who don’t. Most reporters and their editors are too busy snooping into the private lives of public officials and celebrities to actually do any legitimate research or investigative reporting into the real issues. Stealing Your Attention There are serious issues that justly deserve more attention than President William Clinton’s sex life, Senator Bob Packwood’s diaries, O.J. Simpson’s trial, Tanya Harding’s escapades, this or that celebrities sex life, or any other irrelevant media spin that distracts us from the real issues and concerns. Most of the mainstream media, following in the path of the tabloids, focuses public attention on non-issues and directs the public political agenda towards the desired goals of the global elite. Most alternative media is too busy reacting to whatever the mainstream media is focusing on to ever notice what’s really going on independently of the mainstream press and take initiative in creating the news. NEWS = PROPAGANDA Independent Press Investigative reporting and truth-saying in today’s media climate is hard and dangerous work for a reporter or editor if you want to keep your job. Maintaining an independent, free press is essential though to the continued existence of a healthy constitutional republic. Spinning the Issues Public policy is shaped by the “image of the issue,” not by the “reality of the issue.” Public policy will be what the policy ought to appear like, not what actually solves the problem at hand. Spin doctors, image-makers, and propagandists are the key policymaking posts in any government or corporate public relations department. These spin doctors, and those behind the scenes who direct them, create public policy based on public opinion, then the legislators follow by writing the statutes. Lawmakers don’t lead, they follow public opinion directed by the media. The media even goes so far as to “create” (i.e., fabricate) the news to suit their political agenda. Watch the movie, Wag the Dog with Dustin Hoffman. It’s a shocking possibility! 14 Abandoning the Ship of Freedom The “independent” press as the guardians of “reality” has abandoned the ship of freedom. Journalism has deteriorated into slick entertainment and sensationalism, even by the vanguards of the media industry. Often journalists and anchormen fan the flames of discontent by introducing violence, racism and disinformation into the community. From my vantage point, citizenship is not meant to be a spectator sport orchestrated by the media. The real “news” must never be confused with “entertainment.” The real “news” is not always what the media is currently directing your attention towards. Can you tell the difference between news and entertainment? If not, we’re both in big trouble. 15 “ There is no such thing at this date of the world’s history in America as an independent press. You know it, and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinion, and if you did, you know beforehand it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly to keep my honest opinion out of the paper. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job...” “ The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it, and I know it, and what folly is this, toasting an independent press? We are the tools and the vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the Jumping Jacks. They pull the strings, and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.” —John Swinden, Former Head of the New York Times 16 - 17 -"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Media Literacy and Internet Activism Entertainment is the opiate of the American people along with sex, drugs, rock n’ roll and religion. The American media culture is the most pervasive and persuasive in the world today. We the People have become addicted to the mass consumption of images, elevated above and invalidating reality and truth at every commercial break. Over one-sixth of the GNP is spent on marketing and advertising (i.e., propaganda). Media Manipulation Because the American people are terrified of cults, drug dealers, terrorists, crime, gangs, child and sexual abuse through the continual bombardment of the media, we are extremely susceptible to massive media manipulation in these areas. Through the manufacturing of facts, evidence and the creation of artificial enemies, the media can easily frame up an individual or a group as a culprit while the mass consciousness prepares to lynch them without a trial. Most people have no discernment and cannot tell the difference between hype or lies and substance or fact. “ We’re entertaining ourselves to death under the gray sky.” —Bruce Cockburn Framing the Facts with Lies The mainstream media accuses, frames the facts and convicts innocent people daily with network broadcast innuendo and smear campaigns intent on discrediting, without trial, without indictment by a grand jury, without substantial evidence. Even bold-faced lies suffice. Worse still this is quickly becoming a standard practiced in the legal profession. Discrediting the Source Beware of the discrediting of legitimate sources of news, people and information. Look twice at the message and the messenger the media attempts to discredit. The media hunger for shock therapy, sensational stories and movies-of-theweek leads them into the business of lie- making, fear mongering, demonizing and deadly deception. Beware. Always read and view between the lines of the message. In many cases, the media is the message. Media Purpose The media could be utilized to inform, educate, entertain, inspire or control. More often than not, the media is utilized to advertise, control and harness the energy of the slave class, much like in The Matrix movie. The economic, consumer slaves keep them in power, and live to serve the needs and goals of the Power structure and the global elite. We the People consume so that the Power structure and the global elite may live long and prosper. Power structures and the global elite are energy controllers, vampires and leeches. These structures, institutions and people “need” to control, dominate, conquer, exploit and use others to “survive” at their desired “standard of living.” Subverting and erasing the will of the people and implementing the directives of the Power structure and the global elite is the “only” job of a politician, the public school and the media. Without will power, public attention can be directed like a cheap magicians trick to continue fostering the illusion. The Power structure and the global elite through their stooge politicians use the media and money to manipulate public opinion, and incidentally, get elected time and time again. The media echoes their message loud and clear. Restoring Media Literacy What can we do? First, we must withdraw consent and withdraw our attention from the television set and the daily news. We must restore our will power and begin to live deliberately. Second, we must examine and withdraw our ignorance and beliefs, our indoctrination and conditioning and begin to think for ourselves and create original thoughts and ideas to create the reality we prefer. Third, we can set-up and organize independent communications networks, news services and resource centers encrypted with PGP for privacy. We must organize effectively at a global scale to counter the corporate governments eternal preparation for war and the media’s assault upon the strained sensibilities of the American people. The brainwashing, programming, propaganda machine waged against America and the rest of the world has been highly effective and very costly to the Power structure. It consumes a lot of energy and effort to keep the people fed twenty-four hours a day with lies and deceit. Fourth, we can empower the entire free world to organize and network through the visionary use of the Internet, private telephone conferencing systems, shortwave radio, underground publications and media, and news services. Organize communications structures, network people, resources, skills and information, and broadcast them widely. Communications networking is our greatest wild card for stopping the encroachment of the New World Order and restoring freedom around the world.

The Internet was born in 1969 with funding from the Pentagon to facilitate post-nuclear communications in the event of a nuclear blast. The World Wide Web <www> was born in 1992, just over ten years ago, when the first browser software was developed and given away for free. There are presently hundreds of millions of users in the world. There’s no longer any excuse for computer illiteracy. 17 Building a Communications Structure From a credible source people respect and honor, word of mouth is still the most powerful media of all. Networking is the key to happiness and the key to organizing communi- cations networks. Walk you talk. Share what you know. Do not forget the human dimension of communication and the interaction of heart, mind and soul. Integrity is the key word. Thoughts, words and deeds must be in alignment for your truth to be communicated effectively. Utilize all available communications media and resources, above and underground to spread the your message to all the people. “If you don’t like the news, go out and make some of your own.” Having your hands steadily focused on a video or digital camera or audio recorder may be your best protection against the New World Order. They do not want the truth to see the light of day. Keep the cameras and tape recorders rolling whenever you confront the government or those who would steal your freedom, your rights and property. The last thing the Power structure and the global elite wants, is for everybody to know the truth. \"The function of the media in the United States is to inculcate and defend the economic, social, and political agenda of privileged groups that dominate the domestic society and the state.\" —Noam Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent 18 Censorship and Security Issues When was the last time you had an intelligent, public conversation about a controversial subject without feeling attacked, judged and/or invalidated? There are many censorship tactics being used to prevent opposing points of view from getting the opportunity to express themselves. Mostly, We the People censor and police each other, denying free expression of ideas. This censorship mentality begins in our homes, families and schools. Censorship might involve the outright denial of airtime or funding, time limits on debates, shouting matches, threats of litigation, limits on subject matter, a seven-second delay for live radio or television, public humiliation, discrediting or false accusations, etc. Advertisers influence the media in a similar way, by conditioning their sponsorship upon the censorship of any negative reporting around their companies. Wonder why you haven’t gotten any real news lately? Censorship may secure the ears from hearing opinions and/or words that you have already prejudged as invalid or inappropriate, but it also prevents any possibility of dialoguing intelligent solutions and coalition building. We paint ourselves into a corner with nowhere to go. Are we so insecure about our point of view that we must prevent others from expressing theirs? The Wisdom of Insecurity You cannot predict the future. You don’t know when you’re going to die. You feel insecure, because insecurity is the way of life. There is no security, not even in death. The wisdom of insecurity is an Eastern concept that is beyond the comprehension of most Western minds. We the People must get back to values that respect and honor all life, and our deepest, truest sense of human nature. Not only are we disconnected from the Earth, but we’ve lost touch with our own humanity. This may be the most difficult, and rewarding journey yet. “ Here will I be bold. If there’s a power above us (And that there is, all nature cries aloud through all her works.) He must delight in virtue; And that which he delight’s in must be happy.” —Benjamin Franklin Mind control is not necessarily a formal “brainwashing” process like prisoners of war being brainwashed in the concentration camps, or like the CIA training assassins to do it's political dirty work, although that form of mind control happens routinely. Mind control is any imposed system that suppresses the human will to think, act and feel independently of outside influences. This broadens the scope of “mind control” to include all forms of manipulation of the human mind, whether subtle or coercive. Most of the human race lives in one mental prison or another. Here's how it works. 20 Dogmas History has shown the most effective way to control and shut down a human mind is through the introduction of rigid, inflexible “dogmas.” Dogmas are political or religious beliefs that are inculcated and programmed into children from an early age through fear, guilt or abject terror. - 19 -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook This indoctrination occurs in the family systems, churches, schools and media — and in all cultures and societies. Often it takes a strong commitment and years of therapy to de-program from intensive dogmatic training (e.g., Catholic School). ”Fundamentalism” is the root of all dogma — my way of thinking is the one and only “right” or “moral” way of thinking. On a planet of gullible and pliable minds committed to dogmatic thinking, war is inevitable and conflict will flourish on all levels. This chaos and confusion feeds directly into the hands of the global manipulators who divide and conquer by controlling all sides of the conflict, then introducing their agenda to solve the “problem.” Thus their agenda is perpetuated regardless of who “wins” the war or prevails in the battle. Peer Pressure Mostly we police each other into conformity and blind obedience to rules and norms that are unquestioned, unchallenged through “peer pressure.” The story is, “Either you believe the way we do or see things as we do, or we'll ostracize, humiliate and criticize you until you knuckle under or go away.” Our parents, teachers, ministers, leaders and celebrities all do it. They set up “role models” that we emulate and imitate. Be like Mike! Ha. What about “Be like Me?” Who’s encouraging that? Persecution and Character Assassination The media chimes into attacking and discrediting the character of anyone remotely departing from the status quo. If you were ever a genius, scientist, inventor, healer, teacher or true visionary, you'll be able to relate to the numerous occasions where your fresh and innovative ideas were met with sizable resistance. Thousands of people in America each year are “disappeared” for daring to challenge or expose the system for the lie and manipulation it really is. Malicious Prosecution This may be a malicious prosecution resulting in jail time, or being disappeared simply by being marginalized and alienated from friends, family and the public. Those who maintain an independent “mind” despite “peer pressure” are further bludgeoned into conformity when daring to challenge “authority” or the agents of the power structure. The Power structure might dispatch the police to serve a search warrant, confiscate property, allege a drug or terrorist offense, send a SWAT team, or incite an attack minded U.S. Attorney with a knack for malicious prosecution. They must teach those who challenge authority a lesson about bucking the system. After all, “You can't fight City Hall!” Political Assassinations If you were ever an activist, whistleblower, reformist or political innovator, you can relate to the numerous persecutions of our leaders (e.g., John & Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Leonard Peltier, John F. Lennon). Our graveyards are full of good people who were victimized by the system or put to death in some horrible war for a purpose they never understood or dared to ask. Political Prisoners Our prisons are full of such nonconformists whose only crime was to dare to challenge the authorities and the system. Only 40% of our prison population are actually “criminals.” Public Education as Mind Control Public education is an institution of social programming and mind control to inculcate social and national values, prejudices and predispositions in our children at a young and impressionable age. John Gatto's Dumbing Us Down 21 details the actual hidden agenda of public education spookily accurate. Control of pu- blic education is also a tenet of the Communist Manifesto. 22 Public Media as Mind Control The major daily newspapers, news services and radio/television stations are institutions of mind control twisting tiny facts into huge fictions to keep the mass mind preoccupied with irrelevance and false security (e.g., O.J. Simpson, Bill Clinton's extra-marital affairs, the War on Iraq). That people still habitually pick up a newspaper or tune into a news channel expecting to get the “news” is a testimony to their effectiveness in mass hypnosis. We the People are in a trance. From that slumber, we are enslaved. We are hypnotized into dullness. That the media is a propaganda machine to control our minds is not such a far stretch of the imagination considering the overt manipulation of our desires accomplished through advertising, infomercials, entertainment and the so-called “news.” Why so many people still give their minds away every day is beyond me, especially since the truth has been shining brightly for sometime now. Mind control is not new information. The concept is being represented for broader distribution and reconsideration. Stop reading the evening news. Start thinking for yourself instead, and living in the light of your own design. 23 - 20 -"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter One Censorship and Security Issues Economic Sovereignty Summary In summary, economic sovereignty includes: 1. An economic system involves the exchange of goods and services; 2. You are responsible to be a producer in that system, not just a mere consumer; 3. It’s not the money, but the circulation of money and the production of wealth that matters in a true economy; 4. Embrace the principles of prosperity consciousness; 5. Remember the principles and economics of free enterprise and circulation; 6. Attitudes and beliefs must be changed with knowledge, education and persistent hard work. Achieve economic sovereignty. 7. See also Economics of Free Enterprise and Principles of Circulation. Breakdown of the Family and Tribe With the surrender of the mind to external control, will power is soon to follow. With no mind or will power to individuate and discover one’s true self, We the People become totally dependent upon the indoctrinated dogma and belief systems we were taught and conditioned. Until we examine our lives and beliefs, challenge our indoctrination and institutionalized authority and inquire into the nature of universal principles and law, the status quo of the prison mentality and victim attitude will continue ad nauseum on this planet. Isn’t it time to liberate yourselves from mental slavery. Safety and Security The most basic root chakra of the human being desires to belong to a family and tribe for safety and security reasons. The family and tribe have always been the center of human life. The only question that remains is what tribal system were you raised in, and how do you break free of the conditioning that stops us from individuating our own selves fully? Until such awakening occurs, you and I are easily subject to manipulation and control by external forces and institutions. 24 In addition to mind control and media manipulation, the family and tribe are under attack by the New World Order, the Power structure and the global elite. In the modern societies of the West, it’s evident that traditional family systems are breaking apart, further wounding people emotionally, dividing and alienating them from the root of their being. The loss of the family and tribe has left most people vulnerable, without basic safety and security needs being met, further becoming dependent upon the State for sustenance and survival. This is a dangerous trend. In the Communist Manifesto, the breakdown of the family is essential to centralized control by the State. Marriage License is a Three Party Contract with the State The marriage license is a three-way contract with the State and is based on old property law. In the patriarchal society, the man owned his seed and the eggs of the females were considered property. If a man and a woman decided to get married, they needed the “consent” of the father who gave his daughter (i.e., property) away. If the father didn’t consent, they might elope, but without the consent of the father, the property (i.e., title) didn’t convey. Common Law Marriage If you lived together for seven years and the father neither consented nor contested the marriage, then the couple would be legally married under the Common law. A Common law marriage is recognized in every American state republic. State as Legal Parent In the American legal system, the doctrine of parens patria confirms the State is the legal parent and the children produced from a State-licensed marriage are the property and chattel of the State. Following from old property law, if you’re chattel or the property of the State, then you need the consent of the State (i.e., the father) to get married (evidenced by the marriage license), and any property derived from the marriage (i.e., children) also belongs to the State. 25 The goals of the New World Order, the Power structure and the global elite are one in the same with the Communist Manifesto. Read it and weep at the loss of your rights and property. The breakdown of the family and tribe is in the best interests of the State seeking to expand it’s power base. State Parenting When the family system is breaking down, the State becomes the new, “improved” parent. The State imposes controls over the raising of the children through public education and public health agencies and departments of human resources. Thus the State dominates the biological parent in influen- cing and controlling the child until they are of legal age. The State decides what is taught in the public schools. The State deci des what the child will learn and what career track they’ll be on. The State decides what is appropriate social behavior, and what is politically correct. The State decides and defines abuse, and what is appropriate affection or discipline in the family. All this power in the hands of the State further alienates the children from their biological parents who are left as nothing more than the custodians of State property. Biological Parents are Powerless Haven’t you as a parent ever felt that your children were out of your hands? Read the “UN Convention on the Rights of - 21 -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook the Child” and you'll get a sense of what's on the horizon for “parental rights in the near future.” 26 In traditional tribal systems where families and communities are too strongly bonded to be broken or replaced by the State, the parents can be indoctrinated by old-time religion, programmed by the educational system or influenced by the media to get behind the State’s agenda and become the politically correct, socially acceptable manipulators of their children. We the Children Become We the People The result for the child is the same by different means - We the Children are taught to give our minds and power away to external authority and institutions. We the Children give our power away and become slaves to the social and political manipulators, whether State or biological parents. Independence, thinking and free will are suppressed regardless of whether or not it's a capitalist, socialist, communistic or so-called democratic society. Hope for the Children Our future hope lies in the establishment of sovereignty for all the people, beginning with spiritual and emotional sovereignty then extending into the political, economic and legal realms. This is the ultimate challenge of our time — to free enough people, young and open enough, to alter the pattern on the planet from negative (i.e., destructive) energy to positive (i.e., creative) energy. The ultimate challenge is to live free as sovereign individuals or die slaves of the global manipulators! The choice is yours. Legal Aspect Summary In summary, legal sovereignty includes: 1. A course of study to learn about your individual rights and how they are taken away through your ignorance of the law; 2. Choosing your Citizenship; 3. Understanding commercial, administrative and judicial remedies; 4. You have the right to do business in your jurisdiction of choice. 5. See also American & International Law Truth is Neither Left Nor Right The Right and Left political spectrum and all the bantering about Liberals and Conservatives, Capitalists, Communists, Socialists, Republicans and Democrats, is presently irrelevant to the entrenched institutions of the Power structure. Polarized Mode of Thinking Most of our thinking, and the resulting conflict, is caught in a polarized mode of black or white, right or left duality. This endless and irrelevant debate plays solidly into the hands of the Power structure and the global elite by keeping people divided, thus conquered. It’s the oldest game in the book. You pit two opponents you want to control against each other and they can no longer see you controlling both sides of the game. Like consenting to peer group pressure, we agree to play the divide and conquer game. We do it to ourselves and each other unconsciously if not deliberately. The Power structure and the global elite are quite content to let people attack and kill each other instead of focusing attention on their escapades. Plus it saves them the cost of the bullet! Wake up America! Wake up world! Unified Mode of Thinking The truth is neither Right nor Left, Liberal nor Conservative, Black nor White. The whole truth and nothing but the truth is a blending, a melting of the individual points of view into a paradox of reality, inclusive and comprehensive. The truth is indeed much stranger than fiction. Political Correctness We're all familiar with the Christian, Islamic, conservative fundamentalism of the so-called Right. Political correctness is the mind numbing, guilt-oriented, intellectual fundamentalism of the Left, liberal, socialist, and communist global elite, intent on destroying free thought, independent inquiry and true consensus-building. Both are presently irrelevant in the pursuit of truth and the restoration of your sovereignty. Be watchful of those who would encourage you to betray your friends, family and neighbors on behalf of the government. Beware of D.A.R.E. programs, Neighborhood Watch and other police-oriented community programs co-opted to pry into your privacy. This is part of a strategy for destroying public and community trust (e.g., Orwell’s 1984 ). As I overheard recently on the campus of a major university, “In the sixties, it used to be Us vs.Them. Today, with the advent of political correctness, it's Us vs. Us.” 27 Let's stop fighting each other and focus on the real issues, the real problems, the real perpetrators. “ We have seen the enemy, and it is us.” —Pogo - 22 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter One Truth is Neither Left Nor Right Crime Wave or War Against the People The supposed “crime wave” crashing over the American landscape is generated by media sensationalism, the failed economic policy of the federal government, and inept legislative priorities and directives by the foreign creditors of the United States (i.e., IMF).

Boycott the television, unless you can watch with the utmost of discrimination and skepticism. Stop believing what you hear, or what's projected at you without proving it out for yourself. Do your own thinking. Reject fundamentalist thinking of all kind, whether so-called Left or Right in origin. The People of the Lie Americans are presently the most controlled people in the world, supposedly living in a “free” country, yet they cannot see this. According to M. Scott Peck, Americans are the “people-of- the-lie,” who believe in the lie so wholeheartedly that we can no longer see, nor do we care to see, reality for what it is. 17 “Reality erosion” is the most serious mental disability of our time — the inability to distinguish between what is real and what is imagined. 28 This inner blindness combined with ignorance, fear, denial and irresponsibility results in crisis after crisis being created in our lives. Once again, the truth is much stranger than fiction. Surrendered Without Awareness Most people on the streets of America have already surrendered their heart and soul, country and nation, body and labor to the foreign powers without hesitation, without thought, without awareness. According to Jay Leno interviewing people on the street, many young people don’t even know how many planets are in our solar system, let alone how the political, economic or legal systems actually work. Many people, young and old, have never experienced any real “freedom” in their lives. They are working all their lives for the illusion of an American dream, 92% of all Americans are bankrupt by the age of sixty-two. Walk in the streets of America today. You'll see a stressed-out, defeated and demoralized people, most who have already given up and resigned themselves to their miserable fate. They have surrendered lock, stock and barrel, even though the first shot of a military occupation by foreign powers (e.g., United Nations troops) has yet to be fired (unless you include Waco, Ruby Ridge, Oklahoma City, 9/11 and numerous other raids on the American people). Whatever happened to the bravado and will power of the American people? We the People better summon some courage to face ourselves and wake up to smell the future. Perhaps it'll take another major crisis for the wake up to occur (hopefully not a war, famine, plague or another designed economic collapse). “If we keep going in the same direction, we’re likely to end up where we’re headed.” Prevention is the best medicine. Educated action is the cure for apathy and indifference. 29 Political Aspect Summary In summary, political sovereignty includes: 1. Forming a distinct political entity as a true nation under the law of nations, sovereign, independent and free; 2. Reading, studying and re-establishing our constitutions both state and federal, or compromising the freedoms and prosperity that we originally enjoyed for generations; 3. The foundation of a global republic. - 23 -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources RECLAIMING THE AMERICAN MIND 1.

Considering “sovereignty” is the central concept around which all political, economic and legal systems revolve, I was amazed how quickly, in a matter of a few generations, “sovereignty” become a concept virtually absent from the English language. As I taught over the years, more and more people began to awaken to their own sovereignty, especially in America — the only country in the world based on the sovereignty of the individual above that of the government. Whether you’re American or not, we’re all human beings with the birthright to exercise our rights and freedom regardless of the political, economic or legal system of the particular nation we were born into. Sovereignty is about standing in your own character, presenting yourself, NOT being dependent upon experts and professionals to do it all for you. Think Global - Act Responsibly To reclaim and restore global sovereignty for all the people requires many levels being activated simultaneously. We the People must reclaim our spiritual, mental and emotional sovereignty first and foremost, then with the will to act freely, reclaim, restore or create our political, economic and legal sovereignty. Spiritual — Mental — Emotional Political — Economic — Legal I’ve noticed over the years that you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot force him/her to drink. You can teach people about political, economic or legal sovereignty, but without facing our fears, without the will or courage to act—most people will not even take the first step. Talk is cheap and words are plentiful, but action is precious and rare. Independence — Interdependence You can give people all the tools, access to the resources and materials, even the plans to build their dream house, but without spiritual, mental and emotional sovereignty, the house remains an unbuilt, unreal idea living still in the clouds. This educational work is dedicated to those who have the passion and aliveness for freedom and the competence to execute effective grounded actions here and now. “ No longer will we perceive ourselves as isolated individuals; we will know ourselves to be part of a rapidly integrating global network, the nerve cells of an awakened global brain.” —Peter Russell, The Global Brain 2 Spiritual and Mental Sovereignty Freedom is being effortlessly aligned with the source of all creation. You must awaken to knowing that within you is that source, and that you are truly whole and complete as you are. You must awaken to knowing that you are responsible for creating your own reality and are empowered to create prosperity and abundance from that place. Freedom Is Creative Prosperity and abundance is also aligned with freedom. Prosperity is not equal to money, but true wealth. Freedom is not something we must “fight” for. Freedom is more than just our ability to go places, but to navigate the inner world as well — to move freely in any direction without resistance. Integrity is defined as the alignment of your thoughts, words and deeds. To be truly free, you must declare your spiritual and emotional sovereignty. 3 What happens when the human race gives its mind and power away? What happens when the veil of secrecy is lifted to speed the moment when the days of world domination and global manipulation are over? As David Icke says so well in his book, The Truth Shall Set You Free, an elite few cannot dominate and control billions of people and create wars for their advantage unless thousands of millions are willing to be used as economic slaves and cannon fodder. Collective consciousness is the accumulation of the sum thoughts broadcasted each moment by the human race. These thoughts can be negative or positive. Presently, there's an overwhelming vortex of negative thought forms and energy keeping the human collective consciousness grounded in the root chakra of fear and control. This applies to each and every species as well on Earth. “Once you can manipulate the thoughts of one generation, it gets easier to impose your will on future generations because you now have the programmed parents and ‘leaders’ unknowingly working on your behalf. It's a conspiracy to manipulate the human race's sense of self and in doing so, the creation of its physical reality.” 4 - 27 -"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Until we take our minds back, start thinking and deciding for ourselves to live as co-creators in this beautiful universe, co-creating our own realities with the divine, we'll be subject to intense mind control and manipulation that robs us daily of our life force. Too long have human beings allowed others to think for them, to fill their heads with someone else’s ideas. Power structures are nourished on negative energy and our own negative thoughts and reactions perpetuate this feeding frenzy. 5 We must deprogram and de-condition ourselves to the point of “disillusionment.” We must commit ourselves to a steep learning curve, take back our own minds, think, boycott the mainstream media, educational conditioning, read books, listen to audio and videotapes, attend seminars and discern what’s true for us. This is the root of all sovereignty education — reclaiming and restoring your spiritual, mental and emotional sove- reignty, then taking total responsibility for creating your own reality and the consequences therein. We must then declare political, economic and legal sovereignty as well. Freedom We’ve been living in the age of darkness. Stoned cold eyes of steel. Out of fear comes the need to control. When will we rise up and let it go? I’ve been praying for the Golden Age. Warm smiles and eyes of soul Grounded in love we build a whole new world. When will we wake up and let it be? We’re living in a mighty vision of truth. Stand together in our sovereignty. Heart to heart we join in unity. There will be justice and liberty. —Johnny Light Herd Mentality [Editor’s Note: Thanks to David Icke for his inspiration and contribution to these sections.] We're all part of the same consciousness. Divisions are only in our minds. These attitudes most people have adop-ted allow a few people to control the destiny of the planet. We're due for a spiritual awakening. God save us from religion. Religion is the greatest form of mind control through the manipulation of fear, guilt and shame. Spirituality is the opposite of religion. The people are terrorized into denying who we are. From birth we are taught to conform, to be comfortable and to live within the “hassle-free” zone. All societies and dogmas, religious or political are generally “hassle-free” if you conform. We're pretty much left alone because we are not perceived as a threat to the established order. This herd mentality allows the rule of the world by a few masterful manipulators. We are herded through conditioning and fear just like the shepherd and his flock with a stick (i.e., conditioning) and sheep dog (i.e., police). We the People consistently react in the direction the power structure intends. For example, the power structure masterminds a problem (e.g., Bosnia), the media whips up the problem to the point of hysteria, then the people react with “Something must be done! What are ‘they’ going to do about it.” Blame someone or something for the problem and take no responsibility. The Power structure steps in to rescue us with the already preconceived solution and directs us one more step towards centralized, totalitarian world government. Thanks to Bosnia, we are one-step closer to a world army with 60,000 troops assembled in Europe. This was the intended result all along. By the way, the same region of Europe was used to justify involvement in both WWI and WWII. Problem — Reaction — Solution These strategies for controlling large populations have been orchestrated for generations. When the World Health Organization (WHO) wants us to line up at the clinics and get our flu shots, they simply whip up a frenzy through the media that they predict a flu epidemic is going to happen next year. They create the problem to get the desired response. We the Sheeple react, line up to get our flu shots and sure enough there's a flu epidemic. Wake up people! Gradually, stepping stone by stepping stone our liberties and our sensibilities erode and We the Sheeple are led down an unholy road giving our power away at every step in the dance. Frighten them and the people will demand their power be taken from them. We have grown comfortable at “giving our power away” and denying ourselves. This is what's perceived as “normal” — the status quo. Once the mindset is there, it defends the norm — whatever the hassle-free zone considers reality. We are more afraid of what other people think of us than what we think of ourselves. If we step out of the herd and go our own way, dance to the beat of our own drummer, others will notice and they might not like us anymore. If you evacuate the “hassle-free” zone and have a mind of your own, do your own thinking and come to your own conclusions then others won't approve. You ask, “What would the other slaves think if I was free. Gee, mom and dad won't approve.” Neither will our friends, our lovers, perhaps even our children will hate us. Are we so weak, so cowardly that we cannot step out and live our own lives? 6 - 28 -"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Policing Ourselves Policing Ourselves Mostly we police each other and ourselves. It's not possible for a small handful of people to control and rule the world unless the people are partners in the plan. When one of us doesn't conform, we police each other into conformity through projected guilt, blame and shame techniques. We maintain the prison at all costs to our “peace of mind.” For if we ever faced the truth, our lives would be ripped apart and that's a “hassle.” We'd have to live in the “hassle- full” zone and challenge the established order. We'd have to question authority and ask “why?” We'd have to look inside and know ourselves. The real war is in our psyches between these factions. Our prisons have no walls except those psychological ones we've conditioned into each other through projection and denial systems, such as our family system, churches, schools, media, government and police. “ Don't let the system fool you, all they want to do is rule you.” — Bruce Cockburn Due to the compartmentalization of our institutions in the form of a pyramid, where the people at the bottom don't know what the people on the next level up are doing, very few have ever “connected the dots.” Only a handful of people at the very top ever have the whole picture. Most interface with government is with the clerks in the front office who haven't a clue what their agency ever does. They are the frontline of the mindset. Do what you're told. Ask no questions. Give no answers or “legal advice.” What have We the People allowed to stand? How much death and oppression have we tolerated due to our herd mentality, don't rock the boat mentality, don't question authority mentality! These attitudes have created mountains of suffering for our fellow human beings, and the destruction of many parts of the earth. And what will ever stop it, until we face ourselves and awaken to our true self and power? Emotional Sovereignty The well of tears and sadness within my heart runs deep. I shed a tear for the struggles, and the sometimes needless sufferings of my fellow sentient beings throughout the whole of human history. These tears are also for myself. Having a good cry is healthy, human and holy. We are emotional beings like it or not. We must relearn how to express our emotions authentically and without projection or blame on other people. We must reclaim our humanity. The loss of human and planetary potential, the destruction of what is inherently beautiful on this Earth proceeds at an alarming pace. For these lost possibilities, I grieve. For our belief in a death culture, I grieve. There are times when I walk the streets and it seems like human emotions are dead. Is there really no feeling, or are we masters at disguising and repressing them? We must open to receive the healing (i.e., wholeness) for ourselves and each other. Without emotional healing, all effort at reclaiming our sovereignty in the external realms will be lost. We must reclaim our sovereignty from the inside out. Yes, having feelings is human. Being human is divine. We the People seem still to be mostly unconscious of ourselves and our possibilities. When will we awaken and feel the loss? I grieve the sadness in my own heart and the pain and suffering accumulated throughout history. No transgression against any one of us has not also been a transgression against each of us. We must release the fear and terror accumulated through generations of perpetuating negative energy on this planet. It's essential for the cleansing, purification and rejuvenation of the human spirit. It takes more than an intellectual process to purge the human psyche of these memories that no longer serve your liberation. You must release them from your physical memories, from your spiritual and emotional bodies as well. Take the time for rebirthing, massage, hypnotherapy, or whatever other regime works for you, to get to the root of the fear and terror that holds you back. Once released, a well of joy will be available to generate positive energy (i.e., love) and gift it to those around you — especially yourself. “Here is a definition of emotional sovereignty. First of all, it means liberation, freedom. A state of emotional sovereignty is obtained when a person recognizes, both intellectually and emotionally, that he or she is the total creator of his/her reality and has sole responsibility for him/herself.” 7 Breaking Through Fears Fears must be challenged to be overcome. We get so comfortable and familiar with our fears that we’ve accepted them as a necessary and unavoidable part of us. So long as our lifestyle, beliefs and fears go unchallenged, we’ll go about our business of living half the life we’re capable of. “One thing you can’t hide is when you’re crippled inside.” 8 “ Plug the holes in yourself.” —Scott David According to Coach Michael Connaway, you must break order and invite chaos into your life to effectively challenge your fears. A life in chaos confronts fears. Furthermore, you must close the back door and all escape routes to abuse and co-dependency if you’re going to succeed at conquering your fears. Unbelievably, more people are afraid of public speaking (i.e., being seen) than of death. Fear = Control Since we are imaginations of ourselves, we can create with our fears, or with love, with negative or positive energy. Most of our fears are simply imagination with little or no basis in reality. Isn’t it interesting how many people are afraid of spiders, chipmunks or other critters that are - 29 -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook thousands of times smaller and less powerful physically than a giant human being. Do we think so little of ourselves? Many people are afraid of change, even if staying where they are is abusive or hurtful. They are more afraid of the change than the abuse. “Even though I know I'm going to be taxed or attacked by the government, I'm too afraid to change.” Why do women stay in an abusive relationship? Because they are more afraid of change than of the abuse itself. At least in the abusive relationship, they know what to expect. This is the comfort zone. This is the epitome of victim mentality. > EN-COURAGE —put courage in the locker room of your life. Many people are too willing to settle for their lot in life, working at minimum wage or at a job (i.e., Just Over Broke) that barely makes ends meet instead of shooting for the moon, getting off welfare, and being successful. We ‘re so committed to “keeping it together,” or at least keeping up appearances or being right, so much so that we’re willing to live a lie in order to stay the same. Have courage and face your fears. The rewards are greater than the cost. 9 “ Winners love to sweat, bleed, and get dirty.” —Michael Connaway Self-Responsibility, Self-Government Humanity as a whole wishes to give away its responsibility daily for what happens in the world. We rarely look at ourselves for responsibility. Instead we demand “others” do something about the “problems” in the world and project fear, guilt, shame upon others to manipulate them into doing it for us. If indeed there are “problems,” and I would argue that all “problems” are created in the minds of human beings, then solving them is about taking responsibility for having created them in the first place. Nothing is a problem until we perceive it to be so. Take responsibility! Humanities desire to give its mind away has allowed a structure to develop over hundreds, if not thousands of years, which today is on the verge of creating a global, fascist/communistic/capitalistic dictatorship. I wish that fascism had ended with Adolf Hitler. It just ain't so. Worse that it’s often poised behind a smiling “Have a Nice Day!” face while they’re taking you to the cleaners. The human race so often appears to be like a herd of bewildered and lost sheep. We the Sheeple are too easily led by the self-appointed shepherds who lead us eventually to our enslavement if not our slaughter. It's time to stop acting like sheep and mind-controlled slaves and accept the will to power which is our birthright as co- creators of this beautiful planet, in this multidimensional universe of possibilities. We the People must take our minds back and it won't be easy. The dependency and “comfort” of having others do your thinking for you is epidemic on the planet right now. Very few have learned how to think, how to discern, integrate or verify fact from fiction. Very few would even read a book anymore let alone do serious research into the global elite's plans for global domination and control. Take your mind back! The responsibility for taking our minds back, for taking our power back begins and ends with us. Think constructively and proactively. Question everything status quo, mainstream and alternative especially authority. Share your knowledge freely and awaken those around you to the necessity of shaking off the chains of oppression, and the trance of mind control and manipulation that has descended like a cloud over the human race. Wake up Humanity! 10 Anger and Blame is Not Taking Responsibility Some of us have already been getting angry and blaming others for our lot in life, not understanding or taking responsibility for how we created the situation in the first place. Some of the ways we are trying to change it, to get out of the system, are really dragging us deeper into a confrontation that results in less freedom and more hassles than you care to deal with. Let’s say you’re someone who studies the Constitution and our American history, and realizes that there is a contradiction between what was set up and what is going on now. This could very well make you angry and want to get back at somebody for having deceived you. If you’re an individual with a lot of victim-hood energy, insecurity and fear, you might become angry about the situation. Because you are not willing to look at and deal with the source of your anger — your own inner victim- hood, your own relinquishment of sovereignty and freedom — you’ll externalize the victimization and see the “system” as the perpetrator. So you’ll start pointing their fingers, projecting and blaming someone, or a structure outside of you for your pain and anger. So maybe you get dragged into court, and in the court system, the better blamer often wins. You then have someone who is angry and decides to buck the system. Let’s say they refuse to register their car, get automobile insurance or a drivers license. Through their anger, their intent is to simply make a statement — to cause trouble, not necessarily to get educated about how to withdraw lawfully and/or legally. This creates resistance toward the very structure they are struggling to pull away from, and generally a reaction or consequence from the system. You might end up with an indictment, a warrant for your arrest, or becoming the subject of malicious prosecution. And furthermore, it’s not the most intelligent way to get free and become sovereign. If you’re going to step out the system, then you’d better be certain that you are doing it lawfully and/or legally soas to not create circumstances you’ll regret later. Most people - 30 -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Anger and Blame is Not Taking Responsibility know just enough about these things to be dangerous to themselves. All it does is balance the intensity of the structure. It will not free them but keep them chained to it. The person never looks at the real reason for the anger — the relinquishment of individual sovereignty — but instead blames that loss on someone else. You can never be sovereign if you blame anyone else for anything. You must ALWAYS take complete and total responsibility not only for what’s going on inside, but what’s going on outside. There are many individuals who feel they are engaged in good causes when they are reacting in anger. But I’ll advise you that anger and blame will NEVER solve the structural challenges of our system. It can never break the structure. The question is, what will break the structure? First, it takes an intelligent understanding of the structure itself, why it was created and how it is kept in place. After that it will be necessary to process any anger, martyrdom or victim-hood that you feel, and be willing to act from your own integrity — NOT from anger or blame. There are people at present who are starting to hear the voice of their conscience, who are processing their victim- hood, who are beginning to see the true nature of the structure and how it was put there. And when they realize this in their own conscience, they can no longer keep it intact. They must follow their own integrity. In that choice to follow integrity, cleanly, clearly, with no anger — the structure begins to change. The issue is not the structure that is enslaving you, but the fact that you have allowed it to enslave you. If you can begin to understand why you've allowed this, why you've forgotten you put it here to begin with, then true sovereignty is right around the corner. 11 Power is the Name of the Game Human beings have been terrorized into submission to the guy with the bigger club since the dawn of so-called civilization. Bully’s have always lorded over the weak. Victims have rationalized and justified their shame and guilt. Having power and control over others is the name of the fear and terror game. Needing to power over others is symptomatic of a spiritual disease, indeed a weakness, a deep-rooted insecurity of self and mistrust of the universe. Have you ever looked into the bully’s eyes and seen self- confidence and self-love? No, I see fear and terror rooted in the posture. They are simply creating their own reality from fear and deceiving everyone else into believing they’re powerful. Don’t buy into it. True power comes from strength of character, not from the force of arms. So ask yourself, who’s the bully in your life? Who makes the rules over your life? Is it the government? Is it your parents, spouse, children, teachers, preachers, experts or professionals? If you aren’t making the rules, then somebody else is. If you don’t have the freedom and the presence of mind to make the rules over your life, then you aren’t free. If you aren’t the sovereign, then somebody else is. If you do not take responsibility for governing yourself, you will be governed. Guaranteed! Sovereignty is not any great mystery really. It’s just a well- kept secret. It’s about having the freedom and presence of mind to make the rules over your own life, so long as you don’t infringe on another’s rights or freedom in the process. Can you even imagine such a world? Those who feed off the powering over others don’t want you to govern yourself, otherwise they’d have to find a new source of employment. The global elite would have to get a job like everybody else. So stop complaining and whining about your life. Create a better one where you become the rule-maker, the sovereign. Sovereignty is the Source of Power Sovereignty is the source of power and authority from which all laws and governments arise. It is the source of power from which all governments are created and abolished. Sovereignty is the central concept behind all political, economic and legal systems. All wars are fought over the issue of sovereignty. Who is the sovereign? Who will power over another? Who shall prevail? Who makes the rules? Sovereignty is also the intersecting point between the political and spiritual realms. The outer and inner worlds meet, as above — so below, in the concept of sovereignty. Whoever constitutes the sovereignty constructs government, corporations, banks and other structures to institute and maintain a “Power structure” that operates under the exclusive authority of the sovereign. Only recently has the concept of sovereignty extended to the realms of the common people, as inherent to all free people organized in a free republic, of and by the people. “ When the [American] Revolution took place, the people of each State became themselves sovereign.” —Pollard v Hagan 3 H. 212. Historically in the West, prior to the American Revolution and the founding of the united states of America, there were two sources of sovereignty. There were the Monarchs, the Kings and Queens of various European nations, the Catholic Church, the Pope, and the Vatican. Most lineages are still operative as sovereign powers in the world today along with many other overlapping and sometimes competing Power structures. Monarchies — Pope Historically in the East, dating back thousands of years, there were Kings and Queens, Emperors, nomadic barbarians and benevolent tribal peoples. Common to both - 31 -"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook West and East, is that most of the common people had no rights or recourse against the Sovereign. Rule was absolute and justice was swift and often ruthless. Sovereign powers have destroyed thousand s of indigenous tribes, and hundreds of sovereign nations through colonialism, war, slavery, disease and economic subjugation since the dawn of time. History is replete with examples of sovereigns and whole nations powering over others for their own economic and political benefit. > SOVEREIGN —supreme, absolute, uncontrollable power and authority over a body politic; freedom from external control; superior power owing no allegiance to another; enjoying autonomy; an acknowledged leader; source of all laws and governments; organizes various entities and structures to manage and preserve their assets. > SUBJECT —owing allegiance to a sovereign or other ruler and is governed by his/her laws; the term is little used in countries enjoying a “republican” form of government. The British government was created by the sovereign lineage of the monarchy of England. The King and Queen are still at the helm of this Power structure today despite their somewhat tainted public image. Although it may appear today that the Queen of England doesn’t have decision-making authority with regard to the day-to-day functioning of the British parliamentary government, the Queen of England still represents a long geneology of power and authority from which that government was created. For example, the lineage of the royal family holds vast assets in various “Sovereign Trusts” with a situs in the Isle of Man from which they grant property and assets to royal favorites in exchange for loyalty. 12 Although, their power has been diminished due to the rise of very powerful central banking families, the royals are still a sovereign power to contend with. Very powerful people had their lands “deeded” them by a “Sovereign,” including the Virginia Company and the New England Company which were the first charters in the New World from which the founding fathers received their titles and property. 13 The British people are still “subjects” of the Queen wherever they reside including countries like Canada. The Queen of England and her heirs are still at the helm of the indisputable, invisible, behind-the-scenes Power structure of the British Empire worldwide, although many of her administrative duties have been delegated to the government. The Queen of England is also the wealthiest woman in the world with tremendous power and control over those assets. This example also applies to other monarchies as well as their respective governments. 14 > REAL —from the Spanish meaning “royal”; pertaining to the succession of king deeded, estate lands; all titles flow from the sovereign; the root of the term “real” estate. The Vatican government was created by the Catholic Church at the height of its power with the Pope as a “Sovereign.” The Vatican is an “Ultra-Sovereign Canon Law Trust” from which property and assets are granted to papal favorites in exchange for loyalty. 15 “Canon Law Trusts” served as the basis for most democratic and parliamentary governments formed in the New World, including the Mayflower Compact, the Commonwealths, and the Constitution for the united states of America. This represents a long lineage of a Power structure that arose during the Roman Empire, and continues to this day. The Pope still holds tremendous power today, both over his congregation of Roman Catholics around the world, but also economic and political power through the administration of its assets. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest “real estate” owner in the world. Much of modern day colonialism and the settling of the New World arose by papal decree, and was substantiated by the Canon law. Since sovereignty is the source of power and authority from which all laws arise, each sovereign power created its own system of law and imposed it on others. Laws were passed down from generation to generation, from nation to nation over a long history. When the sovereign powers colonized the native territories and nations, and “discovered” America, they brought and instituted their own laws. The American system of law blended the laws that influenced it. Both the King of England and the Pope brought their respective laws with them to America. The King of England codified the “Common law,” derived from the Mosaic Law of the Old Testament and other natural laws, beginning with the Magna Charta (1215), the Petition of Rights (1618), and the Habeas Corpus Act (1679). This was the basis by which the original colonies governed themselves. Thirty-eight (38) of the forty-eight (48) states based their own state constitutions on the Common law of England. Exceptions were that Louisiana based its state constitution on the French Common law. Alaska and Hawai’i are irregular “states,” more like U.S. possessions or federal States. The Kingdom of Hawai’i was also an independent nation before the overthrow of the Queen and the unlawful annexation. The Pope codified the “Canon law,” which was integrated into the Common law, and was the foundation in law from which the Constitution for the united states of America derived its power and the basic tenets of religious freedom. The “Doctrine of Discovery” was a papal decree that paved the way for modern colonialism, the exploitation of indigenous peoples worldwide, international law, and the world court system. > COMMON LAW —unwritten, natural law codified in England from the Mosaic law of the Old Testament, Magna Charta (1215), Petition of Rights (1618), and Habeas Corpus Act (1679). > CANON LAW —moral rules and laws integrated from various religious traditions especially the Roman Catholic Church; rights given by “GOD” through intuition and common sense; principles of life, liberty & the pursuit of - 32 -"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Sovereignty is the Source of Power happiness; principles of religious freedom and the 1st Amendment. Sovereign powers design, create and abolish governments at will. They charter corporations, establish trust organizations and commercial enterprises, engage in war to protect or expand their interests, and administer economic controls through central banking systems. Sovereigns are the invisible Power structure pulling the strings of all corporations, banks and nation states. Sovereigns are more powerful than presidents, senators, congressmen or other high-ranking government officials. Sovereigns are more powerful than the CEO’s of transnational corporations, or the governors of the 50 corporate States. Today, sovereign Power structures are a complex, and mostly invisible, network of individuals, business trusts, legal fictions, corporations, foreign entities, nation states and central banks. Sovereigns operate from the source of all power and authority, protected by the rule of force, while having access to economic and political power that is largely unavailable to the common people. But We the People have a wild card, yet to be fully played. In the united states of America, We the People are the Sovereign powers — if we reclaim and restore it! In the united states of America, every man and every woman has the inherent power to be a King or Queen in their own home, on their own property without government encroachment or interference. We the People are sovereign American Nationa ls OR “state” Citizens and there is no superior authority.

This is where the Christian and indigenous theologies are perpetually in conflict. There is no spiritual justification for genocide, or the annihilation of a culture. If your religion does not teach and practice the golden rule, then it has nothing to offer you. Before we can continue with the issues of sovereignty as it relates to the united states of America, we must address the issue of native sovereignty. Most Americans have heard the term “sovereignty” only as it refers to the native struggle for sovereign rights to self- determination and recognition of their indigenous cultures and nations. The Western nations and Power structures cannot continue to ignore the indigenous peoples in our mostly destructive pursuit for property, wealth, and a now extinct “manifest destiny.” There are no continents or peoples left to conquer. The last frontier is internal and spiritual, as well as political and environmental, and we must include the indigenous people in this final quest for sovereignty for all the people. We the People have a spiritual debt to the indigenous people that can never be repaid. Until forgiveness and healing of these transgressions are complete, there’ll be no true happiness in these united states of America or any other European nation. The Western world is riddled with guilt and shame for the deeds done in the name of “progress.” Forty years before Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, Pope Nicholas V gave permission to King Alfonso of Portugal “to capture, vanquish, and subdue, the Saracens, Pagans, and other enemies of Christ...to take all their possessions and property, and to put them into perpetual slavery.” With this document and its predecessor in Roman law (terra nullus), Pope Nicholas declared war against all non- Christians throughout the world. The United States is commonly believed to conduct its affairs in accordance with separation of Church and State. This is not true, however, with regard to the indigenous people of North America. 1 “ This Doctrine of Discovery, an ancient doctrine of the Christian world, still serves as the foundation of federal Indian law in the United States.” —Steven T. Newcomb After Pope Alexander VI heard of Columbus’ successful “discovery,” he promptly issued the Inter Cetera bull on May 3, 1493 in which he declared that “the Catholic faith and Christian religion be everywhere increased and spread and that barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith itself.” 2 He called on the monarchs of Spain and Portugal to subdue and convert all native lands and possessions. In essence he decreed that unconverted heathens had no rights. Even when indigenous people signed a treaty, it was considered non-binding because they were non-entities under the Canon law. Thus generations of treaties have been routinely dishonored, and indigenous people still suffer great injustice at the hands of their conquerors. The roots of religious persecution and racism go long and deep in the united states of America, and around the world. The U.S. supreme Court formally wrote the “Doctrine of Discovery” into the laws of the United States in the case of Johnson vs. McIntosh (1823). Chief Justice John Marshall wrote: “Discovery gave title to the government, by whose subject, or by whose authority it was made, against all other European governments.” 3 “ Indian people are still denied their rights simply because they were not Christians at the time of European arrival.” —Steven Newcomb Few people realize this legal distinction between Christians and the so-called “Heathens” (i.e. indigenous peoples, Native Americans, the people) is still the “law of the land” today. Based on the Doctrine of Discovery, and the resulting federal law, the United States continues to deny indigenous people the recognition of their sovereignty and treaty rights in their own ancestral homelands of North America. Indigenous people still have unalienable, natural law rights to complete sovereignty as independent nations. This has never been refuted in American law, although the treaty law has not been respected. 4 In my analysis, the indigenous people of North America never lost their sovereignty, but were conquered and subdued to the point of annihilation. Their lands were collateralized by the federal government. Many indigenous people, dispirited by the genocidal actions against them, temporarily surrendered to the federal system under the stewardship of the federal government. - 35 -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The indigenous people can reclaim their sovereignty by disengaging from the federal government and restoring political, economic and legal sovereignty over their affairs as a nation (e.g., Onondaga Tribe in New York). One of many steps needed to bring this immoral, although “legal,” system of colonization and exploitation to an end, the Doctrine of Discovery must be formally revoked by Pope John Paul II. An open letter has been written and submitted to Pope John Paul II for consideration, although he has ignored the request to date. 5 Another step needed to restore sovereignty is to restore “allodial” land rights as a tribe in either a “Sovereign Trust” structure, or by updating the tribal land patents. Restoring self-reliance, tribal traditions and language, and the land-based self-sufficiency of the indigenous people, along with economic self-reliance, is the major challenge to sovereignty. The federal United States government recognizes this sovereignty in very practical ways, for their own self- interest. Consider this excerpt from an affidavit of a former, high-level CIA operative who was responsible for developing a copy of the Inslaw software on the Cabazon reservation. \"The Cabazon Band of Indians are a sovereign nation. The sovereign immunity that is accorded the Cabazons as a consequence of this fact made it feasible to pursue on the reservation the development and/or manufacture of materials whose development or manufacture would be subject to stringent controls off the reservation.\" —Michael J. Riconsciuto 6 That the indigenous people must get these casino gambling operations, mining and other environmentally destructive industries off their reservations is essential to reclaiming tribal sovereignty. These casino gambling operations, and other industries, are a political and economic means to control and regulate the resources of the reservations through corporate enterprising. Thus the reservations become subject to the New World Order, just like the rest of the common people of the world. 7 If they are to be utilized wisely, then the funds generated by these industries must be used to rapidly rebuild the tribal infrastructure, dissolve these corporate operations promptly, and break all ties, except diplomatic, with the federal and State governments. Any native businesses or industries that remain can be integrated into a Sovereign Trust structure. This can be the legal instrument for implementing sovereignty in all tribal nations, and having it recognized internationally by establishing self-government under the Law of Nations. There are over 3,000 indigenous nations, often nations within nations, that have not been recognized by the international community as sovereign nations with the unalienable rights of self-determination. Sovereignty movements are afoot in many of the stronger tribal cultures in North America and around the world. [See Also: Global Sovereignty Movements] Sovereignty Summary In summary, the power of sovereignty is: 1. Based on the inherent nature of the free individual; 2. It is the source of authority from which all laws and governments arise; 3. It is based on the action of the individual being supreme; 4. It is a gift that you choose to give yourself. Indigenous Treaty Rights Editor’s Note: Treaty law is supreme over all other laws pursuant to the Constitution. This includes treaties with indigenous people. Until We the People honor what we have promised to the indigenous people, the lies and deceit will continue unabated. We will be caught in our own lie turned inward. Honesty in all matters is imperative for sovereign people. Indigenous nations and people have the right to secure their homelands and provide for their people. Indigenous American people gave up vast territory and wealth under the white man’s colonization. Indigenous American people, or Indians as they are called in the statutes, were not subject to any tax. The Buck Act (1940) excepted Indians from the levy or collection of any tax. (i.e., Indians not taxed). 8 The federal United States could only tax it’s “U.S. citizens.” “ Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes.” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:3] Indigenous nations and people have the right to have their treaties honored by the governments that negotiated them. Treaty rights in North America, and much of the colonized world, have not been honored by nation states because native people, like “U.S. citizens” today, were considered “wards of the State.” Indian people were under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, regulated by the laws of the federal United States which were derived from the Canon laws of the Doctrine of Discovery. From the standpoint of the federal government, the treaties were originally negotiated with “non-entities,” of “nonrecog- nized” nations, without Citizenship or rights of any kind, state, federal or international. - 36 -"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter Three Indigenous Treaty Rights Therefore, the federal government acts as if the treaties with indigenous people are not binding, nor are the treaties with indigenous people respected the same as treaties with European nations. As “wards of the State” without Citizenship of any kind, indigenous American people were denied access to the state and federal courts. 9 Therefore, indigenous people could not challenge the violations of their treaties, nor could they compel the federal government to any specific performance. Indigenous American people were neither sovereign “state” Citizens like the white, male property owners were, nor were they U.S. citizens of the federal United States. Emergency power statutes permits the abrogation of Indian Treaties when any Indian tribe is in actual (or contrived) hostility. 10 Could this be another convenient justification by the federal United States government for not honoring the treaties, by executing a declared state of perpetual emergency on the reservations and Indian lands? These emergency powers must be lifted and lawful, de jure governments re- established. “ A treaty is declared to be the supreme law of the land, and is, therefore, obligatory on courts whenever it operates of itself without the aid of a legislative provision.” —U.S. vs. Peggy, 1 Crs. 103,2 L. ed. 49 Today, neither the indigenous American people, nor “U.S. citizens” have their “treaties” recognized by the federal United States. The Bill of Rights was a treaty between the sovereign state Citizens and the federal United States government, which has no effect for U.S. citizens. The indigenous American people have been robbed of their land and treaty rights by the same sovereign Power structure that is now robbing U.S. citizens of their land and treaty rights. Ironically, perhaps karma, the very land that was stolen from the indigenous American people because of the Doctrine of Discovery is now being systematically stolen by the same old Power structure, both at home and abroad. “The indigenous American people, sovereign ‘state’ Citizens, and U.S. citizens are being colonized, again!” Strategies for restoring indigenous treaty rights, include the following. These would be interesting test cases and have never been tried. Today, many of the indigenous American people have been issued Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or became born or naturalized “U. S. citizens.” Indigenous U.S. citizens have civil rights, remedies, and recourse in the federal courts, and could compel performance of their treaties under Admiralty/Maritime OR Military/Martial law jurisdiction. The “law of the sea,” not the “law of the land” operates in the federal courts. Argue the treaties from the basis of an international contract in force, or the lack thereof, not from the basis of the treaty or the Common law. Many indigenous American people, those without a Native American tribal document (which certifies that they are still a sovereign people), have recently been naturalized as “U.S. citizens.” Although, indigenous U.S. citizens are under federal jurisdiction (just like indigenous people on the reservation without civil rights), and have “waived” their sovereignty and unalienable rights, just like other U.S. citizens, indigenous American people could restore their full sovereign rights as “state” Citizens with full state and federal constitutional and treaty rights available. By expatriating from their U.S. citizenship and naturalizing in a sovereign state, they could become sovereign “state” Citizens, and claim their treaty rights on behalf of all the other indigenous American people in their tribe through a “class action lawsuit” in the federal courts under Admiralty jurisdiction and maritime procedures. The land patents on the land held-incommon on the reservation could be updated in the name of the tribal elders, and be stewarded in a Sovereign Trust for the whole tribe. Ironically, this possible strategy for reclaiming sovereignty is comparable for both the colonized indigenous American people, and the colonized American citizen. “ A treaty is a law of the land whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be determined.” —In re Cooper, 143 U.S. 472, 12 Sup Ct. 453, 36L. Ed. 232 Seven Aspects Summary Every aspect of sovereignty defines the realm of a responsible individual. It takes courage, faith, kindness and contentment to reach the levels of joy we are capable of in our lives. The seven aspects of sovereignty are: 1. Attaining physical health and wellbeing; 2. Attaining emotional health and balance; 3. Practicing spiritual sovereignty and the golden rule 4. Freeing yourself from mental slavery; 5. Achieving economic sovereignty and financial independence; 6. Choosing your Citizenship; 7. Establishing true independence in your nation of choice. These are the seven aspects of sovereignty. Sovereignty is an attitude. It’s a way of being. It’s a way of life .

It is essential that the American sovereign “state” Citizen recognize and support the sovereignty of indigenous peoples and their inherent right to self- determination. In recreating a de jure government, the American sovereign must consider the claims and restitutions due the inherent indigenous sovereigns of North America whose lands, rights and cultures have been systematically decimated over the last three hundred years. The American sovereign must honor and respect these indigenous sovereigns, and develop diplomatic relations with them during a long deserved period of reconstruction and restitution. New nations of indigenous sovereigns are being recreated not only in North America but around the world. The time has come where either we're all going to be sovereigns and respect each other’s lands, rights and cultures, or we're all going to be slaves under the New World Order. Diplomacy -Not Perpetual War Like the Hawai'i(an) people, and many others around the world, the inherent indigenous sovereigns of North America never lost their sovereignty. Their sovereignty was not lost but suppressed, and in some cases destroyed, through genocide. The Constitution for the united states of America refers to “Indians not taxed = Sovereigns not taxed.” To this day the activities on the Indian reservations, including casino gambling operations, are not subject to taxation, although a desperate and bankrupt United States government and its political subdivisions have recently considered using national guard troops to forcibly collect taxes on the reservations (e.g., Mohawks). This is clearly unconstitutional as well as unconscionable. There is substantial evidence that the sovereignty of the indigenous people was not annihilated, although it is clearly still under attack. Indians Not Taxed=Sovereigns Not Taxed The process of reclaiming sovereignty is similar for the indigenous sovereigns of North America, except that there was no recognized constitutional government in place. Instead, there were chiefs, councils, kivas, and other forms of self-government, many of which have been functioning for thousands of years. Such can be remedied under the Law of Nations by consummating governments modeled after constitutions like the Iroquois Confederacy, or their traditional councils of elders. The principles of sovereignty are universal and arise from the natural and organic laws. “ It will not suffice for the Kingdom of Hawai’i to become a nation within a nation, and to remain dependent upon the economic and money system that has been installed ultimately to control and bankrupt not only the Hawai’i(an)s but all the peoples of the world.” —John David Van Hove, Former Ambassador from the Kingdom of Hawai’i to the united states of America These laws must be further develope d and instituted to meet the challenges of a modern colonial world still on a collision course with the traditional cultures. But the era of colonialism is almost over. The indigenous peoples are beginning to effectively organize and fight back against this historical encroachment. Soon indigenous people will have the upper hand as the colonial powers have systemically bankrupted themselves, politically, economically and morally and surrendered to the New World Order. The sovereign indigenous nations of the world must not make this mistake. Accepting a “nation within a nation” status is inappropriate for a sovereign people. So is asking for recognition by the United Nations. Sovereign people must get off their knees and accept nothing less than independent status — politically, economically and legally. Mental Sovereignty Summary 1. In summary, mental sovereignty is: 2. You have your own mind, your own thoughts, ideas and conclusions; 3. One function of the mind is for memory or storage; 4. Another function of the mind is for focusing thought and energy; 5. You must train your mind to focus both intention and attention; 6. You must learn to make distinctions in your own mind; 7. To embrace higher truths, our way of thinking must shift to embrace the paradox; 8. Mental sovereignty is about doing your own thinking and making your own choices; 8) Come up with an original idea in 30 days or less; 9. Defeat all mind control systems by being vigilant and perceptive; 10. Reconsider political correctness; 11. Free yourself from blind spots that keep the same old mental patterns operating; 12. Develop your mindset into a powerful attitude for achieving success in your life. - 38 -"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Chapter Three News from Indigenous Nations News from Indigenous Nations Onondaga Insist on Self-Rule The Onondaga Nation has insisted on self-rule and independence from the federal government for centuries. Enter the Onodaga Nation territory and you’ll enter a foreign country. They don’t recognize federal jurisdiction or consider themselves U.S. citizens. They travel freely on their own passports. They refuse to accept federal programs that other tribes recognized as “nations within a nation” do accept at the cost of their sovereignty and independence. The federal government doesn’t concede the Onondaga’s independence and the tribe has been in numerous legal battles with the State of New York which claims jurisdiction over the Nation. According to Chief Irving Powless, by western standards the tribe lives in “poverty,” but the Onondaga’s consider themselves blessed to be free and not accept the trappings of civilization such as being taxed, drafted, investigated and counted. Chief Powless is a member of a tribal council picked by clan mothers in a matriarchal society. He asserts there are lots of happy, well-fed people who are firmly rooted in their culture. “We’re still here...surviving without compromising our position for the last 200 years.” 11 Oneida Shoot for Economic Independence The nearby Oneida Nation doesn’t share the Onondaga’s strategy for sovereignty. They are convinced true sovereignty must be built on economic independence. They have raked in $100 million in casino profits since 1993 and expanded their land base from 32 acres to 4,000 acres. Being run by tribal governments installed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs doesn’t yield an independent voice for the indigenous people, but a mouthpiece for and cooptation by the federal government. Not to mention the immorality of raking in profits on gambling and disempowerment — a prostitution of the human spirit. Many other tribes have gone this route, and it could be a short-term working strategy for long-term sovereignty if they don’t lose the heart and soul of the people in the process. The tribes could gain economic independence only if they converted the financial resources into an infrastructure that provides for self-reliance and interdependence. 12 Shawnee Declare War on United States On January 23, 1990, the Shawnee Reserve was violated by an armed force which invaded the reservation in order to steal Shawnee Indian property and impose civil jurisdiction upon Shawnee Indian Country and the Indians thereon, according to Chief Jimmie D. Oyler. A recent tax levied against the Chief has prompted him to file “Motions with Demand and Warning” to Governor Bill Graves, the Secretary of Revenue and the Board of Tax Appeals for the return of all Indian property and/or monetary compensation for property, taken during the January 23, 1990 action. He is suing for an excess of $1,000,000. Chief Jimmie D. Oyler and other unnamed tribal members sent a legal warning to the “State of Kansas” that anything short of “total compliance with the Constitution of the United States, United States Treaties with the Shawnee and others” shall result in total war. 13 Northern Russian Federation Calls for International Assistance Indigenous groups in the Northern Russian Federation have called for international support for negotiations with President Yeltsin. The group is transmitting a call to “political parties and movements, to the Russian public, to all people of good will, to whom the life and rights of every nationality is dear, to support the aims of minority peoples of the Russian North for self preservation.” Socio-economic conditions among indigenous people of the north in the Russian Federation continue to deteriorate and the extinction of the Aleut, Ket, Iganasan, Negidalets, Orok, Oroch, Tofalar, Enets and Yukagir people seems imminent. V.B. Shustov, General Secretary of the Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, Siberia and Far East, says annexation of lands to accommodate “rapacious petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold and non-ferrous mining interests, without any form of just compensation to indigenous people of the north, is threatening 29 endangered nations representing some 200,000 individuals. He asserts that \"the transition to a market economy is characterized by a total break down of traditional economic activities and way of life, an uncontrolled growth of unemployment and impoverishment, life threatening levels of crime and alcoholism that undermine traditional outlooks on life, sharp decline in the health of our peoples and death rates that are one and a half times the average in the country.” As a result, ind igenous groups are demanding the start of a negotiation process with the government of the Russian Federation “while it is still not too late,”\" addressing the questions of direct compensation, guarantees of traditio-nal resource use and economic activities, social services, economic advancement, government representation and related issues. Unfortunately, this strategy is flawed as it is an appeal from an affiliated NGO of the United Nations. Although, application for international recognition of the injustice is well intended, it’s an appeal to the very Power structure that created the injustice in the first place. Can you appeal to the wolf to stop eating the chickens? 14 Huaorari Nation Occupies Oil Platforms The Huaorani Nation of the Ecuadorian Amazon (ONHAE) occupied oil platforms and rigs belonging to Maxus Ecuador Inc., according to an ONHAE spokesman, as well as Hector - 39 -"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Villamil of the Pastaza Indigenous Peoples Organization (OPIP). Maxus Ecuador Inc., denies that the wells were seized, but the Quito daily newspaper reported that there are about 100 soldiers in the area who could be used to remove the protesters. The Huaorani group says that despite an “Agreement of Friendship, Respect and Mutual Support” signed between the indigenous people and Maxus, the company's true intentions have become manifest. The compact was signed amidst divisiveness and deceit on Maxus’ part , and the corporation's paternalism and manipulation is resulting in loss of autonomy for the Huaorani people. As a result, the Huaorani have proposed a new agreement to the government of Ecuador and Maxus, Inc. for the conducting of oil exploration in “Block 16.” The new agreement challenges the government and Maxus to defend and protect the cultural, organizational and territorial integrity of the Huaorani people and to guarantee their participation in the decision making process for oil development in their territory. They also are requesting the corporation to coordinate its activities with the Huaorani's own economic development plan. 16 Indians Threaten Mass Suicide About 250 Brazilian Indians with a tribal history of suicide are threatening to fight to the death or kill themselves if they're forced from a ranch in the western brush-lands. Dozens of families of Kaiowa-Guarani Indians have lived on the 1,230-acre ranch, 800 miles west of Brasilia, since it was expropriated and turned into a reservation several years ago. Earlier this year, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a decree allowing such expropriations to be contested in court, and former owner Miguel de Oliveira sued successfully. A judge ordered the Indians off the land. 17 Indigenous people have been exploited for generations for the natural resources they command. This is as true in the former Soviet Union, in Ecuador, in Brazil, elsewhere in the world, and in the American Southwest. Indigenous people have understood the destruction of their sovereignty much longer than the American patriot. We the People have much to learn from each other. Enough of the domination of the white race over the red, black or yellow races. We must respect the sovereignty of all the people of every culture and Nation. Martial Law at Big Mountain The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) have blockaded the annual spring Dine’ gathering on disputed territories of the Hopi Partitioned land at Big Mountain, Arizona. Martial law has been imposed over a large area on Black Mesa in northern Arizona since May 15th, 1996. Operating under the joint authority of BIA Superintendent Robert Caroline at Kearns Canyon and by Hopi Chairman Ferrill Secakuku at Kykotsmovi, government agents wearing flak jackets and brandishing automatic weapons are enforcing road closures and conducting warrant-less searches, improper detentions, seizures of personal belongings, food stuffs and medical supplies and intimidation of legal residents in their homes and on their premises. The residences of Louise and Ruth Benally in the Communi - ty of Big Mountain, Arizona and the surrounding area, are covered with scores of law enforcement personnel. Violence has been reported by several area residents as police have used batons and force to take the gathering participants into custody. Police are now preparing to use tear gas at the site. Many Navajo Elders are resisting arrest as their children and supporters have already been taken into custody. The situation escalated as a group of Elder women prevented the arrest of a Dine’ youth. Police then attempted to arrest Elders who sat and clung to each other to avoid being taken into custody. Supporters and family members continue to arrive and confront the Hopi Rangers. The Traditional Elders have called on the media and the American public to come and witness the violence and the occupation of their ancestral homelands. Hopi Tribal authorities have also verbally threatened to disrupt the upcoming July Sun Dances at Big Mountain. 18 Leonard Peltier Denied Parole Again Leonard Peltiers parole was denied once again on March 30, 1996. The United States Parole Commission (USPC) states that regardless of the information brought back to them from the parole officer and despite favorable recommen- dations following the government's distinct concessions that no direct evidence exists against Peltier, it is more convenient to keep an innocent man in prison than to deal with the controversy that might result from paroling him. The Leonard Peltier Defense Committee urges people to voice their outrage with phone calls and faxes. 19 People of every color have their political prisoners, those who have fought, died or been incarcerated for their cause. It will greatly benefit the American sovereign and all concerned to build strategic and diplomatic relationships with all other sovereign entities especially the indigenous sovereigns of North America. In order to survive and participate fully in “another world order,” the American sovereign must humble themselves and lead the way by facilitating the reconstruction of America. As Bob Dylan said, “ A man not busy being born is busy dying.” The choice is ours. Americans—grow or die!

Yet, they are still willing to share “alo’ha” with the foreigners who occupy this nation. The Hawai’i(ans) are a peaceful, loving, land and sea-based people who have accepted parts of the modern world and integrated it into their traditions and culture. The winds of change have arrived on these islands once again and a window of opportunity has opened for reclaiming sovereignty for the Hawai’i(an) people. “ In Hawai’i, the time is ripe for all inherent Hawai’i(an) sovereigns to reclaim the sovereignty that is rightfully and lawfully theirs—to regain their lands, property, rights, traditions, ancestry, culture and language.” —John David Van Hove, Former Ambassador from the Kingdom of Hawai’i to the united states of America Today in the streets people will solemnly speak the word \"sovereignty,\" as if it was the liberty bell tolling for the Hawai'i(an) people. Although they may not understand its full context and depth, sovereignty is better understood here than in most of North America. Sovereignty is at the heart and soul of every human being, where the spirit of freedom begins and ends. > ALO’HA — with spirit or breathe. > HA’OLE — without spirit or breathe. Every child born in this world is a natural born sovereign individual with the innate will to be free. That will to freedom and transformation is actively suppressed by the power structures, and we are programmed by the media and our educational systems to give up that freedom and our sovereign rights in exchange for the illusion of security. Although at first dependent upon the mother and the father, then in modern times dependent on the State, a child eventually grows into the adulthood of their fullest sovereign potential in the maturity and wisdom of age. We the People must cast off the shackles of our social and educational programming by the powers that profit immensely through systematic manipulation and control, by those who harness our desires and will for their benefit, and limit our visions and dreams. The political, economic and legal powers must be brought to task and exposed for what they really are--a massive legal fiction of greedy pirates, organized crime on the high seas. Their only real power comes from the massive ignorance and consent of the people worldwide. Sovereignty is the key issue on the planet today. Sovereignty is to be free from any other nation's control--to have no higher Legislature than God. Sovereignty is not a privilege granted by one nation to another, but a right inherent in a people. The United Nations has proclaimed: \"All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.\" This does not in any way imply that the authority for such rights is derived from, or that an independent sovereign nation must get recognition from, the United Nations. It does not! This establishes as prima facie evidence that, even the United Nations acknowledges the principles of natural law and the Law Of Nations. The Wisdom of a Queen “ I could not turn back the time for the political change, but there is still time to save our heritage. You must remember never to cease to act because you fear you may fail. The way to lose any earthly kingdom is to be inflexible, intolerant, and prejudicial. Another way is to be too flexible, tolerant of too many wrongs and without judgment at all. It is a razor’s edge. It is the width of a blade of pili grass. To gain the kingdom of heaven is to hear what is not said, to see what cannot be seen, and to know the unknowable—that is Alo’ha. All things in this world are two; in heaven there is but One.\" —Lili’uokalani, 1917 20 Lessons for Aspiring Sovereigns Editor’s Note: Credit due to Estar Holmes for authoring this. The Northwest Ordinance is the first full declaration of the United States Government's policy regarding the Indian nations. It was a policy that had developed during a couple of centuries of tribal/colonial relations and reflected the good intentions of European common law. The same doctrine was embodied in the act of August 7, 1789, as one of the first declarations of the US Congress under the new Constitution. The common law maxims embodied in the policy were in direct confrontation with the overwhelming desire for the Indians’ lands though, and forty short years later, the covetous intentions of the federal and state governments were apparent. “ The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the Indians, their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in their property rights and liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed...” —Northwest Ordinance, 1787 - 41 -"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook In 1830 Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law. It was not overtly coercive, as it authorized the federal government to send negotiators to the Indians who would bargain for and promise to pay for Indian land if the natives chose to sell it. In practice though, it was a disaster, and with the encouragement of powerful individuals and state government's who coveted the territories, Indian resistance to the Act was met with military force. During those days, the Cherokee Nation held a vast area of land within the borders of Georgia state. Considered the most civilized of the tribes, the Cherokees had adopted a representational form of government and a constitution patterned after that of the United States. Every indication pointed to the fact that they intended to remain a sovereign nation on their ancestral territory and that they had no plans to disappear to the lands west of the Mississippi. However, the State of Georgia was impatient to gain possession of the Cherokee's lands and decided to proceed on its own. It arbitrarily created counties, superimposed their artificial borders over the historical Cherokee territory, and forced the foreign jurisdiction of Georgia state laws onto the Cherokee nation. When the Cherokees attempted to redress their grievances about the matter before Congress they were shunned, so they hired William Wirt who took the issue directly to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall said the court did not have jurisdiction in the case of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia on the grounds that Indians were not truly foreign nations because they were classified separately under the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. He coined a new term for the occasion, “domestic, dependent nations.” He further asserted that individual Indians were in a “state of pupilage,” that is, wards of the government; and that they only retained limited aspects of sovereignty through the treaties that had been signed. Justice Smith Thompson vigorously dissented. He argued that the Cherokee were an independent and sovereign nation. Despite their status as a conquered people they must be treated on par with other sovereign nations in their dealings with the US Government. He also delineated the characteristics of a legal sovereign nation as it is still accepted in international law today: It must occupy a fixed territory with a population over which it exercises exclusive jurisdiction, and there must be a stable organization to administer its affairs and meet its international obligations. The ink was hardly dry on Justice Marshall's opinion when a citizen of Vermont was arrested by the Georgia militia for residing on Cherokee land without a license. The charges reflected the laws of the day: “...residing within the limits of the Cherokee Nation without license or permit from his excellency the Governor...” Samuel A. Worcester was found guilty and sentenced to four years in the state penitentiary. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court where it was argued that the Georgia law was unconstitutional and therefore void because it violated US/Cherokee treaties and the sovereign status of the Cherokee Nation. In a dramatic departure from the decision in Cherokee Nation, the court agreed and reversed Worcester's conviction. This time, Justice Marshall writing for the majority said: “The Indian nations had always been considered as distinct, independent, political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the land, from time immemorial. The settled doctrine of the Law of Nations is, that a weaker power does not surrender its independence — its original right to self-government — by associating with a stronger one, and taking its protection. A weak state, in order to provide for its safety, may place itself under the protection of one more powerful, without stripping itself of the right of government, and ceasing to be a state.” Even though the court had drastically altered its stance in Worcester, it was the Cherokee Nation opinion that was ultimately favored in subsequent Indian relations — much to the detriment of those classified as “domestic, dependent nations” and “wards of the government.” 21 Reflections on the Freemen, Indigenous People and the Common Law Editor’s Note: Credit due to Estar Holmes for authoring this. If we were playing a word association game and I said “Freemen” not many people would respond with “Indian.” But the modern patriot movement and the ongoing struggles of indigenous people are closely linked; the word “sovereignty” being an example of a shared value heard about often in both camps. It goes deeper than that though. It reaches into the fundamental concept of Common law. Frazzled journalists must find it difficult to grasp the essence of the patriot community's discussion of Common law, lapsing instead into simple demonizing of the Freemen; a treatment they may well deserve — but not in the media. Mindless sensationalist sound bites are cheating the people out of one of the more interesting cultural discussions to come along in a while. (Yes, even better than the O.J. trial). It's true that most of us have no idea what the Common law is supposed to be. Our state and federal constitutions say it's the law of the land — except when replaced by statutes. The patriots say it has its foundations in the Bible. But even a cursory excursion into the vibrant venue of the Common law court phenomena currently sweeping the patriot community, will reveal fundamental disagreements over details about how to revive the Common law in our nation. There is a consensus however, that it must be revived, which is only natural. The popular support the militia-patriot movement has been enjoying (despite media attempts to make it look stupid) is due to a common sentiment that a fictitious (i.e., corporate) entity is encroaching on peoples liberties by leaps and bounds. - 42 -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Chapter Three Lessons for Aspiring Sovereigns Some have already been choked by it; their traditional life ways and beliefs have been threatened and disrupted. They have been colonized, so to speak, by an invading power — the corporate/political and global elite. It occupies with force of rules, regulations, tribunals and army of officers. The founding fathers of America knew that the right of the people to live, move and have their being was rooted in their own organic law. They also knew if people were to loose touch with that organic law, the country would be vulnerable to invasion from armies without, or an incursion by a corporate state from within. So they wrote documents and set up a government designed to preserve the organic relationship of the people to each other. They relegated the federal government to ten square miles and a few outposts so that it was prohibited from interfering in that organic relationship. It was a wise arrangement. At the heart of the Common law the people carried across the sea were two universal principles that when ignored, always cause hardship and sorrow. These are: 1) Do all you agree to do; 2) Do not encroach on other people or their property. It is a cruel paradox of history that many of the colonizers forgot to apply their lofty principles to everyone, especially when everyone else knew the Common law rules too, and it was obvious who was breaking them. However, it is still an incontrovertible fact that those same Common law breakers knew how valuable the Common law was. Let's face it; this country was established by radical, white, narrow-minded men who had some very good ideas. Such good ideas in fact, that people from all nations still clamor to come here, sneaking in if they have to. And all of us here are quite content to pursue our right to happiness on this finagled land and to plead the lst, 2nd, 5th, or whatever Amendment happens to embody the solution to our desperation. There is another fundamental principle in Common law, that of restitution. Instead of denying the fact that this national castle is built half on the rock of Common law, and half on the sands of usurpation, we must apply the law to our own breach by confession and restitution. After all, we are all beginning to understand how uncomfortable it is to be colonized. All people share the fundamental characteristics of identifying with their groups, which are described by language, culture, tradition, beliefs, morals and relationship to property — both real and personal. The Common law springs from spiritual morals and philosophical principles and it preserves the sphere of common interaction for all societies. This is as true for white patriots in Montana as it is for the brown Ye’kuana of Venezuela, who incidentally are very unhappy about a UN biosphere reserve being foisted upon them. Sound familiar? The conversations of colonized people tend to resonate from nation to nation and tribe to tribe as they strive to hold on to the things that uniquely identify them. Note for example the similarities between the following statements taken from the Abya Yala News, the journal of the South and Meso American Indian Rights Center, and the often repeated comments of the radical patriot community: “ They have superimposed artificial and arbitrary borders over a cultural and historical geography; they have tricked us into thinking we can obtain justice in their courts; they have undermined the peoples’ justice systems; they define us with legal language that does not define the nature of our character; democratic fictions...enable(d) the oscillation between democracy and dictatorship; true Indian liberation will begin when we assume our condition of immemorial identity, when we abandon the entities of the national states that dilute and disavow us.” Only those who have been thoroughly re -educated by the occupying powers insist on perpetuating the illusion that the corporate state represents the interests of the people and their commons.” - 43 -"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY 1.

It is taboo! It is inappropriate and certainly not politically correct! Seldom do we hear these “impolite” conversations around the coffee table. These questions are not seriously addressed or investigated by the mainstream media, or academia from any neutral non-prejudiced point on the Right-Left political spectrum. The polarities are also maintained by both political parties and special interest groups to prevent any serious dialogue or truth-seeking to occur. If we weren’t so insecure about our positions, we’d invite lively and serious debate on the issues instead of hiding inside our hall of mirrors behind our veil of illusions. Are we so afraid to lose our ideals? As a result of this well-organized complicity of silence, this conspiracy of ignorance and fear, most Americans haven’t a clue as to what is really going on, nor do they care how to relate to the rapidly changing world around them. We the People are forbidden to think or question how we are actually governed! And We the People police ourselves into conformity and compliance. Are we so afraid to ask? Conspiracy of Ignorance and Fear Dissent has been profoundly squelched and discredited. If we had even the faintest notion of what is actually going on, we would rise up by tomorrow morning, and demand the immediate resignation (or worse) of all our leaders. Are we so afraid of the truth? So we ask the hard questions anyway. Who controls 98% of the world’s resources including land, real estate, natural resources, capital, media, industry, corporations and national governments? To whom are they accountable? Where did they get their power and authority? Is there a conspiracy to take over the world? Is there a global elite positioned to benefit from world government? How do GATT and NAFTA serve the rich and powerful international bankers and destroys third world economies? Where does your income tax money really go and what does it pay for? Why is the American military under the foreign command of the United Nations (under a Russian commander)? Why did former President George Bush involve America in the Gulf War? Why did former President Ronald Reagan seal the National Archives for fifty years (so we couldn’t discover who really owns and controls America)? Why does President Bill Clinton continue the policies and treaties of the Bush administration to compromise the sovereignty of the united states of America? When did the Attorney General begin operating as a foreign agent under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and expatriate its allegiance to INTERPOL? How does the bankruptcy of the federal United States affect economic growth? What is inflation (a hidden tax)? Who are the real “enemies” of the united states of America (domestic or foreign)? Why does the government chronically lie to its Citizens? Wake up America! These are just a few of a thousand questions we must dare to ask, and demand a truthful answer from our elected representatives, politicians and public servants. They have pulled the wool over our eyes far too long. And We the People spun the wool! Don’t expect them to tell the truth, unless they know that you know what they’re up to. This book and others like it will open your eyes forever. The answers to these questions are contained within the pages of this book. There is no excuse left for remaining asleep. There’s no possibility for going back to sleep! Wake up America! “ Nothing in politics happens by accident.” —Franklin D. Roosevelt Is there an invisible, sovereign power that demands allegiance from the bankrupt nation states of the United Nations? Is there a conspiracy? After considerable research and years of soul searching, I would conclude without a doubt that sovereign powers and the global elite are behind the scenes of every significant event in the world today. - 47 -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ There is no indication that American public opinions, for example, would approve the establishment of a super state, or permit American membership in it. In other words, time – a long time – will be needed before world government is politically feasible... This time element might seemingly be shortened so far as American opinion is concerned by an active propaganda campaign in this country.” -Allen W. Dulles (CFR) 2 James P. Warburg testifying (February 17th, 1950) before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee as to the relinquish - ment of the sovereignty of the de jure united states of Ameri - ca and the several republican states of the Union said, “We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or conquest.” These Hearings occurred on February 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 17, and 20th, 1950. The records were ordered sealed for 75 years. You might get a chance to look at them in the year 2025. So much for the concept of open government. What are they hiding? The sovereign Power structures are mostly invisible, competing for larger market share of power and control over every aspect of our lives globally. They also merge in huge cartels and monopolies so as to minimize competition and maximize profits. Sovereign Power structures wrestle with each other behind the scenes of every war and conflict in the world today. These powerful individuals, trusts, institutions, businesses, corporations, banks, and networks of international organizations are the “sovereigns” behind all the governments of all the nation states in the world today. Power structures have been with us since the dawn of time. Power structures began with the big, strong, imposing individual who protected the tribe, and evolved to the complex, transnational mega-structures that typify the modern, technological Power structures of today. The most important founding principle of any organized Power structure is “divide to conquer, and to keep conquered, keep divided.” 3 Divide and Conquer We the People have become such experts at dividing ourselves against each other: rich against poor, black against white, male against female, strong against weak, smart against stupid, young against old, heterosexual against homosexual (vice versa and ad nauseum), that we presently pose no threat to the authority of the Power structures that run our global political, economic and legal systems. We the People have become “petty tyrants” of our own accord, lording over our tiny territory of family, friends and associates in our so-called democracy. A people divided against themselves will not organize politically, nor will they build the necessary communities of trust and open their eyes to what is really going on behind the scenes of our day-to-day struggle to survive. We the People are the political prisoners of fear, angrily blaming and suing each other, avoiding individual responsibility and persecuting the innocent instead of rallying together and recognizing our real oppressors. As Winston Churchill said, “ There is nothing to fear, except fear itself.” We the People do not acknowledge who the real perpetrators are, or their agenda for global domination and world government. That there is a sovereign Power structure with a lineage of players going back hundreds of years is undeniable. That there is a history of secret societies, brotherhoods and other inexplicable events about the origins of the human race is also irrefutable and not within the scope of this book. I am interested in the “What’s So?” of the Power structure and their strategies for “mind control.” It’s not possible to control billions of people without their consent to give their minds away, and a somewhat sophisticated system of manipulation. Just look how effective advertising is in “conditioning a market” to buy just about anything. I’m amazed everyday at the crap people buy. I’m amazed to watch them shop until they drop. I’m simply amazed at what people believe that other people tell them without question. I’m completely amazed people believe anything the government or media tells them at all! Getting beyond the institutionalized denial, which surrounds most “conspiracy theories”, and anything else that reeks of serious investigation and truth is our greatest challenge. Many people stop thinking the second they hear the term “conspiracy theory,” or any of the other popular media buzzwords (e.g., white supremacist, racist, bigot, domestic terrorist). The conversation is over! Like it or not, this is “mind control.” Furthermore, very intelligent and well-educated people are susceptible. Many people are willing to prostitute the truth for their own self-interest, self-preservation, and their careers. This is the particular sin of media professionals who prostitute themselves daily for a good story. Many people have put social status above intellectual honesty. Let the facts speak for themselves, for those with the courage to listen. Do your own research, confirm the evidence, think for yourself, and draw your own conclusions. “ It may be true... that you can’t fool all the people all the time, but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.” —Will and Ariel Durant - 48 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter Four Power Makes the Rules Conspiracy theories are mostly based on serious investigation, fact, history and the public record. Where the conspiracy gets stretched and loses credibility is when we extrapolate to fill in the holes of our theories. Special Knowledge is Power Knowledge has always been power. There is knowledge hidden from most human beings that has been sequestered and passed down from generation to generation through secret societies and the mystery schools of Babylon, Egypt and Greece up to modern times. There are higher and lower levels of initiation into this special knowledge. As many as 95% of the members of these secret societies will not realize the agenda until they reach the highest levels of the pyramid. These are the foundations for the global manipulation and control structures that presently rule the world and guard the mental, spiritual and emotional “prisons” we occupy as human beings. Through these hierarchal structures, with only a few at the top with complete command of the esoteric knowledge, the global elite rules billions of people in an almost seamless interlocking grid. >ESOTERIC = meant only for the initiated. Sometimes the hoarding of such knowledge was not for negative purposes, but because it would come under attack if known. Human beings have at root an innate fear of change, and prejudice towards innovation and new ideas. The believers in the flat-earth theory and the established political order resisted the concept of the Earth as a sphere and burned ‘heretics” at the stake. Spiritual knowledge can be used for good or evil. A hammer is just a tool and can be used for construction or negative intent. Many of these secret societies hoarded knowledge for the purpose of power and control over others, especially the ignorant masses. Ignorant people were excellent slaves, servants and cannon fodder for the incessant wars and conflicts of history. To maintain privilege, class and the ruling family bloodlines, required massive efforts to keep the truth from the people. Balance Negative with Positive Energy The aim of these secret “brotherhoods” was to not only hoard knowledge, but to persuade the mass of people to believe any old nonsense. This secret knowledge included ancient maps of the world, evidence of an extraterrestrial presence on Earth, how to exploit gullible human minds, various natural energy grids and to manipulate them to their advantage. When used for negative or control purposes, this sacred knowledge becomes distorted. The distorted aspect of this esoteric knowledge has been largely a misunderstanding and misapplication of the universal power of love, without which the Power structure generates and feeds off negative energy. Without love, knowledge will always be misused. It is the mind without the heart and inevitably leads to destruction. Mainstream puppet-journalists make liberal use of the phrase “conspiracy nuts” when describing those who express “anti-government” sentiment. To the average government- educated citizen, any story regarding the U.S. government betraying its own people appears ludicrous. Yet Americans have been groomed over generations to believe in political puppet shows designed to mask a complex and quite different reality. As have the citizens of other countries. In reality, global economic interdependence was set up to ultimately control the peoples of the Earth through manipulation of food, energy and financial resources. But the real puppet masters behind most ideological power struggles are rarely chronicled by historians, because they choose not to be seen. The history and activities of many key players in the current struggle for global power, including the Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergs, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the United Nations is well documented. Throughout time, people have sought to control others. Deceptive manipulation techniques have been used and fine-tuned over many centuries. Such ploys, like this often played out scenario: 1) One creates conflicts where people fight each other and not the true instigator. 2) One is never seen as the instigator of the conflicts. 3) One supports all warring parties. 4) One is seen as a ‘benefactor’ who could end the conflict. Ending the conflict, of course, requires control of an unruly populace by the unseen third party who manipulated the game all along. The strategy is clearly successful. People today are so busy chasing their tails over endless deliberately created conflicts within a web of misinformation that most of them will never know who really destroyed their country, or why. The desire to rule the world goes back to biblical times and beyond. One such plan for world domination was documented over two centuries ago. The “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” outlined steps toward a “one world government” by the year 2000. The plan discussed the manipulation of three world wars. The idea was to use the fears and weaknesses of people as a means of eventually enslaving them. Absolute control of mainstream media was recognized as essential, as was government control over education. History has unfolded almost to the letter of this amazing document written so long ago; any rational being could not dismiss such evidence as coincidence. Yet all attempts to reveal the roots or activities of this or any branch of the hidden power structure have been uniformly squelched and ridiculed by today's propaganda masters. There are many branches, indeed separate power structures altogether, vying for global domination in this hideous chess game.

When the storm hits, will the people beg their “governments” to save them, or will they come together and cast off this rotting mantle of oppression for good?

The re-emergence of feminine power or “goddess energy” is essential to the re-harmonizing of the Earth. Balancing Male and Female What has been passed off as “women's rights” though, is just a female version of “penis power.” True feminine power comes from the heart not the intellect. It is not about emulating the male power or wanting to achieve what men have achieved, but about a different way of being altogether. Let women be women and be honored and respected for it. Let the feminine be valued and honored for the expression of heart as much as the workings of the intellect. There must be more emphasis on this balancing in all the sovereignty work. The secret societies are almost entirely male-dominated and patriarchal with women excluded from the knowledge and decision-making. Women have their own power and esoteric knowledge by virtue of their sex, secrets around creation and birth which men have coveted and attempted to replicate and control. Lets explore partnership (i.e., Riane Eisler) models between the sexes, not domination and submission. 6 The Illuminati & Freemasons If you want to trace the sovereign Power structure to its roots thousands of years ago, I’d recommend “ Pandora’s Box” by Alex Christopher or “ Secret Societies and Their Power in the 20th Century” by Jan van Helsing. Both reveal with exciting detail the long lineages of bloodlines up to the present day. “ The Truth Shall Set You Free” by David Icke is also a good reference work. 7 The best single reference work on the Bavarian Illuminati in fact and legend is “ The Illuminoids” by Neal Wilgus. 8 The Bavarian Illuminati was founded (May 1, 1776) by Dr. Adam Weishaupt, a professor of Canon Law at Ingolstadt University. “He formed a secret society called the ‘Order of the Illuminati’ within the existing Masonic lodges of Germany... In 1785, the Illuminati were suppressed by the Bavarian government for allegedly plotting to overthrow all the Kings in Europe and the Pope to boot.” Sounds like the kind of folks our founding fathers fared well with.” 9 The Illuminati and the freemasons collaborated for awhile then split ranks. After the headquarters of the Illuminati were raided by the Bavarian government, the Illuminati operated under the cover of the League of the Just. Karl Marx was hired to update the writings of Weishaupt which resulted in the Communist Manifesto (1848). The League of the Just became the League of the Communists. The House of Rothschild was involved in the founding of this partly religious, partly political movement, which Nicholoai Lenin was also a member. The Russian Revolution (1917) was funded by both American and European international banking families. 10 - 50 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter Four The Illuminati & Freemasons When Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States, he boasted that the Communists would bury us and that our grandchildren would live under Communist rule. This may be the prophesy of the day coming true before our eyes. 11 “ You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept Communism outright, but we'll keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you'll finally wake up and find you already have Communism. We won't have to fight you. We'll so weaken your economy until you'll fall like overripe fruit into our hands.” —Nikita Khrushchev 12 Power Doesn’t Play By the rules it Makes There is an “invisible” aspect of all Power structures, sovereign powers operating behind the scenes of the storefront banks, corporations and nation-states, pulling the puppet strings of the “visible” aspect of the Power structure. For the most part, with the exception of natural law, Power structures are not playing by the same set of rules the rest of us are obliged to. For example, the U.S. Congress has exempted itself from numerous statutory laws that apply to U.S.citizens. These exemptions include: Civil Rights Act of 1964, Free - dom of Information Act of 1974, Ethics in Government Act, Family and Medical Leave Bill, OSHA and SSA. Communist Party leaders had also exempted themselves from the op - pression reaped upon the common people. 13 Power structures are not motivated by some higher moral order or authority. They do not adhere to superior ethical standards of behavior, nor do they act on behalf of the public interest of the ordinary Citizens in America, or elsewhere in the world. Power structures are not loyal to any particular government or nation state, not compelled to obey the mandates of American Common law, the Constitution for the usA, Bill of Rights, or International law, except when it serves their own best self-interest. “ No government is ever in favor of freedom of the individual. It invariably seeks to limit that freedom, if not by overt denial, then by seeking to constantly widen its own functions... All governments, of course, are against liberty...” -H. L. Mencken 14 Power structures take full advantage of the inside knowledge of the law for their own economic and political self-interest. Power structures derive their sovereignty from either the lineage of a Monarch or Pope, a legal and foreign “person” like a trust, corporation, by virtue of extreme wealth and influence (i.e., international bankers) or by operating in a offshore jurisdiction of law (Admiralty /Maritime). Power structures act upon their own authority with full reservation of rights. They are intent upon competing or cooperating with each other for total control and ownership of the economic infrastructure, in order to create a global empire, a world government—the New World Order. “ Never overestimate the intelligence of the American people.” —P.T. Barnum Americans experience a gut feeling they are being grossly deceived, misinformed and used by Power structures that operate behind the scenes of the autocratic media and big government. They know someone is pulling the puppet strings of the American democratic system, but can’t quite figure out who or why. We the People are unknowingly the “economic slaves” of sovereign Power structures that control our global economic and political systems, encroaching upon our personal lives and choices more pervasively than ever. Power structures funnel subsidies into the industries, schools, research institutions, prime contractors, and transnational corporations that afford them the most leverage and support the policies that perpetuate their self- interest. Power structures fund foundations and non-profit organi- zations to meet their social and educational agendas. 15 \"The foundations are another arm of global manipulation. Norman Dodd was the Reece Committee's director of research and he interviewed then Ford Foundation president, H. Rowan Gaither, as part of his report. Gaither told him that the Ford Foundation operated under directives from the White House and these instructions were to make every effort to alter life in the United States to ensure a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union.\" — The Tax-Exempt Foundations 16 Power structures buy politicians wholesale, in quantity discounts, to legislate their own agendas. It’s no accident that the District of Columbia (DC) is overrun with 30,000 foreign lobbyists influencing money-hungry elected officials to vote for policies sympathetic with the interests of the Power structure, both foreign and domestic. - 51 -"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Power structures have drastically altered the very concepts of justice and instituted their own, self-interested brand of commercial, corporate, statutory law that operates in a hidden Admiralty / Maritime, Military / Martial law jurisdiction. Virtually all the courts in America have forsaken the Common law and replaced it with the law of international, commercial contracts or negotiable instruments law (e.g., UCC) on behalf of various de facto governments. Common law upon which all constitutions and de jure governments are founded no longer exists for the benefit of the people, but for the exclusive benefit of the Power structure that owns, operates and controls the economic system. The exclusive, hidden and secret knowledge of “sovereignty” is fundamental to the global elite strategy of global domination and conquest. That’s why it’s essential that every Citizen, every human being understand these issues and become proficient in every area that we are addressing in this book. “ Great nations are simply the operating fronts of behind-the-scenes, vastly ambitious individuals who had become so effectively powerful because of their ability to remain invisible while operating behind the national scenery.” —Buckminster Fuller, Critical Path 17 Global Power Structure The most significant components of the Global Power structure and the elite behind it are “invisible” and inaccessible to We the People. For example, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) owns and controls most of the world media cartels and is a private club for recruiting international bankers, top government officials in all branches of government particularly the U.S. State Department and CEOs of major corporations. The Council on Foreign Relations is the American Branch of a society which originated in England... [and] ...believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world rule established... Comprehensive charts are available from the last four U.S. Presidents (e.g., Carter, Reagon, Bush, Clinton) and their administrations mapping out their membership in the CRF/Trilateral Commission. “ The Trilateral Commission is international...[and]... is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.” —Barry Goldwater, With No Apologies 18 • Round Table (introduced Commonwealth of Nations, League of Nations, controlled the London Times, decided British foreign policy and wrote the history of British imperialism) • Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) (May 30th, 1919) (influence at Oxford and the London School of Economics) (precursor to CFR) (homeport for all international bar associations including the American Bar Association) • Council of World Affairs (India) • Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) (1921) 19 • Institute of Pacific Relations (1924) • Trilateral Commission (TC) • Bilderbergers • Bohemian Club \"Those who control history control the present, and those who control the present control history” —George Orwell, 1984 20 Every American President since FDR (including Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton have been recruited and funded by the CFR, and other international and domestic organizations intent on global domination and control. Presidential elections and governments have long since been bought and sold. If your vote made any difference in the outcome of an election, they would have made them illegal a long time ago. No matter who gets elected, they own and control both parties. 21 “ More governments have been changed since WWII by coup than by any other means.” —Edward Luttwak 22 Rhodes scholarships were not set up to reward gifted students with a free ride at Oxford, but rather as a component of the Rhodes-Milner Group to create a one- world government based on British Commonwealth rules. The function of the Rhodes scholarships was to identify future leaders, instill them with common values at Oxford. Carroll Quigley was one of William Clintons \"mentors\" and has written a remarkable book entitled, Tragedy & Hope: A History of the World in Our Time. 23 This is an insiders story on the emerging global state, the century-old master plan to end national sovereignty, consolidate all currency and institute the global state.

Rockefeller may not live to see his dream come true. Like its junior varsity, the Trilateral Commission, which met in April in Copenhagen, Denmark, Bilderberg members are depressed by the current mood of America. They are afraid that the “populist” sentiments and the freshman Congressmen and Senators will balance the budget, reduce spending and the size of government, and abolish foreign aid. The Bilderbergs are accustomed to owning and controlling the U.S. Congress and the President completely. They also do not like the publicity from the Swiss media or the light of day shining in their direction. So shine the light in their direction. The Bohemian Grove is a 2700 acre redwood forest located in Monte Rio, California with accommodations for 2,000 people to camp in luxury in over 120 distinct areas, divided according to class and status. The club is an association of rich and powerful men, mostly Americans. The Grove is the site of a two-week retreat every July where the most powerful men “network” and indulge in strange cabalistic rituals of Moloch. There are speeches known as Lakeside Talks wherein high- ranking officials disseminate information not available to the public. We the People must communicate effectively with these Power structures, invite them to tea and thank them for taking over the world without our consent. It’s time for We the People to reclaim our sovereignty and freedoms, internally and externally.

It was a replacement for the League of Nations which failed to create world government after World War I. United States participation in the United Nations was never lawfully ratified by the U.S. Congress. To participate, member nations must surrender their sovereignty to the United Nations. The security council coordinates the military operations (i.e., peacekeeping) of its members. Nations like Taiwan (still on a gold standard) will not be admitted because they are not bankrupt to the international bankers. Only bankrupt nations need apply. The “Global Commission to Fund the United Nations” says present financial constraints on United Nations activities require a change in financing methods for the world body. It is now time to “ shift the burden of financing the UN from national to global sources by introducing charges for the use of the global commons or levies on international activities such as foreign currency transaction.” The “United Nations Commission on Global Governance” is calling for a World Conference on Global Governance in 1998. The purpose of the conference is to adopt treaties and agreements that will pave the way for global government by the year 2000. - 53 -"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The official United Nations (UN) motive for global government is the establishment of justice and equity worldwide. Justice, the theory goes, can only happen when all of humankind is economically equalized. The Commission assumes that earth’s masses are now ready to accept a new “global ethic” but that territorial people may need a little help overcoming the primal instinct of wanting to own private property. Those who buck the United Nations plans will be “corrected” via the use of international equity law, backed up with physical force. The “United Nations Trusteeship Council” is being restructured to represent United Nations accredited Non- Governmental Organizations (NGO’s) and this is the group that is to assume trusteeship and hold title to the “global commons.” Proposals for international taxes are being pushed to fund the UN takeover. The most significant is a 0.5% tax on foreign exchange transactions. This is projected to rake in $1.5 trillion a year, which represents a 150 fold increase over the current UN budget of $11 billion. The UN Commission on Global Governance says global taxation is necessary to service the needs of the global neighborhood and that the safeguarding of the global commons cannot be achieved with the current drip-feed approach to financing. The current administration is full of Clinton appointees who wholeheartedly support the UN's program. For instance, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott wrote an article for Time magazine called “The Birth of the Global Nation,” and he won the Global Governance Award from the World Federalist Association in 1993. Furthermore, President Clinton appointed Morton Halperin as Assistant Secretary of Defense. His commitment to global governance was so strong he failed the Senate confirmation hearings. Thereafter, he was appointed to the National Security Council which does not require Senate approval. President Clinton also welcomed the UN agenda with open arms with his “Presidential Decision Directive (PDD25),” a classified document that is not even available to Congress. A summary that was circulated to Congress revealed the “creation by the UN of a Plans Division, an Information and Research Division, an Operations Division, a Logistical Division, A Public Affairs Cell, a Civil Police Cell and a Professional Peace Operations Training Program.” The United Nations should have a rapidly deployable headquarters team and its own modest airlift capabilities. The administration claims this document gives the President authority to assign U.S. military personnel to the United Nations. 24 Resistance to UN flag On October 25th of each year, the City of Lansing, Michigan celebrates United Nations Day. The first such celebration occurred three years ago. The UN flag was to be raised along with ceremony rituals, including local elementary schoolgirls singing the United Nations anthem. Much to the surprise of the Governor and other politicians, nearly a thousand angry people rallied to protest the event. As a large UN flag was raised, with the American flag following underneath it, the crowd became loud and threatening. The little girls sang less than one verse before retreating into Lansing City Hall. Within 10 minutes, the flags came down. The next year, officials determinedly raised the UN flag on October 25th once again, but this time under the protection of state police, sheriff deputies and officers from neighboring counties. Snipers were perched on rooftops. The flagpole was surrounded by police wearing full riot gear. That year, however, the UN flag was not only half the size, but flew underneath its American counterpart. This year's flag-raising ceremony was conducted in the neighboring presence of a dozen or so well-known anti-UN speakers, news media from three public networks, and a French film crew. The American’s Bulletin editor notes: “Maybe this flag issue is the basis of a ‘new’ tax protest movement! Maybe the American position should be, ‘I will pay no tax until that foreign flag is removed from this state!’” 25 NAFTA / GATT Power structures design and lobby for legislation, rules & regulations, insurance and licensing requirements primarily for their own self-interest. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has nothing whatsoever to do with “free trade,” but is designed to eradicate the sovereignty of Canada, Mexico and the United States and establish a regional cartel that effectively destroys all competition and free trade. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is more protectionism for global cartels to ultimately destroy free trade and eradicate what little remains of the sovereignty of the 270+ member nations and effectively place them all under the jurisdiction and “control” of the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Agency for International Development (AID), and the World Bank (WB.) What is more sickening is that GATT is 20,000 pages long and Congress voted on it without reading it cover to cover. Nobody knew what was in it except those who authored it. They relied on summaries and the leadership to tell them what was in it. It passed with little debate. How’s that for legislative responsibility? 26 Free Trade = Global Cartel Internationalists Destabilizing North America to Reconstruct Regional Government Henry Kissinger said that NAFTA was the biggest step toward the New World Order. The goal of the global elite is to destroy all sense of nationalism, sovereignty and cultural origin. The international bankers and the global organizations they represent are the new conquistadors of Mexico, Latin America and the rest of the third world (including the usA). - 54 -"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter Four NAFTA / GATT We'll be talking about the destabilization of Mexico and how it will affect the perceptions and borders of the United States. The New World Order can play the sovereignty card both ways and is encouraging the breaking apart of Mexico, Canada and the usA. This will allow them to better orchestrate the reconstruction into regional governments after Civil War has torn the nations apart. The New World Order plan is not only to destabilize, ransack and pillage entire countries, but also to see the death of four to five billion people on earth. Revolution is of their making. NAFTA Enslaves Canadians, Americans & Mexicans The majority of the people of Canada, the United States and Mexico opposed NAFTA. We all have the same basic concerns even though our countries are all different; our ways of life will be destroyed by NAFTA. The whole situation is being engineered in such a way that they will enslave the people of all three countries at the same time. It is essential that the people of North America build bridges and organize communications around these issues. 27 Legislation Proposed to Review NAFTA One of the purposes of NAFTA is to “create an expanded and secure market” for goods and services. However, NAFTA is draining $2.5 million a month from the U.S. economy, according to a report by Troy Underhill in Media Bypass. The country is has also lost 227,000 manufacturing jobs and 300,000 high paying positions. Editor’s Note: During George Bush’s administration alone, the U.S. economy lost 2.5 millions manufacturing jobs. NAFTA is also supposed to “ensure a predictable framework for business planning and investment,” but there are no safeguards in the agreement to offset the negative impact of severe currency fluctuations. The U.S. has tried to protect its economy by bolstering the Mexican peso with $30 billion in loans. The devaluation of the peso has, however, canceled out any benefits the U.S. expected to achieve from the agreement. The NAFTA Accountability Act (HR 2651) is being proposed to assess NAFTA impact, to require further negotiation of certain provisions within NAFTA and to provide for withdrawal if those provisions are not met. 28 Free Trade Policy Blasted by Former GM Executive “ Free trade across our borders is outrageously immoral, economic demagoguery and an insult to the 55 men who gave us the United States Constitution.” So says retired General Motors senior executive Gus Stelzer. Mr. Stelzer recently received a tumultuous standing ovation for his remarks during a public debate on free trade at Chapman University in Orange California. Mr. Stelzer challenges the presumption of free traders, who contend consumers are best served by free trade across our borders. The position that consumption increases wealth is a delusion, he says. Instead, the American people are being robbed of potential wealth through free trade. The policy thwarts the creation of wealth in the United States because it is the labor of fairly-compensated people that is the source of the nation's wealth, capital formation, tax revenue and multiplier effect. Furthermore, it sabotages the constitutional means provided to generate revenue to run the federal government. Since money is not coming in from tariffs on imports, the American working people, who are already making less because of free trade, must now shoulder the additional expense of running the government via a barrage of taxes aimed at them. The country used to have it right, until 1913 when “we departed from the concept of tariffs on imports and substituted a tariff on our own products in the form of income taxes. Then in 1935, we imposed another tariff on ourselves under the label of ‘Social Security.’” In 1995 Federal, state and local governments imposed a total of $2.2 trillion in taxes on industry and employees, and this constitutes a tariff exceeding 45 percent of our own consumer and capital goods, as contrasted with our rate of tariffs on imports which barely reaches 2 percent. American consumers are further punished by a deluge of regulatory codes, laws, judicial and monetary edicts with which business must comply. These “internal tariffs” account for more than 80 percent of the cost of the average American product. 29 “ No agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of government which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.” —U.S. Supreme Court, Reid vs. Covent, 354 U.S. 1 (1957) 30 State of New Columbia Editor’s Note: Thanks to Jeffrey Thayer and Melanie Miller for their research and commitment to the sovereignty movement in America. Jeffrey Thayer was the first attorney in America to give up his bar license and become a people’s lawyer and researcher in sovereignty issues. He brought the State of New Columbia to our attention. In the last century since the Civil War, the global elite and the sovereign Power structure have achieved the consolidation of power in the federal United States government corporation. This shift of power from the sovereign states and their respective “state” Citizens has created a virtual dictatorship in the District of Columbia. To add insult to injury, and to further shift power into the international and global arenas, the District of Columbia recently reorganized as the State of New Columbia. The political relationship between the District of Columbia and the states of the Union has been a great mystery to most - 55 -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook people. The District of Columbia has been a federal territory since the Constitution was ratified in 1791. Jesse Jackson will appeal to the United Nations on behalf of the District of Columbia. Jackson is arguing that the United States is in violation of the Human Rights Treaty ratified by the Senate in 1992. What Mr. Jackson fails to recognize is that the District of Columbia cannot become a state of the Union, nor would it be advantageous to do so. Today, there's a new flag flying over the District of Columbia, but it’s not the old red, white and blue American flag. In 1982, the District of Columbia established itself as the State of New Columbia, complete with a brand-new constitution that bears no resemblance to the Constitution for the united States of America. The State of New Columbia is NOT the same entity as the City of Washington D.C., which is 75% black. The Bilderberg Group wants the State of New Columbia to be represented in the United Nations as an independent nation and don't care a “rat’s ass” for the black Americans domiciled in Washington D.C. Jesse Jackson is being duped and doesn't realize it. Wake up Jesse! The District of Columbia recently became a trust territory of the United Nations, and the independent State of New Columbia in 1982 by a majority vote of the electors of the District of Columbia. The international Bilderberg Group, a bastion of the global elite, is behind a move to take the issue of representation for the District of Columbia to the United Nations. If the Bilderberg Group is behind anything, caveat emptor, or buyer beware! The State of New Columbia is the seat of power for the third super-state of the evolving global Power structure distinct from the federal government, and the U.S. Congress. New Columbia is but one of three super-states. London and the Vatican are the other two. New Columbia - London -Vatican Washington insiders are well aware that the name of the District of Columbia was changed to the State of New Columbia when its new constitution was passed by a 61,405 to 54,964 vote ratified by 116,000 “electors” in Washington D.C., not by any vote put to the U.S. citizens at large, on November 2, 1982. Editor’s Note: Electors, not U.S. citizens, voted on the State of New Columbia constitution. Now, you know who really has the power. It’s a self-governing, municipal body politic which is not a signatory to the U.S. Constitution, nor bound to its terms. New Columbia operates subject to no law except its own, the municipal law of the District of Columbia. The U.S. Congress gave itself a blank-check delegation of powers, authority and conscience to act as the sovereign for New Columbia. Lawmakers have given themselves a mandate for providing protection to children or the elderly or whomever they please in whatever way they deem best according to statutory law alone. In New Columbia you can forget about the Common law concepts of sovereignty or unalienable rights. To further expand your mind, the District of Columbia, not being a state of the Union, is a “trust territory.” A trust territory is now defined in the sixth edition of Black’s Law Dictionary as “ a territory or colony placed under administration of a country by the United Nations.” In essence, Washington D.C., the District of Columbia, has been re-named the “State of New Columbia” and placed under the administration of a country (i.e., United States Inc.,) by the United Nations. The State of New Columbia is not only a super-state, but a field of commerce, governed by merchants and driven by consumers using increasingly electronic ways of doing business. The rules on this new playing field are the “municipal laws” of the District of Columbia and the State of New Columbia. “ Review the private boilerplate contracts for obtaining phone or pager services and you'll find legal terms specifying that the law of the District of Columbia will govern all disputes, and lawsuits must be filed in the District of Columbia District Court.” The State of New Columbia will only have authority over legal “persons” who agree to be incorporated by Congress within its exclusive, legislative jurisdiction. In other words, U.S. citizens, corporations and commercial enterprises that enter various adhesion contracts with the State of New Columbia. Thus to remain free of the jurisdiction of this new super- state, you must reclaim your sovereign American National OR “state” Citizenship in a sovereign state, and/or declare a contractual status known as sui juris. “ In his or her own right, possessing rights to which free- man or freewoman is entitled, to not being under the po- wer of another as in the case of a slave, minor or the like.” 31 American Power Structure Some of the American Power structure is visible through an alphabet soup of corporations, agencies and pseudo government institutions it has established: • Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) • Internal Revenue Service (IRS) • Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms (BATF) • Department of the Treasury • Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) • National Security Agency (NSA) • Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) • Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) • Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) • Food & Drug Administration (FDA) • Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) • Wall Street Attorneys and State Bar Associations • Attorney Generals - 56 -"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter Four American Power Structure • Department of Justice, administrative tribunals and equity/admiralty courts • Cooperating local and State police Agencies, multi- jurisdictional task forces (MJTF) • State and federal prison systems • Federal, State, county and municipal governments, and their connections with the principles/creditors of the United States. “ [Instead of Viewing].. .their enemy as external operating from Moscow, Hanoi or Beijing,.. millions of Americans...[are awakening]... to the fact that America’s primary enemy is internal operating from New York and Washington D.C.” —Anthony J. Hilder “ Communism is not [and never was] a creation of the masses to overthrow the Banking establishment, but rather a creation of the Banking establishment to overthrow and enslave the people.” —Anthony J. Hilder Executive Orders & Management Agency (FEMA) The executive powers that the President of the United States was granted by the U.S. Congress have called for the suspension of all constitutional and civil rights upon the de- claration of a “National Emergency” administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Most people know FEMA as the friendly federal agency that steps in and helps people during floods, hurricanes and riots. FEMA was also created as a parallel and secret emergency government located at an underground complex at Mt. Weather that would take control once a federal bankruptcy was declared, or some other national emergency. Executive Orders stem from the failure of the government to rescind the declaration of martial law during the Civil War. Executive Orders are dictatorial in nature, with extraordinary powers being granted to the President that supercede constitutional limitations. Executive Orders (EO) must be published in the Federal Register. The United States has been operating under a perpetual state of national emergency since 1933. For example, Ronald Reagan signed this Executive Order #12532 (September 1985), which is one of the many excuses for suspending constitutional government and maintaining the National Security State. Do you remember ever feeling threatened by South Africa? 32 “ I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, find that the policies and action of the Government of South Africa constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.” These Executive Powers are not limited to wartime. Using emergency powers, the President can seize property, control the production of industrial and agricultural goods, seize commodities being hoarded, assign military forces abroad without the consent of Congress, institute martial law, close all banks and regulate withdrawals from banks, prohibit unauthorized transportation, prohibit use of private telephones and other communications equipment. 33 • E.O. 12148 —FEMA national security emergency, such as: national disaster, social unrest, insurrection, or national financial crisis. • E.O. 10995 —“... provides for the seizure of all communications media in the United States.” • E.O. 10997 —“... provides for the seizure of all electric power, petroleum, gas, fuels and minerals, both public and private.” • E.O. 10998 —“... provides for the seizure of all food supplies and resources, public and private, and all farms, lands, and equipment.” • E.O. 10999 —“... provides for the seizure of all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.” • E.O. 11000 —“... provides for the seizure of all American people for work forces under federal supervision, including splitting up of families if the government has to.” • E.O. 11001 —“... provides for government seizure of all health, education and welfare functions.” • E.O. 11002 —“... designates the postmaster general to operate a national registration of all persons.” Under this order, you would report to your local post office to be separated and assigned to a new area. Here is where families would be separated. • E.O. 11003 —“... provides for the government to take over ALL airports and aircraft, commercial, public and private.” • E.O. 11004 —“... provides for the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned and establish new locations for populations.” • E.O. 11005 —“... provides for the government to take over railroads, inland waterways, and public storage facilities.” • E.O. 11051 —“... the office of Emergency Planning has complete authorization to put the above orders into effect in time of increased international tension or economic or financial crisis.” All of the above executive orders were combined by President NIXON into Executive Order 11490, which allows all of this to take place, if a national emergency is declared by the President. The burning and insurrection in Los Angeles in the case of Rodney King could have executed (and partially did execute) these Executive Orders. Concentration Camps in America President Reagon had reactivated 10 huge prison camps at key defense facilities designed to hold 25,000 civilian prisoners. A new concentration camp in Alaska with barracks, mess halls, fencing roped with barb wire will hold 500,000 - 57 -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook prisoners for slave labor to build pipelines, and mine for precious metals. An Executive Order signed by then President George Bush in 1989 authorized the FEMA to build 43 primary internment camps each having a capacity of 35,000 to 45,000 prisoners. It also authorized hundreds of secondary facilities. Several of these facilities can accommodate 100,000 prisoners. These facilities have been completed and many are already manned but as yet contain no prisoners. FEMA has been authorized for the past 15 years by Presidential Executive Orders to confiscate all property from the American People, and separate families in “internment camps.” They are called “relocation camps” by the government for assignment to work camps. Two of the state prisons in Georgia are currently empty, although manned by a minimal number of staff, have been setup and intentionally unpopulated by prisoners just to support this political policy. 34 • Executive Order 12919 —”National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness” Signed by President Clinton (June 3, 1994), delegates authorities, responsibilities and allocations of FEMA’s Executive Orders for the confiscation of all property from the American people, and their re-location and assignment to ‘labor’ camps. The Executive Order also supersedes or revokes eleven (11) previous Executive Orders [from 1939 through 1991] and amends Executive Order 10789 and 11790. This Executive Order is a declaration of war against the American people by the secret government of the United States in concert with the United Nations. Operation Dragnet Janet Reno can implement this operation upon receiving one call from the President. Arrest warrants will be issued via computer to round-up over 1 million patriotic Americans who may ‘resist’ the New World Order. Operation Rolling Thunder Reno and Benson have mentioned this operation which comprises county-wide sweeps of house to house, dynamic entry, search and seizures for all guns and food stockpiles by BATF, state national guard, activity duty soldiers, as well as local police. This function is also run and coordinated through FEMA. Public Law 100-690 Banned almost ALL RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS (not yet enforced.). The Department of the Army, Com - manding General, U.S. Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia is the executive and implementing agency. The responsible agency within U.S. Army Forces Command was what used to be known as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans Division (DCSOPS, Plans), which was changed several years ago to J-3 after the Headquarters be - came a joint headquarters. They keep on file copies of all FEMA Emergency Manage - ment Operation Plans, including those plans developed by the Army to support the FEMA plan to eliminate the U.S. Constitution upon implementation. According to current plans, the Constitution will be temporarily discontinued and shelved until the real or perceived and declared threat has been neutralized. But once shelved, as with almost every other action of the Government, it stays shelved. Secret Underground Bases and Spy Satellites There have been documented over 60 secret, virtual cities, underground, build by the government, Federal Reserve Bank owners, and high-ranking members of the government. Some of these under-ground areas can be seen in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. In additional, there exist underground Satellite Tracking Facilities which have the ability to punch your 911 address into the computer and a satellite can within seconds bring a camera to bear on your property to the point that those monitoring can read a license number on an automobile in your driveway. These facilities have, as of Oct. 1, 1994, been turned over to the (foreign power of the) United Nations. Year 2000 Crisis Likely It is highly likely, that the federal United States government will be foreclosed upon by the international bankers when the federal deficit reaches Ø16 trillion dollars (circa 2000). The same scenario occurred with the former Soviet Union when they went bankrupt. At that time a state of national emergency will be declared by the President. All civil and unalienable sovereign rights and due process under the law will be suspended indefinitely. The Constitution and Bill of Rights will be suspended again. United Nations “peacekeeping” forces will be used to occupy the united states of America to keep the “peace.” The lack of serious political action to avert the Y2K computer crisis gives reason to believe this may be a comparable world event to orchestrate a global emergency to usher in the New World Order simultaneously with the declared bankruptcy and dissolution of federal, State and local governments, and the reestablishment of regional world government. Editor’s Note: Y2K was a non-event as most of know. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was established to oversee the country when the bankruptcy and martial law was finally declared. The bankruptcy has been largely kept secret for over 65 years. The following are speculations of what could occur when the federal bankruptcy is openly declared. The principals/creditors of the federal United States are at war with the American people with the full cooperation of the bankrupt United States corporation. - 58 -"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chapter Four Executive Orders & Management Agency (FEMA) America will be soon governed under a one-world government dictatorship, a high-tech, totalitarian Attorney- Police-Prison State, a “communistic” country foreclosed upon by the international bankers, and policed by United Nations troops and federal troops. Whether or not these postulations become reality or not, depends on what we do today. Is this the kind of America you want to live in? It’s right around the corner. The writing is on the wall. In fact, it’s between the lines of the news everyday. 35 Federal Government As Organized Crime If the truth was ever told, and We the People could hear, about the covert and criminal activities of those acting on behalf of our federal government, there would be a revolution tomorrow. The truth being, the scandalous activities of our elected representatives and other federal officials who have pro- fiteered at public expense, and engaged in the grand theft of our country, our assets and our natural-born rights. From the theft of the Savings & Loans, BCCI, the systematic looting of Chapter 11 assets, the theft of Inslaw software by the Department of Justice, October Surprise, Iran-Contra, Watergate, and wars of aggression around the world, the federal United States has a poor track record in the second half of the 20th Century. 36 Our failure as Americans to speak out and to act respon- sibly has escalated our political, social, and economic problems to the point of crippling this once great nation. Everyone in positions of power knows that the American people are paying dearly for tolerating this outrageous corruption, yet We the People remain indifferent, like cattle going to slaughter. Vegetating in front of the television, and not disturbing the status quo will guarantee that everything will get worse. Most people do not perceive this criminal behavior and misconduct as a threat to themselves, thus they are content to do nothing. The massive ignorance and indifference to government misconduct by the American people makes their criminal behavior more profitable, and encourages its proliferation from the higher echelons of government down to the street level. We are generating criminal behavior at all levels of society in an ethical and moral vacuum that supports the myth that crime does in fact pay. This massive ignorance and indifference also makes attempts by investigators, honest government employees, and informants and whistleblowers to correct the criminal behavior difficult if not futile. The Power structure is presently so corrupt that it cannot and will not correct itself until the people speak out, take serious action to reapply the checks and balances that limit government, and restore a constitutional Republic. We the People must restore our sovereignty and take responsibility for ensuring that the law of the land is obeyed by the government, as well as the people. It is essential that a majority of the American people become aware of the well-orchestrated criminal behavior involving high-level government personnel, and to motivate the American people to take action and bring a halt to the destruction of the values that once made the united states of America a great country. There must be a revolution against government corrup-tion and an unprecedented ousting of federal officials never before witnessed in the united states of America. The federal United States government has lost all credibility by its inaction in correcting systemic problems, rampant criminal behaviors, and by neglecting its duty and office as specified by the Constitution for the usA. By acting so irresponsibly and being unaccountable for its actions, the “District of Columbia” has become a “District of Criminals” operating outside the law of the land. It seems that the only people who aren’t aware of the sinister practices by government personnel are the American people, who have not yet been touched by the long arm of tyranny that will eventually be at their door. Modeled after the famous quotation by Martin Niemoeller when the Nazi’s finally came after the Jews: “ I didn’t speak up when the secret government brought about wars in Laos, Burma, Vietnam, [E. Timor], and Central America. I didn’t speak out about the deaths of 58,000 Americans in Vietnam, or the tens of thousands of CIA-directed assassinations in Central and South America. I didn’t speak out when the savings and loans were looted. I didn’t speak out [or listen] when courageous individuals spoke out about the October Surprise operation. I didn’t speak up when...people reported the CIA drug trafficking into the United States. I didn’t speak up when I learned of the looting of people’s assets in Chapter 11 by corrupt federal judges and others.” “ I chose to remain ignorant about the depth of corruption by government officials and judges. I ignored the pattern of cover-up and criminal activities by members of Congress. I ignored my responsibilities as a Citizen, and was indifferent to the tragic plight of those people who were directly affected by the massive corruption in government. - 59 -"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook I shirked my responsibilities by eagerly believing the disinformation and denials given by the media and federal officials. I am now paying the consequences, and I share the blame for what is happening to the United States, [and] to the American people.” —Rodney Stich, Defrauding America 37 The federal United States government has become a criminal enterprise headed by the misnamed Justice Department and the CIA with the full knowledge and complicity of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branch of the federal and state governments, and the mainstream media. How has this happened in the once great united states of America? 38 Organized crime has been operating in and around the White House and the U.S. Congress for over two decades. Both George Bush and Bill Clinton were key players in the Mena, Arkansas cocaine smuggling operation, laundering money for covert operations and for building political empires. Bringing an indictment against these traitors is the true test of the integrity of our legal system. There is enough evidence to fill a football stadium, yet not one indictment can be brought. The White House has been harboring serious criminal activity for decades. Our system is as bankrupt and corrupt as the morals and ethics of our leaders. Many of these men should be impeached and sent to prison. “Three Strikes and You’re Out” should be applied first and foremost to our elected representatives. If the professional politicians in the U.S. Congress had the courage to speak the truth and get off the dole, this country could turn around. Money is still the primary inducement for treason. 35 I have little interest in streamlining governmen t or in making it more efficient , for I mean to reduce its size . I do not undertake to promote welfare , for I propose to extend freedom . My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them . It is not to inaugurate new programs , but to cancel old ones that do violenc e to the Constitution , or that have failed in their purpose , or that impose on the peopl e an unwarranted financial burden . I will not attempt to discover whether legislation is ‘needed’ before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible. And if I should later be attacked for neglecting my constituents’ ‘interests,’ I shall reply that I was informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can. —Barry Goldwater National Security State and CIA Did you know that the government can use your household or office garbage to incriminate you, including your medical records, psychiatrist’s or your attorney’s private notes? Customs agents are routinely searching passengers leaving the country for smuggled items, including excess cash. Foreign mail is opened and bank tellers are being ordered to report suspicious transactions. The National Security Agency (NSA) is capable of monitoring phone calls between the United States and foreign nations. The Computer Matching and Privacy Act gives the government absolute authority and discretion to wiretap phones and plant bugs in homes and businesses without the knowledge or consent of those being monitored.15 The Digital Telephony Bill (HR 4922), passed by the House (Oct. 5, 1994), created and funded a national system for the interception of digital and other communications. It will allow the easy isolation of individual communications for government wiretapping purposes, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization. Telephone companies that do not comply or assist the government will be shut down. Clipper chips have been designed to be installed in all electronic devices including computers, telephones, fax machines and televisions so that the government can monitor your communications remotely. Look for these to be legislated into existence soon. “ A revolutionary change, permitting law enforcement agencies to pass around investigative information, much of it rumor and gossip over a national computer system run by Big Brother.” —Representative Don Edwards (D-CA) National Security Directives (NSD) issued by the National Security Agency do not have to be reported, reviewed, made available to anyone or even acknowledged that they exist. Over 500 secret orders can also be invoked by the President, includin g the total censorship of all devices capable of emitting electromagnetic radiation. 36 The CIA was legislated into existence via the National Security Act (1947) with limited statutory authority. 37 It originally required that any covert action taken by the CIA must be authorized by the National Security Council. The NSA originally provided for checks and balances that have become meaningless today. The CIA has taken on functions never intended by the NSA, and has consistently breeched its mandate. After WWII many former Nazi intelligence officers were brought to the United States and placed into various intelligence agencies, including the Office of Naval Intelli- gence, and the CIA. 38 Having infiltrated many key posi- tions in government agencies and private enterprises with - 60 -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter Four National Security State and CIA people loyal to various CIA hierarchies, the CIA represents the real Power structure in the United States. 39 The CIA went underground when President Jimmy Carter ordered the disbanding of its covert operations in the seventies until Reagan’s election restored CIA operations. There are three factions in the CIA that are often fighting each other. Faction-One is controlled by the Department of Justice and the White House. Faction-Two is controlled by the Office of Naval Intelligence, often at odds with Faction- One. Faction Three is a small number of former Office of Strategic Services (OSS) personnel. 40 Today, the CIA has become so powerful that it can destroy any politician who seriously questions its activities. “ The National Security State uses fascism to protect capitalism while they say they’re protecting democracy from communism.” —Michael Parenti 47 The CIA conspires with underworld figures including the Italian and Jewish Mafia to carry out all sorts of criminal activities both abroad and in the united states of America. President Dwight Eisenhower warned the American people of the dangers imposed by the military-industrial complex, which included the CIA. Mind Control and the Global Manipulators A notorious center of mind control and time travel research on the eastern end of Long Island, New York is Montauk. Preston Nichols discovered a blocking frequency jamming the minds of psychics he was working with. A blocking frequency put around this planet to disconnect humanity from the other dimensions is like being an astronaut on the moon being cut off from Mission Control. Like radio or television waves broadcasted from a transmit - ter and decoded by a radio or television set, the human mind decodes thought-waves broadcast by the universe. Some people have their sets tuned for other frequencies and dimensions and are considered talented psychics, intuitives or clairvoyants. These are talents once common to the entire human species that have been blocked, jammed or programmed out of us by the global manipulators. The CIA, and other intelligence communities, have long engaged in mind control experiments: LSD and psychedelic experiments in the sixties; HAARP blasting human population centers and the natural environment with electromagnetic radiation; training assassins for their dirty work, and boot camp for the new enlistees and cannon fodder. Secret Government Directives Behind Airport I.D. Check Reporters who follow federal FOIA issues may be interested in recent efforts by privacy advocates to get the government to release a secret directive that the airlines rely on as the basis for demanding that passengers show an official photo ID before boarding their flight. Some privacy advocates consider the ID requirement on domestic flights an unnecessary intrusion into the passenger's privacy, since the metal detectors and luggage screening equipment that is already in place is sufficient to ensure the security of air travel. While airline officials blame the FAA for the photo ID requirement, the FAA is refusing to make public the secret directive that the airlines say they are implementing. This, of course, raises questions as to why the directive itself is such a secret. From the passenger's perspective, the airlines are saying “the FAA makes us do it,” but the FAA says “no” when asked to produce the document that the airlines claim requires them to ask for ID. Privacy attorneys Robert Ellis Smith and Lee Tien have filed separate FOIA requests to obtain the FAA directive. Both FOIA requests were rejected, and Smith and Tien are doing more legal research to determine if there is sufficient grounds for a lawsuit. Meanwhile, passengers who refuse to show a photo ID, have in a few cases been prevented from boarding, subjected to abuse by airline officials, or treated with suspicion for exercising their Constitutional right to privacy. Even more confusing, some passengers are not being asked for ID prior to boarding. 48 “ For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy making arm of the government...” —President Harry Truman 49 - 61 -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources SOVEREIGN POWER STRUCTURES 1.

Sounds reminiscent of the \"evil empire\" come home to roost in America.” —Johnny Liberty Editor’s Note: The following commentary was inspired by film reviews I’ve been doing while simultaneously searching for links and patterns to the news over the INTERNET. Over the last two years, there is a pattern of increased domestic terrorist activity, increased media preoccupation with terrorism and increased government cover-ups and suppression of evidence to secure convictions in these cases. Who benefits from terrorism? Do the terrorists or their “cause” actually benefit, OR does the media and the government benefit? You decide. We know for certain that nothing in politics or global affairs happens by accident. Murder of Gordon Kahl The murder of tax-protester Gordon Kahl by government agents on February 13th, 1983 in Medina, North Dakota signaled the watershed event for the modern “patriot” movement in America. White, middle-class America had been increasingly upset about the decline in the standard of living, the increasing bite of the taxman and numerous bankruptcies and foreclosures that disrupted the comfortable lives of family farmers in the Midwest. The mergers and acquisitions of large corporate farms was the direct result of money market manipulation by the bankers forcing thousands of mid-western farmers to lose their property during the mid-seventies. They marched on Washington D.C. led by Dr. Eugene Schroder, to protest, but the Congress turned a deaf ear on its most loyal constituency. Dr. Schroder has since cham- pioned the research on War & Emergency Powers Acts that have robbed We the People of our constitutionally-protected rights. Now, the government and the police had for generations waged a not-so-secret war against black Americans, native Americans, union organizers, civil rights organizers and just about anybody else who challenged the authority of centralized government, but this was different. It wasn't an attack against a minority group. In the government's mind, attacking minorities is justified because they can never become the political majority and do serious damage to the system. The murder of Gordon Kahl wasn't a racial issue, but a political issue. Fed up with government being irresponsive to the people, he had turned to the study of law to fight the IRS. He was popularizing legal remedies to reverse the trend of big government, and was stepping on some pretty big toes in the process. This event marked the desperation of the centralized gov- ernment to maintain law and order and keep a lid on the fraud it had been perpetrating on the American people. The lid was about to be lifted and the government would be caught raiding the chicken coup. Like a game of musical chairs, nobody likes having no place to sit when the music stops. The music was about to stop. When it's most loyal constituency, white middle-class America stopped paying their taxes and caught on to what was really going on behind closed doors — big government and the big business that leaches off it would be dead. So something had to be done. Gordon Kahl had to be stopped. Somebody orchestrated this event, fully ten years before Waco & Ruby Ridge. Excessive force was used to serve a bogus search warrant upon this white, middle-class and Christian tax protester in North Dakota. It signaled a revolution in process that continues to this day. His son was charged and convicted of killing federal agents in self-defense. This event was a symptom of the recklessness and stupidity with which our government has determined to wage a war against its own people. This was the government assault that signaled the beginning of the “patriot era.” Thousands of average, tax-paying, middle-class Americans woke up politically that day and haven't gone back to sleep yet. They realized their lives could be snuffed out as quickly as Gordon Kahl by a government drunk with power. The Sagebrush Rebellion began to gain momentum. Editor’s Note: Yorie Kahl has been in prison ever since, the first prominent patriot political prisoner in a steady stream of this era. He did not receive due process of law during his trial. His appeals and parole have been forthright denied. Read their stories, write and lend your support. It's a long time to be rotting in jail. 1 Designing Problem, Reaction, Results It is essential to see the pattern in these events by the results generated. They are not isolated. They are designed and planned. All the following ACTIONS or EVENTS have yielded specific REACTIONS that generated one RESULT with several beneficiaries. One RESULT is interagency cooperation and a giant step towards the merging of all local, State and federal police forces into a national police force with one united goal — to eradicate “terrorism” and the so-called “cults” that perpetuate it. Action — Reaction — Result Behind that RESULT is an agenda for world government of, by and for the global elite. We the People must understand the herd mentality that allows such deception and manipulation to be slowly but readily accepted by the people.

Criminals are being mass-produced by the outpouring of new legislation, new laws, new regulations and controls from all levels of government, particularly from the federal. This massive growth of the federal bureaucracy and their police powers has grown dangerous and unwieldy. Who benefits from the rise of federal police power? Who benefits from all the new prisons being built? Who benefits from terrorism? Clinton admitted that the single greatest reason for his reelection was the Oklahoma City Bombing. Are We the People benefiting from all these new police? Are you more secure? Do you sleep better at night? Or is this it all a well-conceived and well-implemented hoax to slowly but certainly erode your civil liberties and install a police state? No! The erosion of our liberties has everything to do with the hidden agenda of the shadow government to destroy all forms of government of, by and for the people. It's time to wake up and smell the roses! Centralization of Police Power This is the ultimate RESULT of a socialist - communist - fascist police force, centralized enforcement power in the hands of the State, instead of checks and balances against the tyranny of any particular agency or branch of government. In a dictatorship, who's going to be the independent investigator to determine standards? Who's going to police the police? Who's going to police the courts and the politicians? Without an alert and educated populace, tyranny is guaranteed. Even the police and military forces themselves are being duped into submission and compliance with the global agen - da. What isn't mentioned is the government and media involvement in falsifying evidence (i.e., you read what we want you to read), the obstruction of justice (i.e., we keep whatever evidence fits our story and destroy the rest), false and often groundless accusations (i.e., slander and libel, blacklisting against selected individuals who might tell the damned sordid truth and nothing but), malicious prosecutions (i.e., targeting individuals for prosecution and conviction to put them out of circulation), and perhaps direct involvement in the staging of terrorist events to secure the desired result above. If you still believe JFK was murdered by a lone assassin then you've been living with your head in the sand for way too long. Editor’s Note: Today, we'd call Oswald a terrorist and prosecute the witnesses on the grassy knoll who saw shots coming from another direction besides the book depository, as coconspirators. Many witnesses contradicted the Warren Commission Report about the lone killer and the magic bullet theory. Testimony was changed or eliminated to fit the govern- ment's story. Isn't it about time to do your own research and come up with your own conclusions? The murderers even erected a statue at the scene of the crime and nobody even noticed. There is evidence to prove that the FBI knew about the bombing of the World Trade Center in advance, could have prevented it but didn't, then blamed it on Palestinian terrorists. There is evidence to prove that the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was a government military operation, not a two-man lunatic fringe operation. The bombing at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was executed strategically and from very high levels to destroy condemning evidence regarding the government's behavior at Waco, to frame up and arouse negative public opinion against groups that are a threat to their power base, and then it could be blamed on the militias. Beware fellow Citizens, that the United States government has be-come the world's most dangerous “terrorist” organization. Numerous witnesses to the Oklahoma City Bombing saw Timothy McVeigh in the company of four or five individuals the morning prior to the bombing. The FBI has been harassing and intimidating those witnesses to change their stories. Witnesses saw fire going towards TWA Flight 800 from the ground right before the explosion, yet after a $40,000,000 investigation the government doesn't know and won't tell what blew up that plane. Perhaps Ron Brown knew something he wasn't supposed to know. Perhaps it benefits the government's plans for another coup d’etat to have the people whipped up into a frenzy about “terrorists” and militia groups so as to imposing martial law. In America, we've been in a perpetual state of national emergency since the bankruptcy of 1933. Now, the global Power structure has decided to stop scurrying around in the dark alleys of a shadow government as they have for several generations. Now, they’re coming out in broad daylight to arrogantly destroying the last vestige of freedom in America. That is if we cooperate and continue to give our power away. Political Assassinations ACTIONS: Assassinations or Murders of Benevolent and Dynamic Leadership: John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Medgar Evans, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, John Lennon. Editor’s Note: Federal government has sealed the files regarding Kennedy's assassination until the year 2029. The Department of Justice has not reopened the investigation despite plenty of disconcerting evidence of a probable conspiracy from the highest levels of government 2 REACTIONS: Americans are Shocked at the Violence in their Midst and Loss of Leadership; Americans are Too Disempowered to take Effective Action or Question the Government's Story. - 66 -"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Conspiracy vs. Fact: Who Benefits from Terrorism? Editor’s Note: From November 23rd, 1963 to the present, confidence in leadership and blind faith in our so-called “democratic” institutions has declined in America. The government has routinely lied to the American people about every significant event since. The government has proven itself to be unequivocably untrustworthy. RESULTS: Coup d’ etat by Military Industrial Complex; Escalation of War in Southeast Asia; Huge Profits for War Industry; Expansion of Cold War; Fragmentation of Civil Rights Movement and Political Activism of the Sixties; Expansion of Centralized Power in the Hands of the Federal Government. Who Benefits? Excessive Use of Police Power ACTIONS: M.O.V.E. Assassinations in Philadelphia by COINTELPRO; Leonard Peltier Framed for Murder of Federal Agents (June 26, 1975) by FBI COINTELPRO; Tax Protester Gordon Kahl Murdered by Federal Agents (February 13th, 1983) and Son Yorie Kahl Imprisoned; Rodney King Beaten By Los Angeles Police; Donald Carlson; Donald Scott Murdered by Police While Serving a Warrant. 3 Terrorist Events in America ACTIONS: FBI Informant Involved in Staging World Trade Center Bombing with Terrorists (February 26th, 1993); ADL Fuels the Rhetoric About Anti-Jewish Sentiment & Blames the Arab World; Editor’s Note: Evidence revealed during the trial supports the conclusion that the FBI had foreknowledge of the bombing and an FBI informant was involved in supplying the bomb–making materials to the terrorists. This was a precursor to Waco by two months. 4 ACTIONS: Combined Military and Federal Assault Against Civilians Murder of Innocent Women and Children: Waco (April 19th, 1993) and Ruby Ridge (August 22nd, 1992) Editor's Note: Federal government still accepts no responsibility for staging these fiascos. Was it planned all along to generate the intended result? Further oppression and the centralization of police power in the hands of the federal government? Military involvement in civilian affairs and a coup d' etat? Could history be repeating itself again. 5 REACTIONS: Militia Groups Arming and Expanding Membership Throughout the States; Citizen Grand Juries Forming to Indict Corrupt Government Officials; Citizen's Expanding the Use of the Courts to Bring Their Issues and Grievances; Citizen's Organizing Fax Networks, Utilizing Short Wave Radio and the Internet to Advance the Cause of Justice; Government at all Levels Getting Nervous About Citizen Activism and Mounting Anger Editor's Note: The rise of the patriot movement was gradu - al from the mid-seventies until escalating in the mid- nineties. It took almost twenty years to gather enough steam to concern the government. Big government, corpo - rations and banks have been getting away with murder and ransacking the people's property for generations and they wonder why Citizen's are angry and organizing against them. To be labeled anti-government, means to be against government corruption, not against lawful gov - ernment of, for and by the people. There is nothing inher - ently \"hateful\" about not allowing corruption, injustice and evil to prevail 6 ACTIONS: Bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City; BATF had Foreknowledge of Bombing but did Nothing; Obvious Cover-up by Federal Government: Oklahoma City Bombing (April 19th, 1993) Editor's Note: Evidence supports that McVeigh was not working alone, that the fertilizer bomb could not blow up the building, that military-style bombs were used to down the building. There is more than meets the eye and too much evidence suppressed to rule out an extensive cover-up by the government. McVeigh was an outsider to the patriot movement, unknown until his deed was done, probably a government agent and a patsy set-up to take the blame for a dark and shadowy government operation. Nichols just got caught up in the angry passion of the times and was swept away by a system furious for vengeance. REACTIONS: Anti-Terrorist Legislation Was Passed and Signed Into Law Further Restricting Civil Liberties, Expanding Federal Police Forces and Permitting the Use of U.S. Military to Fight Terrorism; The Media Whipped Up a National Frenzy About Militia Groups and Eagerly, Without Facts, Blamed Them or Anyone Who Spoke Out Against Government Corruption and Fraud for the Bombing Editor's Note: You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see the pattern emerging towards the end result of more cen - tralized police power in the hands of the State. Open Your eyes people and wake up! The militias, radio talk-show personalities, sovereign Citizens and constitutionalists were not responsible for bombing the Federal Building, yet in the public perception and greed for revenge, they're psy - chologically attached to punishing a scapegoat, anyone for this horrendous crime against humanity. Strategically placed disinformation wins out over reason and fact in a country full of victim mentality, eager to blame anyone else for their problems and pain. This is the foundation of all mind control and shadow governments are experts at it. 8 ACTIONS: Potential Military and Federal Assault Averted by the presence of Citizen's Militia; Patriots Assist in Negotiating: Freemen of Montana (March 25th, 1996); Elizabeth Broderick Known as “The Lien Queen” Arrested in California (April 26th, 1996) Editor’s Note: As a result of Leroy Schweitzer's far too excellent research into the nature of the international banking system revealing the humongous fraud perpetrated on the American people, he became the first notable and controversial political prisoner. Although many disagree as to whether or not his research is valid, most would agree that his poor though noble attempt to bankrupt the power structure through the lien process was bound to fail. He had a strong-minded and stubborn personality and was committed to the process, right or wrong.

People involved in common law courts, Citizen grand juries or any vocal opposition to the government found themselves subject to malicious prosecution and/or military-style police raids on their homes or offices. A panic spread through the patriot movement as many feared for their lives and families. 10 ACTIONS: Bombing at the Olympics in Atlanta; Attempted Frame-up of Security Guard Failed: Olympics Bombing Editor's Note: No comment. Who done it? It's your best guess. I don't know. 11 ACTIONS: Downing of TWA Flight 800; Potential Cover-up of Real Cause of the Demise of Flight 800; Crash of Air Force Plane Carrying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown; Editor's Note: Evidence supports the plane was downed with a missile. The government & the NTSB denies eye- witness reports. Witnesses are harassed. 12 ACTIONS: Republic of Texas Was the Most Effective and Best Organized State Sovereignty Group in the Country; McLaren Was the Founder and Legal Researcher Behind it's Success; Republic of Texas Had Just Divided Into Two Factions; Richard McLaren Was Utilizing the Lien Process Like Schweitzer; McLaren Was Having Dubious Success Working Within the Existing Judicial System; Federal Judiciary Was Obstructing the Process of Independence for Texas and Ignoring International and Constitutional Law: Republic of Texas Being Organized Editor's Note: This was a process each of the other 47 state republics would have to have done simultaneously to have pulled a political coup over the New World Order. 13 REACTIONS: McLaren Had to Be Stopped; McLaren Was Becoming Increasingly Desperate and Paranoid Having Alienated Much of His Support in Texas; Government Seized the Opportunity When McLaren Reacted and Purportedly Kidnapped; Government Used Excessive Force for Serving a Warrant: Republic of Texas Standoff Editor's Note: McLaren was a vocal and competent oppo - nent of the State of Texas, asserting the sovereign right of the people to reestablish the republic. I believe he was gen - uine and sincere, although I can't validate all his legal opinions and strategies. His personality and inability to keep the Republic of Texas moving in one direction, being patient and committed to non-violence, were his ultimate downfalls. Divided the Republic of Texas will ultimately fail to reassert it's independence. Ditto in the Kingdom of Hawai'i.] [Editor's Note: When the media refers to a \"sepa - ratist\" they imply there is no separation of powers doctrine between the federal and state governments (which is a ba - sic tenant of American Law and the Constitution), that the people are not sovereign and have no rights to keep the fed - eral government out of the business of the states, including the Republic of Texas which is even recognized as an inde - pendent nation under international law (World Court at Hague). 14 Disinformation Agents & Hate Groups These are complicated and difficult times for the free- minded, freewheeling sovereign people who dare to exercise the unalienable rights given by our Creator. Freedom and liberty are under attack everywhere. And those who many of us believe to be our ”protectors” are in fact the perpetrators of injustice. The propaganda and double-think media machine is working overtime to deceive the American people into believing the militias, sovereign Citizens, Common law courts are somehow evil and antigovernment terrorists. Sounds reminiscent of the “evil empire” come home to roost in America. The Cold War has become a Civil War in America between the haves and havenots. It has nothing to do with race, but money and power. All this is a carefully implemented mind control and misinformation campaign intended to rob the ignorant of any other conclusion except that government is good, government is our savior, government is right and true. This is corporate State socialism come home to these united states of America with its institutionalized lawyers, professional liars (media) and politicians. Who are the real terrorists? Who are the real criminals? Who has robbed the American people of their property for generations? Who are the real racists hiding behind their veil of anti-hate? This is a delicate issue as it brings out prejudice and bias hidden behind our own personal core beliefs. In my opinion, the answer to these questions has nothing to do with race, class, creed or color. These are political and economic issues, yet the guardians of public morality would have you believe that if you challenge the authority of the government or the banks you are hateful, anti-semitic and racist. This logic demonizes good people who are attempting to correct the injustices. If you challenge the Federal Reserve Bank, the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) will immediately label you “antisemitic.” It is well established that the ADL is a front organization for the banking establishment, some of which is “Jewish,” but certainly not exclusively so. They are also a front for Israel's Mossad and their intelligence operations in the United States. 15 So what is “Jewish” anyway. I doubt the Jews could agree as to what being a Jew really is, as there are so many classes and blends as well. So where's the logic in accusing someone opposed to the legalized theft of the international bankers, as being anti-semitic, unless perhaps the ADL has some political interest in preserving the economic status quo, Jewish or not. The ADL is the source of much misinformation about patriot groups, especially those deemed “anti-semitic.” True, there are some people who are anti-semitic, but they are such a small percentage of the population. - 68 -"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Disinformation Agents & Hate Groups It is in the best interest of the ADL to promote anti-semitism to justify their continued existence and fund-raising efforts. Most accusations about anti-semitism are pure and simple hoaxes for political and economic gain and have no basis in reality. I have been accused by these same sources of being anti-semitic, yet there is not one anti-Jewish word in any of my books, publications and lectures. It was all hearsay from ignorant people who didn't even look at the materials. I don't have one racist bone in my body either. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) maintains a “black list” of all Americans who are purportedly in “militia” groups. The number is astronomical considering how vague the definition of militia is. Today, anyone who disagrees with the political aims and objectives of the ruling New World Order (which is truly fascist and totalitarian in both tone and style) is deemed an anti-government extremist. 16 SPLC is a private organization under the leadership of Morris Dees with a reserve fund of $60,000,000. Dees is a purported authority on the subject of “hate crimes” and terrorism. He is hired to instruct local law enforcement officials and the FBI about the dangers of “militia” and anti- government groups. In examining their research, any objective observer would conclude that it is total hysterical, propagandist trash. Yet most Americans never examine anybody's research. They just believe what the television tells them and do as they are told. If the media says militias are anti-government, the public will believe them. If I'm painted “anti-semitic” the majority of people will believe the accusation without any evidence to support it. You are convicted in the media as soon as you are indicted. There is no trial, no evidence, no innocent until proven guilty. You are convicted in the eyes of public opinion. There is not an ounce of honest investigation in any of their work. Yet, local law enforcement and the media rely upon SPLC for the targeted “dangerous” organizations. Militia is a media buzzword and catchphrase created after the Oklahoma City bombing and it includes any private Citizen with a firearm. There are 260,000,000 weapons in America. That's a pretty big group isn't it. Why is it important to blast the militias in the media and blame them, if not accuse them, for all sorts of atrocities. Don't we have enough scapegoats in America? It's important because it's essential that the American people submit to “gun control” just like the Jews did in Nazi Germany. There are preparations in the court of public opinion to permit atrocities like Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the door-to- door confiscation of guns. There are foreign troops on American soil practicing in major cities to take a neighborhood by storm troopers and get the guns. Any dictator knows they must disarm the people before an Auschwitz can happen with any ease. If you can blame the militias for the violence, and the stupidity of the American people permit it in broad daylight, then you can round up the troublemakers — those damned constitutionalists, sovereigns, freemen and libertarians, Jews, blacks or whomever we deem an enemy (thanks to our black list-maintaining friends), and put them in concentration camps. Doesn't this sound pitifully familiar? So-called “news” articles are circulated on a regular basis in all the corporate-controlled newspapers around the country from supposedly credible sources. They are trash journalism from biased propagandists who have no intention of doing any honest research or telling the truth. In all of these articles the same sources are quoted: Anti- Defamation League, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Northwest Center for Malicious Harassment. These are the self-appointed guardians of the public morality who have defined “hate crimes,” “anti-semitism” and “racism” to their political advantage. I am boiled about the stupidity of the American people, and for those who could prevent another holocaust sitting idly by while others are persecuted for their beliefs. There is a Holocaust Museum in the District of Columbia so we can learn from history, not repeat it. So why cannot ordinarily intelligent people see the writing on the wall? America is rising as a fascist dictatorship, as the world's policeman for “democracy,” in every conceivable way except it doesn't have the appearance of one (thanks to television). President Clinton is the perfect, smiling fascist with a great screen presence on television. He can lie to you at forty- miles per hour and most people still believe it. He’s that good! He’s the new-style, “new age” Hitler, a fashionable and likeable dictator. You may not like the white supremacists or the racists, but they have a right to their opinion, just as you or I do. Truth is, they're not as bad as people make them out to be. I may not personally agree with them, but I insist they have the right to believe the crap that comes out of their mouth. No one talks about black supremacists, or Israeli supremacists or Palestinian supremacists. There are lots of cultures who believe in racial purity, or the preservation of their race or culture. It's not all such a bad thing. Look at the Japanese. Are the Japanese supremacists because they don't want to intermarry? We're so conditioned to bashing the whites, especially white men in America for causing all the problems, now they're the new scapegoats instead of the “Jews and niggers.” Editor’s Note: This is obviously for emphasis. You are assumed to be a racist because you're white. That sounds awful racist to me. I say, it’s time for the human race to grow up and stop this silly nonsense. Stop judging another through the window of your own victim mentality. Take responsibility for creating your own reality. They may not come for the Jews first this time, maybe it'll be the American patriots, but when? Where will you stand? - 69 -"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Crime Control and Domestic Terrorism The Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993 (HR 3355) is the “superhighway to fascism.” This bill abolishes the Bill of Rights, abrogates due process, and cancels any pretense of checks and balances against the abuse of government police powers. It will have little impact on street-level crime. This law is only the most recent of a series of statutes passed over the last 12 years that curtail even the most rudimentary of constitutional and civil rights. 17 Any individual or organization in the United States who had or should have had knowledge that an associate might commit a terrorist act can have their property seized. Politically active organizations are especially vulnerable to the Crime Control Act of 1993 & the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. Forfeiture provisions are written like the RICO laws. Broadly written intent to commit terrorist acts is worded as “appear to be intended.” Any attempt to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion would be interpreted as a terrorist act. If a defendant seeks to discover evidence against him/her, the attorney for the government may object on the grounds of national security. Discovery of witnesses, evidence and due process have been eliminated. Illegal search and seizure is redefined while eliminating an innocent citizen’s redress in suits against the government officials and agents. Sentencing guidelines have been increased for terrorist crimes. The proposed HR-666 will change the rules on admitting evidence that is illegally obtained. 18 Informants are afforded special breaks for testifying against an accused party, who will often testify falsely to mitigate their own arrest. The government will have no difficulty creating informants to cause the incarceration of any citizen considered a threat to ones political agenda. Informants and law enforcement agencies addressing the prevention of terrorist acts are funded by the forfeiture and fines collected from alleged terrorists. Will sovereign “state” Citizens exercising their constitutional right to free speech, press and association be targeted by these agencies who know their jobs depend upon property seizures, fines, and arrests? Remember, Americans Nationals OR sovereign “state” Citizens are “foreign” to the federal United States. • E.O.—12949 “( February 13, 1995) authorizes the Attorney General to approve physical searches without a court order to acquire “foreign” intelligence information. Since the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno and the media spin doctors have now slandered and libeled sovereign “state” Citizens, constitutionalists, patriots, tax-protesters, or anyone who disagrees with the government as a “domestic or paper terrorist.” Newt Gingrich has been quoted from the floor of Congress as saying: “We’re going to nip those sovereignty people in the bud.” We the People are being labeled by the spin-doctors as extreme right-wing paramilitary organizations, white supremacists or terrorists. Granted, there are some elements of these in the sovereignty movement, but I assert it’s less than 5% of the prevailing thinking. To the unthinking, indiscriminate public, an accusation or indictment equals a conviction. Most people do not and will not think for themselves, or even confirm information before drawing conclusions. Instead of thinking, We the People react to stimulus-response. The desperate need for a scapegoat for the inner rage, anger and frustration is so strong that the indiscriminate mind doesn’t really care who committed the crime, so long as somebody gets punished. Our prisons are full of innocent victims of this mentality, this sickness that pervades our society and nation. This is a sad state of affairs in the united states of America today. The Antiterrorism Act of 1996 will give a new charter to the FBI and other agencies, including the military, to investigate political groups and causes at will. The bill criminalizes acts of violence, which are already illegal, as well as the giving of funds for humanitarian and legal activities. Any organization the President declares to be “terrorist,” regardless of any legitimate activity they might pursue, could result in ten- year sentences and/or deportation for citizens supporting these organizations. Due process would be eliminated by permitting the use of secret evidence never shown to the defendant or his/her lawyer. 19 Legislative History of the Clinton administration The administration of President Bill Clinton has waged a persistent attack against individual liberties, the Constitu - tion and the Bill of Rights in the name of reinventing bigger (i.e., global) and more efficient (i.e., tyrannical) government. This has resulted in more federal and international control over state's rights, local initiatives and every aspect of the constitutionally-protected sovereign rights of the American Citizen. In the wake of Waco, Ruby Ridge, the Oklahoma City bomb - ing and numerous other domestic incursions, many of which could have been staged by agents within the government it - self, an “antiterrorist” bill has been passed, additional feder - al and local law enforcement has been funded to the tune of $1,000,000,000, airport security has been tightened to the point of the absurd, privacy and first amendment rights have been increasingly attacked, censorship is on the rise, a na - tional I.D. card institutionalized, welfare privatized, prisoner rights curtailed, and prisons have been constructed at an alarming rate while social programs have had to bite the budget-cutting bullet. The NSA is persistent in its efforts at cyber-spying, tightening its grip on the free expression of the Internet despite huge opposition.

Netscape Corporation, which virtually dominates the market for Web browsers with an 80 percent market share, recently contracted with NSA to produce browsers and servers compatible with the Fortezza Card. 20 Joshua M.K Masur writes, “Consider how nicely Congress' net-wide censorship plan can be enforced with our nation's shiny new half-billion dollar national wiretap system, for simultaneously wiretapping as many as 1 call per 100 from anywhere.” The Federal Register contained a lengthy, detailed “notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates the government agencies authorized to conduct electronic sur- veillance may conduct and use simultaneously by 11/98.” 21 FBI Director, Louis Freeh reveals that “Each telecommu- nications carrier must ensure that it can expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capability requirements [for] interceptions equal to 1% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities or services that provide a [wired or wireless telecommunications] customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.” Although privacy & civil liberties advocates successfully stripped a requirement for a new national ID database from the recent Immigration bill, something just as bad was embraced by America's political whores when inserted in the new Welfare “reform” bill. New block grants to the states for welfare and the new people-tracking national ID systems they entail will be administered by private corporations. They'll make the decisions regarding eligibility, services, and payments-who eats and who starves. Welfare has been privatized! Is this a great country or what? Top private-sector welfare contractors include Lockheed, IBM, and EDS. Analysts are already speculating whether these corporations could boost profits by laying off their employees, then administering welfare to them. The military-industrial complex so prevalent during the Cold War and Vietnam years has transformed into the prison-industrial-police-attorney complex re-sharpening its focus from a war against the Soviets to a war against the individual liberties of the American people. The Pentagon is involved in electromagnetic warfare and mind control experiments on civilian populations. Biochip implants are being prepared for human subjects with the capability of tracking through the satellite-based Global Positioning System. The Law Enforcement Satellite System (LESS) is being developed to cut the communications costs incurred by law enforcement agencies around the nation which currently maintain separate systems. An entirely new unified police communications infra- structure will directly link all agencies and their units to the National Crime Information Center which combines all law enforcement data from various agencies. 22 \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.\" -Robert F. Kennedy (U.S. Senator, 1967) Terrorism helps government by encouraging it to expand. If the terrorism escalates in spite of tougher rules, then government power mushrooms some more. Editor’s Note: Whoops, I'd better bite my tongue! Under new anti-terrorist legislation the above article could be construed as a veiled threat, anti-government sentiment, even paper terrorism. The publisher could be blacklisted as a terrorist organization and have it's office raided and property seized. I could be disappeared from my family and friends without due process, a formal accusation or a trial by jury. You say, it couldn't happen in America. Look at the writing on the wall! It used to be an American pastime to criticize the government, to organize rallies in opposition to government corruption, to lobby against draconian legislation. Today, it's a dangerous proposition regardless of which side of the political spectrum you may stand. Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996 The Anti-Terrorism And Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104132 on April 24th, 1996 (S.735 introduced by Sen. Dole) was passed despite opposition by a wide mixture of strange bedfellows across the political spectrum. It has wide-reaching consequences that ought to chill the spine of every decent American born into the luxury of freedom in this increasingly un-free New World Order. • Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 • Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 • Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996 The Congress has declared that dangers posed by international terrorism far outweigh any posed by overpopulation or pollution. Despite opposition by a mixture of strange bedfellows the Act became Public Law 104-132 on April 24th, punctuated by the one-year commemoration of the Oklahoma City bombing. The Washington Post noted that most members of Congress opposing the bill were either Democratic liberals or Republican conservatives. Organizations such as Gun Owners of America (GOA) teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Bar Association (ABA) and the National Black Police Association (NBPA) to fight the proposed law. They found themselves going head to head with an equally strange group of cohorts lobbying in favor of the legisla-tion, such as; The Christian Coalition, the Anti-Defa-mation League and the National Rifle Association (NRA). The literature is replete with warnings about this Acts affronts to citizens’ liberties, but President Clinton bemoaned the fact that the most important parts of the bill had been “left on the cutting room floor,” such as the section that would have made it easier for authorities to wiretap all phones used by suspected terrorists. - 71 -"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook FBI Director Louis Freeh says he is particularly “chilled” by wording that establishes a five member commission to study activities of federal law enforcement agencies. His concern is dwarfed by the apprehension of freedom- loving people that the police state in America has just taken a giant step. Vaguely defined concepts that are likely to result in tough prosecution for those intent on exercising liberties asserted in the Bill of Rights are also of interest. For example, can the unspecified “explosive materials” in section 706 be understood as ammunition, and will gun dealers thereby be punished for selling ammo to those who commit a crime with it if the state believes the dealer had foreknowledge? What will be the determining factors in establishing a “reasonable cause to believe?” Moreover, what exactly does to “obstruct, delay, or affect interstate or foreign commerce” mean (Section 702)? In 1942, the U.S.Supreme Court held that a farmer was negatively affecting interstate commerce when he ate his own crops because that negated the need for him to buy his necessities in the open market. 23 Also in Section 702, anyone involved in “conduct transce- nding national boundaries” and in a “circumstance” that in - cludes use of any facility of interstate commerce or involves any type of property owned, leased or possessed by the Unit - ed States shall invoke the act's jurisdiction if they: A) Kill, kidnap, maim, commit an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, or assaults with a dangerous weapon any person within the United States, or B) Create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person by destroying or damaging any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States or by conspiring to do the same. Threats to do so shall be punished by prison terms up to 10 years. Just a couple of years ago, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt threatened to blow up Northwest dams to save the salmon. Now anyone who makes a comment like that can be thrown in the poky for 10 years. What exactly is “conduct transcending national boun- daries?” The term is defined as conduct “occurring outside the United States... (and) inside the United States.” Does that mean “a Bernie Goetz who uses, say, an Italian- made Beretta to defend himself and then affects interstate commerce in the slightest way would trigger federal invol- vement and a BATF investigation...(and) be subject to a 30- year sentence for an ‘assault with a dangerous weapon.’” US Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, who voted against the law and lobbied hard to protect Constitutional habeas corpus provisions said, “Proponents mean no harm to the basic rights that Americans enjoy.” If that is true, a rabbit is guarding the hen house. If, on the other hand, the Terror Law is a Trojan Horse moved in under the guise of protecting us, then a cougar is guarding the hen house, and everyone must now be unrelentingly vigilant. 24 Some of the features of this law are: 1) Establishes a five-member commission to study activities of federal law enforcement agencies. 2) Removal of protections on interception of wireless messages. 3) Increased scope of BATF. 4) Prohibitions on providing material support of any kind to organizations the Attorney General or Secretary of State have deemed as international terrorist organizations. 5) Freezing of domestic groups bank accounts (with no measures for appeal) if the government believes they are agents for foreign terrorists. 6) Exception to rules of discovery in civil proceedings when the government claims classified materials are involved. 7) Habeas corpus reform will curtail the ability to appeal previous court decisions where evidence was destroyed or suppressed by prosecutors (like in Waco and Oklahoma City). 8) Authorizes antiterrorism training programs. “ We should not forget that our tradition is one of protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the rebels of the past while we silence the rebels of the present.” -Henry Steele Commager Government Protecting the People? The bombing of TWA flight 800 and the pipe bomb in Olympic Park inspired the federal government to protect us even more than they already have been. The two blasts created the impetus Congress and the President needed to overcome any significant public resistance to draconian anti-terrorism laws that have been hovering around the 104th Congressional session. Once again, the public is ready to welcome more policing in order to feel safer. Newspapers around the country reported that “travelers at airports don't mind putting up with any inconveniences encountered — as long as they can just feel safer.” One poll at a Miami radio station found that “90 percent of the listeners approved of the new steps, even if they meant extra delays and even higher ticket prices.” They didn't say anything about added incursions into their privacy or dignity. The line between freedom of movement and safety searches is getting narrower all the time. “We’re going to have to do some things that some people, who might be called liberta- rians, would not like. But nonetheless we're protecting the people and that's the job of government,” commented former Treasury Secretary William Simon after the bomb blast in Atlanta. He suggests “most people want more oppressive government since these crises have occurred-- and if the radio poll is any indication — he's right.” Terrorists are generally thought of as enemies of the state, but their relationship to government is actually more symbiotic than antagonistic. “Terrorism helps government by encouraging it to expand. If the terrorism escalates in spite of tougher rules, then government power mushrooms some more. - 72 -"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Government Protecting the People? This dynamic continues to build until free institutions are completely subverted and a new political order is created,” says William Norman Grigg, writing for The New American. 26 This observation is nothing new to terrorists on either extreme of the political scale. William Pierce, founder of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, and author of The Turner Diaries (pseudonym Andrew McDonald) observed, “ More and more, the government will lash out at dissidents, at anyone who is not politically correct. And the two sides will feed on each other. The more repressive and terrorist the government becomes, the more individuals there will be who will engage in terrorism to get back at the government. And the more individual terrorism there is against the government, the more terrorist the government will become in turn.” This world-view is remarkably similar to that of Brazilian Marxist Carlos Marighella. In his book, Mini-Manual for Urban Guerrillas, he explains that terrorists attack innocent people and subvert public order in order to provoke governments to intensify repression. “ The police roundups, house searches, arrests of innocent people, make life unbearable... Rejecting the so-called political solution, the urban guerrilla must become more aggressive and violent, resorting without letup to sabotage, terrorism, expropriations, assaults, kidnapping and executions, heightening the disastrous situation in which the government must act...” Another striking similarity between leftist and rightist terrorists is their method of organizing into anonymous, leaderless cells (i.e. like the militias). The concept was made popular on the extreme right by former KKK Grand Dragon Louis Beam. Radical Marxists like Carlos Marighella developed the strategy in the 1960s. “ Is this a case of ‘extreme right’ mimicking successful initiatives of the ‘extreme left,’ or is there perhaps a deeper affinity involving conscious deception and agents provocateur?” William Grigg asks. He points out several interesting communist-KKK connections. In 1922, police in Bridgman, Michigan raided a Communist Party cell. Documents seized there revealed that a cell member had been running a Klan organization under communist direction for several years. In 1947 Sam Bowers, who would later become the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was a communist as a student at the University of Southern California. Around that time, Jewish fraternity houses at USC were the scenes of crossburnings, and other vandalism and defacement. The police were unable to uncover any Klan activity in the area. They finally traced the actions to the American Youth for Democracy which later became the Young Communist League. In the 1960s, after he had achieved Wizard status, Bowers still kept his living room adorned with portraits of Marx and Lenin. In 1964 Bowers held a strategy meeting outlining a plan of which the White Knights were just a part. He said he was trying to create a race war with the hopes that troops would be sent into Mississippi to restore order. There were probably people who wanted them to come, so they'd feel safer. Bowers predicted martial law would be declared and the state would be under dictatorial control from Washington. The radical left was busy then too. A militant civil rights group called the Freedom Democratic Party was fomenting hatred among inner city blacks. FDP glorified red urban revolutionaries abroad and taught autonomous cell resistance. Civil rights organizer Michael Schwerner, who was slain around that time, had predicted the same governmental escalation and results as Bowers. Socialists, Communists and Fascists want government control of every facet of people's lives and terrorist acts lead to more government. Since the United States government is infested with Socialists and bureaucracies are parasitic in nature, it is not remiss to speculate that the escalating acts of terrorism, like acts of racism, are being orchestrated from headquarters for the desired aim of complete martial law. After all, governments are all about control -- and anyway, wouldn't everything be safer if armed troops were always right outside protecting us? 25 - 73 -"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources TERRORISM 1.

Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak out for me.” —Pastor Martin Niemoeller 1 So what does the power structure have in mind for us and who are “they” anyway? Is this just some horseshit “conspiracy theory?” The present objectives are simple. Get the world population to agree to a one-world government, world central bank and currency, world army and a microchip population linked to a central computer. We are already a one-party, one-world State with different storefronts posing as separate and distinct nations. There is one policy and the same cast of string pullers orchestrating world events. Most people believe that the head of State (e.g., Bill Clinton) is the pinnacle of the power structure and the buck stops there. It doesn't even come close. Presidents and Prime Ministers, Congressmen and Senators are puppets nothing more. There is an extensive secret and emerging powerful world government above them pulling their strings. Politicians have big egos and they project an image as if they are the final arbitrators of power. Most people believe this despite that it simply ain't so. Have you ever asked who creates a President? Who decides their running mates on both parties? Isn't it suspicious that regardless of whether or not Democrats or Republicans get elected, everything still gets worse? These divisions are arbitrary and have nothing whatsoever to do with real power in the real world. Ideology is an illusion fostered to keep the people divided — arguing over non-issues, which they have absolutely no power to do anything about (at least in the present herd mentality). The Left and Right are a big joke. With Hitler cast on the far Right and Stalin cast on the Far Left — both advocate centralized control, concentration camps and slavery for their people. Isn't it great to have choice? Elections are decided long before any vote is cast. If you still believe in “democracy” as the peoples’ government, I'd suggest looking again. Your vote makes no political difference whatsoever. Democracy is not “freedom” even though they are treated as synonymous terms. Fifty people telling the other forty-nine what to do is not freedom. Majority rule is tyranny for the minority! The last five Secretary Generals of NATO were Bilderberg appointees. World Bank appointees are Bilderberg appointees. The European Union, endorsed by Chancellor Kohl of Germany, is a Bilderberg Group creation. Every recent President of the United States including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton were members of the Trilateral Commission and/or Council of Foreign Relations. So were many of their opponents in the elections. So regardless of who won, the same people behind the scenes retain power. Look at current events with a more scrutinizing eye. Do not ever believe the mainstream or alternative media storyline. Both are contrived action and reaction. Today, all media is propaganda, mass manipulation and government-supplied information. Look at who owns the media, what clubs they belong to (e.g., Bilderbergs, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations) and how are they benefiting from keeping the truth from the people. It’s more of a collective mindset and attitude of superiority than a loathing “conspiracy.” Treat it as such. Question every motive from the power structures perspective and every conclusion arrived at. Watch who is blamed and ask who is benefiting from the sheeple believing the storyline. Do your own independent research and cross-check your sources. Have direct experience of the people or groups blamed and get some inside information. If you do so with an open mind, you'll arrive at very different conclusions. Ask yourself who is benefiting from the action? Who benefited from the assassinations of JFK, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and John Lennon? Who benefited from the war in Bosnia? Except for rare, random cases of violence without a purpose or cause, most events are conspiratorial and orchestrated carefully. Nothing in politics happens by accident. You'd better start believing that. Who benefited from the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City? As a result of the bombing, anti-terrorist legislation sailed through Congress further curtailing the civil liberties of 260 million law-abiding citizens for the insane acts of a few people. [See also Terrorism.] Today, there is more centralized police power in the hands of the federal government with an easing on the restrictions regarding the involvement of the military in civilian affairs. Records regarding the BATF involvement in Waco were destroyed in the building so no further investigation of the agency could ensue. People were whipped up into a frenzy and scared of the rise of militia activity in the United States. The militias and constitutionalists were blamed for the bombing despite any evidence. The impression was still left in the public mind and most people discounted their activities as irrelevant “right-wing extremists.” - 77 -"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook So instead of looking at the issues being raised by the patriots in America regarding the erosion of the constitution and the protection of our precious freedoms, most people discounted the patriots as fanatical murderers. Thus the herd mentality could go about their business in the hassle-free zone without daring to look at reality outside the comfort zone. The status quo benefited from this bombing. Do you think perhaps they had some small involvement in orchestrating it? Look at the evidence. Then look at the evidence that was either destroyed or suppressed. Make up your own mind about it. Today, great power is being unveiled for all to see. We do not have to hate these power mongers, for they are doing what they believe is best for the sheeple. They have given us a gift in seeing ourselves, what we stand for and how we fall. The power structure today is a massive statement about us and our own lack of power and responsibility. I do not or will not speak with hate or condemnation about anyone. I do not advocate “an eye for an eye” for then everyone is blind. – Gandhi I do not advocate the use of violence for any reason or cause, but firm nonviolent, non-cooperation with such a system. Look at our possibility. We could be soon evolving and migrating from a prison to a paradise. If indeed we create our own reality. Let's do a better job at it. Let's make it a powerful one. War Against the American Sovereign Many Americans are awakening to the blatant corruption and abuses of our own federal United States government, which is presently occupying and controlling the free and independent states of the united states of America on behalf of foreign powers. Similar occupations are occurring in countries around the world. America may be the last bastion of freedom consciousness arising in the world today. More Americans are afraid of their own government than so-called “terrorists,” and are unwilling to give up more of their civil liberties to fight them. When a D.C. Research group asked Americans, “ In general, do you have more confidence in local, state or federal government?” Almost one in five Americans, black or white, volunteered that they had no confidence in the government at any level. 2 Due to a strategy and design that’s older than the republic, American Nationals AND sovereign “state” Citizens, and the free and independent sovereign states of the republic began losing their sovereignty after the Civil War. This has continued unabated until the present. The united states of America is at the frontline of the New World Order’s assault upon the sovereignty of ALL the nations and peoples of the world, because We the People have set a historical precedent and model for individual sovereignty that stands in the way of the present international structure. To achieve a de facto world government without the consent or input of the people requires obliterating the concept of sovereignty. Without destroying sovereignty and the innate free will of the human being, the New World Order cannot and will not succeed. Although, mind control and propaganda systems abound in this Communications Age, the root desire for freedom and consciousness is alive and well. Our perceptions may have been altered, indeed changed for awhile, but the truth shall set up free! Restore your ability to see clearly the truth and the light of day!!! “ [The New World Order] cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions.” —Henry Kissinger The federal United States government, and the foreign powers presently directing it, have waged a 130 year assault upon the Constitution and the republican form of government created here over 220 years ago. The federal United states government has neither acknowledged nor apologized for its continued assault and war upon its own American sovereign Citizen. Our national government formally declared war on the American people in 1933 by amending the Trading With the Enemies Act (1917) to include all American sovereign Citizens and suspending the Constitution through the Emergency & War Powers Acts. That war has continued to this very day. 4 [See also Restoring a Republic.] We the People can still re-consummate a de jure govern - ment by returning to the organic law that preceded the cre - ation of the federal government and rebuilding the founda - tion for a renewed republican form of government for the all the people regardless of race, creed, class, sex or color. The Constitution of the United States, not the organic law that preceded it, has been suspended and suppressed, not destroyed. The united states of America merely needs to be re-inhabited by American National OR sovereign “state” Citizens to restore constitutional government. This is NOT a matter of majority rule, but an individual issue of choice. Will you reclaim it or not? The choice is yours to decide whether or not you’ll walk the path of sovereignty in this life. Presently, the American sovereign “state” Citizen is in exile, without a homeland, until constitutional government is restored in the united states of America. - 78 -"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Chapter Six War Against the American Sovereign The principles of self-government continue to exist in the organic law, the public laws, statutes and case laws of over 220 years of American law. But it requires an American sovereign to re-inhabit the system once reconstituted. Without American sovereigns formally declaring and re- inhabiting a republican form of government, there can be no sovereign states, counties, townships, constitutional Common law courts or grand juries. The republican form of government must be reconstituted from the bottom-up, not from the top-down. Will you throw off the chains of democracy and tyranny? Will you throw off the New World Order and establish a “True” World Order? It’s all around you! Listen to the Drumbeat of Tyranny When are We the People going to finally awaken to the political and economic realities in America — that the federal United States government is corrupt and must be transformed or abolished? Government has become nothing more than a vast international network of “organized crime.” We are in a constant state of war. The economic system is collapsing on more and more people every day. An apathetic, illiterate and ignorant Citizenry marches to the drumbeat of tyranny. Will we make the same mistake every other empire in history has made? Is this the last hoorah for the American empire? This is a critical juncture in both American and world history. Are we going to stay asleep until after the New World Order has superceded all our constitutional laws and imposed it’s own totalitarian version of a replacement “constitution?” How long can you tread water? How long will it be until the United States government comes after you to collect on your promise to pay the federal debt? Have We the People enough courage in the home of the brave and of the land of the free to finally face the truth? The joke is — you're not paranoid if they REALLY are out to get you! Must We the People forever be reminded of how tyrannies arise? We give our power away desperately like children wanting to be taken care of. When a people go to sleep for generations and do not apply the checks and balances necessary to maintain liberty and justice for all, then governments take and abuse their power over the people. The United States government is presently such a government. Stop apologizing for tyranny. Stop relying on government to take care of you. Stop supporting the dangerous polarization of America by jumping on the bandwagon and attacking your fellow Citizens who are being victimized by such a government. Someday it may be your turn to be under attack. Who will stand for you? Who will prevent another Holocaust from happening in these united states of America? Your fellow Citizens and neighbors are under attacked daily by our own government, by countless unjust and unconsti - tutional laws. Prosecutors, attorneys, police, prisons, and even our own military are planning attacks against us. There are concentration camps built to house what remains of the free people of America. We the People are attacked daily by the media and other government apologists who are blindfolded into a position that supports tyranny and oppression. Are we so ignorant and vested in the lie that good people rally behind tyranny under the guise of democracy and don't even realize it? Property is being seized, extorted, and outright stolen by the courts, forfeiture laws, judges, attorneys, and the IRS. Due process of law is virtually gone in these kangaroo courts. We the People have no rights, no constitutional guidelines, not even consistent rules and procedures left to prevent the abuse of government power. The halls of Congress and the courts are totally corrupt. Criminal activity is routine in the halls of government and those whistleblowers who attempt to report those crimes are fired, marginalized, discredited and victimized. Our elected officials operate under so-called sovereign immunity and are protected from prosecution and imprisonment even if indicted and convicted. There are two standards of justice. Both of our recent Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton are immoral criminals of the highest order as are many other top government officials who are operating solely on behalf of the creditors of the federal United States. Some levels of government, and those who pull the strings of government, are involved in sponsoring terrorist events so as to implement more stringent controls and install a police state. Problem — Reaction — Result Ultimately, the truth shall prevail and those responsible brought to justice. Democracy = Dictatorship = Communism Fellow Citizens and neighbors concerned with the plight of America are being prosecuted, harassed, indicted and labeled “domestic or paper terrorists” by the same officials who lie, steal and kill daily on behalf of a government gone mad. These people are called “patriots” because they love their country and the principles upon which it was founded. A government that has no conscience about killing innocent men, women and children under the ruse of protection, whether at Waco, Ruby Ridge, Okla - homa City, or in Iraq, is not a government worth your allegiance or hard-earned tax dollars.

Police State Actions Our life, liberty and unalienable rights as American National OR sovereign “state” Citizens are being invaded, assaulted, and violated daily by both the willing and the unconscious agents of the sovereign Power Structure, and the foreign creditors/principals who control the federal United States government. Thousands of new statutes are passed each year while those elected to uphold and defend the Constitution routinely vio - late the law of the land. This is paramount to treason. These multifarious statutes have made “criminals” of virtually every American, for some reason or other, while increasing numbers of the American people are suffering from unemployment, hunger, sickness, homelessness, imprisonment, and bankruptcy. The hidden agenda of the sovereign Power structure is to destroy the united states of America, and to control every facet of our lives. Through statutes and administrative rules and regulations, the federal United States government is routinely violating your right to privacy, right to contract, right to travel, right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Adolf Hitler took control of Germany by instituting statutes, and administra - tive regulations, This is not some novel intellectual idea of a fanatic cult or lunatic fringe, nor the raving and ranting of a madman, but the long-needed wake up call for all America and the world. There won’t be any sanity until We the People get government back under the political control of the people. The greatest “lies of our times” are delivered wholesale through the mainstream media. Truth is indeed an endangered species, as we plunder the earth to our own self- annihilation. Have the American people become lemmings marching blindly, instinctually to the apocalypse? Here comes a smiling government bureaucrat, “Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help you.” They offer fraud, theft, lies, and 100,000 more police officers on the street to fight the illusive and useless “wars on crime and drugs.” Perhaps, the war is against the people and always has been. If you think your constitutional, sovereign or civil rights are worth squat as a U.S. citizen, subject to all these statutory intrusions and violations of basic civil and human rights, think again. Given the political, economic and environmental climate of our times, reclaiming your sovereign citizenship, restoring our Constitution and Bill of Rights may be our best option for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the next millennium. Why hesitate? What have you got to lose except your chains? \"The Truth is in lock-down. Unleash the Truth, it will set you free.\" —Johnny Liberty One hundred heavily armed BATF agents invaded the residence of a religious group in Waco, Texas. Upon hearing the shouting hoard of heavily armed para- military group descending upon them, they locked the doors and braced for an attack. BATF agents broke windows and shot into the residence killing eight people inside. As agents started entering the building, the people defended their home by fighting back killing four of the assaulting BATF agents. If the besieged residents had any hope that public pressure would bring a halt to the siege, they were sadly mistaken. The government’s disinformation campaign and rapid manipulation of the media sought to make the besieged victims the culprits. The Waco tragedy had the potential for waking up the American people. Bill Clinton appeared on television and stated that the residents had committed suicide and were to blame for the horrible outcome. 5 Five hundred heavily armed ATF and FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, local law enforcement, military vehicles and tanks surrounded a small home owned by Randy Weaver, killed his son and wife, then had the audacity to charge his entire family with conspiracy (September 16, 1992).

Kennedy, to eliminate the American armed forces and to use foreign troops to police the united states of America. This has almost been achieved through the transfer of sovereignty of the federal United States to the foreign creditors/principles, and the command of our armed forces to the United Nations. Former President Bush also transferred the command of the American military forces to the United Nations under their direction and control. 10 Former President Carter authorized the creation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by Executive Order #12148. He also deputized all military forces as U.S. Marshals. Three U.S. supreme Court Justices (Stevens, Brennan and Marshall) affirmed in the Bail Reform Act of 1984 that we are living in a police state. The sovereign Power structure is not hesitating to use their “police powers” to enforce their plan for a New World Order. Because of Bosnia, the largest multinational world army since World War II with 60,000 troops has assembled in Europe. There are presently 53 different federal police organizations with 79,000 troops in the United States including the FBI, BATF and U.S. Marshals which are presently under the authority of the United Nations. There are thousands of national police forces organizing domestically under the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force (MJTF). The MJTF is the velvet glove on the iron fist, comprised of not only military and law enforcement personnel, but also punks from street gangs. Another job program from the government. MJTF’s avowed purpose is to do house-to-house search and seizure operations to seize weapons, firearms, food reserves and people. FINCEN are foreign military and secret police brought into the United States for deployment against U.S. citizens under the authority of Executive Order of the President, Interpol, and the United Nations. HR 97 seeks to create a “rapid strike force” that would empower the Attorney General to establish an FBI unit to assist in the combating of crime. 11 United Nations troops are also being trained and harbored in old military bases in the united states of America for future actions against the people of the united states of America, or elsewhere in the world. Since November 11, 1990, they’ve been performing joint military exercises with United States troops on military bases around the country, and on Forest Service land in Idaho and Montana. Other United Nations battle groups are in Ft. Drum (New York), Ft. Dix (New Jersey), North Carolina next to Virginia, Texas panhandle near Oklahoma, south of Los Angeles. They are supplied by United Nations Naval forces through - out Michigan, Montana and Sacramento (California). It’s es - timated there could be as many as 500,000 United Nations troops presently training on American soil. 12 Along with the National Guard and the U.S. Military, you’d think this would be enough firepower to wage a war against a mostly sleepwalking people. The perception is that the domestic troops would not be reliable enough to enforce these new laws against their neighbors, friends and families. Soldiers from other countries under the flag of the United Nations would not be so compassionate in dealing with Americans, thus are more reliable. There are many patriotic United States military forces including the Officer Corp that will resist the takeover of our nation (e.g., Delta Force). 13 There have been rumors of black military helicopters being sited all over the united states of America, many in association with DEA operations, but also engaged in the surveillance of civilians. - 81 -"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook There are unconfirmed reports of Russian military equipment being unloaded at the docks, and imported from points in Mexico.

Now 10,000 to 12,000 are dead,” says Joyce Riley, an RN who was afflicted with the Gulf War Illness and survived to lead the campaign to help the sick and dying vets who are being shunned by the Veterans Administration and The Department of Defense. One of her few allies in Congress, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs, released a report in September 1993 suggesting the troops may have been exposed to chemical and biological warfare agents. Concerned for the health of the vets and their families, who were also becoming sick, he held a Senate hearing on February 9, 1994 which revealed Gulf War troops were subjected to experimental vaccinations, irradiated foods, radioactive munitions and a toxic soup of substances released by the bombings. His committee requested records from the Department of Commerce that show the US government approved the sale of biological materials to the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission, the Iraq Ministry of Higher Education, the State Company for Drug Industries and the Ministry of Trade before the war. A 1992 Department of Defense report called Conduct of the Persian Gulf War says: “(Iraq's) advanced and aggressive biological warfare program was the most advanced in the Arab world...(The) program... concentrated on the development of two agents, botulinum toxin and anthrax bacteria...Delivery means for biological agents ranged from simple aerial bombs and artillery rockets to surface-to- surface missiles.” Nurse Riley says 20 different biologicals were loaded into the warheads along with cyanide which was used to make the gas mask filters ineffective. “When our patriot missiles knocked the SCUDS out at 200 feet over the heads of the American troops, they were rained on with biologicals.” The following biological materials, all of which have potential weapons applications, were sold to the Iraqis by American companies: Bacillus Anthracis, Clostridium Botulinu,Histoplasma Capsalatum, Bruccella Melitensis, and Clostridium Perfringens. Also, orders for E. Coli, genetic materials and human bacterial DNA were shipped directly to the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission. “ The US government and Iraq violated the Geneva Convention of 1972. There are tremendous criminal and political implications in this,” says Ms. Riley. The milieu of symptoms suffered by the Gulf War vets is now spreading to family members and pets, and an inordinate number of their children are born dead or deformed. Nurse Riley says troops returning from other engagements are exhibiting the same symptoms. “Men returning from Somalia are sick, people returning from Bosnia have rashes and a strange viral illness, and troops going to 3 - month rotation in Kuwait from Fort Hood, Texas, are coming back sick with a rash.” And it's not just American troops being affected. She says, “British, French and Canadian troops are dropping like flies.” 14 US Interests Profited From Biological Warfare Ingredients in Gulf War The Department of Defense and the Veterans Administra - tion continue to issue reports saying they can find no single cause of the health problems of Gulf War veterans. Peter Kawaja, a security specialist who provided security to Prod - uct Ingredient Technology (PIT) in Florida and Ishan Bar - bouf International (IBI), says that germ warfare was indeed used in the Gulf War and that the United States sent the sol - diers into the war knowing biologicals would likely be used. In addition, the hydrogen cyanide used to render gas mask filters ineffective was tested at PIT for over a year prior to the Gulf War. In 1989 Kawaja was asked to install a hydrogen cyanide detection system. He became suspicious of the company's motives and reported their activities to the CIA, FBI and Customs. The government told him IBI were “international terrorists” and that the government was going to prosecute them. That didn't happen. In 1990 he sent a secret message to the National Security Agency warning that Iraqi intelligence was operating in the US close to a classified military facility. He had obtained audio and video recordings, fax transmissions and paper documentation of federal agents, politicians and the “terrorists” regarding connections to Commodity Credit Corporation-Banca Nazionale del Lavorro (CCC-BNL). Eight federal agents subsequently burst into his office at the International Security Group (ISG) and confiscated the videos and other documentation without presenting a search warrant. This evidence was subsequently sealed due to National Security purposes. Four years later, Mr. Kawaja had it unsealed. The documents prove government agents knew Barbouti, who had previously built the Pharma-150 Chemical/Biologi - cal Complex at Rabta, Libya, had established a chemical warfare production facility at the PIT plant in Florida. The documents further show the government was familiar with Barbouti's ownership of CROSS LINK in Belgium which is connected to CCC-BNL. Brent Sowcroft of the National Security Council, was a consultant to BNL. The “Counselor” Attorney General Janet Reno appointed to investigate BNL was John Hogan II, an attorney from Miami who represented Ishan Barouf International.

In the forward, Newt Gingrich touted America's ability to successfully cope with low-intensity threats, intimating that electronic weapons are the ideal tools to accomplish that goal. They are used both overtly and subtly. The Pentagon's energy weapons development program includes high power lasers that disorient “the enemy,” strobe lights that nauseate uncooperative crowds and high- powered microwaves that disable electronic components. The Air Force already has a flying transmitter that can intercept radio transmissions (anti-UN propaganda, for example) and replace the content with words more to the controllers’ liking. “Operation Sleeping Beauty” during the Reagan Administration explored ways to disrupt the human nervous system through electro-magnetics. The program sought to manipulate the reason, emotions and physical sensations of subjects and to “unhinge a man's mind.” The practical uses for such capabilities included the quieting of mobs by triggering mass vomiting; electronically disorienting hostage takers' minds and the disabling of terrorists holed up in compounds with explosives. In 1990 DOD said that the Soviets had the ability to produce radio frequency weapons that could disorient people at a distance of a half mile. Apparently the Soviets capacities at mind control are much more sophisticated than that. According to Newsweek, Moscow conferred with the FBI during the WACO debacle about their technique of beaming inaudible transmissions into a subjects brain. The procedure would have caused Koresh to think he was hearing the voice of God in his head. Also during WACO, the Air Force offered the FBI one of its top-secret nonlethal weapons which “would have given [the FBI] the ability to make a surprise attack with a large number of agents.” After WACO, Janet Reno asked the Pentagon and the CIA to join her in further exploration of the use of these “non-lethal technologies” for both military and civilian law enforcement purposes. Even though the new weapons are billed as “non-lethal,” an article written as early as 1980 in Military Review, said “... there are weapons systems that operate on the power of mind whose lethal capacity has already been demonstrated.” An Air Force publication, Defense News projected that it may eventually be possible to locate anyone on the planet and then target them for disruption through thought implantation techniques. Similar technologies have been developed to pump millions of watts of electricity deep into the earth (i.e., Project ELF). 16 War on Drug s - War on Human Rights The “war on drugs” is actually a “war on civil liberties and human rights.” Nine million people have been arrested for possession or sale of marijuana since 1965. The National Drug and Crime Emergency Act (HR 4079), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1988) has thrown many of our statutory civil rights and due process out the window. This “war” has justified all kinds of clearly unconstitutio-nal and unconscionable police activities, including illegal search, seizure and the forfeiture of property without a trial. Don’t forget your 4th, 5th and 6th Amendment rights. Fortunately, the supreme Court recently declared property forfeitures and illegal seizures unconstitutional, again. Still they go on everyday. 17 The supreme Court Justices in 1989 upheld that state and federal agents could confiscate the assets and property of a person possessing drugs, or who committed a crime, even though charges had not been filed, and there had not been a trial. In December 1993, five of the nine held that there must first be a hearing before the property was seized. This is preposterous considering the key role high-level federal officials and the CIA have been playing in the import of massive amounts of drugs over the last thirty years. 18 Disinformation Drives Drug Prohibition “ Since 1988, federal spending on anti drug programs has increased more than 300 percent, yet according to government statistics illicit drug use has remained virtually unchanged among adults and has actually increased among adolescents,” according to Allen St. Pierre, Deputy Director of NORML. Heroine and cocaine are cheaper, purer and more widely available now, especially in prisons — the one place you'd think the government could perfect Prohibition. These observations have led to a growing conviction that drug prohibition, like the failed experiment in alcohol prohibition, is doomed to fail and a new solution to nation's drug problem must be found. Most opponents of drug prohibition agree that the first step toward a solution is to get the federal government out of the picture — for several reasons. First of all, the federal government has too much to gain by being engaged in a drug war. It gains more and more police power, and various enforcement agencies are raking in profits via asset forfeiture laws. Secondly, the government’s suppression of drugs drives the market underground and artificially raises the value because of risks involved in dealing without doing anything (as already noted) about diminishing demand. Third, decisions about drug use should be made and enforced on a local level because the smaller the bureaucracy, the more receptive and innovative it can be.

The billions of dollars the federal government has misapplied in its ineffective drug war are matched by the basic lack of understanding exhibited by the DEA on drug use and abuse. The Partnership for Responsible Drug Information refutes the 22 major claims made in support of drug prohibition. 19 Marijuana Laws Ineffective “ Contrary to popular myths, marijuana smokers are no different from their nonsmoking peers except for their cannabis use,” writes Paul Armentano, publications director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). “Like most everyone else, these folks are responsible citiz- ens who work hard, raise families, contribute to their com- munities and want crime-free neighborhoods to live in.” Armentano argues that seeking out, arresting and jailing these otherwise law-abiding people is a travesty within our criminal justice system and can never be part of a truly free society. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimates that 71 million Americans (more than one-third of the voting population) have smoked marijuana at some time in their lives. More than 10 million are current users. In 1994, nearly half a million Americans were arrested on marijuana-related charges; 84 percent were arrested not for making sales, but for mere possession. Many successful business and political leaders have admitted to using the drug. Literature from NIDA itself states that the vast majority of users do not become dependent, and they do not go on to use other illegal drugs. Alcohol and tobacco are just as much \"gateway\" drugs as marijuana to the small percentage of society bent on self- destruction. Consider, too, that marijuana was legal in this country until the early 1900s. Prior to its prohibition, America was never known as the land of “potheads.” In other words, smoking the stuff was just not a big problem. The fact that marijuana use is currently on the rise, in the wake of stepped up enforcement of existing laws, shows that federal prohibition is not effective in discouraging its use. It is difficult to predict how or if usage rates would change with lesser penalties or legalization. Insight can be gained, however, from studying the results of modified decrimi- nalization laws adopted by 11 American states during the 1970s. Each state imposed a modest civil fine for minor marijuana offences. In none of these states did the lax laws cause any increase in marijuana use. Usage rates and related attitudes about the drug's use remained the same in these states as those that arrested users. All but one of the test states, Alaska, still support decriminalization policies. “By stubbornly continuing to classify all cannabis use as criminal,” writes Armentano, “including adults smoking in the privacy of their homes, we trample the constitutional liberties our nation was founded on, waste police and prosecutorial resources, clog the court system, fill costly and scarce jail and prison space, and needlessly destroy the lives and careers of genuinely good citizens.” 20 Hawai'i(an) Hemp Activists Suing Prosecutors Hawai'ian hemp activists Robert Christie and Aaron Anderson are suing Hawaii prosecutors Jay Kimura and Kay Iopa for $3 million in civil court. The plaintiffs were busted for possessing hemp seeds they say were sterile. They are complaining that they are being unfairly singled out by the government because of their outspoken views about marijuana. The suit alleges the prosecutors violated constitutional rights to \"freely speak, petition the government and be free from unjust government repression.\" The suit further accus - es Kay Iopa of lying about results of tests checking the viabil - ity of the hempseeds and of singling out the plaintiffs when similar seeds are commonly sold in stores around Hawai'i. Industrial Hemp Movement Growing Hemp can singlehandedly stop worldwide deforestation according to entrepreneurs like Carolyn Moran, owner of Living Tree Paper Company in Eugene, Oregon. Moran's magazine “ Talking Leaves” is printed on the company's first 100 percent tree-free hemp content paper, Tradition Bond, consisting of 10 percent hemp, 10 percent esparto grass, 60 percent agricultural by-products (like cotton and flax) and 20 percent post-consumer recycled fibers. Moran sees hemp awareness going mainstream. “We need to put pressure on the industry to create more plant-based paper,” she says. “Consumers need to put their money where their conscience is.” The U.S. government cannot seem to grasp the fact that industrial hemp is a much different product than marijuana raised for mind-altering purposes. Genetic engineering has produced seed varieties of hemp strains that carry less than one percent of the THC levels of the smoking variety, rendering it incapable of getting anyone high, no matter how much is smoked. Nevertheless, hemp production remains illegal in this country. Meanwhile, countries such as England, Germany, Holland, Hungary, China, Chile and Switzerland are reaping the benefits of hemp agriculture. Hemp provides alternative sources for fabrics, paper, health and beauty aids, building materials, food products and car fuel. “It's a plant that can provide alternatives to anything synthetic,” says Mari Kane, publisher of “ Hemp Pages: The International Hemp Journal.” Many state governments have been pushing to legalize marijuana for hemp production and medical use. In Vermont, legislators lobbied the governor to sign a bill allowing a hemp project that included studying the plant's marketability. - 84 -"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter Six War on Drugs - War on Human Rights Colorado introduced the Hemp Production Act in 1995 and 1996. The bills were defeated both times, but they did receive endorsements from the American Farm Bureau Federation and many other respected groups. The bills’ main opposition was from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). A hue and a cry was also sounded by the White House National Drug Council when footwear giant Adidas marketed hemp shoes. Adidas defended their product, stating that hemp is a versatile and durable fabric with a proven track record, and that hemp may be the answer to the world’s fiber shortage. It is now up to American consumers. The hemp movement is fighting for recognition and legalization. “Hemp can save the world,” says Kane, “but we have to give it a chance.” 22 Medical Marijuana Passes in California and Arizona California's medical marijuana initiative and law came about in response to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis. The 1996 law maintains that any patient who possesses a valid doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent without fear or risk of prosecution. If the initiative is passed by California voters this fall, the measure will become law immediately and cannot be vetoed. \"The issue here is simple: sick people should not be arrested for using medicine that their physicians recommend to them,\" said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. 22 Building Prisons Instead of Schools Editor’s Note: If you want to know the heart and soul of a nation, look into it’s prisons and see the conditions therein. The heart of America has turned cold. Our preoccupation with fear and control has distorted the great American experiment into just another pathetic police state like the former Soviet Union. There are too many good people behind bars for daring to exercise their unalienable rights as human beings. The united states of America has the highest incarceration rate in the “civilized” world, with more and more common activities and victimless offenses being criminalized. “Three strikes and you’re out must apply to elected government officials as well. A higher percentage of Americans are presently behind bars than were former political prisoners in South Africa and other countries with track records of human rights abuses. Yet, we do not even acknowledge that America has “political” prisoners (e.g. Leonard Peltier). Amnesty International ought to focus on the treatment of political prisoners in the United States, as well as their international work. I assert that 75% of the prisoners in the United States have been convicted and incarcerated for “political crimes.” A political crime is one that has no victim or damaged party, but has violated some corporate or commercial statute. Be aware of the coming holocaust on human rights in these United States. 24 The total number of prisoners held by the federal United States government has more than doubled since 1985. It is expected to double again before the end of the decade. Murderers, rapists, muggers and burglars do not ordinarily go to federal prisons. There you will find “white collar” criminals, political criminals or people judged guilty of “crimes against the State (crimes against the government).” On June 30th, 1994, there were 1,012,851 people in federal and State prisons. In 1992, the last time they were counted, there were 445,000 people in local jails. 25 In 1995, 150 new prisons were built in America at huge expense. There is no shortage of money when it comes to building prisons. So ask yourself, who needs these prisons? Is it for our security? Do you really believe that? Do we need more prisons, or do we need fewer legislators passing fewer laws that make criminals of all of us, and less government to enforce them? We are building more prisons and concentration camps instead of schools. 26 How is it that we have unlimited funding for that which oppresses us? Ask the international bankers! The FBI acknowledges that the serious, violent crime rate has gone down or is remaining steady in many areas, when adjusted against an increase in population, not up as the media would have us believe. In reality, there is not more crime, but more prosecution of crimes against specific classes of individuals deemed “dangerous” to the State, and more reporting of certain types of crimes (e.g., rape). 27 There is also greater media attention spent on crime and police activities. Crime coverage on network newscasts doubled in 1993. The media contacted the Department of Public Safety 3,700 times in small-town Eugene, Oregon for news stories in one year (1994). Handgun sales were up 65% from 1993 to 1994. Beware of the hidden agenda behind new crime bills. Crime is big business. Crime keeps the people afraid, the media supplied with news, and the government justified for stepping in and taking more control. 28 Little known to Americans, the entire Communist economic system in the former Soviet Union was maintained through the productivity of forced labor camps and prisons. Even in America today, increasing numbers of prison laborers are working for major corporations (e.g., Microsoft Corporation). And they keep telling me, a holocaust can’t happen in America.

Psychological torture and inhumane conditions in the prisons against these men, and a lack of lawful process in the courts has made this the trial of the century. Their treatment in the prisons has been appalling by minimal standards of human decency and fairness. These men are American political prisoners, and they are not alone. Well, over 75% of the prison population in America is political in nature, not criminal. 30 The machinery of de facto corporate government is now committing acts of violence and inhumanity in the prisons instead of overtly committing acts of genocide since the tragic, public relations fiascos of Waco and Ruby Ridge. The government can no longer get away with military-style raids on private civilians, no matter how notorious the media paints them to be. The media spins the FBI as the heroes of the people, praised for saving a few ranchers from these horrible “freemen” who dare to live by the Constitution for the united states of America and the Common law. They have simply executed the Common laws of the land and exercised the Common law lien process the way the international bankers and government does everyday. The trouble is they stepped on the toes of the global cartel that controls the banking industry, and they reacted harshly and swiftly. If laws were broken and “fraudulent checks” written, then bring forth the evidence and the pertinent laws before a constitutional court of competent jurisdiction to determine the outcome by a jury. This is all the freemen have requested and have been denied for over two years (except for the famous extradition hearing by Judge Burns). 31 If a crime has been committed, then a grand jury must bring forth the charges. Regardless of their individual views or political opinions, every man or woman has the unalienable sovereign rights to a fair trial in America. An accusation or indictment is not a conviction in the united states of America, only in a tribunal under a military dictatorship. This is how our statutory courts presently operate under the Emergency and War Powers Acts. Under the laws of our land and international conventions, you cannot be punished before trial or treated inhumanely. Not even prisoners of war are treated as badly as our reports indicate from the Montana and Missouri federal gulags. There are reports from Schweitzer’s relatives and an Affidavit from Brandie Schweitzer, Leroy's daughter, that he is being grossly mistreated in jail. “He was taken to the Yellowstone County Detention Center in Billings, Montana. Beginning that same evening through Wednesday the 27th, I heard repeated reports of my dad's mistreatment. By 'mistreatment,' I mean he was being beaten...On Friday the 29th...we learned that he was not just beaten, but rather tortured...He described in detail how the federal marshals put shackles around his ankles and wrists so tightly that he bled. He said they strapped him in a chair and kicked him in the legs, hit him in the face, grabbed him by his hair and yanked his head around, pushed in on his ears with their fingers until he almost passed out, and pressed on the backs of his finger nails. They turned down the heat in his cell, took his blanket and his mattress and left him in only his t-shirt and pants.” 32 This is a shivering reminder of our own inhumanity to each other. What the government will not do in broad daylight, it is accomplishing behind the closed doors of prison cell. They are trying to break this man’s spirit! This is wrong and must not go unnoticed by the media and the American people. The outcome of these events will determine the future of America and the world. Do not turn your head aside and ignore what is going on! If they can come and get any one of us for simply being learned in the law and exercising our rights, then none of us will ever be free. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, “ If we don't hang together, certainly we will hang separately.” The intimidation and torture that America has taught third world dictators for decades has now come home to roost in our own jails for our own political prisoners. Where is Amnesty International? Why have they not caught wind of what’s going on in America? If you wish to know the heart of a nation, look at its jails. America, you have lost your heart and soul. Have you forgotten what country you live in? Is this the land of the free or the clone of some ugly communist dictatorship? The media has twisted the truth into a pretzel and the American people must awaken to the truth.

Editor’s Note: Having the choice to do with our bodies what we choose is an unalienable right, as much so as breathing the air, drinking water and eating food. That any body politic, local, federal or global would presume to have power over our bodies is ludicrous and dangerous. We the People must educate ourselves, stand together and organize against these initiatives. We the People must keep alternative healing modalities available by any means necessary despite these initiatives to destroy your freedom of choice. The FDA raids health food stores and alternative health clinics in pursuit of super-vitamins, herbs and other unapproved nutritional supplements at gunpoint. Now the FDA is threatening to arrest ordinary citizens in their homes for purchasing “unapproved” therapies. Kenneth M. Shuart was threatened with arrest and intimidated in his home when an armed U.S. Marshal and an FDA Enforcement Agent came to his door and informed him that they had seized the KH3 he had ordered from Europe. We must expose and protest the FDA’s outrageously illegal and unconstitutional actions. The Life Extension Foundation has mounted a campaign to expose these illegal actions by the FDA. Kenneth and others have legal recourse if they understood the principles of sovereign Citizenship. Unfortunately, most people in the health freedom movement are still unaware of the power and significance of sovereignty. The FDA is a federal government agency and has no power or authority over sovereign state Citizens. If you want your health freedom protected, then you must reclaim your sovereign state Citizenship and restore the checks and balances that belong on government. As partners in NAFTA, both Canada and Mexico are having their public health care systems dismantled and privatized along the lines of managed competition. 34 FDA Bullies Brave Battlers for Nine Years, Then Backs Down Editor’s Note: Hooray for a victory against the FDA. These clowns have been persecuting doctors, nutritionists, alternative cancer therapists for years. It's time we give them a bit of their own medicine. In 1987, two dozen armed FDA agents and U.S. marshals smashed their way into the Life Extension Foundation offices in Hollywood, Florida, with guns drawn. Their search warrant later proved to have been obtained through perjured testimony by the FDA agent in charge. Not finding what the search warrant allowed them to take, the agents grabbed everything they could, including literature, documents, computers and personal belongings not included in the warrant. They also seized 5,000 copies of the foundation's newsletter, which were ready for mailing — a flagrant violation of the organization's freedom of speech. A decade of legal battles insured. Evidence showed that the agent in charge had also tried to intimidate a radio producer into banning appearances by foundation representatives. Repeatedly told that they would by sent to prison for life if they didn't cooperate with the all-powerful drug agency, foundation principals William Faloon and Saul Kent stood their ground and fought back, at enormous personal cost. The government poured millions of dollars into its case, attempting to “prove” that the Foundation was purveying “unapproved drugs” — such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Failing to get the goods in one grand-jury fishing expedition, the FDA started over with a second, both times terrorizing foundation witnesses with threats of personal investigation. Further raids, embargoes on vitamin products and interstate terrorism by the FDA failed to induce Faloon and Kent to give up, however. Instead, they fought back hard with political activities, media counterattacks and legal motions demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the charges against them. In 1991, they were indicted for having informed Americans (in the mid-1980s) how to obtain life-sustaining drugs from overseas suppliers. Since the FDA has long permitted the importation of unapproved drugs for personal use, the two men's action was innocent, yet they were arrested, handcuffed and jailed for a day. At last, the agency's brutal campaign began to break down. In 1992, it was ordered to return items seized in the first raid and offered a “deal” to settle the case. After this, it made several other offers, each accompanied by threats that never materialized. Then, in 1995, the FDA made its most serious threat yet, claiming new evidence that would certainly send Faloon and Kent to jail for life! This kind of illegal intimidation has been the FDA's standard operating procedure — and it had usually worked, but by mid 1995 it offered instead to guarantee no prison time and even to allow the two men to stay in business. Next, in November 1995, the FDA asked the judge to drop all charges but one: “obstruction of justice.” Finally, last February — after nine years of brutal harassment and anguish since the first attack — the last charge was dropped. Derailed for a decade, the Life Extension Foundation has begun funding research again, and, thanks to its two victorious freedom-fighters, the rest of us can feel braver about facing down unruly government agencies. 35 GATTS Fist Crushes Health Supplements in Norway, Threatens U.S. Drug cartels have invaded the European health-food market, and repressive new laws have already made herbs and other supplements almost entirely unavailable in Norway. The few that remain carry enormous price tags--and are sold only by corporate pharmacies. - 87 -"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The Norwegian laws are identical to the German Codex proposal that the U.S. Congress signed on for when it ratified GATT. 36 Health Choices Threatened by World Health Organization (WHO) In another move to control virtually every minute aspect of our lives, the global elitists now want to monopolize the dietary supplements industry. The U.S. Congress allowed the UN to get a foothold into this private aspect of Americans' lives through GATT which dictates that the US must “harmonize” its rules governing the manufacture of health products with new international standards or be penalized by the World Trade Organization. A special commission called Codex Alimentarius Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses is moving to regulate labeling and manufacture of dietary supplements. The Committee is composed of delegates that represent national agencies and international organi-zations with 90% of the group being dominated by spokes-people for multinational pharmaceutical corporations. Any delegate can propose regulations to the Committee and those proposals are subjected to a peer review period with votes occurring at various stages in the process. A proposal that runs the gauntlet of peer review unscathed becomes part of the official Codex Alimentarius. So far, the only delegate from the US has been Elizabeth A Yetley, Ph.D of the FDA who, due to political pressure in America, has so far voted on behalf of those who choose health freedom. A new draconian proposal called “Proposed Draft Guide- lines for Dietary Supplements” would result in the requir- ement of doctors’ prescriptions for most supplements now available in this country. The measure, introduced by the German delegation calls for the following: 37 1. No dietary supplements can be sold for prophylactic or therapeutic use. 2. No dietary supplement sold as a food can exceed potency levels set by the commission. 3. Codex regulations for dietary supplements would become binding. 4. All new dietary supplements would automatically be banned unless they go through the Codex approval process. HIV Reappraised As Non-Contagious By Some Scientists & Medical Doctors Very few people seem to know that growing numbers of scientists and medical doctors now think that AIDS is not contagious and that HIV is completely harmless. A newsletter devoted to this controversy, Reappraising AIDS, was founded three years ago by The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis. The Group is comprised of university professors, physicians, and community activists who think that this debate should be given a fair public hearing. In this month's issue, editor Paul Philpott examines a sensational study published last year in England's prestigious journal Nature. The study tracked about 2,000 hemophiliacs for 14 years. It documented a startling jump in mortality for those testing HIV-positive, but no increased mortality for those testing HIV-negative. Philpott points out that the study could find no increased mortality among HIV positive hemophiliacs until 1986, one year after HIV testing was introduced. By that time, roughly half of Darby's subjects were positive. If HIV causes deadly AIDS, then why did a large population, fifty-percent comprised of HIV positives, not start dying until after they had been diagnosed as being HIV positive? Philpott suggests that the principal cause of AIDS among HIV positive hemophiliacs is aggressive prophylactic treatment with toxic “anti-HIV” medications and intense anxiety from “HIV-positive” social stigma. Philpott references other studies demonstrating that HIV is actually a benign virus typically found only at very low concentrations, and sometimes not at all — in AIDS patients. 38 AIDS: Genetically Engineered In his new book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola: Nature, Accident or Genocide, Dr. Horowitz, D.M.D., M.A., M.P.H. traces the development of the AIDS virus. He says his scrutiny of over 2500 scientific papers and government documents reveals that HIV-1 and HIV2 could both have originated from simian viruses genetically manipulated in laboratory experiments at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Dr. Horowitz began his investigation into the source of AIDS in 1993 after reading a Department of Defense appropriations request for $10 million for development of AIDS-like viruses. He says the emergence of AIDS coincides with major advances in genetic engineering of mutant viruses that produce immuno-suppression and an array of infectious diseases. In the early 70’s, scientists had isolated the specific enzymes and other biochemical processes that induce collapse of the immune system. Research at the National Cancer Institute was focused mostly on the sarcoma-leukemia cancer model where immunosuppression, cancer, and death were induced by DNA and RNA manipulation. In some experiments, DNA in simian monkey viruses was commonly replaced with cat leukemia and chicken sarcoma RNA. Dr. Robert Gallo, a top AIDs researcher, used viruses from simian monkeys and mice to insert cancer-causing RNA into human white blood cells. In his book, Dr. Horowitz traces the development of AIDS- like viruses to mega-military contractor Litton Industries. Litton was the principle supplier of simian monkeys to NCIs cancer research centers throughout the world. They were also the sixth highest paid biological weapons contractor for the Army. 39 - 88 -"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Chapter Six Health Freedom or Fascism? AIDS Statistical Risk Most heterosexuals in the United States face a very slim chance of getting AIDS, but that’s not what Washington wants Americans to think. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, federal officials began a nationwide disinformation campaign in 1987, suggesting that AIDS was becoming an epidemic in the general population. A similar campaign of duplicity occurred in Britain as revealed by the Sunday London Times. In fact, federal officials knew the risks of getting AIDS were largely confined to gay men, intravenous drug users, their sex partners and their newborn children. They proceeded with the campaign anyway for fear the public wouldn't support increased funding for AIDS research if most heterosexuals didn't believe they were at risk. For most heterosexuals, the AIDS risk from a single sex act was one in five million without the use of a condom, and one in 50 million for condom users — smaller than the risk of getting hit by lightning. Scientific journals are increasingly publishing the findings confirming there’s no “hidden spread” of the AIDS virus into the heterosexual population. This is not to even mention the suppression of respectable evidence challenging the entire AIDS theory, including those of Nobel Prize winning scientists. 40 Why We May Never Read the Book on AIDS? HIV is a mere wimp that cannot be the cause of AIDS, according to Dr. Peter Duesberg, a virologist with the University of California-Berkley. Dr. Duesberg, a scientist of international stature, is credited with defining retroviruses. He says HIV has been highly overrated as a killer. His theory holds that cofactors, especially drugs used to manage the disease, are the actual killers. About 200 other doctors and researchers are coming up with similar conclusions. One even injected HIV infected blood into his own veins to prove the point. Bryan J. Ellison, one of Dr. Duesberg's graduate students, wrote a book called, Why We Will Never Win the War on AIDS? However, we may never get to read it. Federal Judge, John E. Sprizzo granted an injunction to halt publication of the book and has ordered all existing copies destroyed. Mr. Ellison had decided to print 20,000 on his own after he had signed a contract with Alfred J. Regenry. Apparently, Regenry was the second publisher to agree to print the book and change their minds. Regenry says they are still planning to publish the book sometime. Poisoning the People With Fluoride The state has the police power to add a toxic substance to drinking water without violating the rights of the citizens, according to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Bellasai vs. Cuyahoga Falls. Apparently, the California state legislature supports the practice since they passed a law mandating the fluoridation of drinking water in over 90 percent of the state’s municipal water systems. But fluoride is good for you isn't it? And no child should be deprived of it, should they? On the contrary, “The chronic administration of fluoride in water takes its toll on human health and life,” according to John Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D, president of the Safe Water Foundation. “Fluoride in water increases risk of hip fracture, cancer, dental fluorosis and other harmful effects,” he says. That’s why he's spearheading an initiative campaign to ban fluoride from water systems in California. So who would want to poison 30 million people anyway? The Public Health Service has been endorsing the use of fluoride for years and has its credibility and funding to think about. Petro chemical and steel corporations regularly spew fluorides into the atmosphere and they have billions of dollars to loose if fluoride were widely identified as the poison it is. But the biggest losers will be the chemical fertilizer industry as they generate the fluoride that gets dumped in water supplies. Fluoride must be removed from phosphate fertilizer before it is applied to crops, or they will die. The toxic substance has to be put somewhere and as Dr. Yiamouyiannis says, “The solution to pollution is dilution!” 450,000 signatures are needed to get the initiative on the ballot and Dr. Y says everyone should help, even those who don't live in California because, “If we let California fall to fluoridation, the rest of the country will follow in three to four years.” 42 Outcome-Based Education Editor’s Note: Education is best left to the parents, families and communities, not to centralized standards coerced into implementation from the level of global governance. It simply is not wise to standardize the human race and its immense cultural diversity into an industrial model that serves the elite. That’s what makes these global initiatives dangerous. It takes a whole village to raise a child, but it doesn’t take the New World Order to educate him/her! Thanks to the researchers on this article. Educational restructuring has nothing to do with local initiatives designed to yield wise and knowledgeable adults. It is an Orwellian international plan, complying with international business standards, designed to produce a compliant global workforce on behalf of the international banking cartel. The education reforms currently being implemented by local school boards are integrally based on a plan orchestrated by UNESCO. In 1947 UNESCO published Towards World Understanding, which identifies the school as the means for changing society to establish the New World Order. Two years later, UNESCO adopted the “Vocational Guid- ance Recommendations of 1949” and subsequent “Vocat- ional Training Recommendations” in 1956 and 1962 as propounded by the International Labor Organization. The United States Government has been lapping up UNESCOs Orwellian pablum from the start. In 1947, President Truman's Commission on Higher Education declared, “The role which education will play officially must be conditioned essentially by policies established by the State Department in this country... - 89 -"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The United States Office of Education must be prepared to work with the State Department and with UNESCO.” The reforms currently being implemented in the nation's schools are linked to concepts propounded by Paul Lengrand in his paper Introduction to Life-Long Education, endorsed by UNESCO in 1966. Back in 1925, the Rockefeller Foundation had issued a grant to inaugurate the International Bureau of Education (IBE), a reincarnation of the Rousseau Society of France. By 1970, UNESCO and IBE joined forces and decided that lifelong education would be the Master Concept for restructuring schools throughout the world. UNESCO commissioned George W. Parkyn in 1971 to develop a means for bringing an existing national school system into line with the lifelong learning policy introduced by Lengrand. Parkyn’s study, “Towards a Conceptual Model of Life-long Education,” is the basis for every aspect of educational restructuring in the United States. The new paradigm of lifelong education, replaces traditional curriculum with transformational Outcome-based Education (OBE) which is a shift from a content structure to a process structure, heavily influenced by the psychological theories of B.F. Skinner and Walden Two. In 1976, UNESCO published “Foundations of Lifelong Education,” the master text of education reform which covers the philosophical, sociological, psychological, anthropological, economic, and analytical principles necessary for the development of UNESCOs “new man for the 21st century.” One of the problems uncovered in that report is that the United State’s “capitalist school system engenders a relative over-population of qualified workers.” In other words, the educational system in the US was too good and turning out a cadre of diploma holders that seemed “seriously to exceed the capacity of the market.” The study indicates that America's educational system should be downgraded to facilitate absorption into the global economy. This objective has been abetted by both democratic and republican administrations. President Carter established the Department of Education as a cabinet level position to work directly with UNESCO. The shocking revelations of the Reagan administration's “Nation at Risk Report” opened the floodgates for popular support of education reform. It was President Bush who called a meeting of Governors together for an Education Summit (co-chaired by Bill Clinton and Lamar Alexander). The purpose of the summit was to translate the UNESCO/IBE goals into a working model to foist the plan onto an unsuspecting American public. Despite the constitutional injunction against federal interference in education, America 2000 emerged, and with the help of the National Business Roundtable, the Carnegie Foundation, the Governor's Association, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and a host of other organizations, it was marketed to every federal State of the Union. Now, under the Clinton Presidency, “Goals 2000” codifies the UNESCO model in law, using federal dollars to entice federal States to “voluntarily” comply. Under Goals 2000, the National Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, the Joint Dissemination Review Panel and the National Diffusion Network ensure that every federal State will use validated outcomes, assessments and curricula that align with the UNESCO plan for “world class standards.” 43 Critique of the Careers Act The Careers Act (HR 1617) embodies the value that people are a “human resource” to be developed for the good of society. Emphasis is placed on how the individual “worker” can best become a producer serving corporations and the government. This goal will be accomplished by the top-down, carrot-and- stick approach to decision making, where states apply for federal education grants then comply with the structures dictated by the Act. States that accept money under the Act will institute so- called collaborative decision making processes with the decision makers appointed by state governors who have the last word when agreements about education cannot be reached. Colorado state senator Charles Duke says, “You do not and will not see the State Legislatures in here anywhere, for State Legislatures have been effectively bypassed. You also do not see any mention of your local school boards, for those too have been bypassed.” He says The Careers Act will merge the federal departments of Education, Labor and Human Services and that it warmly embraces all aspects of Goals 2000. “The architects of Goals 2000 have a supreme elitist attitude that government policy should presume the omniscience to direct and channel our children into careers of the government's choosing.” A National Education Goals Panel will be put in place to measure the progress toward the Goals 2000 agenda. Under the plan, everyone will be required to obtain skill certificates, which not only guarantee mastery of basic academic skills and a vocational track, but will also assure that successful inculcation of government sanctioned values, attitudes and beliefs has been achieved. Local Workforce Development Boards linked to Integrated Career Centers will tailor workforce skills to projected busi - ness requirements. In order to keep track of everyone's progress, a comprehensive data base will be created linking fed eral, state and local workforce data. “This program is de - signed to turn all of America's children into automatons, in - capable of independent thought and ignorant of issues such as freedom and justice for all,” says Senator Duke (R-Colo). 44 - 90 -"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chapter Six Parental Rights Endangered Parental Rights Endangered Editors Note: If this is any sign of the times to come where the State acquires then enforces an interest against your children, then mama and papa you'd better get your sovereignty happening now!

In a decree forever terminating petitioner MLB’s parental rights to her two minor children, a Mississippi Chancery Court recited a segment of the governing Mississippi statute and stated, without elaboration, that respondents, the children's natural father and his second wife, had met their burden of proof by “clear and convincing evidence.” The Chancery Court, however, neither described the evidence nor otherwise revealed precisely why MLB was decreed a stranger to her children. MLB filed a timely appeal from the termination decree, but Mississippi law conditioned her right to appeal on prepayment of record preparation fees estimated at $2,352.36.

The supreme Court of Mississippi denied her application on the ground that, under its precedent, there is no right to proceed in forma pauperis in civil ap - peals.

It threatens a mammoth intrusion by the world body into the private affairs of American families. To start with, it would mandate registration of all children of birth, dictate rules about religious training for adopted children, and grant blanket privacy to children regarding sex and the related topics of contraceptives, abortion and pornography. Under the convention, parents are not allowed to forbid their children to join gangs or cults, and if they (the parents) break any of the rules they must appear for an inquisition before a tribunal of experts who decide their guilt or innocence and punishment. The Concerned Women for America have been fighting to keep the treaty from coming to a vote before the Senate, but pro UN officials are now pushing for ratification. 46 Biochip Implants, Tracking & the Microchip Generation The Clinton Administration recently announced its intention to open the Pentagon's “Global Positioning System” up to full commercial access. Vice President Al Gore said the move would “help the emerging GPS business burgeon with jobs and explode into an $8 billion industry by the end of this century.” Some of the new jobs would be caused by the need to protect the military security of GPS while making state-ofthe art systems available commercially, the Vice President explained. “Before long it's going to be very difficult to get lost,” according to Charles R. Trimble, president of Trimble Navigation Ltd. Trimble is one of several high-tech firms interested in producing portable receivers capable of picking up satellite positioning signals from anywhere in the world. Meanwhile, European scientists are developing biochip implants that can be read from up to three miles away by utilizing the Global Positioning System. The new implants contain a 20k data chip that not only stores information about its host, but can also accurately locate an individual. The invention is currently being tested on crabs and a human version will be available in 1997. 47 Micro-information System for DMV Symbol Technology, Inc. has developed a micro information system for Departments of Motor Vehicles nationwide. Information about a vehicle, its owner and any liens held against it are stored in dots printed between bar codes. The system, called PDF-417 can be adapted to provide “traffic analysis” of a vehicle’s movements and any traffic fines incurred can be reported directly to consumer credit databases via cellular links. 48 Genetic Vampires & Sovereign Rights The science of genetic engineering has raised questions about who owns the genetically manipulated materials that scientists come up with in their labs, and whether the people from whom the raw materials are prospected have rights to any of the proceeds from the commercialized products. In 1984, the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center developed a cell line valuable in fighting bacteria and cancer. The University filed a patent claim on the line that was commercially developed and the man from whom the cell was taken filed suit, claiming he was entitled to a share in the profits. In 1990 the California supreme Court said a donor has no “property right” in tissue removed from his or her body. Moreover, remuneration to a donor would hinder research by restricting access to necessary raw materials, thereby interfering with the progress of science. In 1993, a patent claim was filed under the name of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on the cell of a Guayami woman from Panama. Her cell line is of interest because the Guyami people carry a unique virus whose antibodies may be useful in AIDS and leukemia research. International protest and action by the Guyami General Congress and supporters led to a withdrawal of the patent claim. - 91 -"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The U.S. Department of Commerce also filed patent claims on cell lines of indigenous people from the Solomon Islands. The government of the Solomon Islands declared the action was an invasion of sovereignty, that there was lack of informed consent of the “donors” and demanded the genetic samples be repatriated. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown responded with a letter that said, “there is no provision for considerations related to the source of cells that may be the subject of patent application.” The Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) which is harvesting cells from indigenous people worldwide raises troubling questions about the exploitation of people for their genetic assets. Since there is a lack of international policy governing the human genetic material market, it has been suggested that contracts may offer some control to those individuals who donate genetic materials to HGDP. However, contracts, treaties and other negotiations have historically provided indigenous people little protection from property-hungry interests. Furthermore, the idea of ownership and property rights being extended to all facets of the natural world is a western notion of law that is contrary to the concept of stewardship inherent in the cosmologies, traditions and cultures of indigenous people. 49 Vampire Project Challenged by Indigenous Alliance A consortium of scientists, universities, governments and private interests called the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) adopted the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) in 1994 to further their objective of mapping the entire human DNA sequence. The multinational, multi-billion dollar project is zeroing in on 772 groups of indigenous people on the assumption that they will inevitably become extinct. Called the “Vampire Project” by some, the effort consists of researchers gathering blood, hair roots, cheek scrapings and saliva samples from living people. The cell samples are to be harvested from 50 people per group. Dr. Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a principle founder of the project said the scientific rationale for selecting 50 individuals per group is that, “One person can bleed 50 people and get on an airplane in one day.” The invasive project is being challenged by an international alliance of indigenous peoples from South, Central and North America. The “people,” as most indigenous humans refer to themselves, resent being identified as “Isolates of Historic Interest” by HUGO, and are questioning the ethical implications of the entire plan. Will the People truly be fully informed about the possible uses and potential profits from the materials, as HUGO promises? Will the choice of “informed consent” rest with the individual “donors,” tribal representatives or the government officials of the nation-states that dominate the groups’ territories? How will the project be explained in local languages? Will a decision not to participate be fully honored? Indigenous communities are not only concerned with the obvious exploitation of their body parts, but consider that the genetic information may be used for racist agendas, even genocide and biological warfare. The Human Genome Diversity Project is the brainchild of Dr. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a renowned population geneticist at Stanford University in California. He wants to reconstruct the recent history of homo sapiens from a comparison of the genomes of different human popu- lations. Why? Purely in the interest of science, he says. Last October the implications of his project were reviewed by UNESCO's International Bioethics Committee (IBC) in Paris. The group acknowledged the validity of the project's scientific goals, but also endorsed the criticism of indige- nous peoples, whose genes are the main target of the research. Opponents of the project fear that indigenous groups will be exploited commercially by “vampires,” doing Cavalli-Sforza's bidding. On the contrary, Dr. Cavalli-Sforza says the project should help to combat racism because experience so far shows that physiological and psychological intra group differen-ces are always greater than the mean differences between groups. The IBC says this is the most debatable of all his claims since the prejudice that gives rise to racist and eugenic attitudes tends to pervert scientific results to its own ends, Dr. Cavalli- Sforza says,”I have become used to being called a planner of genocide and of being accused of economic interest. My main aim is to defend the project and defend science.” 50 Human Tissue Enterprise Linked to US Military Human genetic material is routinely being exchanged between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and biological warfare medical units at Fort Detrick near Washington D.C., according to the March/April report by the Rural Advancement Foundation (RAFI). Fort Detrick is not only famous for its Ebola research but also for its long history as the military's primary biological warfare research center and medical intelligence headquarters for the Defense Department. It is also the home of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) unit charged with monitoring medical data gleaned from foreign populations. Thousands of human tissue samples collected from indigenous people and isolated communities around the world are now being evaluated by the biotechnology industry, academic researchers, and the government, says Edward Hammond, principal author of the communiqué, “New Questions About Management and Exchange of Hu- man Tissues at NIH/Indigenous Persons’ Cells Patented.” “There appear to be no policy or protocol barriers or ethical consideration to the routine exchange of foreign human cell lines between civilian researchers in the U.S. Government and their military counterparts,” says RAFI Executive Director, Pat Roy. - 92 -"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Chapter Six Genetic Vampires & Sovereign Rights RAFI has sought assurance from NIH and Fort Detrick that there were strict protocols and policies preventing the transfer of NIH's cell lines and data to bio-warfare workers.

SAIC was at a loss to identify any such protocols to RAFI researchers. RAFI is calling on the UN to ensure that civilian medical research is kept separate from bio-warfare research, according to proprieties established by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Fourth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva. 51 Seizure Fever: The War on Property Rights Once upon a time it seemed like a fine idea to seize the property of convicted felons. That was in 13 th century England, before the Magna Carta reforms were instituted. Zealous modern-day anti-drug warriors forgot about the potential for abuse that government seizures induce and decided to nip drug dealers in the bud by taking away the fruits of their profits. Thus was born the “asset forfeiture law enforcement program,” as Cary H. Copeland, director of the Justice Department's Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture calls it. Nowadays, many people's property is seized without a conviction, let along a charge. Asset forfeitures are such easy money for law enforcement groups that temptation has turned our protectors into robbers while doing little to stop the drug trade in the land. A Justice Department document summed up the problem, “Like children in a candy shop, the law enforcement community chose all manner and method of seizing and forfeiting property, gorging ourselves in an effort which soon came to resemble one designed to raise revenues.” According to Steven Kessler, author of a three-volume study on federal and state forfeiture, “The use of forfeiture has probably increased a hundred fold in the last ten years.” And why wouldn't it? Police departments can rake in big capital with scant accountability: A $138,000 Lear jet whose owner committed the heinous crime of a typographical error on FAA paperwork. Entire apartment buildings whose landlords had not eradicated drug dealing on the premises. A $1.1 million ranch in California on a fabricated tip about marijuana plants. It is a technicality in the law that allows the government to swoop down like vultures on the private property of citizens without due process. Persons and people have rights under the law, but property doesn't. So the government sues the property instead of the owner and it is guilty until proven innocent. Often, the seizures occur on the basis of unsubstantiated rumors made by confidential government informers. The Justice Department regularly gives rewards to those who make accusations that lead to a seizure. It's a cozy arrangement that funds law enforcement units and a mushrooming group of informers at the expense of citizens. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois noted in 1993 that 80 percent of the people who have their property seized under federal drug laws are never formally charged. Many of them never get their property back either. Why? Because if it’s nice the officials would like to keep it and the cost of suing the government for recovery often exceeds $10,000 and requires the posting of up to $5,000 bond. 52 Banking on the New World Order The federal United States government has formally accepted the SSN as a “National Identity Card,” until such time that the National Health or Debit Card functions in that capacity. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 enabled the Secret Service to create profiles of would be assassins, and the IRS to create a Debtor Master File listing nearly one million people who supposedly owe money to various government agencies. 53 “ Give me your social security number and I ca n find out anything about you. ” —IRS Agent, Retired The Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that all children be assigned SSNs through enumeration at birth programs. Often this is done automatically without consent at the hospital (having your baby at home is a better option). For taxpayers, failure to register will result in the loss of dependent deductions for tax purposes and welfare programs. All real estate transactions must now be reported to the IRS by both the seller and broker (if a real estate broker is involved). A national IRS database lists every homeowner in the United States. If you move, you must notify the DMV or IRS within 10-45 days. 54 The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has called for the creation of a counterfeit-proof currency that can be electronically tracked (notice the new designs and electronic thread in the new $20, $50 and $100 bills). Soon, we’ll be going to a “cashless” society with all transactions accounted for with a debit card (you can get them via offshore banks without tracking). President Bill Clinton has made it a goal of his administration to implement the debit card system. Electronic wire transfers of your IRS calculated tax returns can now be subtracted automatically from your bank account without your authority (do not have bank accounts in your name linked to your SSN). Income taxes will be automatically deducted from your bank account on a monthly basis. 55 The IRS is identifying individuals buying and selling gold, the first step toward launching another gold confiscation effort (keep your gold and silver private). On at least three occasions, the United States government impounded private stocks of gold - during the Revolutio- nary War, during the Civil War, and again in 1933. Anti- hoarding laws are imminent for Americans stockpiling food, water, medicine, and other survival items. 56 - 93 -"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The Bank Secrecy Act requires all U.S. Banks to maintain copies of all transactions on microfilm, record the SSN of anyone opening a new account and turn in the name of anyone who fails to provide this information within 45 days to the Treasury Department. Deposits greater than $5,000 are reported to the IRS via a Currency Transaction Report (CTR). It also limits the amount of cash leaving the country to $10,000 and makes changes in the treatment of foreign bank accounts. The IRS, as a government record-keeping operation, has the contractual authority to snoop into the private financial lives of every U.S. citizen hooked into the grid and share that information with other federal agencies. The IRS has given major new forfeiture powers to 63 district criminal investigation division chiefs who may delegate their authority to Special Agents. If the value of the property is assessed at $500,000 or less the Special Agent may publish a binding “Notice of Sale of Seized Property”. All this is done everyday despite the fact the IRS has no authority whatsoever in the sovereign states of the republic.” 57 “The Depositor takes the risk in revealing his affairs to another, that the information will be given to the government.”—Justice Lewis Powell 58 A Treasury Enforcement Communications System terminal is in place at virtually every port of entry to the United States to screen suspected tax evaders, criminals or those suspected of removing cash from the country. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 authorized the U.S. Treasury to monitor any movement of its U.S. citizens, including reading license plate numbers by computer. Passports will not be issued to anyone who has failed to file tax returns or who has not paid their “required” income tax. Disputes with the IRS will result in the loss of travel privileges outside the United States until the dispute is resolved through the Tax Court. 59 The Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FINCEN) has established a crime center in Arlington, Virginia, whereby through the use of sophisticated computers the govern-ment has combined more than 100 databases on bank records, criminal suspects, driving records, census data and myriads of business and financial activities of millions of honest, law- abiding citizens. This is a trial run for a world system of financial tracking, surveillance and control to be administered by the United Nations. 60 FinCEN Follows the Money The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a federal intelligence gathering network operating under the auspices of the Treasury Department. The stated goal of FinCEN is to collate, analyze and disseminate information on financial crimes, especially drug money laundering. FinCEN is an extensive spy network armed with sophisticated computer resources. It is linked with 13 intelligence organizations and 14 federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, BATF, CIA, DEA, SS, etc., as well as Chapter Six – Banking on the New World Order the IRS, Interpol, and financial institutions. Every law enforcement group from the smallest local police department to the National Security Agency can access FinCEN in their attempts to identify, track and prosecute criminals — or those who are just a threat to the established order. 61 Fingerprints, Not Liberty, for All Finger printing was designed to help track convicted criminals. Now it is being used to track citizens who have no checking account and want to cash a check. Bankers’ associations in 16 states are encouraging financial institutions to put non-customers’ thumb prints on the backs of checks — just in case the person turns out to be a crook. Statistics on check fraud provides the social planners with evidence to support their position that fingerprinting as the only possible solution to the problem. And of course bank customers also commit fraud; it’s only a matter of time before all bank customers (the vast majority of Americans) are fingerprinted too. Then what? An implanted computer chip in the human body? Now there's the ultimate check on fraud. At what point will the American people draw the line and say “no”? There are other solutions to the problem of check fraud, but this particular solution imposes the monitoring and regulating of people not accused of any crime. Notice how more and more problems are being solved in this manner, such as: increased restrictions for law-abiding gun owners; curfews for certain age groups; social security numbers used as centralized identification; unconstitu- tional searches and bodily screening procedures simply for traveling interstate on an airplane. . .the list of government intrusions is growing rapidly. And like cattle in ignorance led to slaughter, the American people are allowing gradual enslavement through apathy. Propagandists put forth the argument that if a person isn’t doing anything wrong, why worry about being monitored? Because “right” and “wrong” are determined by those in power. Who now holds the power over increasingly centralized tracking systems? The people? Monitoring innocent people is not consistent with basic Constitutional rights. Such centralized tracking systems are evidence of a people being governed, not a people governing themselves. And the power of choice in the matter is rapidly closing. In Oregon, about a third of all financial institutions are currently using thumb prints. “Virtually every financial institution either has or will implement the program,” said Diane Ness, chairwoman of Oregon's Financial Institution Security Task Force 62 - 94 -"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Chapter Six Banking on the New World Order Mexican Bailout Never Reached the Mexican People The $20 billion that the U.S. government appropriated for Mexico never left New York, but went directly into Goldman-Sachs.

Whether you have a lot or a little, work hard for it, live off trust funds or collect welfare, inherit it or win the lottery, there are so many basic survival, fear and success issues linked up with “money,” its acquisition and spending, that we rarely have the time to step back from the insanity and ask the hard questions. What is real “money”? Who controls it? How is it made? Where does it come from? How does the economic system really work? Why are so many people and businesses going bankrupt? Money, is it worth living and dying for, stealing and killing for? Why is it so glorified as an object of ones attention? Is there a better alternative? How can I let money reflect my values? How can I serve the greater community as well as work doing what I love? “ When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion” —Voltaire Until 1500 BC, all “money” was alive—cattle, lambs, goats or pigs. Bankers financed the great trading ships on long sea voyages from port to port. While onboard, the cattle had calves or “kind,” which had been agreed belonged to the banker. This was where the concept of charging “interest” arose. The concept of “interest” though depletes the life- support equity of both depositors and borrowers and ultimately transfers equity and control to the banker. 1 The Phoenicians, who were a sophisticated ancient civilization, invented metal money in the shape of a pair of bullhorns. Because coinage was simpler to transport than cattle, it gained popular usage internationally as a commodity and precious metal. Gold and silver have also retained a steady value relative to purchasing power over time. An ounce of gold today has the same buying power as in ancient Greece. Money is not an invention of the state. “Certain commodi- ties become money quite naturally, as the result of econo- mic relationships... independent of the power of the state.” Though many different commodities have been used as money over the centuries, “...gold and silver have emerged as money in the free competition of the market.” 2 > “MONEY” (Ø)—in the ordinary connotation it means coins and paper currency used as a circulating medium of exchange; does not include notes, bonds, evidences of debt, or other private property or real estate. 3 > MONEY ($)—tangible metallic substance with intrinsic and stable-store of value, distinguished from paper currency, checks and drafts. Money is not wealth, but a tool. The true source of wealth of a nation lies with the skills of the people and what they are capable of producing. True economies are created from the production of goods and services. Wealth is land and tangible assets. Wealth consists of tools, materials, equipment, and profit-generating assets. Wealth is bought with money. Wealth is also acquired by force and theft, by sovereign grants and deeds or by other unscrupulous means. “ To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures...” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:5] “ No State shall...make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts...” —Constitution for the usA [1:10:1] What is a “Dollar?” A Dollar is a measure of weight defined by the Coinage Act of 1792 (first gold coin in America) and 1900 which is still in effect today. A “Dollar” specifies a certain quantity of gold or silver. The relative value of silver is tied to gold. In 1995, a Dollar is still 371.25 grains of silver in a 480 grain coin (one ounce). 4 ONE TRUE DOLLAR = 1/20th OUNCE OF GOLD = .999 TROY OUNCE OF SILVER As originally defined, a Dollar = 1/20th of an ounce of gold “money” (until it was devalued by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 to 1/35th of an ounce), or .999 troy ounce of silver “money.” Gold and silver was decided to be coined as money by the Constitution. The founding fathers of the united states decided that only gold or silver coins can be “money” in America. Real Money = Gold / Silver The power to coin real “money” in the united states of America has been relegated to the U.S. Congress and none other. We the People gave no lawful or constitutional authority to the U.S. Congress to operate or delegate private banking neither in the “Republic,” nor in the “Democracy.” Until 1913, We the People were our own bankers. We created wealth directly from the earth. We mined for the gold and silver and brought it to the U.S. government to mint into coinage. The U.S. government in turn kept 10% of the gold and silver as an excise tax to cover the cost of minting. - 99 -"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Before 1968, dimes and quarters were still coined in silver and spent into circulation. Pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars and Susan B. Anthony dollars are still spent into circulation (although they have no gold or silver in them), while all the money substitutes and paper currency (except U.S. Notes) are loaned into circulation. “ The importance of an honest, stable, gold money supply is to ensure that relative scarcity, demand and production efficiency of goods and services are accurately represented through their actual market prices. Prices are information.” —Boston T. Party 5 Paper Money Substitutes or Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) Since gold and silver coinage were heavy and inconvenient for a lot of transactions, the money was stored in safes in warehouse banks in lots of the old buildings. A warehouse receipt or certificate was issued as a money substitute to represent the gold or silver on deposit. People traded their warehouse receipts as money, or “currency.” They were akin to the gold and silver certificates that were once redeemable. The paper currency we presently use is NOT money, but a “money substitute.” Redeemable warehouse receipts or gold/silver certificates MUST promise to pay a dollar ($) equivalent in gold or silver money. Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) make NO such promises, and are NOT “money” by any stretch of the imagination. They are “corporation notes of undetermined value,” banker’s scrip, or barter paper. An FRN is a debt obligation of the federal United States government, a promissory note, a promise to “pay” the Federal Reserve Bank (in gold and silver) at an undisclosed time in the future. FRN’s are not “money.” 6 FRN’s are not lawful, constitutional money ($), but a fiat paper currency (Ø), legal tender or a money substitute. FRN’s are not federal because the Federal Reserve Bank is a privately owned corporation. There is no gold or silver, not even paper currency, held in reserve, and they are not a “note” because they cannot fulfill an unconditional promise to “pay” real money to the holder. A “Note” must contain the unconditional promise to “Pay to the Bearer on Demand.” > NOTE—an instrument containing an express and absolute promise of signer to pay to a specified person or order, or bearer, a definite sum of “money” at a specified time; an instrument that is a promise to pay other than a certificate of deposit. 7 FRN’s are “fraud reserve notes,” the commercial lien of a private corporation (i.e., commercial paper), a negotiable instrument and counterfeit security of the Federal Reserve Banking system. FRNs are unsigned checks written on a closed account of the U.S. government (closed since the bankruptcy of 1933). Money Substitute = FRNs = Ø It’s essential that we comprehend the distinction between real “money” being tangible wealth and substance, and a paper money substitute representing a debt. You cannot get rich, generate wealth or become econo- mically sovereign by accumulating money substitutes alone, anymore than you can get rich accumulating monopoly money. You will only get deeper into debt, and ultimately bank-rupt yourself if you do not understand these distinctions. You can though acquire these debt instruments and convert them into tangible substance, real money, property and wealth, providing you structure your legal sovereignty as well. For when we acquire property with FRN’s, we’re not acquiring it with real “money.” We’re not really buying it, thus it’s not our property if we’re still in the jurisdiction of the federal United States government corporation. Thus our property and FRN’s can be taken away by the lawful owner and trustee at their pleasure and discretion. We the People do not have any real “money ($),” nor are we buying or exchanging goods and services with real “money($),” nor are we accumulating wealth or assets. Those who have acquired lots of FRN’s in the bank have simply accumulated control and power over banker-created credit systems. Their assets are at risk if they do not understand the nature of money and who really owns and controls the property. It is NOT true wealth and sovereignty. Bill Gates may be the “richest” man in America according to Fortune 500, but he is rich valued in FRN’s, NOT in proper - ty he owns outright in his private and sovereign capacity. I would venture to guess that he doesn’t have a clue that his riches are being manipulated and controlled by other sovereign Power structures unknown to him, as are many otherwise successful individuals. Without sover-eignty, your riches are worthless tokens of your possibility. Most Americans have not been paid any real “money ($)” in their entire life. Consider this seriously. If you haven’t been paid any real “money,” then how can you “pay” your debts? You can’t! Now, do you comprehend why you feel broke (Ø)? You are poor, broke and starving for freedom. Now, do you understand why you are “bankrupt (Ø),” along with the rest of the country? You cannot “pay” debt with a debt-currency, not ever. You can only “discharge” debt (which is to delay the inevitable bankruptcy that awaits you). Wouldn’t you love to become economically sovereign and financially independence in law? - 100 -"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven Paper Money Substitutes or Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) “ Neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commodities. Intrinsically, a ‘dollar (Ø)’ bill is just a piece of paper (Ø). Deposits are merely book entries.” —Modern Money Mechanics Workbook, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (1975) 8 The right to create money (Ø) substitutes and paper currency of all kinds is reserved to the people. If you happen to be a banker, you’ve learned how to monopolize this right in conjunction with power-hungry governments and keep others from hoarding in on your cartel. But We the People also have the unalienable right to work, to contract, to create our own money substitutes in lieu of gold and silver if necessary (e.g., local scrips, Cascadia HOURS, time-dollars, barter/trade), and restore the gold and silver standard as well. 9 “ By a continuing process of inflation, government can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens... —John Maynard Keynes Whenever there is an increase of the supply of a money substitute (Ø) or paper currency in the economy without a corresponding increase in the gold/silver money ($) reserve, inflation occurs. Inflation is an invisible form of taxation that even the most responsible governments inflict on their Citizens. FRNs are an inflatable paper system designed to create debt through inflation (i.e., devaluation of currency). Inflation destroys your purchasing power over time. Inflation and unpayable debt transfers power and property to the sovereign Power structure that has no real interest in accumulating money substitutes.It’s the tangible assets, property, land, industrial capability and “real estate” that represent true wealth in the economy. Inflation = Invisible Taxation Over two-thirds of the total productivity of an entire nation is invisibly taxed through inflation inflicted on people at every level of the system. It is a conspiracy between the bankers and the governments to confiscate wealth and productivity to suit their own agendas and get We the People to pay the piper. 10 “ Every congressman, every senator, knows precisely what causes inflation... but can’t [won’t] support the drastic reforms to stop it [repeal of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913] because it could cost him his job.” —Robert A. Heinlein, Expanded Universe 11 The federal United States government corporation and the U.S. Congress has NOT ever been authorized by the Constitution to issue paper currency of any kind, but only to coin lawful money ($) of substance — gold or silver for the sovereign states and their respective Citizens. “ Congress had no authority to grant a private consortium of banks the monopoly privilege to create the nation’s currency.” —Boston T. Party 24 Powers not specifically granted by the Constitution are strictly forbidden and automatically denied. Today the Federal Reserve Bank and the international bankers have a monopoly over legal tender, the issuance of money sub- stitutes and paper currency in lieu of gold and silver. They run the largest counterfeiting operation the world has ever seen, “legally” protected by a renegade U.S. Congress and now bankrupt U.S. government corporation. “ To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States.” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:6] Their lust is for power and control, not money substitutes. They have plenty of real “money” already, in fact they control the world’s gold and silver reserves, and have created substitutes to patronize and control the masses into remaining productive economic slaves. Since the inception of centralized banking in Europe, these bankers have created wars for profit and controlled the fates of nations. 12 Introducing Debt Currency Circulation Every piece of paper currency in circulation was borrowed into circulation from the Federal Reserve Banking system with interest. It is a debt which can never be paid back except with our sweat, our labors, and ultimately our freedoms. We the People have unwittingly surrendered our lawful money system to the international bankers and accepted a fiat paper currency in lieu of money. This is the funda- mental act which has destroyed our once great nation. Global Economic Speculation Because every piece of paper currency in circulation incurs an escalating debt, the only way you can expand an economy is by expanding the amount of debt in circulation. Thus markets soar, currencies devalue, prices rise and speculation is the rallying cry on Wall Street. We are running our global economy like a casino-like gambling operation, and it is headed for collapse. History shall repeat itself ad nauseum. - 101 -"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ In the seventies, only 20% of all global investment and trade was speculative by nature, and 80% was directly related to the exchange of goods and services. By 1990, those figures had reversed. In 1993, only 5% of all global economic transactions were directly related to the exchange of goods and services.” —Wilfred Guth of the Deutsche Bank 33 Inflation is also created with “fractional reserve banking” and negotiable instruments such as “checks.” The illusion is presented that there’s a limited supply of money (Ø) and a significant “reserve (Ø)” must be kept on hand if a lot of people need cash at once. It simply ain’t so. The banker’s create fiat paper currency and electronic ledger entries from thin air. Commercial banks are nothing more than accounting divisions of the Federal Reserve Banking system. Fractional Reserve Banking Here’s how it works. Assume a “reserve requirement” of 10%, although it’s actually much lower than that number. The bank down the street needs to retain 10% (9:1) of your deposit on hand in case you want it back in paper currency or “cash.” When you deposit Ø1,000 in the bank, no sooner does it hit the cash box than you’ve created a Ø9,000 line of credit (Ø) that the bank can now loan to the guy in line behind you, OR invest in anything they desire (stocks, bonds, real estate) at prevailing rates of interest. That’s how commercial banks make “money” out of thin air (not by service charges or bounced check fees). Wouldn’t you like to be able to create money out of thin air? You’d go to jail for counterfeiting if you tried. The banks make a fortune from your ignorance. That’s why commercial banks compete for your deposits. The current fractional reserve requirements13 for commercial banks is 3% (33:1) for net accounts under Ø29.8 million and 0% for accounts of corporations on time deposits of 1 & 1/2 years or more. Today, deposit Ø1,000 in the bank and you’ve created an instant credit line of Ø33,333 for the bank. This is an extremely profitable business for the banks, even if you default on the loans and credit cards! If you bounce a check (Ø), you pay a bounced check fee. If the banks write a bad check (Ø), they call it a “loan (Ø).” You exchange one promissory note for another. Do you still wonder why the banks keep getting richer and richer? Do you still wonder why all the big buildings downtown have the name of various commercial banks on them? Because We the People haven’t wised up to these basic economic facts of life. 14 In the chart on the opposite page, if banks had actually been loaning real “money” the total debt would be less than Ø200 billion. According to the chart, there were over Ø6 trillion of bad checks in circulation in 1985 which created all this public and private debt. This debt curve is growing exponentially today. This is check kiting, fraud, racketeering, counterfeiting, and a lawful basis for repudiating private, public and federal debt. Do you understand what a criminal enterprise the Federal Reserve Bank and their cronies in government are running? 15 The Federal Reserve Bank controls the money supply, interest rates, and movement (i.e., velocity) of FRN’s has everybody fooled (except you and me). They have access to an unlimited supply of FRN’s, paying only for the printing costs of what they need. Checks and ledger entries of credits and debits total 95% of all deposits and transfers. Securities, bonds, mortgages and stocks compose most of the hard assets that banks presently own. Money Supply Interest Rates Velocity The Federal Reserve Bank can increase or decrease the “reserve” requirements at will. Therefore, a “run on the bank” could not happen as it did in the past. They simply print as much paper currency as they need to retain control. The reason for the reserve requirements at all is to regulate the greed and larceny of the member banks and to maintain a certain level of quality in their investment portfolios. 16 FRNs are nothing more than promissory notes for U.S. Treasury securities (Tbills)—a promise to “pay” the debt to the Federal Reserve Bank (in gold or silver). Have you ever borrowed money to consolidate debt only to discover that you became more indebted than before? You didn’t “pay” the debt but only reorganized for future discharge. Our financial lives are reduced to managing debt and making money to service an ever growing liability, both private and public. This is economic slavery! “ [Every circulating FRN] represents a one dollar debt to the Federal Reserve System” There is a fundamental difference between “paying ($)” and “discharging (Ø)” a debt. To “pay” a debt, you must pay with value or substance (i.e. gold, silver, barter or a commodity). With FRNs, you can only “discharge” a debt. You cannot pay a debt with a debt currency system. Pay or Discharge Debt? You cannot service a debt with a currency that has no backing in value or substance. Also, there is no valid or lawful contract under the Common law unless it involves an exchange of “good & valuable consideration (i.e., real money).” We are dealing in “counterfeit” currencies issued by a global cartel. We are bankrupting ourselves and our children into economic slavery!

The net result of the Federal Reserve System is a devalued dollar (Ø0.20 dollar in 1994 compared to 1964) predicted to drop to Ø0.03 before the year 2000), hidden inflation that taxes the future earnings of future generations (53% total tax rate in 1994), a constant decline in personal income for 12 consecutive years during the Reagan-Bush Administration, an un-payable federal deficit (Ø4.6 trillion in 1995) and accelerating exponential debt curve, and the transfer of all the property and assets of the American people to the international bankers. 18 “ The Federal Reserve Debt Note system was established by Congress under its ‘District’ powers because the Constitution required a gold or silver standard.” —International Tax Technologies > ECONOMIC SLAVERY—total loss of control over your financial affairs; working for no reward, no “money,” no substance, no asset accumulation; working for a master you cannot see; unknowingly surrendering your property and assets to public indebtedness; invisible and undeclared bankrupt- cies; are you prepared to be bankrupt at age 62? National and state constitutions prohibited the issuing of foreign bills of exchange (i.e., FRN’s), or making anything but gold or silver a tender in the payment of debts. It was an important check and balance against the encroachment of foreign money traders in the republic. Federal law prohibits creating credit money from nothing, although it happens every time a bank issues a credit card. Their total investment is the cost of the stamp and the plastic. You pay back the principle with interest. So what has happened? Why do We the People continue to allow this grand theft to occur, in broad daylight, without taking a stand for the constitutional republic, and our own sovereign rights? “ No State shall...make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts...” —Constitution for the usA [1:10:1] Lawful, constitutional and honest United States money is coined or printed in a redeemable currency by the U.S. Treasury and spent into circulation by the Federal government. Lawful money is either gold or silver coins, or currency backed by gold and silver that has been certified deposited in the Department of the Treasury and payable to the bearer on demand (i.e. U.S. Gold Certificates from 1863-1934, U.S. Silver Certificates from 18861963). Federal Reserve Notes redeemable in lawful money at the Department of the Treasury Federal Reserve Bank (1934-1963), or United States Notes spent into circulation by the Federal government (e.g., JFK’s $2 bill was interest-free). International Banking Cartel The federal United States adhered to its constitutional imperative, the law and public policy of a strict gold standard until 1933. Attempts at recreating a centralized National Bank, similar to what had been established in Europe, had failed consistently from the founding of the republic until the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The American people, for the most part, had become quite wealthy without a centralized National Bank and were hard to convince they needed one. Artificially created bank panics (e.g.,1857, 1873, 1893, 1907) were foisted on the American people to create the appearance of a problem that would eventually discredit the existing decentralized banking system, and open the door of public opinion to support a centralized one. This was orchestrated by the large, international banking interests (e.g., J.P. Morgan, Paul Warburg, Rothchilds) who wanted a central National Bank in America under their control. The international bankers wanted to wear down America’s tolerance towards uncoordinated banking activities and their reliance on gold-backed, and silver-backed currency so the federal government would eventually intervene to “save the day.” Whenever credit expanded too quickly at the discretion of bankers, beyond the limits of the gold reserves, interest rates rose sharply, new credit was not available, and the economy went into a sharp, but short recession. Governments gave up all attempts to coin or control mon-ey in the 19th century, not because they were incapable or i ncompetent, but mostly because they didn’t trust each other. International banks orchestrated this mistrust, stepped in-to this vacuum to solve the problem, and by demonstra-ting more fiscal responsibility (on the surface) than governments had, became the economic masters in the modern world. “ Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.” —James A. Garfield “ I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. - 103 -"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.” —Thomas Jefferson To maximize their profits and control, the international bankers needed a scheme that would allow banks to loan money indefinitely, and without restrictions on the gold or silver reserves. Senator Nelson Aldrich (R-RI), under the guise of banking reform for the money trust, and the National Citizens League for the Promotion of a Sound Banking System, a front organization for the international bankers, had every intention of pawning off a privately controlled central bank on an unsuspecting America. They needed a “legal” cartel that would allow them to inflate the currency and expand the economy indefinitely and reap all the rewards themselves. Thus they “conspired,” in secret, to establish the Federal Reserve System in partnership with the federal government. This is well documented in G. Edward Griffin’s seminal work, “ Creature from Jekyll Island” . 19 > CONSPIRACY—to breathe together. So Senator Aldrich, Abraham Andrew, Frank Vanderlein, Henry Davidson, Charles Worten, Benjamin Strong and Paul Warburg met at Jekyll Island, a resort island off the East Coast, to author the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and strategize how to get the U.S. Congress to approve it under the noses of the President and the American people. These men gathered together represented over one-fourth of the wealth of the entire world. “ [One of the most important aspects in achieving communist control is the] centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a [centralized] national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.” —Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto Federal Reserve Banking System The Federal Reserve System is based on the Canon law and the principles of sovereignty guaranteed in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. In fact, the international bankers used a “Canon Law Trust” as their model, adding stock and naming it a “Joint Stock Trust.” The U.S. Congress had passed a law making it illegal for any legal “person” to duplicate a “Joint Stock Trust” in 1873. The Federal Reserve Act was legislated post-facto (to 1870), although post-facto laws are strictly forbidden by the Constitution [1:9:3]. “ This [Federal Reserve Act] establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President [Wilson] signs this bill the invisible government of the Monetary Power will be legalized...the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.” — Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr. (1913) The Federal Reserve System is a sovereign Power structure separate and distinct from the federal United States government. The Federal Reserve is a maritime lender and insurance underwriter to the federal United States operating exclusively under Admiralty/Maritime law. The lender or underwriter bears the risks, and the Maritime law compelling specific performance in paying the interest, or premiums are the same. Assets of the debtor can also be hypothecated as security by the lender or underwriter. The Federal Reserve Act stipulated that the interest on the debt was to be paid in gold. There was no stipulation in the Federal Reserve Act for ever paying the principle. The Federal Reserve Act was never challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction, which would be Admiralty / Maritime. The Federal Reserve System is independent of the U.S. Congress, doesn’t file a tax return or pay any taxes, has never been audited, is not subject to Title 5, U.S.C., or to the scrutiny of the General Accounting Office (GAO), nor has it ever filed statements of assets on any information form for the government. It is a private “Joint Stock Trust.” [Editor’s Note: Eric Madsen asserts that it is a corporation.] There is nothing “federal” about the Federal Reserve Banking System as it is not part of the government. There is nothing on “reserve.” It gives the appearance of a “system” to distribute power from Wall Street, but in essence the power is centralized. It is not even a “bank” as they are not dealing with real “money.” The stated mission of the Federal Reserve Banking System was to stabilize banking, but if you analyze their track record, it has not achieved their stated objectives. I assert it was never their objective in the first place. It did though, achieve the cessation of private capital formation in the hands of We the People and centralized it in the hands of the international banking cartels. “ Federal Reserve bonds, including the capital stock and surplus therein and the income there-from, shall be exempt from federal, state and local taxation, except taxes upon real estate.” —12 U.S.C. 531 The Federal Reserve Act was passed over a Christmas vaca - tion (December 22, 1913) with ten members in session. Hardly a quorum by any stretch of the imagination. The rest of the U.S. Congress was adjourned for the holi - days. Most Americans, the U.S. Congress and the President had been fooled by a well-orchestrated propaganda and me - dia campaign into believing that the bankers and the money trust on Wall Street were opposed to this legislation. Thus as a knee-jerk reaction and clever manipulation, We the People walked into a well-designed trap and supported the Federal Reserve Act despite its lack of quorum.

I do not like to think that any law can be passed that will make it possible to submerge the gold standard in a flood of irredeemable paper currency.” —Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr. (1913) Before 1913, most Americans owned their own land, sovereign “allodial title” to property, free and clear of any liens, encumbrances or “mortgages.” There weren’t conventional “mortgages” with banks whereby you’d pay for a piece of property three-times over the course of thirty years (another not so subtle property confiscation scheme as a result of the Federal Reserve Act). You simply acquired land by assignment with a “Bill of Sale,” paid for it with gold or silver, updated the land patent or allodial title and received the true, lawful title and ownership to land. Property was also NOT registered or recorded via a “deed.” Then the Federal Reserve Act (1913) “hypothecated” all property within the federal United States to the Board of Governors, or “Trustees” of the Federal Reserve Banking cartel. In any Trust, the Trustees held legal title and ownership and have control over the assets on behalf of a third party (i.e., beneficiaries). > HYPOTHECATE —to pledge something as a security without taking possession of it. “Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.” —Mayer Amschel Bauer Under the terms of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve Banking system agreed to extend the federal United States government all the credit (i.e., money substitute) it needed to expand the operations of the United States corporation. Like any other debtor, the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan. Since the federal United States government didn’t have any significant assets, except a small modicum of public property, they “hypothecated (i.e., assigned, transferred)” the private property of their “economic slaves”, the U.S. citizens, as collateral (i.e., security) against the soon to be un-payable federal debt. The federal United States government, along with their principals/creditors, needed a contractual nexus to lure more and more sovereign “state” Citizens into their jurisdiction, so as to expand the pool of property they could legally attach and lien. Manufacturing wars, recessions, depressions, and finally luring most Americans into the Social Security Act did the job. The U.S. government also pledged the unincorporated feder - al territories, national parks and forests (e.g., clear-cutting is simply a policy of debt reduction), birth certificates, for- profit and non-profit corporations, as collateral as well. Thus the creation of an income tax to pay the interest on this debt. [Editor’s Note: This particular income tax on corporations was effectively repealed by the Internal Revenue Act of November 23rd, 1921.] 21 “ The regional Federal Reserve Banks are not government agencies. ...but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.” —Lewis vs. United States, 680 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1982) The Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) is a very private foreign entity held by a cartel of international bankers. The FRB can sue and be sued in the name of the entity. Each FRB carries its own liability insurance. Each FRB conducts activities without any direction from the federal government. Each FRB pays local property taxes and postage (evidence of private ownership). Each FRB has listings in the telephone book, not under government headings. The beneficial interest of the FRB is held by four foreign banks and four U.S. banks who are now completely controlled by international bankers. These banks are: 22 1. Rothschild Bank of London and Berlin (52%) 2. Lazard Freres Bank of Paris (8%) 3. Israel Moses Seif Bank of Italy (8%) 4. Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam (8%) 5.

The following is a quote from his famous address to Congress in 1934. “ Mr. Chairman, we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, hereinafter called the Fed. The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation's debt. The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over. This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of these United States, has bankrupted itself, and has practically bankrupted our Government. It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates, through the mis-application of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.

From the time of the Civil War until the Federal Reserve Act many Americans, particularly in the South, had already giv - en up their sovereignty. Over the course of the next twenty-five years, American Na - tionals OR “state” Citizens from the North would also sur - render their sovereignty and become tenants, residents, franchisees and U.S. citizens. They would unwittingly contract into the jurisdiction of the federal United States government corporation via the Social Security Act and other adhesion contracts. Americans surrendered their sovereign “state” Citizenship by registering themselves voluntarily as “beneficiaries” of this “Joint Stock Trust” via his/her Birth Certificate (which is an unrevealed Trust instrument placing you in commerce with the federal United States). By 1933, the federal United States government, in collaboration and conspiracy with the Federal Reserve Banking system and its foreign principals/creditors, had “hypothecated” all of the present and future properties, assets, and labor of their newly regis - tered “subjects”— U.S. citizens. In 1934, the Federal Reserve Bank confiscated all the gold of the American people with the assistance of Franklin D. Roo - sevelt (FDR). By 1998, every asset not held “in allodium” has been as - signed and transferred as payment to the international bankers against the unpayable federal debt. 21 Unwittingly, America has returned to its pre-American Revolution, feudal roots whereby all land and property is held by a sovereign Power structure (e.g., the international banks as Sovereign instead of the King of England) and the common people (i.e., U.S. citizens) have no rights to hold allodial title or own property outright. Once again, We the People are reduced to tenants and sharecroppers “renting” property from a Sovereign in the guise of the Federal Reserve Bank. We the People have exchanged one master for another. History repeats itself ad nauseum. “ If Congress has the right [it doesn’t] to issue paper money [currency], it was given to them to be used by... [the government] and not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.” —President Andrew Jackson, Vetoed Bank Bill of 1836 Irrelevant Economic Dialectic [Editor’s Note: Thanks to Mark Evans for his research and wisdom in these matters, especially his research into the works of Congressman Charles Lindbergh who had a serious handle on sustainable economics.] Since the Bolshevik Revolution, a phony dialectic has dominated the minds of economists — that of Capitalism versus Communism. Nowadays we are still reeling under the presumptions of the remnants of that false dialectic as the two orthodox schools of economics — the Keynesian and Monetarist dominate world finances. Keynes dictates the functions of the World Bank/IMF while Monetarism rules at the Bank of International Settlements, the international central bank of the Group of Ten. Progressives have missed the point, according to Mark Evans, writing in Flatland Magazine. The issue that should have been getting attention all along is “the struggle between the sovereign right of the people, collectively, to create and control their own credit, and the paid political hirelings who have always served the vested interests of the banks and plutocracy...” Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution for the United States says, \"Congress shall have the power to coin money, and to regulate the value thereof, and also, of foreign coin,\" Mr. Evans says this vital clause was never fully put into effect and Thomas Jefferson also had some regrets about the matter. He wrote that his great regret about the Constitution was that it did not include a clause stating specifically that Congress had the power specifically to monetize paper. It was an advantage the colonists enjoyed for a time and Benjamin Franklin wrote that the Revolution was fought because the Crown suspended the rights of the colonies to print colonial scrip. Mr. Evans says that the much maligned and misunderstood Congressman Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Sr., (1859-1924) who based his radical economic theory on the Constitution, had broken away from the standard economic rhetoric shaping the world in the early 1900s. He believes Congressman Lindbergh was probably approaching a “simultaneously democratic and constitutional” solution. This is evidenced by the campaign to suppress his work, according to Evans.

Total debt per capita is Ø13,000 (1990) compared with $131 debt per capita (1930). An average of Ø61,000 debt per family (assuming 75 million families). Interest on the debt alone was Ø1.69 trillion, which was 21% of total federal outlays (1990). 26 The Federal Reserve Bank is holding the federal United States government, our elected representatives and the American people hostage through its credit and monetary policies. Those who control the “buck” control the government. Did you ever believe it was different? The temptation for our government to borrow and spend more and more, raise taxes and exponentially increase the debt obligation for all Americans, is tantamount to trea-son. Yet, it goes on and on and We the people stand for it. The federal United States government has been bankrupt numerous times since 1933. Yet our elected representatives cannot even seriously address the issue of balancing the budget. It is all lip-service. It is not even possible to balance the budget in an unsustainable, debt-based economy without eliminating the cause of debt — the Federal Reserve Banking system. The only way to expand or grow an economy in a debt-based economy is to expand and grow the debt. Economic Growth = Economic Slavery Each time the U.S. Congress authorizes a budget and raises the debt ceiling, which is prima facie evidence of the federal bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve Bank has the authority to deny credit to the government by simply not buying the bonds. 27 Prior to the Federal Reserve Act, the federal government had to sell U.S. bonds to the people to fund the operations of government. The government also traded one master (the people) for another (the international bankers). Now, the Federal Reserve Bank has the power to close the doors of the federal government at will by denying credit. That’s a lot of power in the hands of foreign bankers. “ The Federal Reserve System was founded primarily to serve the special interests of certain highly organized, politically influential groups within the banking industry. The [Seven Member] Board of Governors is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but five of the twelve members of the Federal Open Market Committee representing the regional Federal Reserve Banks dictate our country’s monetary policy and are controlled by private, commercial banks. Thus private banks, serving special interests, control or influence public policy as to the money that everyone in the United States uses.” —National Alliance for Constitutional Money Unlike the federal government, state governments are constitutionally required to balance their budgets and accept no foreign bills of exchange, although they have been failing to do that for a long time. Remember, today the “States” are not sovereign nor are they republics. They are simply subsidiaries or political subdivisions of the federal corporation and are following in their stead. \\So long as our U.S. government is doing the bidding of the sovereign Power structures, via the Federal Reserve Bank and its principles/creditors (i.e., International Monetary Fund), then the Federal Reserve Bank has been more than willing to “lend (i.e., create from thin air)” the federal U.S. government more and more fiat (i.e., fake) “money (Ø).” Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) are a paper currency, a money substitute, a negotiable instrument, and is manufactured from ink and paper, or moreso these days it’s created electronically. “Money” is nothing more than a incredibly orchestrated lie and fiction we still believe. How much longer will the fools borrow themselves into economic slavery? 28 “ Banks lend by creating credit. They create the means of payment out of nothing.” —Ralph M. Hawtrey, Secretary of the British Treasury “ When you or I write a check (Ø) there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover that check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a check (Ø) there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money (Ø) [irredeemable currency].” —Putting It Simply, Boston Federal Reserve Bank Although the Federal Reserve Note (FRN)(Ø), henceforth referred to as “Ø,” is the keystone of the unsustainable, debt- based and struggling American economy, few people understand or even care to understand how it actually works. Every FRN or Ø placed into circulation burdens the entire society with an ever growing mountain of public and private debt. Every FRN or Ø borrowed by the federal United States government MUST be repaid, and can NEVER be repaid to the Federal Reserve Bank and its foreign principles / creditors. FRN’s (Ø) are “unlawful” money under the state (no foreign bills of exchange) and federal (only gold and silver coin are - 107 -"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook money) constitutions. Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) create not only debt, but interest and usury that results in perpetual economic slavery for most of our Citizens. Debt money systems are the primary instruments through which property is confiscated for “communistic” purposes. The political result is the usurpation of free republics, the erecting of false democracies and the destruction of sovereignty and basic human rights worldwide. “ The Federal Reserve System pays the U.S. Treasury Ø20.60 per thousand notes— a little over 2 cents each—without regard to the face value of the note. Federal Reserve Notes, incidentally, are the only type of currency now produced for circulation. They are printed exclusively by the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and the Ø20.60 per thousand price reflects the Bureau’s full cost of production. Federal Reserve Notes are printed in Ø1, Ø2, Ø5, Ø10, Ø20, Ø50 and Ø100 denominations only; notes of Ø500, Ø1000, Ø5000, and Ø10,000 denominations were last printed in 1945.” —Donald J. Winn, Assistant to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 30 Money created from nothing yields inflation. Prices don't go up, but the value of currency goes down. Inflation is a hidden tax. Your purchasing power is continually being reduced. So who acquired your lost purchasing power? The government (i.e., corporation), commercial banks and borrowers. So who gets the most value — those who get the fresh money first. Here’s how fiat “money” is created from thin air. Congress needs Ø1 billion for some worthless, pork-barreled project sponsored by a few high-ranking Senators who want to stay in office. Congress authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury to print bills or bonds as a loan to the government. This is called “monetizing the debt.” 1) the funding starts in U.S. Congress by borrowing U.S. bonds and U.S. Treasury notes. 2) if the U.S. Congress can't borrow enough Treasury notes, an officer goes to Federal Reserve, who pulls out a checkbook, writes a “check” from a checkbook for Ø1 billion from an account with nothing in it. 3) U.S. Government puts the “check” into their account and starts writing “checks” to pay government workers. 4) for example, the U.S. Government writes a “check” to a postal worker who deposits Ø100 into a check-ing account in a neighborhood, commercial bank. 5) commercial bank puts the Ø100 into the banks reserve account and loans out Ø900 to its customers (fractional reserve banking) 6) the bank has created the $900 from thin air from the deposit of $100 OR, Ø1 billion created for the government yields Ø9 billion for the commercial banks plus yields interest (on nothing) for the bank and taxes for the government (i.e., corporation) 31 The Treasury prints Ø1 billion worth of FRNs at the cost of Ø0.02, each regardless of denomination. The Treasury walks down the hall to the Federal Reserve Bank and offers to sell them for Ø0.02 each, regardless of denomination. The Federal Reserve Bank then walks down the same hall, writes a check from an empty account for Ø1 billion, and loans the money back to the federal United States government at face value plus interest. The government then writes checks and puts the Ø1 billion in circulation. Ø’s are created when a loan is made and interest collected and security or collateral is posted. The interest is on nothing given, nothing borrowed, nothing taken except from thin air. For every FRN or Ø in circulation the federal debt + interest grows exponentially (e.g., estimated at Ø15 trillion including entitlements and future obligations). We the People have incurred this federal debt plus interest at rates set by the Federal Reserve Bank because we’ve been asleep at the wheel and forgotten who we are. Remember, We the people are the sovereigns, NOT the international banks, NOT the U.S. government! Investment Recommendations for Getting Out of Debt 1. Make a decision that you’re going to get out of debt and strive for economic sovereignty and financial inde - pendence. Make a decision that you are willing to reor - ganize every aspect of your life, including your busi - ness, job or occupation to achieve this goal. Know that you are the master over government, and not a slave or subject. Learn the transitional tools necessary to move from where you are to where you want to be. Stop sending your hard-earned funds to a government that wastes them and uses them for destructive purposes. - 108 -"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven Investment Recommendations for Getting Out of Debt 2. Engage in free-enterprise activity that is enjoyable and matches your skills, talents and aspirations. Establish several non-domestic and foreign entities with offshore banking to do business. Begin to move out of the adhesion contracts that have kept you in bondage with the government. Generate wealth and prosperity from your hard work and productivity. Invest your profits directly to generate more wealth. Take a portion of your surplus funds and contribute in a socially responsible fashion in your community. 3. Tear up your credit cards, stop borrowing and pur - chasing items you don’t have the funds for. Discipline yourself to live within your means, and not on the backs of another’s productivity. 4. Position a portion of your assets (e.g., 50%) safely off - shore in foreign entities, either Trusts, IBC’s or S.A.’s. Invest a small portion of the debt-based currency in various national currencies (e.g., Swiss francs). Invest a larger portion in precious metals (e.g., gold or silver, rare coins), before any currency exchange is instituted in the United States and the blocking of the domestic currency occurs. 5. British Sterling denominated mutual funds are a good investment. Watch China and the growing giant of an economic power. They have used gold as a store of val - ue since the beginning of time and have not changed their behavior pattern. Buy gold or hard currencies. To strengthen the U.S. Dollar on foreign markets, the federal government will have to convert gold at any - where from $700 to $20,000 per ounce. 6. Get out of bond portfolios or mutual funds investing in bonds or derivatives. Derivatives have been able to absorb the increasing debt issued by the government, only while the interest rates were coming down. Now with interest rates on the rise (5.8% to 7.5%), the derivative markets can no longer sell these products. Thus the Fed will have to create massive amounts of money out of thin air to continue the deficit spending. This means inflation, which will depreciate the value of the bonds at an even faster rate, and increase com - modity prices. Placing values on bond portfolios has become impossible. The trend for stocks is also down. 7. Beware of mutual funds investing in long-term bonds. Because the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has no interest in policing the investments of money fund operators, and the mutual fund companies have misrepresented their funds by investing in long-term debt instead of staying in short-term cash instruments, many have resulted in illiquid portfolios and the recog - nition of large losses. 8. Beware of U.S. based foreign currency denominated bank accounts which are not protected from a currency devaluation, and also supply feedback to the Fed as to how fast the pressure is building against the currency internally. Invest outside the control of the Federal Re - serve and the New World Order central banks. 9. Set up self-reliance on land and property paid for in full and protected from foreclosures or other sudden downturns in the economy. For sovereign “state” Citizens, update your land patents. Get the titles out of “Your Name” and into non-domestic or foreign entities. Provide basic needs for your family, friends and com - munity, including water, medical, seeds and food stor - age for 2 years of austerity measures. Set-up solar, battery-based radio communications and other alternative, self-sufficient energy systems before the collapse of your buying power and the food supply system. 10. Avoid highly speculative investments or casino-style gambling. It’s a corruption of the soul to squander your wealth in hopeless ventures. Your chances of getting hit by lightening is five times greater than winning the lottery. 11. IRA’s can be liquidated early. Author your own re- demption letter. Do not authorize withholding 30%. Handle yourself at end of the tax year. Do not withhold 10% penalty for early withdrawal as funds are being used for a mental illness (do not speci - fy which one.) Get a signature guarantee (from a bro - ker), not notarized. 12. Invest in companies such as Stirling Energy Systems with the exclusive licenses and patents for solar-hydro - gen technology, grid-type systems for producing 25,000 kW of electricity direct from the sun. These systems can be hybridized with other fuels and con - nected on or off the existing grid. Private issue of stock available. Begins manufacturing in 1999. 13. Purchase the products and seminars offered by the In - stitute for Communications Resources (ICR), an asso - ciation of free-enterprisers worldwide committed to sovereignty education and financial independence for its members. Many offshore investments are offered with a vision for an infrastructure for sovereignty and freedom worldwide. These include access to gold and silver, rare coins, intra-day trading in the global markets, leveraging a $1 billion portfolio to move the markets, private placement of capital and asset allocation. 32 - 109 -"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources MONEY 1.

We are here now in Chapter 11. Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any bankrupt entity in world history, the U.S. government.\" —James Traficant, Jr. (D-Ohio) addressing the House on Wednesday, March 17, 1993 —United States Congressional Record, Volume #33, page H1303 1 Since the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the federal United States government has continued to borrow and spend without limit or accountability. It took only 20 years (1913—1933) for our power-hungry, money-crazy elected representatives in the U.S. Congress, the supposed guardians of the American republic, to bankrupt the federal United States government and sell out the united states of America. So much for politicians. Has anything changed? In 1933, the federal United States government declared bankruptcy by Presidential Proclamation #2039, issued March 6, 1933, and #2040 issued March 9, 1933, temporarily suspending banking transactions by member banks of the Federal Reserve System. Normal banking functions were resumed on March 13, 1933 subject to certain restrictions. These Presidential Proclamations took effect after President Roosevelt’s declaration of a national state of emergency pursuant to Executive Orders # 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260 (see Senate Report 93-549, pp. 187, 594; 5 U.S.C.A§903) under Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, codified 12 U.S.C. 95a; House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 1933; confirmed in Perry vs. U.S. (1933), 294 U.S. 330-381 and 31 U.S.C. 5112, 5119. 2 The Federal Reserve foreclosed on the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1933 and demanded all the gold ($) to satisfy the interest payment on the debt obligations already incurred. On June 5, 1933, the U.S. Congress enacted House Joint Resolution 192 to suspend the gold standard. 3 “ Whereas the holding or dealing in gold affects the public interest, and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction; and whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the oblige (Federal Reserve) a right to require payment in gold.” —House Joint Resolution 192 The U.S. Department of the Treasury was emptied, all the gold in Fort Knox was removed, and every state republic in the Union went bankrupt as well by pledging their good faith and credit (i.e., your future productivity) to aid the national government. The Federal Reserve Bank directed President Franklin D. Roosevelt to declare a state of national emergency and prohibit the private ownership of gold ($) within the federal United States. The American people were ordered to deliver their gold to the nearest Federal Reserve Bank. Although, by law, this Executive Order applied only to U.S. citizens, most people complied (as they didn’t know any better) and handed over their real money ($) in exchange for a paper money substitute (Ø). So if you wonder why you don’t have any “money” it’s because you were robbed in broad daylight and didn’t even notice. Since HJR 192, the American people have not been able to lawfully “pay” a debt. You can only exchange and transfer debt from one party to another which is what we do when we exchange FRN’s. The debt can never be paid off. It is perpetual, growing exponentially and lasting forever (until bankruptcy do us part). The suspension of the gold standard and an emergency prohibition against the payment of debts, also removed the “substance” from the Common law thus effecting the entire legal system as well. The substance of lawful consideration was replaced with the “National Public Credit System” where debt money (FRNs) was used as legal tender to “discharge” debts instead of real “money.” Perpetual debt belongs exclusively to an Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction and an International contract compelling performance. Thus the Common law was also suspended, as there was no money to consummate any action in law. Note that the court “excepted” matters governed by the Constitution and acts of Congress from being governed by state laws. “ Except in matters governed by the federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state...there is no general federal Common law.” —Erie R.R. vs. Thompkins, 304 US 64 (1938) 4 The “principal/creditor” in the fashioning of the “federal Common law” is the “Admiral” himself, enlarging his powers over the republic and jurisdiction over the land as a result of the public policy declared in HJR 192. The limited liability for payment of perpetual debt falls under the federal law merchant and the law of Admiralty because of the subject matter, and the nature of the cause of the action. 5 Thus, the state and federal constitutions, and/or Common “law of the land” has yielded to the Admiralty/Maritime “law of the sea.” The “Admiral,” and whomever he personifies, has become King. The CEO has become King. The sovereignty of the united states of America has been effectively and invisibly transferred to the foreign principals/creditors of the federal United States. - 113 -"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ If we don’t change our direction, we’re likely to end up where we’re headed.” —Chinese Proverb When the brave Congressman Louis T. McFadden stood up to the mighty bankers and legislators, and brought impeachment charges against them, the indictments were buried in Committee and never reported to the House floor. Later he was believed to have been poisoned for daring to tell the truth. Few of our elected representatives Washing- ton D.C. have dared tell the truth since. The federal United States government is perpetually bankrupt. Our children will inherit this un-payable debt, and the tyranny to enforce it. 7 The American people not only lost their gold in 1933, but were paid only Ø.59 on the Dollar in worthless paper currency (Ø) when they exchanged it. The U.S. supreme Court upheld President Roosevelt’s policies due to his threatening to reorganize the judicial branch despite the Administration’s clearly unconstitutio- nal acts. The Constitution and the Common law was gone, and the monied powers of the international bankers were firmly in charge. The Banking Act of 1935 established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), booted out the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency and finally decreed that all profits of the Federal Reserve Bank would be retained by the Federal Reserve Banks. The federal United States government has been bankrupt, financially, legally and morally ever since. Had you seen the writing on the wall, would you have acted? 8 Instead of correcting this horrible mistake by repealing the Federal Reserve Act, or challenging its constitutionality, the U.S. Congress, and our elected representatives have coward - ly continued to confiscate the property and income of the American people through excise and income taxes, social se - curity taxes, probate and inheritance taxes, inflationary monetary policies, seizures, forfeitures, condemnation, mali - cious prosecution, bankruptcy proceedings, and outright grand theft. The U.S. Congress continues to borrow and squeeze until it hurts the American people, then they borrow some more. Every time they raise the debt ceiling in the U.S. Congress, a piece of the country and a bit more of the future is handed over to the foreign principles/creditors. Both Republicans and Democrats have perpetrated this policy to this very day. All this lip service about balancing the budget is great political positioning, but it cannot be done in a debt-based currency system. Whether seven (Republican) or twelve (Democrats) years, it’s too little, too late to avoid the collapse of the American economy and way of life. The true cost of funding this federal U.S. government shopping spree and the international banking cartel, at public expense, has been the sovereignty of the united states of America, our lawful sovereign “state” Citizenship, the integrity of our justice system and the loss of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. \"I have never seen more senators express discontent with their jobs...I think the major cause is that, deep down in our hearts, we have been accomplices in doing something terrible and un-forgivable to this wonderful country. Deep down in our heart, we know that we have given our children a legacy of bankruptcy. We have defrauded our country to get ourselves elected.\" —John Danforth (R-Missouri) 9 When the federal United States government, or any corpo- ration or government, becomes bankrupt, it transfers its sovereignty to its creditors/principals. As a bankrupt entity, the federal United States govern-ment has no power or authority to initiate civil or criminal actions against anyone. No bankrupt entity can issue credit or make loans. All government loans, supposed benefits and charity is a fraud. The entire constitutional court system is suspended, and replaced with military tribunals operating under Admiralty / Maritime law. Consequently, the power and authority of the entire federal United States government resides in the soverei-gnty of its principles/creditors, the Federal Reserve Bank, and its principles the International Monetary Fund (IMF). All courts, federal and State, are convened in bankruptcy proceedings against the citizens of the United States, suing via the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in an Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction. 10 “ A banker is a man who will loan you money if you can prove you don’t need it.” —Mark Twain Reorganization of the Federal United States Inc. Editor’s Note: When the Emergency and WarPowers Acts are lifted all Federal Reserve Banks will cease to operate. In 1995, the law forbids member banks of the Federal Reserve System to transact banking business except under regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, during an emergency proclaimed by the President (12 U.S.C.A§95). The CFR Parallel Index of Rules and Authorities, which begins on page 751 of the 1995 Index to the Federal Code of Regulations, demonstrates that the Federal Reserve System has always been an agency of the self-interested or geographical United States and has never had legitimate authority applicable to the state republics and the population at large. The only published regulation which supports 12 USC §95a, section 5(b) of the “Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917” - 114 -"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter Eight Reorganization of the Federal United States Inc. pertains to customs; the other under Title 31 is held in reserve, and there is no regulatory application for Congress' approval of emergency powers granted to the executive via 12 USC §95(b). Likewise there are no regulations applicable to the state republics for the statute which authorizes federally chartered financial institutions to monetize public and private assets with ledger-book creation of debt (12 USC §101), and there is no regulation extending the Federal Reserve note as legal tender for payment of debt to the state republics (12 USC §§411 & 412). This is further verified by regulations pertaining to federal tax and loan depositaries at 31 CFR §202 et seq. United States-chartered financial institutions traffic exclusively in “public money,” which is treated extensively in Chapter 10 of Title 31, United States Code. By definition, public money is obligations of the United States which can legally be in the custody of agencies of the United States and officers, agents and employees of United States agencies. [Editor's Note: This supports the theory that any use of Federal Reserve Notes indicates an adhesion contract that ties one's Citizenship to the federal system.] 11 The passage of Public Law 90-269 (March 18, 1968) declared that the Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) you carry around in your pocket are not redeemable. The passage of Public Law 95-147, 91 Stat. 1227 (October 28, 1977) declared that all American banking institutions, including State banks, were under the control and direction of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 12 Furthermore, the Act further declared that section 10(a) of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 is amended by striking out the phrase “stabilizing the exchange value of the dollar.” Furthermore, the Act states that the Joint Resolution to assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States shall not apply to obligations of the United States issued after the date of enactment. Therefore, the international organizations, corporations and associations who had refused to pay their debts determined they could pass the loss of their non-redeemable, noncurrent notes, bonds and other evidences of debt to others, and therefore crown the fraud of the money trust with success. Several recent U.S. District court decisions have placed the entire U.S. banking system into receivership which is more prima facie evidence of bankruptcy. During the New Deal (1933), when banks were first federalized, they did not register with the Secretaries of each respective Union state. Therefore every commercial, American bank has been operating illegally since 1933. All loans, interest and foreclosures since then have also been illegal contracts (e.g. National Banking Association, Farm Credit System). 14 The Federal Reserve System is being absorbed into an entity called the Federal Banking Commission (FBC) through HR 1214 (May 1993). This Commission will abolish seven systems, including the Federal Reserve, the National Banking Association, Thrift Associations and the FDIC (though the names might be retained for awhile). Henry Gonzalez (D-TX) addressed the U.S. Congress and told them about the reorganization plan. 15 The Federal Banking Commission is comprised of Seven Governors including the Secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the chairman of the FDIC. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) no longer protects commercial banks. The national banks have recently de-federalized, returning to their state charters. Banks without state charters will close. Deposits are no longer guaranteed by the bankrupt FDIC. 16 Sedition &Treason Against the United States Sixteen nations declared bankruptcy at the first Breton Woods Agreement in 1930. The Geneva Convention Treaty (1930) declared that international bankruptcy treaties were superior to all federal law, and the Constitution. No treaty with a foreign country or legal entity can supersede the Constitution, except in cases of bankruptcy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank was an outgrowth of the Breton Woods Agreement (July 22,1944), aka “The Final Act of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference.” Over 100 nations declared bankruptcy and formed a new currency system led by the federal United States govern - ment, the Federal Reserve Bank, and international bank-ers. The entire monetary system of the United States was sub - verted and usurped by agents of foreign principals. This was the same year the United Nations was founded. The Secretary of the Treasury, as the chief financial officer of the federal United States, is the “Receiver” in bankruptcy (Reorganization Plan #26, 5 U.S.C. 905, Public Law 94-564).41 The federal United States government is a front for the sovereign creditors, the Federal Reserve Bank (see Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938; 22 U.S.C. 286 et seq., 263(a), 285(g), 267(j), 611(c) (ii) & (iii); Rabinowitz vs. Kennedy, 376 U.S. 605; 11 L Ed 2d 940; 18 U.S.C. 219, 951; Treasury Delegation Order #91). The Federal Reserve Bank is also bankrupt under the receivership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 17 The former Presidential Cabinet Office of the “Secretary of Treasury” and Department of the Treasury no longer exists except in name only. The present Secretary of the Treasury is NOT the same office as the Treasurer of the united states of America. Search as you may for an appointment in the public record including the Congressional Record and the United States Code, you will not find one for the present “Secretary of the Treasury.” But you will find an appointment for Robert Rubin as an alien, corporate “Governor” of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (i.e., World Bank), among other interna-tional appointments. - 115 -"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Check out the “Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents.” For example, Rubin’s predecessor, former Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is listed in the Weekly Compilation on January 28, 1993 under Nominations Submitted to the Senate as follows: 18 “Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, to be U.S. Governor of the Interna - tional Monetary Fund for a term of five years; U.S. Governor of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Develop - ment for a term of five years; U.S. Governor of the Inter- American Development Bank for a term of five years; U.S. Governor of the Asian Development Bank; U.S. Governor of the African Development Bank; and U.S. Governor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.” The Governor of the International Monetary Fund is the present and only “Secretary of the Treasury.” The corporate and federal State Governors are also regional Governors of the International Monetary Fund. These are the front men for the foreign principals/creditors of the fed - eral United States. These men are agents of a foreign princi - pal pursuant to 22 U.S.C. §611, 612. They are directed, con - trolled, financed and subsidized by a foreign power that has nothing whatsoever to do with the “United States” or its Constitution. Under 5 U.S.C. §3331, each individual elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services, must take an oath to uphold the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. You cannot serve two masters. Acceptance and holding of an office or employment must not violate 5 U.S.C. §7311 Section 7311. Loyalty and striking An individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia if he: 1. advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government; 2. is a member of an organization that he knows advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government. Under federal law, the “Secretary of the Treasury,” appointed by the President, cannot be employed by the united states of America. Neither does the “Secretary of the Treasury” receive any salary from the federal United States government. The “Secretary of the Treasury” is paid directly by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF also pays the salaries of federal judges, U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals. So why are these purported government appointees being paid by a foreign entity? To whom do they have allegiance? You cannot serve two masters. He whom the piper pays dances. Title 22 U.S.C.§283(a) Appointment of officers; term of office; salary (c) Compen- sation No person shall be entitled to receive any salary or other compensation from the United States for services as a governor, alternate governor or executive director. Reading 5 U.S.C. §782 will shed light on why these appointees are not being paid by the United States government directly. Acceptance of funds or a salary would be sufficient evidence and cause for indictment for treason. Of course, there still is the element of fraud. Did anybody ever tell you they’re working for a foreign principle? Now, do you still wonder why many appointees in government appear to be acting in somebody else best interest, other than the American peoples? Now, I’m curious who pays the salaries of the U.S. Congress? 20 “ The giving, loaning, or promising of support or money or any other thing of value for any purpose to any organization shall be conclusively presumed to constitute affiliation therewith.” —5 U.S.C. §782, item 17. The federal United States began participation in INTERPOL in 1938, designating the U.S. Attorney General as the official representative to the organization. The Waco Massacre of the Branch Davidians in Texas was an INTERPOL operation spearheaded by U.S. Attorney General, Janet Reno. This enlarges the picture quite a bit. The U.S. Attorney General officially designated the Secretary of the Treasury as the U.S. representative to INTERPOL in 1958. The U.S. Attorney General is the “permanent member” to the Secretariat of the Interpol Operation, and the Secretary of Treasury the “alternate permanent member.” 21 Representatives to INTERPOL must, pursuant to Article 30 of the “Constitution and General Regulation of Interpol (22 U.S.C. §263 (a)),” renounce their allegiance to their respective countries and expatriate. The U.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury have renounced their allegiance to the united states of America. One cannot serve two masters. The World Bank is the agent for the principles/creditors of the federal United States and is not subject to American law. 22 > TREASON —offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance; or of betraying the state into the hands of a foreign power (e.g. international bankers). > SEDITION —knowingly becoming a member of any organization that advocates the overthrow or reformation of the existing form of government of this state by violence or unlawful means. Consequently, all “public ser vants,” officials, congressmen, senators, politicians, judges, attorneys, law enforcement personnel, the States and their various agencies, are express agents of the foreign creditor/principles who have bankrupt - ed and stolen the united states of America through the paper money banking swindle and other frauds and treacheries.

Without substance and without real “money,” there can be no Common in law actions. When the federal United States borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank in excess of the American peoples ability to pay the federal government’s obligation in substantive, real money, and the international banks demanded to be paid in gold coin, the sovereign states and their respective “state” Citizens lost their sovereignty under the Common law. Under the influence and prompting of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the American Bar Association and other private organizations accommodated the dilemma by blending “law” with “equity” in such a way as to not alarm the American Citizens of their newly acquired subject status. There would no longer be any genuine Common law courts, or distinct jurisdictions (Law, Equity, Admiralty) as required by the Constitution. All law would be “colorable,” or commercial. All law would be practiced as “statutory,” or commercial operating under the rules and procedures of EQUITY or ADMIRALTY, not the COMMON LAW. As every “licensed” attorney knows, the rules of “equity” are quite different from the rules of “law.” Equity compels performance upon the letter of a contract obligation, or in the interest of the creditor in case of financial default, but it allows a jury trial for controversies above $20.00, and it outlaws debtors’ prisons. However the equity jurisdiction of international default on debt is tried in “admiralty” courts, which do not recognize any of the constitutional protections of the equity courts. A jury in an admiralty court is only advisory to the judge who may rule contrary to a jury verdict if he/she wishes. Admiralty courts impose criminal penalties on those who fail to perform. You can recognize the admiralty jurisdiction by the gold-fringed flag around the American flag in virtually every courtroom today. Balancing the Budget Fiasco [Editors Note: Any intelligent individual ought to understand basic arithmetic and the simple realization that in a debt- based currency system you cannot balance the budget. So what's all the fuss and fiasco in the halls of Congress? Here’s an analysis of the balanced budget amendment.] The government’s practice of burdening the public with debt was addressed by Henry George in 1904 with a keen insight that boiled frogs have cooked out of them. As much as the people who are in debt are told that they are actually benefiting from their negative condition, it is they and their children who suffer, he observed. “The institution of public debts...rests upon the preposterous assumption that one generation may bind another generation,” he wrote. He recognized that foisting debt upon the public is an exercise that would involve “a flagrant contempt for the natural and unalienable rights of man.” He says that drawing on wealth that has not yet been created not only robs our progeny but that it creates dangerous power certain to be abused. The only ones who gain by such an arrangement are “those who get control of governments.” They are able to amass sums clandestinely this way, because outright taxation to acquire the amounts they want would immediately arouse indignation and resistance. 24 National Debt Now at $13 Trillion? The official tally of the national debt is not somewhere over $5 trillion, but the real figure could be closer to $13 trillion, according to Robert Gaylon Ross writing for Media Bypass Magazine. During the government budget crisis shutdowns last December and January, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin admitted he was borrowing money from trust funds to keep the government afloat — “a simple electronic entry,” he called it. Unfortunately, there is no real-life container that holds these trust funds. As money funnels into the Treasury it lands in a general fund. When that fund is empty, anything borrowed from any purported funds is just another electronic debit entry. Investment banker and chairman of the CFR, Peter G. Peterson announced on CSPAN in April of 1994 that the government had already borrowed over $7 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund. How much has been raided from the government's 47 other trust funds? Whatever that figure is, it is invisible debt which the government terms “offbudget” items. The invisible debt is also contributed to by the “Black Bud - get” which funds our nation's huge intelligence apparatus. This part of the budget is off limits to scrutiny because of na - tional security. Another source of off-budget debt is pro - grams that are currently being underfunded, such as the fed - eral pension plan which has been getting shortchanged to the tune of $1 trillion since 1993. Add all this up and the to - tal national debt could be at $13 trillion or beyond. 25 Bankruptcy Strategies There are alternatives to declaring bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is not a desirable status for sovereign people as it creates a lien upon not only all your present assets but your future productivity. To declare bankruptcy is to admit that you are not economically sovereign and incapable of being financially responsible for your actions. That is a lien-able position to take. A Chapter 7, 11, 12 or 13 bankruptcy court order will make you a “ward of the court” forever. Not recommended for aspiring sovereigns. - 117 -"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Accord and Satisfaction “Accord & Satisfaction” is a commercial process for discharging debt. Sovereign “state” Citizens cannot declare bankruptcy, thus “Accord & Satisfaction” is an alternative for Citizens who get over their head in “credit” money and cannot meet their debt obligations. A third party, on behalf of the debtor, will offer a creditor consideration as a conditional “Accord & Satisfaction” in exchange for the full and complete discharge of the debt. If the consideration is offered and clearly designated as a conditional Accord & Satisfaction on the negotiable instrument, and accepted by the creditor, the debt is legally discharged in full. In the case of Ford Motor Co., consideration was sent and accepted, then Ford Motor tried to send the check back and undo the Accord & Satisfaction, which it could not, by law, do. The cost of litigation for Ford Motor was prohibitive against a pro se litigant, so they eventually settled for a full discharge of the debt, and a title to the truck free and clear. Accord and satisfaction is one alternative to declaring bankruptcy. 26 Repudiating Credit Card Debt Fraud [Editor’s Note: Barrie’s methods are not for everyone, but for those faced with un-payable credit card debts, imminent foreclosure on a mortgage or the prospects of bankruptcy, perhaps this is a remedy.] Author Barry Konicov advocates fighting bank fraud and the rip-off of the American people by canceling personal debts. The modern so-called “money” system, he points out, is sustained by lies, cheating and thievery. Bankers (who are all ultimately linked to the Federal Reserve) create “money” out of thin air every time a person activates the debit/credit system. In a lawful system, borrowers put up collateral (something real) in order to borrow real wealth that actually comes from deposits or investments at the bank. In our fraudulent sys - tem, borrowers are still putting up collateral that was creat - ed by their very real labors, but the banks are loaning credit, which is created by electronic computer entries. As a result, bank customers become unwitting enablers to the fraud of the dishonest bankers, and pay interest for the privilege. Taxpayers, who have become accustomed to paying the government for the mere privilege of existing, have been hoodwinked into the same crooked system of paying back money that never existed in the first place. The private, for-profit corporation called the Federal Reserve, creates debt money out of nothing at the government's request, then the IRS collection agency extracts repayment from the people who assume they have no other choice but to sweat and pay. The Great Snow Job by Barrie Konicov advocates mass credit card and mortgage debt cancellation, on the basis that those unlawful debts are perpetrating the fraudulent nature of the nation's money system; a fraud that is hurling the country toward imminent financial collapse. 27 FRN Redemption Strategies Eric Madsen of Team Law has developed some interesting redemption strategies for dealing with the IRS or other government agencies who are demanding payment in FRN’s. First, offer to pay your IRS bill with gold or silver, and the IRS will refuse to accept the payment of lawful money. In fact, it’s against the law for the IRS to accept payment in gold or silver. Second, prior-dated FRN’s must be accepted and exchanged for silver dollars at the rate of Ø24 to $1 silver. 28 Economic Sovereignty As in all other aspects of sovereignty, we must reclaim what we’ve lost. To be completely sovereign means reclaiming spiritual, mental, emotional, political, economic and legal sovereignty. Economic sovereignty is a stumbling block for many people who’ve lived their entire lives in debt, not having been paid in real “money” of substance, not having acquired assets sufficient to be able to be truly independent and free, instead of dependent upon the New World Order system for their lifeblood and support. The welfare and co-dependency survival patterns are pervasive and the attitudes behind them must be broken with prosperity and abundance consciousness. Attitude is everything. If you feel unworthy of having wealth, of having choice, then certainly you won’t. If you don’t believe there’s plenty for everyone, then certainly there will be scarcity and struggle. Achieving economic sovereignty morally, ethically and via the expression of your own talents is the preferred method for independence and freedom. “ The best way to help the poor is to not be one of them yourself.” First, assess your present financial and economic condition. Tell the truth. Be honest. Inventory your resources, talents, skills and dreams. What motivates you? What excites you enough to get out of bed in the morning and be self- motivated. Obligation and debt is a poor motivator. Assess your ability to make a contribution, your capacity to generate a right livelihood for yourself and your family, and to provide goods and services that are needed and wanted. Success and achieving your goals may not come overnight. It may take time to break the old belief structures and attitudes that have kept you limited. Be patient, but stay focused and energized on your goal — being economically sovereign and financially responsible for your actions. If you’re an “employee” with a “job” consider starting your own business. You’ll have more options for freedom working your own business than for someone else, unless they’re also sovereign-minded. - 118 -"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Chapter Eight Economic Sovereignty Get independent of employee status as soon as possible. Or be prepared to educate your “employer” and exercise other tax-reduction strategies. Declare what you want and how you'll serve. Extend an imagination of yourself into the world around you and faithfully assess what is needed and wanted, then provide it. You must commit to action to receive the opportunity for manifestation. Commit to being and living debt-free and supporting others to do the same. Create a community of family, friends and neighbors to support this agenda. Commit to being judgment proof from liens or prosecution. There are hungry, litigious vultures out there looking to take advantage of anyone with assets connected with their name or number. Extract yourself from both and live free. Slowly, carefully and safely remove yourself from the existing system and replace it with another system than gives “pure mission” to manifesting your goals and life’s purpose. Commit to reorganizing your business and financial affairs as quickly and wisely as possible. Set-up and utilize foreign entities (i.e., LLC's, CLT’s IBC's, PIF’s, SA’s), domestic, non- domestic and offshore with the assistance of expert counsel. Set-up private offshore banking in a country with strict banking privacy laws. Get rid of your credit cards, utilize VISA debit cards, and/or fiduciary trust accounts to do business outside the jurisdiction of the federal United States. If you send less of your productivity to the principle/creditors of the government, there’ll be more to invest and allocate where you choose. Allocate a portion of your assets into short-term and long- term investments. Transit from the debt-based currency to tangible assets (e.g., gold/silver, land, food, tools) as quickly as possible. Organize a communications network for sovereign individuals and businesses to buy, sell and trade goods and services. Organize and participate in local scrips for the exchange of goods and services and the development of community-based self-reliance. Invest and establish an asset-based solar economy with We the People as creditors. Let’s deregulate the Federal Reserve monopoly over legal tender, and create our own money system for We the People. - 119 -"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources BANKRUPTCY 1.

Or are we going to continue to work for tyrants and pay them handsomely with our hard work and life’s blood? In 1990, Americans worked from Jan 1-May 8, just to pay their income taxes. This is what is now called the “tax season,” as if the other four seasons weren’t enough. Give yourself a raise. Untax yourself from the IRS, the federal United States government and its political subdivisions, tax and spend bureaucrats and elected officials who are destroying this country and bankrupting us into economic slavery. “ ...For those who wish to stake their claim to sovereignty, to make a personal record, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states of America, that they are not ‘taxpayers’ under the IRC and, as to property not emanating from an employment agreement within the U.S. government, to declare that they are not ‘transferees’ under the IRC, thereby putting IRS employees on notice that no lawful authority exists to pursue it.” —Frank Kowalik, IRS Humbug 2 Fellow American Citizens and private-sector employers, you have a duty, and a moral obligation, to lawfully not pay one dime of income taxes more than legally required. If you only knew where your income tax money went and how it was spent, you’d refuse to pay income tax on the grounds of principle alone. The law is solidly on the side of the sovereign “state” Citizen with regards to the income tax. Under the Constitution and the Common law, the federal United States government was forbidden to borrow money, delegate the authority to create “money,” or impose a direct tax upon the American Citizens. Prior to 1913, when the federal United States government needed money to finance this war or that, it had to sell bonds to the “state” Citizens to raise the necessary money. Most of the taxes we presently pay are unnecessary. According to the Grace Commission Report, not one dime of your income taxes pays for government services. Government services are primarily funded through excise taxes. We the People can have good government without income taxes, usury and exploitation if we choose. We don’t need to live in a social welfare state to be able to take care of human needs. Privately organized charities operated prior to the social welfare state. Here’s a creative example from our forgotten American history. It is rarely known that the original Capitol Building in Washington D.C. was built with money raised from a lottery, not from taxes. “ The original federal United States government had to build a whole new country without the ability to tax its citizens. They built roads, bridges, canals and schools funded to a great extent by lotteries. In 1793, President George Washington built Washington, D.C. by selling 50,000 tickets at $7 each. The top prize was a hotel worth $50,000. ” 3 Here’s a few interesting facts that contrast the federal debt to the increasing size of an expanding federal government. The federal government was virtually debt-free with a balanced budget from 1789-1860. There was a three-fold increase in the size of both outlays and the government, and fivefold increase in debt between 18611865, the Civil War years. The size of the outlays and debt stabilized after Civil War, and the debt was paid off between 1866-1915. There was a five-fold increase in size of outlays and government, and two-fold increase in debt between 1916-1920, the beginning of World War I. After the undeclared federal bankruptcy of 1933, larger outlays and debt have increased by unprecedented, exponential magnitude until the present. The bigger the federal government, the more debt burden exists for all the people. If you want to shrink the federal debt, you must shrink the size and expense of government. Anything else is wishful thinking and foolishness. 4 Also the amount of federal aid to the States has decreased by 80% from 19701990. When the services and benefits that the American people have grown accustomed to are cut, the people are left holding the bag of debt obligations. There are many alternatives to centralized, big government borrow and spend policies that eventually bankrupt the people and put them into the chains of economic slavery. We the People must liberate ourselves from this tyranny and apply the necessary intelligence to create solutions. Social Insecurity Getting a Social Security Number (SSN) is voluntary.5 American Citizens, unless they intend on accepting a government benefit, are NOT required to have an SSN. Social Security is another form of income tax with no mandatory gratuity. - 123 -"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Social Security is not an insurance or retirement program, and it has no obligation to pay you one dime of the tax it collects. There is no particular clause in the Constitution sufficient to sustain such power as to compel every American Citizen to participate in a compulsory retirement or benefits plan. There is a debate as to whether Social Security is just anoth - er form of income tax, or is an insurance and retirement program. What we do know is that applying and receiving a SSN qualifies the applicant for benefits, although there’s no guarantee that you’ll ever receive any. 6 “ There is no Social Security law requiring that one have a number, but the IRS Tax Code, Section 6109 subsection A, stipulates that taxpayers shall utilize their Social Security numbers when filing tax returns. Therefore, if one pays taxes, one must have a Social Security number.” —Lloyd Bentson, U.S. Senator from Texas 7 When the U.S. Congress adopted the Social Security Act of 1935, the supreme Court held in Railroad Retirement Board that the U.S. Congress had no authority to establish a retirement scheme through its most formidable power. Congress had imposed excise taxes upon employers and the supreme Court found nothing constitutionally objectionable to the Act. But neither did they address the issue of whether there was a requirement to receive Social Security. Courts have ruled that there is no obligation to have a Social Security Number (SSN) unless: 1. you are obligated to pay taxes; 2. you receive public assistance; or 3. you obtain and use a driver’s license, operate or register a motor vehicle. Getting an SSN is not mandatory for getting a passport for the united states of America. A usA passport is still a valid function of the national government and we recommend all American Nationals OR sovereign “state” Citizens get one without a SSN. You will notice on the back of the application, the instructions distinctly say that: How to Apply for a U.S. Passport? U.S. passports are issued only to U.S. citizens or “nationals.” An American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen doesn’t need a Social Security Number (SSN). In fact, having one is a disability. If you never obtained one when you were a child, or you have properly revoked or challenged the signature on the one issued, then you can reclaim your sovereignty. You could substitute 999-99-9999. or any other 999 prefix in lieu of a SSN, EIN or TIN when requested. Otherwise leave it blank. 8 Social Security is Voluntary The regulations on the SS-5 application for a SSN simply state that you can obtain an SSN if you need or request it. There is no legal compulsion to do so. Neither can a state make that which is voluntary under federal law something that is mandatory under state law. Furthermore, should any right be denied you when you decline to provide your SSN, you may file an action in the courts under the Privacy Act with penalties paid by the individual, business, or government agency who wronged you. Take a witness when you assert these rights. 9 “It shall be unlawful for any federal, State or local government agency [including businesses within the federal United States] to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual’s refusal to disclose his/her Social Security Account Number.” “ Actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000 the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees determined by the court.” —Privacy Act of 1974 10 Prior to the Social Security Act of 1935, each sovereign state had its own social welfare system and paid varying benefits. The Social Security Administration was federalized in 1939 with national standards of compensation, and the SSN was incorporated into the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as an ID number for income tax purposes as well. Since the introduction of the SSN, there have been many attempts to make the SSN a mandatory federal/national ID card. All attempts have failed to date. The last attempt to establish a federal/national ID card was the “National Health Card.” The most recent attempts have been a mandatory I.D. card for all immigrants and “cashless” debit cards which may be mandated for all U.S. citizens (if you want access to the federalized health care system or any grocery store). Applying for and receiving a SSN is an unrevealed commercial agreement that also: 1) assigns your Power of Attorney to the federal U.S. government to act on your behalf; 2) impairs your sovereign “state” Citizenship by naturalizing as a 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment, U.S. citizen of the District of Columbia; 3) creates a juristic “person” in your name subject to the laws of the federal United States government corporation. 11 According to their own internal regulations, you CAN unilaterally terminate your participation in the Social Security system.

But don’t hold your breath waiting for the Social Security Administration to make it easy for you! They have insisted administratively via correspondence that you cannot terminate your SSN, and cannot get a refund. We advise pulling out of the system, not relying of any social security system for your well-being and not bothering to get any funds back. There is no individual account with funds in it waiting for you when you need it. It’s a general tax and a general fund, which is fundamentally overdrawn and bankrupt like the rest of the system. SSN = TRUST I.D. # The de jure governor of Colorado state, Eric Madsen, asserts that nowhere in the Social Security Act does the SSN attach to a natural-born individual. Instead he asserts, it’s a trust account number for a trust established in the trustee “name” you’re given at birth except that it’s ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (e.g., on your birth certificate). Social security insurance is a constructive trust with the Social Security Administration as the Creators. TRUST NAME = JOHNNY LIBERTY TRUSTEE = Johnny Liberty Therefore, Form 1041 would be the appropriate tax form for those Americans who volunteer as taxpayers, not the Form 1040 as we’re told. This is a very interesting theory and Mr. Madsen has been effectively testing it for a number of years.

All public servants are also required to fill out and sign a questionnaire before securing information about your affairs. Include in your correspondence to any government agency: If any request for information relating to me is received from any person or agency, you must advise me in writing before releasing such information. Failure to do so may subject you to possible civil or criminal action as provided by the Privacy Act of 1974. 15 “ The purpose of this [Privacy] Act is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies... to permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by such agencies.” —Public Law 93-579 Any American can get information from the government about him/herself through the “Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)” of 1974. 16 This is a powerful tool for discovering the unrevealed com - mercial agreements on record under your “name,” or for re - searching laws, administrative rules and procedures, or for determining the public policy of government agencies. Provide your name, address, and the former SSN account number designated “For Information Only” with the years in question requested, along with reasonable costs. The government has 10 days to respond to any American Citizen making a formal request of information through FOIA. If they deny you information, appeals must be processed within 20 days. Unless a criminal investigation is ongoing, nothing should be “exempt” from disclosure.

The Internal Revenue System (IRS) is a collection agency for the Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is the principal/creditor of the federal United States government corporation. The presumes its authority to assess and collect taxes upon constructive fraud and massive deceit. Considering the three historically convoluted lines of construction detailed below, one can only conclude that the IRS is a massive con game foisted upon the ignorant American people. First, the original office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, created by the Internal Revenue Act of 1862 (12 Stat 432), was in the Treasury Department. However this office was effectively abolished with promulgation of the Revised Statutes of the United States 1873. The current office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (IRC §7802), is not in the Treasury of the United States (Treasury Department), but in the Department of the Trea - sury Department of the Treasury, Puerto Rico. In the early part of the current century, provisional governments for the Philippines and Puerto Rico, operating chiefly under super - vision of the Navy, established entities known as the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The first by way of Philippines Trust #2 (internal revenue), the second by way of Puerto Rico Trust #62 (Internal Rev - enue). When the Philippines became an independent com - monwealth in 1946, only one of these trusts remained. The Secretary of the Treasury still administers this trust. 17 Second, when the 18th Amendment effecting national prohibition was ratified in 1919, it granted concurrent state and federal authority relating to the production and distribution of distilled spirits. However, the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th in 1933 and effectively terminated federal police powers. The Federal Alcohol Commission was enacted in 1935 but never got off the ground due to the Constantine case. 18 Functions of the Federal Alcohol Commission were merged with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Puerto Rico, not the Internal Revenue Service as we know it. 19 The Internal Revenue Service as we know it didn’t formally come into existence until the name of the Bureau of Internal Revenue was changed to IRS via T.O. 150-29 in 1953. The fact that Congress never created a Bureau of internal Revenue is verified in the Department of Treasury history of the United States internal revenue laws. 20 From 1953 until 1972, the IRS continued to have responsibility for administration of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was established and segregated from the IRS via Treasury Department Order N. 221, effective July 1, 1972. The fact that BATF still administers the Federal Alcohol Administration Act is verified at 27 CFR, Part 1.1, and in definition at 27 CFR, Part 1.5, and the solid link with the Department of the Treasury, Puerto Rico, is made by definition at 27 CFR, Part 250.11. “ No inference, implication or presumption of legislative construction shall be drawn or made by reason of the location of grouping of any particular section or provision or portion of this Title [26], nor shall any table of contents, table of cross references, or similar outline, analysis or descriptive matter relating to the contents of this Title be given any legal effect.” —IRC Section 7806(b) Delegation of Authority Third, the IRS does not have any legitimate “delegation of authority” at the federal level from the U.S. Congress. Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is often cited by the IRS to justify their authority to assess and collect income taxes. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) authorizes the Treasury Department (Treasury of the United States) to administer internal revenue taxes of the United States in the continental United States, not the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury. 21 Title 26, though, never passed as “positive” law, and the implementing statutes are missing. The IRS collection process is legitimate providing they obey the laws and assess the tax on the proper persons, but the assessment process is a complete and total fraud. All legitimate delegations of authority at the federal level must be “filed” and “published” in the Federal Register. 22 The Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 divested the IRS Commissioner of all authority to enforce the 1939 Internal Revenue Code and vested all such authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. The U.S. Treasury has re-vested to the IRS only the following authority. “ The Commissioner shall, to the extent of authority otherwise vested in him, provide for the administration of the United States Internal Revenue laws in the U.S. territories and insular possessions and other authorized areas of the world.” —Treasury Order 150-01 23 Congress authorized the President to re-delegate authority to various administrative departments and department - 126 -"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Delegation of Authority heads. Most of the core Executive Order delegations are pu- blished immediately following 3 U.S.C. §301(1994 edition). Where the Secretary of the Treasury is concerned, key Executive Order delegation is E.O. 10289. It is found that authority delegated by the President, so far as “internal revenue” is concerned, addresses custom laws, particularly with respect to narcotics and related drugs, the antismuggling act, other maritime activity, and authority in United States off-shore territories such as Puerto Rico,...etc. No authority relating to internal revenue laws prescribed in Subtitles A & C of the Internal Revenue Code is mentioned. That E.O.10289 is the authority for the Secretary to establish revenue districts is verified at 26 CFR, Part 301.7621-1. By consulting the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules, located in the index of the Code of Federal Regulations, it is found that the authority to establish revenue districts does NOT apply to the Union of sovereign states of the republic, as parties to the Constitution. The Secretary in turn delegated authority to the Commis - sioner of Internal Revenue by way of Treasury Department Order No. 150-42, effected July 27, 1956 (Federal Register pg., 5852). There is no authority cited for any delegation in the Union of sovereign states of the republic. “ The Commissioner shall, to the extent of authority vested in him, provide for the administration of the United States Internal Revenue laws in the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.” —Treasury Order 150-42 24 IRS is a Bizarre Scheme to Collect Taxes Editor’s Note: Special thanks to Timothy Lee Rich-ardson for excerpts from his brief for these summaries. These three historical lines of the IRS demonstrates the most bizarre scheme ever perpetrated against a developed nation. Tax prescribed in Subtitles A & C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended in 1986 and since, were classified as Chapters 1,2 & 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which codified the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 and the Social Security Act of 1935, both of which issue only against appointed and elected United States officers and employees. The IRS may administer Subtitle A & C taxes in United States off-shore territorial jurisdiction pursuant to IRC §7701(a)(12)(B). IRS and BATF, both emerging from the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Puerto Rico, with authorization from the Depart - ment of the Treasury, operating in conjunction with Puerto Rico Trust #62 (Internal Revenue) have with primary re - sponsibility for administration of the Federal Alcohol Ad - ministration Act and United States custom laws, which is applicable only in the geographical United States under Congress’ Article IV & 3.2 legislative jurisdiction. The IRS is authorized to administer custom laws relating to narcotics and other drugs pursuant to 26 CFR, Part 403. The BATF is authorized to administer custom laws relating to alcohol, tobacco and firearms under the provisions of 27 CFR, Part 72. The Treasury Department, not the Department of the Treasury is authorized as the Secretary’s delegate in the continental United States so far as Subtitle A & C taxes are concerned. 25 The IRS works on contracts to develop and maintain records and provide record-keeping services for the Treasury of the United States. The agency has absolutely no legitimate enforcement authority in the Union of several states to the Constitution. Although, we know that the IRS is not a corporation, foreign or domestic, it is also not authorized to do business in the corporate State either. To verify this, we acquired a “Certificate of Non-Existence” from the Secretary of State of Nevada. Therein it stated: “ ...The Internal Revenue Service is not a Nevada corporation and has never qualified as a foreign corporation to do business in this State under the provisions of Chapter 80 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, that to the date of this certificate, said corporation has failed to appoint a Resident Agent upon whom process may be served, as required under NRS 14.020, and at the date hereof, there is no such agent in Nevada for said corporation and that this certificate is made under the provisions of NRS 14.030(1). —Secretary of State (June 4th, 1993) The primary taxing authority of the federal United States involves duties, imposts and excises. Subtitles A & C of the IRC prescribe excise taxes, mandatory only for officers and employees of the United States. These are not direct taxes, but taxes built into the consumer price index of everything we buy, sell, trade, import or export. They are levies on everything that is imported, exported or manufactured. These are legitimate taxes within the authority of the Constitution. The IRS has fraudulently involved the individual in an excise taxable activity to be able to assess and collect taxes legitimately. The IRS has even assigned activity codes to all U.S. citizens to justify their assessment activities, although the activities assigned are usually irrelevant to the individuals actual commercial activity. Ask the IRS for Form 5546 and the excise taxing activity codes assigned to you. You’ll be surprised to find out what bizarre basis they’re assessing you on. - 127 -"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;...” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:1] This sinister and bizarre scheme puts the entire federal tax system in jeopardy, as the Internal Revenue Act of Nov. 23, 1921 effectively repealed all federal taxes enacted under Congress’ Article I delegated authority. Even excise taxes prescribed in Subtitle D of the current Internal Revenue Code are applicable and enforceable only in United States territorial and maritime jurisdiction. Individual Master File The IRS, limited as it is in its ability to tax Americans directly, has contrived an incredible scam of imposing excise taxes on American Citizens based not on income or gain or jurisdiction, but on specific taxable activity, such as operating an offshore oil well, importing drugs from the Cayman Islands or dealing in gasoline used in school buses. Thus in order to impose excise taxes on all kinds of Citizens, the IRS has been mis-classifying 95% of all American “taxpayers” as being involved in excise taxable activity that is light-years removed from the truth. Ludicrous, as it may seem, the Individual Master File (IMF) and/or Business Master File (BMF) of each taxpayer has a series of “industry activity codes,” that if decoded reveals excise taxable activity that has falsely created liability. In other words, the IRS has falsified the file of each “taxpayer” to create a basis for tax liability. Every administrative action taken by the IRS is designed to settle that record in favor of assessment and collection. Remember the IRS is primarily a record management agency. Addressing the falsehoods in the IMF or BMF and requesting to correct the record may stop the assessment and collection activity. Getting a complete copy of your IMF and a decoding book is a valuable tax reduction strategy. 26 IRS Considers \"Taxpayers\" Narcotics Dealers? \"When Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have been filed for an Individual Master File (IMF) for people who are experiencing tax problems with the IRS, every return has been found to contain the above codes except for some which are coded as “Guam” returns. Every return shows that the unsuspecting Citizen is being taxed on income derived from importing narcotics, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms into the United States or one of its territories or possessions, from a foreign country or from Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or into the Virgin Islands from the Cayman Islands.” 27 Venue and Statute of Limitations Text 727 contains a further discussion of venue...Text 419 contains further information on the statute of limitations.

There are also no regulations published in the Federal Register which extend IRC authority to the state republics for establishing federal internal revenue districts (26 USC §7621), that there is no regulatory authority extending jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury to the state republics (26 USC §7801), or that there are no regulations extending authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the state republics and the population at large (26 USC §7802).

Terms such as \"family,\" \"equity pure,\" \"prime,\" \"constitutional,\" are used in the title of the trust. Income is from \"wages\" or \"contract\" sources and deductions are for personal living expenses, such as housing, medical, auto, child care , interest or taxes. Generally, an individual will establish a trust, give his/her wages or other income to the trust and the trust pays for the expenses of the individual. The expenses claimed as administrative expenses of the trust, resulting in the individual paying no tax and the trust paying little or no tax. - 128 -"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Individual Master File j) W-4 Excessive Overstatement of Allowances k) Forms 843 and Amended Returns [Section 445 (1-18-80)] The individual income tax prescribed in Subtitle A of the IRC is an excise tax levied for the privilege of working for federal government.

The tax is otherwise voluntary (26 USC §3402 (p).

Commissioner case referenced above.] 62 \"In order to avoid open hostilities, it is necessary to move evidence into proper legal forums so there can be peaceful remedies that minimize danger and damage.\" --Dan Meador Short History of the “Income Tax?” The income tax is an important component of the Federal Reserve Banking System. The Federal Reserve Banking system needs “withholding” as an economic mechanism to absorb spiraling inflation, conceal the currency devaluation, and to keep your FRNs out of circulation so you cannot spend them as disposable income. By keeping FRN’s out of circulation, economic controls are more effective. By keeping your net income as close to subsistence as possible, you are effectively prevented from engaging in any meaningful political activity that might threaten their monopoly over the political, economic and legal systems. The first version of an “income tax” was for government employees only, introduced during the Civil War and then again after the corporate “income tax” was repealed. The second version was a corporate “income tax” introduced, along with the Federal Reserve Act (1913), to service the debt obligation incurred by the federal United States government corporation to the Federal Reserve Bank. Yet another, attempt to impose a direct tax on wages. You might notice on the back of your cancelled check that payment goes directly to the Federal Reserve Bank, not the U.S. Treasury Department. In fact, the Grace Commission Report on Government Waste (1984) concluded that not one dime of your hard-earned tax money goes to pay for government services. 28 All the “income tax” collected goes to service an “un- payable” federal debt, and is the greatest fraud perpetrated upon the American people. As the International Monetary Fund via the Federal Reserve Bank is the primary principal/creditor of the federal United States government, any “income tax” revenue received is directly routed to the principle/creditor—just like any other bankrupt entity. This is also prima facie evidence of the bankruptcy of the federal United States government corporation. “ The greatest challenge our tax system faces in the 1990’s is to ease the burden on taxpayers. Once people conclude that it is too difficult, too time consuming, too expensive to comply, many will stop complying.” —Fred Goldberg, IRS Commissioner The IRS has no lawful or delegated authority to assess and collect income taxes, as the Constitution strictly forbids the federal United States government from imposing any “direct” tax upon individuals. This is the apportionment rule of law. Congress could apportion direct taxes to a state, but not to the individuals within the state. A capitation means a “head tax,” “poll tax,” “per capita tax,” or direct income tax, and is not permitted, unless equally apportioned to each state. “ Any direct tax that is not apportioned is unlawful.” —Commissioner vs. Obear-Nester, 349 U.S.948 (1954) “ No capitation, or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.” —Constitution for the usA [1:9:4] “ Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within the Union to their respective members...” —Constitution for the usA [1:2:3] These basic sections of the Constitution have never been repealed or lawfully amended, and the 16th Amendment, as passed, is invalid. The Constitution still forbids direct taxation of individuals. Our founding fathers intentionally limited the taxing powers of the federal government so as to keep it small. “[the federal government] has no authority to raise either [men or - 129 -"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook money] by regulations extending to the individual [state] Citizens of America.” Apportionment is a protective shield against direct taxation for all sovereign state Citizens providing you are “domiciled” in one of the 48 sovereign states, and not a resident of the federal United States. 29 The IRS claims that the 16th Amendment gives them the constitutional authority to impose and collect direct taxes, despite the fact that the U.S. supreme Court ruled that the16th Amendment created no new power of taxation and did not amend or change the constitutional limitations that forbid any direct taxation on individuals. In addition, the16th Amendment (1913) was never legally ratified by the sovereign states. 30 According to The Law That Never Was, the authors Beckman & Benson traveled to all the state capitols to obtain certified copies of the official voting records of the 36 states that allegedly passed it; 32 states had committed grievous departures from acceptable procedure. In Senate Document 240, the official canvas of the first 19 Amendments, the President’s signature is missing from the 16th Amendment. This is just another of a long history of frauds perpe-trated on the American people. 31 “ The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.” —16th Amendment The U.S. Congress had been taxing the incomes of federal government employees since 1861. The real intent and purpose of the 16th Amendment was to create a smoke screen, making it appear that constitutional restrictions on taxing had been abolished. Once the smoke had cleared, the American people would forget, once again, and the income tax would further encroach upon the assets of the American people on behalf of the international bankers and the Federal Reserve Bank. The U.S. Congress authorized a “voluntary” income tax in 1913 for corporate “persons,” under the popular guise of soaking the rich for the sake of the poor. The General Application “Income Tax” for corporations, which was promulgated simultaneously with alleged ratification of the 16th Amendment, was repealed by the Internal Revenue Act (Nov. 23, 1921). 32 At this juncture, a surtax on individuals was implemented to offset the corporate income tax. These taxes, which became known as “income taxes” via the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, were issued against government returns for public officials. 33 The current Subtitle A tax and Subtitle C Social Security and related taxes have never applied to anyone other than appointed and elected government officials engaged in United States trade or business (defined at IRC §7701(a) (26)). Congress did not make the income tax “mandatory” until World War II, when a “Victory Tax” was imposed on “wages” as an emergency measure to help pay for the war. Before and after World War II, “wages” were not subject to income taxes. Congress transformed the “Victory Tax” into a modern version of the income tax after WWII to finance the Cold War, the rising military-industrial complex, and corporate foreign-aid programs to other countries. Because the American people were asleep then, as they are now, they did not realize that federal government could not constitutionally impose any direct income tax on their wages or property. The American people assumed that “wages” were income and volunteered to be taxed. Once again the American people swallowed a fraud and a hoax, and are left holding the bag. 35 Several courts have ruled that states are prohibited from imposing an indirect tax upon an unalienable right (e.g. no sales tax on food items). Your right to work is an unalienable right and many states have right to work laws whereby the government cannot license or tax your right to work in the profession of your choice. According to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), your “wages” are not taxable because they are not “income.” A tax liability is created from an increase in the value of property, not from gross income, providing you are a person required. Where income from private enterprise is defined as property, it is generally exempt from direct tax under fundamental law. “Wages,” salary and other returns from public service are deemed to be privileged, commercial enterprise due to government-granted benefits, thus taxable. In other words, the so-called income tax is nothing more than an excise tax levied against privileges and benefits derived from government service. 34 Income is defined in the IRC in the same light as a Schedule C, standard business calculation. David Myrland's work regarding IRC § 7701(e) (contract for lease of property) relative to IRC §83 calculations (of the fair market value) and IRC §1011, 1012, 1014 (adjusted basis of property transferred) also confirms this. 19 Gross Income (minus) Expenses = Income (Profit or Gain) or Increase Of Value In calculating “gross income,” 26 U.S.C. §83 applies to all compensation for services. §1.83-4(b)(2) requires that the cost of compensation for services is to be figured by applying the provisions of §1012 and the regulations hereunder. Regarding 26 U.S.C. §83 calculations, ask these questions. Where, under §1012, is the exclusion of intangible personal property, such as labor, from property that is to be treated as a cost? What specific provisions exclude my compensation from the provisions of §83? How am I to comply with the provisions and requirements of §83? - 130 -"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Short History of the “Income Tax?” As an independent contractor or employee, does §83 allow the taxation of the fair market value of services, received as a fee or wage? Editor’s Note: For more on these strategies, see David R. Myrland, Our Uncle, Our Problem. 36 If you are selling your labor to an employer, then labor is your property. Your labor is your property and not taxable. If you are exchanging labor for a paycheck, then zero gain - zero tax. You’re breaking even, not making a “profit!” The same calculation applies for both cash or bartered exchanges. The entire income tax code has nothing to do whatsoever with “wages,” but “profit,” “gain,” and “increase” in value. 37 No Income = No Income Tax — No Profit = No Gain As an “employee” defined below, you are not even required to keep books and records. Under normal circumstances where an “employee” has but one “employer,” the employee is supposed to file for refunds directly from the employer not the IRS or even the Treasury Department. 38 “ Compensation for labor (wages) can not be regarded as profit within the meaning of the law. The word ‘profit’ ...means the gain made upon any business or investment— a different thing altogether from mere compensation for labor (wages)” —Oliver vs. Halstead, 86 S.E. Rep.2d.859 (1955) Withholding Requirements There is no law requiring that employers withhold taxes from wages, nor to become an uncompensated third-party paymaster or agent for the government. Employers become personally liable when they violate the rights of sovereign “state” Citizens or U.S. citizens by operating as third-party paymasters or agents of the federal United States government corporation, acting on behalf of foreign principals/creditors, withholding taxes illegally, taking actions on a “Notice of Levy” or by demanding SSNs as a condition of employment. “ ...every employer making payment of wages ‘ shall’ deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax ...” —Title 26 U.S.C. 3402(a) Furthermore, the “government” paymaster or withholding agent is responsible for withholding, reporting and paying the taxes. 26 CFR §31.3403-1 Liability for Tax Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax under §3402 from the wages of an employee is liable for the payment of such tax whether or not it is collected from the employee or by the employer.... 26 CFR §31.3401-1 Return and payment by governmental employer If the United States, or a State, Territory, Puerto Rico, or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, is an employer required to deduct and withhold tax under Chapter 24... > EMPLOYEE—an officer, employee or elected official of the federal United States government, a State or the District of Columbia; in other words a person working for the government or government- protected enterprise. 39 When duly informed and notified, many employers will respect both the American law and the rights of the sovereign “state” Citizen, especially if they understand the personal liabilities involved. But many employers are also intimidated by the IRS, and afraid not to withhold taxes, therefore demand SSN’s and signed W-4’s as a condition of “employment.” Employers must be informed and notified, and taken to court if necessary if they violate your state and federal constitutional rights by refusing employment because you failed to provide an SSN. 37 When the IRS says “shall,” they mean “may,” which is a voluntary act. When you furnish a signed Form W-4 to an employer, which is an estate and gift tax form for federal government employees, you are volunteering to pay the federal and State income taxes. When you furnish a signed Form 1040, you have volunteered to abide by all the rules and regulations of Title 26, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). You have just given up your sovereign “state” Citizenship again, and reaffirmed your federal, U.S. citizen, subject status. Instead of furnishing a W-4 or a SSN to your employer, as a sovereign “state” Citizen you can furnish your employer your “Affidavit of Tax-Exempt Foreign Status,” “Certifi-cate of Exemption from Withholding( in Lieu of W-4),” “Employer Indemnification Letter,” and your “Certificate of Foreign Status – W-8.” “ W-4 is only for government employees.” —Title 5 U.S.C. 2105 “ The furnishing of such Form W-4 shall constitute a request for withholding.” —26 CFR 3402(p)-1(b)(1)(i) Income Tax is Voluntary By signing a Form 1040, you have unwittingly “volunteered” into a commercial contract with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to assess and collect Subtitle A or C income tax designed for federal United States government officers or employees. - 131 -"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook As a U.S. citizen, having received an implied benefit from the government when you applied for and got your Social Security Number (SSN), you are obliged to abide by the terms of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) contract, and all the rules and regulations of Title 26 (IRC). By signing a Form W-4, an estate and gift tax form for federal government employees, you have agreed to “withholding” from your wages to meet your obligations to pay the income tax. You have the right to “terminate your election” to volunteer. 40 The U.S. supreme Court has also confirmed the voluntary nature of income tax. The IRS admits this on the confidential, outside front cover of the confidential Handbook for Special Agents. “ AGENTS...Our tax system is based on voluntary assessment and voluntary compliance... the material contained in this handbook is confidential in character. It must not under any circumstances be made available to persons outside the service.” —Mr. Mortimer Caplan, IRS Commissioner Thus, if you have indeed volunteered into a contract, then you must abide by its terms and can be compelled to specific performance. If you fail to do so, you can be prosecuted by the IRS for “willful failure to file.” Quite frankly, it is very unlikely that you will be pro-secuted, and less probable that you’ll go to jail. Very few people get indicted or convicted for “willful failure to file.” Occasionally, they’ll pick a political target for an annual news story, then send the message through the media that if you don’t pay your taxes, you’ll go to jail. According to “ Goodbye April 15 th ”, only 125 people (in 1977) served prison time for “willful failure to file.” Thanks to the efforts of Lamar Hardy and the Research Foundation, the supreme Court ruled (1990—1991) that a taxpayer who sincerely believes that the tax laws do not apply to him/her cannot be criminally convicted for “willful failure to file.” 41 This has all but destroyed the ability of the IRS to successfully prosecute for “willful failure to file.” If you are indicted for “willful failure to file,” or wish to challenge the IRS authority, you can file for bankruptcy and take the IRS to Bankruptcy court where the burden of proof is on the IRS to prove their assessment and collection process was authorized, valid and correct with a “Motion to Dismiss IRS Claim.” If you contest a lien or levy in another venue or jurisdiction, the burden of proof is on you. After you prevail, then you can suspend the bankruptcy proceedings. There are many successful tax-reduction strategies for effectively “un-taxing” yourself, removing yourself form the contractual nexus, and challenging either the jurisdiction and/or the authority of the IRS to assess and collect any direct taxes upon individuals. Subtitle A & C income taxes are for federal employees, and U.S. citizens who have volunteered into the contract. There is no place in the Internal Revenue Code where an individual is required to file a tax return. The IRS Form 1040 is another fraud. The Paperwork Reduction Act (1980) requires that all legitimate federal forms have an OMB#, an expiration date, and a corresponding CFR reference. 23 Form 1040 has an OMB #1545-0074 in the top right corner, which is required by law. Whoops, it doesn’t have an expiration date, does it? When asked, the IRS cites the Code of Federal Regulations (26 CFR, Section 1.1-1) to conclude which individuals are required to file the Form 1040, but alas this citation is NOT about a “1040,” but rather a “Form 2555” on “foreign earned income” and with a different OMB #1545-0067. 42 > FORM 1040 —for federal government employees only (CFR 26,§31) > FORM 1041—for statutory trusts with EIN’s OR U.S. citizens with TIN’s or SSN’s; Eric Madsen asserts that the SSN is a trust I.D. # and nowhere in the Social Security Act does the number attach to an individual— therefore the 1041 would be the proper form to file; tax is calculated on the increase in value, not income; expenses are not taxable; labor is an expense; distribute any accounts receivable to a foreign trust as a beneficiary. > FORM 2555 —for independent, sovereign “state” Citizens (i.e., U.S. Citizens) or sovereign American non-resident aliens; $70,000 is tax-free on 2555; where “native tax country” is requested insert N/A; (See 26 CFR,§1.1-1). The April 15th deadline for filing individual tax returns is also a fraud. IRS Form 1120, also known as the “U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return” is the only OMB # 1545-0123 with an April 15th deadline. 43 For those who still choose to stay in the system and pay their taxes, never file on April 15th—get two extensions. There are only 3,000 cases per year selected for review or possible prosecution. If you delay your filing and get two extensions, you’ll be on the bottom of the stack for later in the year when there’s less staff available also. Eric Madsen and Team Law have developed advanced accounting strategies for those who choose to continue volunteering and aren’t ready to pull out of the system as a sovereign “state” Citizen. For example, the W-2 is a “debit form” reported from the employer account. Therefore, the withheld amount is a ”-” and the wages are a “+.” Now, the IRS forms 1040, 1041, 1065, 2555 are “credit forms” whereby the withheld amount is actually a “+” and the wages are a “-.” Thus by these accounting strategies, which are legitimate given the nature of the debt-based currency system, any “taxable” amount < 0 = 0. - 132 -"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Income Tax is Voluntary Eric Madsen & Team Law have developed an interesting audit strategy also. With this knowledge, you can welcome the audit if ever given the opportunity. Because a FRN is a liability not an asset. Simply ask them, “How can you pay a tax on a liability?” AND “How can your labor be paid as a deficit?” You can also hire professionals to assist you in preparing for an audit or have friends go in with you as a witness. 44 The IRS labels people who stop filing, stop paying, or challenges their jurisdiction and authority as “illegal tax protesters.” Now, does this mean the protesters are illegal or the tax is illegal? From the mouth of the beast comes a word to the wise, “The number of illegal tax protesters—persons who advocate and/or use schemes to evade paying taxes—has increased significantly in recent years. Since they represent a threat to our Nation’s voluntary tax system, IRS has taken some important counter-measures, including the establishment of a high-priority, illegal Tax Protester Program...” 45 “ Nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands. Taxes are enforced extractions, not voluntary contributions.” —supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter Washington Attorney Concludes IRS Has No Authority Washington state attorney, Steffan M. Bertsch has concluded that there is no authority for the IRS to seize any personal or real property in Washington State for alleged income tax liabilities from most citizens. Bertsch charges that the IRS is conducting an ongoing fraud that nearly everyone believes to be legal. He stumbled upon this information when a client challenged him to locate the section in the code that required ordinary people to file 1040 returns. He couldn't find it, so he contacted CPA’s, lawyers, tax attorneys, the IRS and even his tax professor. “The best answer I received,” says Bertsch, “was, that by implication, section 6012 required people to file.” Section 6012(1)(A) “Every individual having for the taxable year gross income which equals or exceeds the exemption amount, except that a return shall NOT be required of an individual...” He asked the state's Attorney General, Christine Gregoire to help expose the fraud. A Washington State Assistant Attorney General responded with a standard analysis of the government's justification of the IRS along with underlined sections. He quoted Title 26 of the United States Code, Section 6001 “ ...Every person liable for any tax imposed by this title...shall keep such records...make such returns, and comply...etc.” Mr. Bertsch replied with a letter explaining that “Title 26 of the United States Code operates much like a mirror image...The code applies to a select group of people. Those who are absolutely subject to the income tax portion of the IRC are federal employees...” Mr. Bertsch then wrote to Governor Lowry, who responded by saying that he does not have jurisdiction over IRS fraud because it is a federal matter. The governor suggested he contact his congressional delegation. Mr. Bertsch wrote back saying he would skip petitioning Congress since Congress created the IRS and that it encourages its actions. Further - more, the IRS is the collection agent that plunders the land on behalf of its master. The attorney asked the head of the Washington State Bar Association for help. Mr. Shea, President of the Bar suggested he contact the United States Attorneys and the Department of Justice. However, Mr. Bertsch responded that they are also too close to the fraud to be responsive. He then asked the Bar to advertise and accredit a seminar that he would prepare without charge to educate Washington's attorneys, with ample opportunity for U.S. Attorneys, the IRS or any other interested party to rebut his charges at the seminar. The Washington State Bar Association is apparently not interested in his offer. 46 Sovereign Citizenship & the IRS If the American people ever realized that they’re being duped by their government, that the government is not operating in the best interests of the American people, that the IRS is intimidating people and companies into extorting revenue unlawfully, many more American Citizens would stop paying income taxes immediately. Already, there are an estimated 30,000,000 non-filers. “ Goodbye April 15 th ” by Boston Tea Party estimates there are presently 3,600,000 hard-core tax resisters, patriots or sovereign state Citizens who have successfully untaxed themselves, 20,000,000 non-filers, and 100,000,000 loyal taxpayers who still dole out their tithe annually to the Federal Reserve without questioning authority, or the reasons for the income tax. 47 If you really knew how your income taxes were being spent, by whom, and for what purposes, you would stop paying income taxes immediately on a matter of principle, morality and ethics alone. If the American people ever woke up to these realities, the ability of the sovereign Power structure to effectively enslave the American people would stop tomorrow. You can stop paying income taxes lawfully, either by challenging jurisdiction as an American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen, or by challenging their unauthorized assessment and collection activities. But you must be careful interpreting the concealed and deceptive language of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The IRC was deliberately and masterfully written to deceive you into believing that you are a “person” required, and that your wages are “income.” Whether or not you are a “person” required to pay income taxes depends largely on your Citi - zenship, jurisdiction and the sources of “income” received within the federal United States. - 133 -"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Regarding your Citizenship and status, as established by American law, and reiterated in the IRC, you are defined as one of the following. Which one are you? > RESIDENT, U.S. citizen — residing in the District of Columbia (D.C.), or an unincorporated federal territory (Guam, Puerto Rico etc.,) and subject to federal jurisdiction and the federal income tax. > NON-RESIDENT, U.S. citizen — living abroad is still subject to federal jurisdiction and the federal income tax. > RESIDENT ALIEN, U.S. citizen — residing in one of the fifty corporate States in a federal area, subject to federal jurisdiction and the federal and State income tax, although a resident alien is foreign to the sovereign states. > NON-RESIDENT ALIEN, sovereign “state” Citizen — domiciled in one of the forty-eight, continental sovereign states, not subject to federal jurisdiction, or the federal or State income tax. “ You are presumed to be a non-resident alien [unless there is evidence to the contrary].” —26 U.S.C. 1.871-4 An American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen is a non- resident alien with regards to the federal United States and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), thus not subject to the tax. Caveat: Do not identify with the IRC denoted “non-resident alien” status, as it has gotten prison time for people like Philip Marsh. The federal United States and the Internal Revenue Service has no jurisdiction over sovereign “state” Citizens in any of the sovereign states of the republic. State governments can directly tax only foreigners (e.g. U.S. citizens or resident-aliens) in the State. A sovereign “state” Citizen domiciled in a sovereign state is not required to pay corporate State income or sales taxes, either. Reclaiming your sovereign “state” Citizenship, and giving notice to the IRS, will likely result in a letter stating all kinds of reasons why persons are required, and that courts have upheld this or that. Ignore these rants and raving of a rogue agency. Their conclusions in law are taken out of context. The IRS may ignore you, or continue their world famous intimidation tactics, harass or threaten you, attempt to lien, levy or garnish your assets if any are reachable and linkable to your SSN. You must be judgment and lien-proof before you take on the IRS and attempt to “un-tax” yourself from the beast. Caveat: We may very well have the law on our side, but that hasn’t ever stopped the IRS from operating unlawfully and fraudulently. The truth shall set you free! “ Our system of taxation is based upon voluntary assessment and payment, not upon distraint. [Distraint means force.]” —Flora vs. U.S., 362 US 145 Getting Lien and Judgment Proof The IRS has been designed to extort money, assets and property from the American people under the guise of as - sessing and collecting legitimate “income taxes.” It just ain’t so. If you’re poor as a church mouse or a pauper, have no mon - ey, assets or property then you needn’t be concerned about the IRS. They won’t have anything to do with you. If you do have money, assets or property, then you are a po - tential target whether you are am American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen, OR U.S. citizen. The sovereign “state” Citizen has two approaches to chal - lenge the IRS, the U.S. citizen only has one. As a sovereign, you can challenge their jurisdiction. As a sovereign or a U.S. citizen you can challenge the delega - tion of authority for the IRS to assess and collect taxes from you. You’ll be surprised to discover, the IRS has neither, unless you’ve volunteered into the contract. The costly price for entering into a “voluntary” contract with the federal government is 2,000 pages of the Internal Rev - enue Code (IRC), 4,000 pages of the Code of Federal Regu - lations (CFR), regarding federal and State income taxes that you must understand, even though very few professional tax attorneys can even grasp the immensity and complexity of the Code. Ignorance of the law is no excuse! Don’t expect the IRS to make it easy on you, or to give you information without erecting a few hurdles to discourage you. They will likely ignore you, stall indefinitely, lie profusely, quote the wrong or inappropriate IRC, distract you from the real issues, and routinely disrespect your honest requests for information. There are so many people that hate the IRS that it has come under Congressional scrutiny again. You have the right to demand information from the IRS, and to make them show their authority by law (5 U.S.C. §556), especially if they've taken any lien or levy ac - tion against you. When they IRS erects hurdles, you must be prepared to leap over them. With regards to all government agencies, it is always better to be two steps ahead of them and on the offensive, then two steps behind and on the defensive. If the IRS does not respond administratively to your request for information, then you have the right, through the Free - dom of Information Action (FOIA), to demand information from the IRS including a true, certified, and complete copy of: 48 1) Individual Master File (IMF) Transcript—Complete with the 6209 — decoding book. 2) Form 5546 — activity codes. - 134 -"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Getting Lien and Judgment Proof 3) Form 668W — Notice of Levy Service and Treasury Department authorization if they have sent you a Notice of Intent to Levy. If they have sent you a Form 2039—Summons, which is the first indication that the IRS is serious about getting their meat-hooks on your assets, then demand a true, certified and complete copy of: 4) Form 2039—Summons (including the header and the footer). These documents will reveal the fraudulent nature of the IRS and its collection activities. If they refuse to respond to your FOIA for information, then you must sue them in federal District Court under Title 5 U.S.C.§552. Requesting this information will buy you time to do the necessary research, and prepare litigation if necessary. If you’re unfortunate enough to have your assets liened, levied or wages garnished, it’ll take a court order to effectively release all liens, levy’s or garnishments. This could take three to six months and a lot of headaches, but it can be done without the legal fraternity confiscating a better part of your assets. You’ll have to climb into the legal arena and initiate lawsuits against the IRS to reclaim your assets. You can acquire legal assistance from a variety of sources, and it’ll cost anywhere from $1,500-$3,500 to get the liens released. 49 “ The IRS’s disregard of taxpayer’s rights confirms the worst fear that the American people have about the IRS. This illegal and offensive activity must stop and it’s clear that Congress must act.” —Senator David Pryor (D-Ark), USA Today Before the IRS attacks your assets, you’ll need to do some homework. First, you must revoke all contracts with the governments whereby you have “volunteered.” Then you must learn the American law, read books, take workshops, and create prima facie evidence, by affidavit, to support your status as a sovereign “state” Citizen, then make the evidence a matter of public record. Second, protect your assets! Third, reorganize all your business and financial affairs to reflect the highest degree of privacy possible. Utilize all freedom technologies available, both onshore and offshore to achieve these goals. Do not engage in business that requires 1099 reporting on you as an individual. Operate through business trusts, foreign entities, partnerships, international business corporations and other legal structures. Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Better to close the corral before the animals get loose. Once engaged defensively with the IRS, it’s harder to win as a defendant. Get your paperwork in order, get motivated, be two steps ahead and on the offensive, not the defensive. Get the IRS off your back BEFORE not AFTER you get a not-so- friendly notice, lien. levy or garnishment. If you’re engaged in a confrontation with the IRS, there are many lawful strategies for stopping an audit or investigation, stopping liens, garnishments or harassment by the IRS, and stopping their fraudulent assessment and collection activities. Make them prove their delegated authority.31 The IRS must, by law, answer these questions. The IRS cannot answer these questions, because it would expose the fact that the IRS has no delegated, lawful or legal authority to assess or collect income taxes, unless you have given them that authority. “It is requested of you in your official capacity, and requested of you as an individual person acting under color of your official capacity, that you answer the following list of questions, 32 in number, which government officials are required to answer under provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Freedom of Information Act and various other court decisions.” Good solid research, legal strategies that work, and the American law is your best defense and offense. Sovereign “state” Citizenship is one solid, working strategy for un- taxing yourself. Do not expect the courts to support your assertion of sovereignty. They will balk and attempt to derail you at every step of the road. Even U.S. citizens can challenge the unauthorized assessment and collection activity of the IRS, and collect damages if you prevail in court. 50 You can also file Title 42§§§1983, 1985, 1986 actions against the IRS agents personally, and in their official capacity, if they’ve violated your state or federal constitutional rights under “color of law.” Read between the lines of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Never trust anything the IRS agent tells you. Verify it with your own research. They are taught to lie, cheat and steal. Their business is to extort your money and property from you with the path of least resistance. The IRS agent is often the face of the friendly fascist, lying between their teeth with more miles of smiles than anyone. The IRS can be ruthless, Gestapo-like dictators, merciless tyrants if they think you are an ignorant and fearful American. They will steal the last dime from an old grandmother and put her in the streets with a shopping cart. Furthermore, they can intimidate others who will lie to incriminate you. Do not become another victim of the IRS. The IRS talks tough, intimidates the ignorant and fearful with mostly smoke and whistles. The fact is the IRS doesn’t have the lawful delegated authority—unless you give it to them by entering into a contract. It’s really that simple. 51 Make the IRS agent work extra hard on your case. IRS agents are notoriously lazy as are most government employees, unless they’re bucking for a promotion. In a criminal case, the IRS has to prove “willfulness,” which is very difficult, if not impossible, for them to do. If you’re misfortunate enough to appear in a Tax court, kicking and screaming, where the deck is solidly stacked against you, always argue your case initially from the ground floor— jurisdiction. Tax court has no authority to hear these matters, but the district court of the united states does. - 135 -"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook If you’re a sovereign “state” Citizen, then they have no jurisdiction. If jurisdiction has been proved with the preponderance of the evidence, or if you’re a U.S. citizen, then you must argue your case from the point of delegated authority. Make the IRS prove they had authorization by producing the original, signed contract with your name on it. Make them produce the Treasury Department authorization, the implementing statutes, and the levy order by a court of competent jurisdiction. Case dismissed. 52 Dealing With the Audit For over a year Josiah Hensen has been locked in a struggle with the IRS for allegedly filing “frivolous” tax returns for 1993 and 1994. Mr. Hensen filed a 1040 form and later filed a Form 1040X stating that he had overpaid. The IRS contends his claim of overpayment is frivolous and fined him over $1,000. Mr. Hensen sent numerous certified letters to the IRS in order to force them to explain the penalties, but got no answer. He finally forced a meeting with an agent by threatening to sue the agent if she did not respond. Two agents showed up for the meeting, along with a witness for Mr. Hensen, who taped the proceedings. At the meeting Mr. Hensen explained to the agents that they needed to provide the implementing regulation to him in order to enforce the statute (IRC Section 6702) against him. \"I have the right to ask you for it under section 6110 of the Internal Revenue Code, and you are to provide me with those documents right here,\" he said. When the agents tried to squirm out of it, he continued, \"IRS publication 609...says that anytime you send me any kind of notice, that you are to tell me what statute and what regulations.\" Again, the agents tried to disagree. \"According to California Bankers Association vs. Schultz and United States vs. Mersky, there must be an implementing enforcement regulation to give you the authority to enforce that statute. And I have the right to ask for those papers...that includes an assessment that you had to file with the Secretary's office and under sections 6065 of the Code, there has to be a statement on there that it was signed under penalty of perjury.\" The agents seemed confused but stuck to their guns. \"My job, Mr. Henson, is to collect tax,\" one of them insisted. The meeting ended soon thereafter with Mr. Henson threatening lawsuit under Sections 241 and 242 of Title 18, at which the agents abruptly left. The result: The day after the meeting, he received a \"Final Notice.\" Two days later Mr. Hensen told his story to the district director on the phone. He was then informed that according to the director's computer, there was no more debt--the penalties had mysteriously disappeared from the computer. Nevertheless, the IRS is pressuring Mr. Hensen's employer to start levying his paycheck. Mr. Hensen has threatened his employer with legal action and the case is still unresolved. 53 Performance Management & Recognition System Kickbacks It is becoming increasing apparent, in large part because of a conspiracy of silence, which has descended upon the District of Columbia in recent months, that President Clinton has a lot of explaining to do, in quite a few departments. One of the best suppressed stories of his administration thus far is evidence of White House kick-backs from the IRS for each and every indictment issued by federal grand juries against “illegal tax protestors,” whatever they are. The term itself is an oxymoron, because protest has never been illegal in America. Protest is even recognized by the federal government's precious Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for repudiating presentments in a lawful manner. So, for the phrase “illegal tax protestor” to withstand the obvious constitutional challenge (the First Amendment is still the law of the land), the adjective “illegal” must modify the noun “tax.” This is a telling admission on the part of our vaulted Congress of what many Americans have known for a long time, namely, the federal income tax is a total and utter fraud, from stem to stern. Our Ship of State is a sieve at sea that's riddled with loop-holes and sinking fast. What makes this term even more obnoxious is the way in which the IRS now attacks American “rebels” who dare to learn and speak the truth. A key page from the Internal Revenue Manual clearly shows that the President routinely receives $35,000 from the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS). We have a political prisoner in federal custody right now who is prepared to testify that the President receives this sum each and every time a federal grand jury issues an indictment against any illegal tax protestor (ITP). U.S. Attorneys receive a mere $25,000 per indictment of ITPs. Now, if the Department of Justice (DOJ) has a secret task force in place to attack ITPs who've become organized, like the former Pilot Connection Society which has been reported to have over 5,000 members, the President stands to rake in a tidy sum if his hench-persons in the DOJ succeed in bringing grand jury indictments against all 5,000. Let's see, 5,000 times $35,000 equals $175,000,000. The bad news for President Clinton is that the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) provides absolutely no authority for these “performance recognition rewards” (read “kick- backs”). Courts have consistently ruled that the IRM has no more authority than a pizza recipe when it comes to authorizing - 136 -"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine Performance Management & Recognition System Kickbacks salaries and other compensation for federal government employees. Federal employee salaries must be determined by Acts of Congress, and the IRM is a far cry from that high standard of law. Furthermore, the Constitution forbids the President from receiving any other “emoluments” during his term of office. See Article II, Section 1, Clause 7: “... he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” This is bad enough. But, when you couple these kick-backs with the perjury racket now rampant within the Department of Justice, and with a grand jury system which badly needs a complete overhaul, you quickly find that the indictments issuing from federal grand juries, for alleged violations of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), are really threats, engineered by the biggest extortion racket this planet has ever seen. Jury tampering, perjury, and obstruction of justice are terms which do a far better job of describing what is really going on. In one recent grand jury case, involving a subpoena for certain books and records, a federal judge in Arizona conspired with the Assistant U.S. Attorney to commit 27 counts of mail fraud, 27 counts of jury tampering, 27 counts of obstruction of justice, and 27 counts of conspiracy to commit all of the above. When a formal request was submitted to that grand jury to investigate probable violations of federal law, the judge intercepted this certified request, and all subsequent pleadings which were then directed to the grand jury, in order to keep them informed of what was really going on. These pleadings contained crucial evidence — you guessed it — of the PMRS kick-back racket, and of a pattern of deceit and lies dating back to a $4,797 fine imposed on him for repeatedly lying to a federal court in Phoenix. This was unprecedented for federal courts who almost never eat their own. Last but not least, the evidence is now overwhelming that the law which Congress enacted to qualify and convene all juries, both grand and trial, is horribly defective for exhibiting obvious class bias against sove-reign “state” Citizens who are not also federal citizens. The courts have consistently ruled that Americans can be state Citizens without also being federal citizens, whether or not the federal government's precious Fourteenth Amendment was properly approved and adopted (and we now know that it was not). Unfortunately for Congress, this class discrimination in the Jury Selection and Service Act, Title 28 United States Code Sections 1861 thru 1865, invalidates each and every federal grand jury indictment, and each and every federal trial jury verdict, ever since the end of the Civil War. The United States is now in very deep trouble for putting so many Americans in federal prisons, with absolutely no lawful authority whatsoever to do so. Couple that with the fact that the U.S. incarceration rate is twice as high as South Africa, which is second worldwide in prisoners per capita. Do you think maybe that the federal government may be running an extortion racket here, just for money? I think so. I know so. I can prove it. I am appalled. 54 Wages Are Not Income, But Property If you’re a non-resident alien, sovereign “state” Citizen, the IRS can tax only “income” derived from U.S. sources. The IRS will not allow an employee to deduct business expenses from wages because they know that wages are not “income,” and therefore can’t be offset by business expense deductions. You could file a Form 1041 as a U.S. citizen and deduct your wages as a expense! 55 If you’re a U.S. citizen, a federal government employee, or a non-resident alien, sovereign “state” Citizen effectively connected with a trade or business “within” the federal United States, then your IRC “wages” do fall under the IRC definition of gross income under Subtitle A & C, because you’ve accepted a federal government benefit, as a federal government employee. Revoke your SSN and stop working for the government! Otherwise, your “wages” are not “income” and not subject to backup withholding or the federal or State income tax regardless of your Citizenship status. Wages are also your property, and not subject to the income tax. “ [The IRS] taxes only income ‘derived’ from many different [U.S.] sources; one does not ‘derive income’ by rendering services and charging for them.” —Edwards vs. Keith, 231 Fed. Rep. 113 “ Income excludes wages, salaries, tips.” —Graves vs. People of N.Y. exrel O’Keefe 59 SCt 595 (1939) “Only about 10 million people are really ‘U.S. citizens’ or recipients of ‘U.S.’ income.” So how come most American Citizens have been paying income taxes on their wages? Because the IRS has tricked them into “volunteering,” and most Americans have not bothered to ask the right questions, do their own research, draw their own conclusions and act accordingly. The IRS presumes everyone in America to be ignorant and stupid until proven otherwise. This is a very profitable presumption on their part, for the principals/creditors of the federal United States. Since the federal United States government has been bankrupt since 1933, the IRS also presumes that private-sec - tor employees are within federal jurisdiction by unknowing - ly accepting a federal government privilege by accepting FRNs, which are taxable Treasury securities of the federal United States as payment, instead of lawful money. This is a far-fetched presumption that can be effectively challenged by reserving all your rights under the Uniform - 137 -"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Commercial Code (UCC) 1207. You cannot be compelled into a commercial contract, or receiving a benefit unless you volunteer with full and honest disclosure on behalf of the government. It could be argued that most Americans, whether private or public employees, have not been paid “lawful money” in their entire lives, therefore have derived no income whatsoever from any sources. A non-resident alien, sovereign “state” Citizen’s wages, income or property is, in fact, a tax-exempt “foreign estate.” So would the income or property of a foreign entity or trust. Your property is “foreign” to the federal United States if originating from sources “within” the sovereign states of the republic. If it doesn’t derive income from sources “within” the federal United States, or is it effectively connected with the performance of the functions of a public office within the federal United States, or its political subdivisions. Then, your property is protected by the IRC and is not taxable. 56 “ ...an estate or trust, as the case may be, the income of which comes from sources without the [federal] United States which is not effectively connected with the [performance of the functions of a public office] within the [federal] United States, is not includible in gross income under subtitle A.” —IRC, section 7701(a)(31) In order to maintain a tax-exempt foreign status, one must not receive ANY income directly from the federal government, or through any federal subsidized activities, or through any political subdivision thereof, or earn profits from U.S. sources. The sale of your property, including your labor, is also not taxable. When you deposit a check in the bank account of your foreign estate, make it “For Deposit Only” payable to your foreign estate. 57 Notice of Intent to Lien Notice of Levy A “Notice of Levy” must be supported by a court order by a court of competent jurisdiction to be actionable, otherwise due process has been violated. The IRC does preserve due process rights at §7804(b). IRS agents must execute garnishments, seizures, levies etc., through judicial process prescribed at IRC §7403, in relative part: Section 7403. Action to enforce lien or to subject property to payment of tax (b) Filing. In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax, or to discharge any liability in respect thereof, whether or not levy has been made, the Attorney General or his delegate, at the request of the Secretary, may direct a civil action to been filed in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the United States under this title with respect to such tax or liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the delinquent, or in which he has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax or liability... (c) Adjudication and decree. The court shall, after the parties have been duly notified of the action, proceed to adjudicate all matters involved therein and finally determine the merits of the claims to and liens upon the property, and in all cases where a claim or interest of the United States is therein established, may decree a sale of such property, by the proper officer of the court, and a distribution of the proceeds of such sales according to the findings of the court in respect to the interest of the parties and of the United States... The IRS “Notice of Levy” is a fraud on its face, as it reflects the number “1040” in the column under “Kind of Tax,” the signature on the document is not signed under penalties of perjury, as required by the IRC for all documents which have legal effect, and it does not bear the Treasury Department seal, as required at 26 CFR, Part 301.7514-1(a)(2)(ii). 26 CFR, Part 301.7515-1(c) states: “ Each seal of office established by this section may be affixed in lieu of the seal of the Treasury Department to any certificate or attestation required to be made by the officer for whose office such seal is established in authentication of originals...” For documents generated by IRS personnel to warrant judicial notice or have other lawful effect, as prescribed above, the authority to administer Subtitles A & C of the Internal Revenue Code in the continental United States is vested in the Treasury Department, not IRS or any other component of the Department of the Treasury, Puerto Rico. IRS merely has contracts to develop and maintain systems and provide record-keeping for the Treasury Department. Therefore, IRS personnel have no legal authority in the sovereign states of the republic party to the Constitution, and no document generated by the IRS has ANY lawful effect in the several states. The only implementing regulations published in the Federal Register for lien and levy-related statutes (IRC §6321 et seq. & §6331 et seq.) are under 27 CFR, Part 70. There are no general application legislative regulations for these statutes for 26 CFR, Parts 1, 31 or 301. The Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules is authorized in the Federal Register Act at 44 U.S.C. §5510 and regulations at 1 CFR, Part 8.5. See 44 U.S.C. §1507 & 1510 for requirements of the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations to be judicially noticed.

The IRS, or any other government official, local banks, insurance companies, employers, or private businesses commits an unlawful act by enforcing a “Notice of Levy” action on an alleged “taxpayer” without due process of law. They become accomplices in IRS fraud and grand theft. County sheriff’s departments are also expected to act as unpaid collecting agents for the federal government based on a “Notice of Levy” and seize property. Stop, look and listen.

How many trillions of dollars have been unlawfully extorted from hard working Americans without their consent or knowledge? Do you hear the march of tyranny descending upon this land as certain as the holocaust that once capitivated Germany? —Johnny Liberty Religious intolerance and racism played a major role in bringing the original constitutional republic to its knees. In 1776, the founding fathers had excluded Blacks, indigenous American people, women, and landless minorities from the sovereign Citizenship of We the People. If we are wise it would serve us not to make this mistake again. We the People must embrace the diversity of all cultures, religions and races. The European Power structures saw an opportunity to take back control and ownership of their rebel united states of America by waging a long-time, internal and secret war between the sovereigns (states and “state” Citizens), and the disenfranchised Blacks, women, and minorities (via the federal government and the 14th Amendment). This began prior to the Civil War and continues to this very day. This is part of a classical, historic distinction between the Republicans and the Democrats along with the Right vs. Left paradigm. The constitutional republic would eventually be replaced with an expanded legislative democracy from the Federal Reserve Act (1913) to the Buck Act (1940), imposing power and jurisdiction over the state republics through the manipulation of the economic and political system, the transfer of sovereignty from the states and its Citizens, and the co-opting of the American system of law. The federal government is directed and controlled by the lending policies of a private bank and it’s foreign principals/creditors, not the American citizens. We have been in a perpetual state of national emergency since 1933. 1 After the Great Depression, the increasing majority of both “state” Citizens and the disenfranchised would become U.S. citizens through a variety of adhesion contracts, giving up their rights and due process under the law. The remaining sovereign, “state” Citizens would dwindle to a minority class too preoccupied with power, money, privilege and preserving their assets to notice they were losing their grip on the republic and their freedoms as well. This culminated in the bankruptcies of the federal govern - ment, continually transferring more and more property of the sovereigns to the foreign principles/creditors through each Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This opened the door for glob - alist, international organizations (e.g., United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Agency for In - ternational Development, World Trade Organization) to step in and further direct and control the affairs of the bankrupt nation-states on behalf of the Power structures behind the New World Order. The goals of the New World Order are one in the same with the Communist Manifesto (1848). 2 • Abolition of all ordered, national governments • Abolition of patriotism and nationalism • Abolition & Confiscation of all private property • Abolition & Confiscation of all inheritance • Abolition of all religion • Abolition of the family and private education • Centralization of the means of production • Heavy and progressive tax • Creation of a New World Order “ A generous parent would have said, ‘if there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace.” —Thomas Paine, Common Sense 3 Our present day federal United States government has imposed burdens and restrictions on Americans that are comparable to the ones placed upon the Citizens of the Old World before they left for America. It’s time for another “Declaration of Independence.” Thomas Jefferson said it best. “ If we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for our callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people, like them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, and give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; And the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live, as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have no time to think, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; - 143 -"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers; And this is the tendency of all human governments.

Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression.” —Thomas Jefferson Republic Vs. Democracy In this educational process, it is essential to deepen the distinction between a “Republic” and a “Democracy.” There actually was a time in this country when the “Republicans” and “Democrats” held distinct, philosophical positions on the political spectrum. Democracy=Top-Down / Republic=Bottom-Up Today, those distinctions are all but meaningless as both political parties have surrendered their ideologies to the economic and political powers that put them into office, and keep them there to serve their interests not yours. Meanwhile, the federal United States has surrendered the sovereignty of the people and the government to foreign principals/creditors and sovereign Power structures. Both Republicans and Democrats are conspiring to rob the American people blind for their own personal and political self-interest then bill the “taxpayer” for the expense. Money and lust for power is still the prime motivation for elected officials to commit daily acts of treason. Americans have been reduced to mere taxpayers and consumers. Beware of the persistent lie that America is a “Democracy.” You’ll hear it incessantly in the media, and in political rhetoric from both Left and Right. You’ll hear the President pontificating about making the world “safe” for “Democra - cy.” The American “Republic” was co-opted by the Enroll - ment Act of the Civil War, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, generations of propaganda and misinformation, and many other encroachments. Here’s a definition of “Democracy.” > DEMOCRACY—Sovereign power is exercised by the whole body of citizens directly or indirectly through a system of representation, as distinguished from monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy; People are subject to the government they elect and the civil rights granted by the government; Large groups of people tyrannizing smaller groups, majority or mob rule through the political process; Results in tyranny of government and the masses; Government struc - tured from the top-down. “ ...[Democracies have been] found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.” —James Madison 4 Today, America is not a “democracy” by any stretch of the imagination, and never was intended to be. The founding fathers clearly disliked democratic forms of government. America is a “Republic,” with sovereignty vested in the state and it’s respective Citizens. Because the founding fathers had suffered under an oppressive British monarchy, a democracy was ruled out except for the House of Representatives which was elected by the popular vote. This issue was hotly debated. Here’s a definition of a “Republic.” > REPUBLIC— A Union, confederation, consortium, compact of sovereign states, free and independent nations; Sovereign states form an agency or corporation (e.g., federal government) to serve their common interests; Purpose of this agency or confederation is to establish justice, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare of the several states, and to represent the states in international matters (basis of federal law); Powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated; Government structured from the bottom-up. “ ...And to the Republic, for which it stands, one nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all” —Pledge of Allegiance The American Military Training Manual (1928) spelled out the distinctions between a Republic and a Democracy quite clearly. It’s doubtful whether you’d be able to find or read such “subversive” material today. Which form of govern - ment would you prefer? Do you recognize any of the at - tributes of Democracy in America today? Remember, Amer - ica was not founded as a “Democracy,” but a “Republic.” > DEMOCRACY —Government of the masses; Authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of direct expression; Results in a mobocracy; Attitude toward proper - ty is communistic, negating property rights; Attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate whether it be based upon deliberation or governed by passion, preju - dice and impulse without restraint or regard to conse - quences; Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discon - tent, anarchy.

We the People are sovereign “state” Citizens in relation to the national and federal government. All newly admitted states were guaranteed a “republican” form of government by the Constitution. The original 13 colonies, as freely associated compact states, the Union of states, or the united states of America are also sovereign in relationship to the national and federal United States government. 19 Republic = Sovereignty Of The People “A Republican form of government is one in which sovereign power resides in and is exercised by the people through their own elected representatives... The only Constitutional provision made for Democracy was the election of political representatives (e.g., House of Representatives), whose power is sharply defined and contained. Thus, minorities are relatively safe from the voting tyranny of majorities. The American Republic was designed to protect us from both tyranny by government, and tyranny by the masses.” 5 “ I love the man who can smile at trouble; that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection.” —Thomas Paine, Common Sense 8 Manufactured Wars, Revolutions & Conflict In piecing together world history over the last few hundred years not taught in school, a serious and independent historian can easily conclude that nothing in politics and few major world events ever happens by accident. It is all planned, sometimes years, decades or a generation ahead of the actual events by self-appointed individuals and institutions behind the scenes of the apparent Power struc - ture. It is no longer in the domain of “conspiracy theories”, as it is now provable “conspiracy fact”. It is by design the economic crashes, world wars, revolutions and conflicts are created to further the aims of those pulling the puppet strings of world leaders, governments, corporations, banks, media and the people's attitudes and mindsets. It is coordinated across national boundaries with little con - cern for the sovereignty of nations or the rights or lives of the people. “If you want nations to give up their sovereignty and hand over decisions and power to a world authority, it won't just happen. You have to make it happen by causing conflict between nations on the principle of problem - reac - tion - solution.” 9 There are those who have real power con - trasted with those who have the apparent power. Don’t be confused by this illusion. “Still today, the power lies not with the politicians, but with the shadowy figures who ‘advise’ and control them, and those who manipulate the flow of in - formation into the public arena.” 10 Thesis vs. Anti-Thesis = Synthesis Hegelian principles have been used time and time again with such consistent and predictable results as to be a viable strategy for world conquest - one stepping stone at a time. The global elite has orchestrated these events for generations, creating and funding organizations to support one side of a conflict, while with the other hand they were also creating and funding the other side. The illusions of Left and Right being different sides of the political spectrum must be abandoned forever. They are two sides of the same coin tossed in the wishing well of world government, a centralized world bank, a world army and a micro-chipped world population. WWI, WWII, the Russian Revolution and the formation of the State of Israel are four well-documented examples of Hegelian principles in action. They are briefly outlined below. 11 Carroll Quigley said the House of Morgan was infiltrating Left-wing groups from around 1915. It was the strategy to hijack both Left and Right domestically and internationally. 12 If there are two sides of the political spectrum, it would be based on twomindsets: > FEAR —one which wishes to imprison, manipulate & control. > LOVE — one which wishes to free, empower and manifest human potentials; maintain cultural diversity. All other political mindsets as we know them including democracy, capitalism, socialism, communism and fascism are based on the fear-based model. It's time for an emerging new politics based on love, freedom and human possibilities. Who Won the American Revolution? There was deceit and trickery behind the scenes of the first American Revolution against the British, and every war to follow. The sovereign Power structures did not ultimately lose the American Revolution, they simply regrouped and continu- ed their assault in the political, economic and legal realms. European corporations were deeply invested in the com - merce of the newly formed Union. International bankers had invested in both sides of the war, and profited immense - ly from the perpetual war machine—then as they do today. The Declaration of Independence spelled out clearly the reasons for the first American Revolution. Thomas Paine wrote the revolutionary manifesto Common Sense, which is attributed to inspiring and motivating participation in the first American Revolution.

The American people, especially the white male property owners, wanted to reclaim their sovereignty from the King of England. So We the People drafted the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation to declare our sovereignty, fought the American Revolution to defend that unalienable right, and authored the Constitution for the united states of America to establish a federal corporation and national government to represent the commercial interests of the Union of state republics. “ Posterity, you will never know how much it cost the present generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that ever I took half the pains to preserve it.” —John Adams Who won the first American Revolution? Although “...the British Empire as a world government lost the American Revolution, the sovereign Power structure behind it did not lose, they profited from both sides. The most visible of the Power structure was the East India Company, an entirely private enterprise whose flag, as adopted by Queen Elizabeth in 1600, happened to have thirteen red and white horizontal stripes with a blue rectangle in its upper left-hand corner. When George Washington took command of the U.S. Continental Army ...the flag used for that occasion was the East India Company’s flag...by pure coincidence. While the British government lost the 1776 war, the East India Company’s owners who constituted the invisible, Power structure behind the British government not only did not lose but moved right into the new united states of America economy along with the latter’s most powerful landowners.” 13 Who Contrived the French Revolution? [Editor’s Note: Thanks to David Icke, The Truth Shall Set You Free, for the extensive research and analysis.] In old Europe, monarchies were problematic as they were clearly dictatorships. Sustaining such governments were difficult over time. The people had no rights, no freedom and the times they were a constantly changing. In a monarchy, inevitably the people would rebel and demand their freedoms. So people’s “democracies” were ingeniously created by the sovereign Power structure to give the appearance of “people power” and appease the masses. Give the people the appearance of freedom and they’ll likely believe it. Give them a vote. Give them a voice. Let them protest. Let them march and yell all they want. The only difference between a monarchy and a democracy was that the people “believed” they were free in a democracy, whereby they knew they weren’t free in an monarchy. All revolutions since the American Revolution were orchestrated towards this end. Both Left and Right were created to give the appearance of this superficial distinction. Both Left and Right have been invented and controlled to keep the status quo perpetually in power. The French Revolution of 1789 was a perfect example of such a strategy, the first Illuminati coup d’etat, the methods of which have been repeated to replace “undemocratic” monarchies with undemocratic “people's parliaments” throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Ironically, the French Revolution wasn't organized by French people any more than the Russian Revolution was a hundred or so years later. The techniques for implementing a “people's revolution” or coup d’etat are simple: 1. Create a financial crisis to impoverish the spirit of the people and arouse their anger. 2. Dupe or buy out influential people to support the cause without comprehending the underlying agenda. 3. Dump or sell-out these leaders and any opposition once their purpose is served through character assassination, betrayals. 4. Disseminate mass propaganda to arouse the passions of the people to revolt. 5. Exploit, dis-inform and lead the sheeple in the desired direction. 6. Organize mobs to cause agitation; and finally, 7. Install a phony “democracy” or alternative dictatorship. Fascism and communism are not opposites, only promoted as such. Don’t be fooled. Both involve centralized control by a tiny elite. The real political choices are: • Freedom of expression, thought and lifestyle • Authoritarianism (Fascism/Marxism-Leninism). 14 Who Makes the Money, Makes the Wars?

Between 1944 - 1962, the Federal Reserve Bank went bankrupt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and remains so today. The American republic was co-opted by sovereign Power structures and international banking families and eventually replaced with a “democraticsocialist-corporate” state under a perpetual declared state of national emergency. Today, the American empire is in dramatic decline and rapid “reorganization” into a world government under foreign control and ownership. Behind the scenes of all wars are sovereign Power structures competing or cooperating for a greater market-share of control, power and domination over others. Who will dominate? Who will control? Who will gain land, property and power? Wars are fought between Sovereigns, nations, corporations, and ideologies for power and control, although they may occasionally rally round some flag for the sake of the mainstream media gluttons for “news,” and boast of their intellectual or moral superiority. There has not been a war in the last two centuries that has not been financed and sold to the American people on the premise of lies, deceit, and a so-called foreign policy which was not in the best interests of the American people. The federal United States government has been at war against the American people since the War Powers and Trading With the Enemy Acts of 1917. 15 Transnational, American-based corporations were socialized via President Roosevelt’s “New Deal (1933),” abandoning all but lip service for the “free enterprise” system and free- market capitalism. Today, We the American people are “subjects” under the old Ruler’s law, as the British have always been, quietly and meekly surrendering our sovereignty, our independence, our unalienable rights, our property, and our Constitution and Bill of Rights to foreign powers. History has a way of repeating itself. One who doesn’t learn from the past is condemned to repeat it. The same story is repeated time and time again throughout history. Dare I ask? Who won World War I? Who won World War II? Who will win World War III? Who is busy creating the next conflict to inflict fear and terror in the people and reap huge profits on the carnage? Isn’t it ironic that two of the world’s largest economies are Germany and Japan who supposedly lost World War II, while the “victorious” Americans have bankrupted themselves by becoming the “world’s policeman” and only remaining “superpower.” The Soviet Union has already hit the dust. Obviously, the invisible, sovereign Power structure behind the Germans and Japanese appear to have won WWII. What was their agenda? Was it the same agenda as those who orchestrated Korea or Vietnam? Who won the Vietnam War? Certainly not the American soldiers who fought and were killed. Certainly not the American people who are still shouldering the debt from the war, both economically and spiritually. Certainly not the Vietnamese people who were murdered like animals. That war further divided an already hurting nation with the assassination of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. A healing has still not happened in this country. Today, the frontline of any war is the hired guns of the public relations departments paid by government spin doctors, selling skeptical yet gullible Citizens on wars that don’t represent their interests at all, but are ultimately being fought between sovereign Power structures for their narrow self-interests. The Gulf War in Iraq brought the public relations, propaganda machine to its peak of performance, with a well- orchestrated “disinformation” campaign more effective than any I’ve witnessed in my life. Dissent was completely silenced in the media including the so-called alternative press, more effectively than ever before. Yet, every war preceding it was also sold by lies, disinformation and outright propaganda campaigns against the enemy, which included the American people. Besides the Middle Eastern oil interests and George Bush, guess who won the Gulf War in Iraq? The same old sovereign Power structures are still winning at American and allied taxpayer expense. The Gulf War successfully transformed the United Nations from a “peacekeeping” force and militarized the United Nations into an instrument of global empire operating on behalf of both visible and invisible sovereign Power structures. With the now-declared economic, political and moral bankruptcy of the former Soviet Union, sovereign Power structures are full steam ahead with the rapid, tech-nological deployment of centralized, world government. Here comes the legacy of George Bush and the “New World Order” with the Clinton Administration right behind in support of NAFTA and GATT, and the wholesale theft of what remains of the sovereignty of the united states of America. This is business as usual in Washington D.C. (i.e., District of Criminals). There are many hard questions that must be asked, and answered. How many Americans really supported the Gulf War? Why was there little or no dissent reported through the politically controlled mainstream media? Why is the United Nations in Somalia? (Oil?) Why is the United Nations in Haiti? Why did the United Nations and NATO allow the atrocities in Bosnia and Rwanda to continue? (No economic interest?) Where else are sovereign Power structures operating behind the scenes of current events (e.g., Bosnia, Mexico, Chiapas, Indonesia, Japan)? Read between the lines of your daily newspaper. Don’t believe what you see on television or hear on National Public Radio (NPR)? Do your own research. Confirm your own sources. Think for yourself.

The American Civil War was not fought to emancipate the slaves, but to defeat state sovereignty over the federal government. South Carolina seceded from the Union in December 1860, signaling the onset of the Civil War. The contention of many southern legislators was the states retained full sovereign rights as co-signers of the Constitution, including the right to secede from the Union. President Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated in March 1861. Another proposed 13 th Amendment was signed by President Lincoln in 1861, but only one state had ratified it before the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln had signed a resolve that would have permitted slavery, and upheld states’ rights. “ No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.” —Proposed “13 th ” Amendment [not passed] 16 The Civil War was an attempt by European sovereign Power structures to split the united states of America into two separate countries. “The North [would] be controlled through the banking interests of England (i.e., Bank of England), the South through the banking interests of France (i.e., Bank of France). Both systems of banking were controlled ultimately by the Rothchilds. The Tsar of Russia literally saved the Union and prevented the actual invasion from Mexico of troops from England, France and Spain to insure that the division of the united states of America would not take place. Tsar Alexander II threatened war with each of those countries if they invaded the united states of America.” 17 That the Black slaves were “emancipated” at the end of the Civil War appears to have been an economic sanction against the rebel South, not the morally superior or righteous idealism of the Northern abolitionists. Black slaves were considered private property, and the government cannot take private property without just compensation. Because Citizenship was determined by the state, not the federal government, Citizens in all the Union states were divided as to whether or not the Black slaves ought to be freed and Black freemen ought to have the right of “state” Citizenship that white male property owners enjoyed. The U.S. supreme Court was also unresponsive to social legislation, or to claims of individual rights for the Blacks. Racism has always been central to America’s political agenda at all levels of government, and a hotly debated and contentious issue since the founding of the republic. Abraham Lincoln, though portrayed as righteous in others areas of his life, did not personally believe in the equality of the races as evidenced by his quote below. “ I will say...that I am not...in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races... am not in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition... that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.” —Abraham Lincoln 18 “ Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” —”13 th (or 14 th ) Amendment” The “13 th Amendment” (which was actually the 14 th , as an - other 13 th Amendment had already been ratified prior to the Civil War) freed the slaves from physical bondage. The Re - construction period after the Civil War involved a military coup d’etat by the federal United States government. Military and martial law was declared (i.e., Enrollment Act of 1863) and it has not been effectively lifted since the Civil War. The Admiralty/Maritime/Military/Martial law flag with a “goldfringe” was placed in many state courts across the country signifying emergency war powers were in effect and the Constitution was in effect suspended. Admiralty/Maritime law has been the primary jurisdiction of federal courts since the Constitution. Southern senators were taken out of office by force during the Civil War and replaced with military officers who then voted for the “14 th Amendment” (actually the 15 th ). The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment was adopted under martial law. If and when martial law ends, so do all the so-called “laws” instituted under military authority. The 14th (or 15th) Amendment was a fraud from the beginning instituted during times of great instability and duress for the nation. The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment was not lawfully ratified by the required 2/3 of the Union of states. The 13 th , 14 th , & 15 th Amendments (actually the 14 th , 15 th & 16 th ), also known as the Reconstruction Amendments, were declared to be ratified in a proclamation by the Secretary of State (July 28, 1868) with attempted withdrawals by Ohio and New Jersey. - 148 -"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten Emancipation or Slavery for All? “ While the Union survived the Civil War, the Constitution did not... in its place arose a more promising basis for justice and equality, the 14 th Amendment.” —Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall (May 6, 1987) “ As long as the Constitution endured, this supreme Court must exist with it, deciding in peaceful forms of judicial proceedings the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties.” —Judge Taney The sovereign “state” Citizens of the South became prisoners of war after the conclusion of the hostilities, and were forced, along with all the southern states, to accept the federal government as their superior authority. This included the unconditional surrender of the sovereignty of the southern states and the southern “state” Citizens, who like the former slaves, became 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment “U.S. citizens,” subjects and property of the federal government also. To be relegated to the same class and Citizenship as the newly freed Black slaves created huge amounts of animosity, hatred and resentment by southern whites, not only toward the federal government but especially toward the newly freed Black slaves. But instead of focusing on the federal government as the object of their rage, race became the issue and continues to this very day. The “emancipated” Black slaves suffered tremendous abuse and inappropriate scapegoating by the newly disenfran - chised southern “state” Citizens. This fueled racial hatred, which has continued to this very day in the South and around the country. These true “hate crimes” are a symptom still, of the deep divide between North and South. What’s now considered “white supremacy” is a twisted and distorted version of the southern “state” Citizens maligned attempt at restoring their own beleaguered sovereignty. Somehow the federal government got off the hook and Black people got the brunt. Outfits like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rode the passions of this resentment and hatred and executed acts of terrorism against Blacks for generations. The claim that the South was going to rise again, just never materialized. It was beaten and it’s sovereignty destroyed, except in the hearts and minds of many southern leaders who held true to the old republic, despite it’s defeat. The Civil War, instead of freeing the slaves, made slaves and chattel property of everyone south of the Mason-Dixon line. Original 13 th Amendment The sovereign Power structures of Europe were actively infiltrating the new government of the United States, and offering special favors, benefits and endowments to government officials too weak-minded and greedy to stand for the Republic. These foreign powers offered various Titles and honors to men who would betray their own country, and represent their interests instead. “ No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the [federal] United States.” —Constitution for the usA [1:9:7] The issue of “Titles of Nobility” was so important to the founding fathers for the preservation of the Republic that “another 13 th Amendment,” besides the one we’re familiar with that freed the slaves, was passed and ratified in the early 1800’s. As you’ll see, this was perhaps the most important amendment to the original Constitution for the united states of America and it prevented anyone from holding office in the government of the United States if they received any Title or benefit from a foreign power. “ Neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” —13 th (or 14 th ) Amendment, (3 rd ) Constitution of the United States But the “original 13 th Amendment” was mysteriously “edited” and turned up “missing” from all copies of the 3 rd Constitution of the United States (1868) published after the Civil War, but had been, prior to 1868, published in hundreds of official copies of the 1 st and 2 nd Constitutions in thirteen (13) states. American history books and the present U.S. Congress maintain that it was never ratified by the necessary 13 states, but we have certified evidence to prove that it was. To what ends will men go to deceive their brothers and sisters?

Therefore, the 14 th Amendment, as we know it today, is actually the 15 th Amendment under the 1st Constitution. Henceforth, we shall refer to the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment as such. The “14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment” gave the newly freed Black slaves very limited “civil rights” by creating the “U.S. citizen.” The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment “U.S. citizen” ultimately expanded the jurisdiction and authority of the federal United States beyond the constitutionally specified and limited 63 square miles of the District of Columbia (D.C.) into the sovereign states whereever a “U.S. citizen” resided. The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment is the backbone of the constructive fraud perpetrated on the American people to “waive” their rights and lawful American National OR sovereign “state” Citizenship. Birth certificates were created after the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment for the children of the newly freed Black slaves to enroll them as chattel property of the federal United States government. Therefore, if you have a Birth Certificate, you are the child of a former Black freeman. Birth certificates presently enroll all “U.S. citizens” as subjects and chattel property under the ex - clusive legislative democracy of the District of Columbia via the Census Bureau at the Department of Commerce. 21 “ All ‘persons’ born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the [federal] United States and of the [federal] state wherein they reside.” —14 th Amendment (or 15 th ) (July 28, 1868) 22 The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment created legal “persons” (i.e., corporations, trusts, U.S. citizens) and gave these legal fictions the “civil right” to hold “equitable interest” in property that previously could only be “owned” in allo-dium by a living human being or sovereign “state” Citizen. This opened up the door for corporations (domestic and foreign) to acquire equitable interest in properties not available to them in the pre-Civil War republic. The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment was clearly as unconstitu- tional as the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which had already been declared unconstitutional by the U.S. supreme Court. The federal United States government had conferred a “Title of Nobility” on these newly manufactured “U.S. citizens” by granting certain benefits, privileges, and securities to any “person” who accepted them. This was another return to Ruler’s Law. Granting “Titles of Nobility” to any “person” was strictly forbidden by the Constitution. 23 The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment served the growing “feder- alist” movement well, centralizing more and more power within the federal United States government at the expense of the states and their respective “state” Citizens. The sovereign American and Global Power structure behind the federalist movement was slowly, but purposefully, encroaching upon the sovereignty of the people of the united states of America. “ A person is born subject to the jurisdiction of the [federal] United States... if his birth occurs in territory over which the [federal] United States is sovereign, even though another country provides all governmental services within the territory and the territory is subsequently ceded to the other country.” —3Am Jur2d, section 1419 The federal United States government corporation, and the sovereign Power structure operating behind the scenes, had clear intent of expanding and exploiting fraud after fraud, through coercion and war if necessary, until such time as there were no sovereign “state” Citizens independent and free in any of the 48 sovereign states. Without the sovereignty of the states and its respective Citi - zens, who will remain to question the authority or jurisdic - tion of these foreign and domestic sovereign powers behind the federal government who want to be our Kings / Queens / Popes at the helm of the New World Order? We the People are the ultimate check against the centralization of government and corporate power in the hands of the few. The 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment also replaced sovereign unalienable rights with government-granted privileges or “civil rights.” Any reference to the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amend-ment maintaining unalienable rights over privileges is invalid.

Thus the federal United States could justify borrowing from the international bankers and making U.S. citizens, not sovereign “state” Citizens, accountable for the repayment of the debt. This paved the way for the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the federal United States bankruptcies that followed. “ The validity of the public debt of the United States... shall not be questioned.” —14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment Instead of the 13 th (or 14 th ) Amendment actually emanci- pating the slaves, the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment ultimately made “economic slaves” of every American Citizen by “volunteering” your “person” into servitude without your knowledge or consent.

State governments followed suit. Although today, all Superior courts still have a place in which one can file an “at-Law” action, there are no longer “qualified judges” who can hear at-Law actions. Although, Superior courts in many states still have the power to naturalize a Citizen directly into the state, very few of them have ever done so. Judges acquire a special privilege from the Bar Association to be titled “Attorney at-Law,” “Esquire,” and as such their “Title of Nobility,” which along with their own U.S. citizenship, disqualifies them from ruling “Without Prejudice” (or bias) on at-Law actions. Titles of Nobility were strictly forbidden by the 1st Constitution for the usA as the founding fathers understood the dangers in allowing the legal fraternity to gain a foothold in the government. Titles of Nobility bestow special privileges to a select class or people (e.g., U.S. citizen, person, employee, driver, resident, attorney, esquire, your honor...). Our nation of sovereign states stopped functioning at-Law after U.S. Senators were no longer appointed by the state legislature according to the organic law of the Constitution for the usA, and after the undeclared bankruptcy of the federal United States. The 17 th (or 18 th ) Amendment called for the direct election of U.S. Senators and eliminated the sovereign states direct veto power over acts of the U.S. Congress. The Union of sovereign states has not ratified any corporate United States bill, statute, resolution, war, treaty, policy or doctrine since the 17 th (or 18 th ) Amendment (1914). Each state legislature must take their sovereign perogative to re-exercise its appointment power and put itself back into the equation of lawmaking. Introduced April 5, 1911, HJR 39 falsely proposed the ¾ rule applied to the passage of the 17 th (or 18 th ) Amendment. Article V of the Constitution for the usA specifies that “no state without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.” Many states at that time that did not consent to give up their representation. Each state to reenter the Union of states under the Constitution must appoint U.S. Senators through their respective legislatures, ratified by a de jure governor and revoke the 17 th (or 18 th ) Amendment. 26 Corporations Born & Enthroned Before the Civil War, only natural-born, sovereign “state” Citizens could hold allodial title to land and property in the united states of America. Corporations were forbidden from owning land or property held in allodium. The sovereign Power structures of Europe could not own or control the land and property of the united states of America through the corporations and commercial enterprises they controlled. They had to devise a scheme whereby corporations could have “rights” equal or superior to We the People. These sovereign Power structures including international banking families and the old monarchies conspired to create war and division, bank panics and economic unrest that led to the breaking apart of the Republic into North and South. The Civil War was fought not only to destroy the the princi - ple of state sovereignty, but to enthrone the corporation as a “citizen” with “civil rights” greater than those of the sovereign “state” Citizens and the sovereign state republics. Not coincidentally, the “United States Inc.” was incorporated by the “Government & Corporations Act (1868).” This was the birth-date of a federal corporation which trademarked names such as USA, United States and America. This began the trend toward corporate dominance in America led by none other than the federal government in its corporate capacity.

Giant corpora - tions are causing harm to life, livelihood, and democracy ev - erywhere, and people have been bravely resisting them. But citizen groups have mostly been limiting their efforts to symptoms of corporate rule: deadly chemicals, toxic dumps, union busting, clear-cuts, factory closings, large-scale disas - ters, corruption of an election here, buying of a legislature there, and news corporations distortion of the truth. These struggles have been important, and people have won important victories. But let's face it, these struggles are not adding up. Corporations are wealthier and more powerful than ever. Each generation is brought up to accept that what corporate leaders believe is good must be good for our communities, good for our health and environment, good for democracy. People think we are irreversibly dependent upon giant corporations. We're taught that the corporate system is normal, the height of efficiency and wisdom. Our culture is very much a corporate culture, and it is reinforcing this nonsense all the time. Most people know that corporations are ruining our lives, and that this is contrary to the theory of self-governance, contrary to the ideals of the American Revolution. We've got to make this the subject of public outcry and the focus of citizen organizing. Corporations decide how our food is grown and distributed, how we heat and light our homes, how we travel, what poisons we breathe and drink and eat. They decide who works, doing what, how wealth is shared, what controversies get attention, what analyses and solutions are acceptable, who gets elected to public office, how this nation treats other nations.” “ This is a government of the people, by the people and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations.” —U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes We the People are the ones who are supposed to be in charge of the country, have almost no legal standing in the courts of this land. The underlying idea was that the people were sovereign, and corporations were mere creatures of the sovereign people. That’s why all state legislatures reserved the right both to amend and/or revoke the charters of corporations. 28 If indeed the people are sovereign and the corporations are mere creations, then We the People must reclaim our sovereignty to restore the necessary checks and balances against the excessive accumulation of power by corporations and other legal fictions. To end corporate dominance, as many on the progressive Left are rallying for, requires the will and courage to restore a Republic, not a Democracy, in these united states of America. Otherwise it’s all lip-service and talk is cheap. We the People need to put the corporations, both the government and private, transnational corporations, back into the chains of the Constitution where they belong.

Thanks to David Icke’s, The Truth Shall Set You Free, for the research. Here’s a brief summary of the events and how they trans- pired. They read like a Hollywood script of an action thriller. The difference was that millions of people were killed in this movie, planned, financed and orchestrated by the interna- tional bankers and the sovereign Power Structure. If you still think wars are accidents, think again. • The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was carried out by a secret society in Sarajevo controlled by the Elite called \"Black Hand.\" • Austria accused Serbia of the murder. • The Czar's most influential advisor was attacked with a knife on the same day, at the same hour in Russia. • Kaiser Wilhelm supported Austria and declared war on Russia and France. • Britain came in against Germany and so did the USA. • German sinking of the Lusitania was an excuse for America to declare war. It was a passenger ship carrying arms to Britain sailing into an area of known U-boat activity, and the people on board were sacrificed to satisfy the Elites ambitions. • Carnegie, Rockefeller and Ford families profited immensely and engineered the war behind the scenes for their own benefit. • Changing the way people lived and thought was the main point of the war. • Tens of millions of people were dead and injured on all sides. The bloodiest conflict in human history. • The global elite won the war. The face of Europe and the international community was changed forever. Europe was devastated and submerged in debt to the Elite's bankers. Britain owed the U.S. $4.7 billion in war debts. 30 • Morgan Guaranty Trust and the American Internatio- nal Corporation made loans to finance German espionage and covert operations in the U.S. and South America during the war. 31 • League of Nations and World Court in The Hague were formed. 32 • Control of Palestine was given to the British. • $12 billion in reparations from Germany set the economic stage for WWII and the death of the Weimer Republic. 33 Who Bought and Sold Out the Russian Revolution? Editor’s Note: History does repeat itself, especially when it’s orchestrated and planned. Here’s another example of a people’s revolution co-opted by the sovereign Power Structure. • Czar was manipulated by the Rothschilds into a war with Japan in 1905 to undermine the Russian economy and sow the seeds of unrest. • Rothschild’s company Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. was secretly funding the Japanese from America. • The war with Germany further weakened Russia. • Sending inferior armaments or delaying the delivery was one strategy for assuring one side wins or loses. Armaments ordered for the Russian Army were months overdue fueling the fires of revolution and discontent. • Dissension was being stirred from within. • Several moderate revolutions occurred before Trotsky and Lenin arrived to introduce despotic rule. • This was a coup d’ etat on Russia by the United States financial arm of the global elite largely controlled by the Rothschilds. • Woodrow Wilson made it possible for Trotsky to enter Russia with an American passport. Trotsky was German not Russian. • The boogeyman of “communism” was being created to stimulate the division of fear and mistrust. • American International Corporation was formed in 1915 to fund the Russian Revolution. Directors represented the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, DuPonts, Kuhn, Loeb, Harriman and the Federal Reserve. • Used the cover of a Red Cross mission to arrange the final details of the Bolshevik takeover. • Otto Kahn and the Morgan Guaranty Trust formed a group called United Americans which circulated anticommunist and anti-Jewish propaganda. This allowed genuine opponents of the Russian revolution to be dismissed as “anti-semitic.” • The British also backed the Bolsheviks. • The hated secret service of the Tsars was revamped into the notorious KGB. • The so-called “people’s revolution” would turn hundreds of millions of people into little more than prisoners in their own land and cause the death and suffering in the concentration camps. • The foundation of the Cold War had begun. - 153 -"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook \"The truth of the matter was... that there was a conspiracy, but it was neither Jewish, nor Catholic, nor Masonic.

Antelman Borrowing Forever from the Future: Your Children Will “Pay” for it When there was no central bank, the federal United States government had to live within its means. Imagine that! In hindsight, that’s not such a bad idea. The founding fathers knew what they were talking about when they vehemently opposed a central bank at the beginning of the republic. When the federal United States government needed to borrow “money,” it had to borrow directly from the people by selling government securities (i.e., U.S. savings bonds, U.S. war bonds). Prior to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, if the people didn’t want to go to war or finance the legislation passed by the U.S. Congress, then they simply didn’t buy the bonds. American Nationals and “state” Citizens had direct veto power over the spending of the U.S. Congress. All these checks and balances didn’t please the European bankers, as it didn’t make them any substantial profits. So the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was created and foisted on the American people with the greatest of deceit. 36 The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 offered an unlimited credit line to the federal United States government thus bypassing the will of the American people, and this ultimate check and balance against government spending. Since then, the federal government has borrowed directly from the Federal Reserve Bank, forcing the American people to indirectly lend them the money without their knowledge or consent, obligating them to pay the debt through the income tax. This is the fundamental evil of “monetizing the public debt.” It no longer mattered what the American people wanted. The international bankers were now in control of the American political machinery, and they have been ever since. 37 War and Preparation for War: Your Children Will “Die” in it Prior to World War I, the American people were politically neutral regarding Europe and its many battles and cultural rivalries. The primary measure of wealth in those days was “land” and the American people owned lots of it outright, and free and clear. There were no typical bank mortgages or loans. There weren’t many consumer items to buy with the wealth being generated from working the land. Land was held in “allodium” without any liens or encumbrances on it. By and by the American people were pretty happy. Getting involved in any European war was not a popular idea with the American people. They had refused to buy savings bonds to finance World War I. So in stepped the spin doctors along with the international bankers to insure that We the People would fight, die and pay for their bloody little war. The international bankers were lusty for war, as it burgeoned their coffers and inflated their egos and lust for power. This was a war that would change the shape of the world forever. A massive public relations (i.e., propaganda) campaign was waged to convince the American people that this was a war worth getting involved in, that freedom and democracy were threatened, that it was the “American” thing to do. What appeared to be a war against “some fool thing in the Balkans (i.e., Sarajevo)” was actually a war between competing sovereign Power structures trying to dominate the high seas “line of supply.” These sovereign Power structures struggled for mastery over the high seas trafficking in precious metals (i.e., gold and silver), with behind-the-scenes allies on both sides rallying their war efforts and propaganda machines against each other. America ultimately rallied behind Great Britain and her allies along with J.P. Morgan and the European international bankers. 21 The industrial production of World War I was financed by international bankers on behalf of the sovereign Power structures of Europe through the federal United States government. The United States government borrowed $30 billion (all the “monetary” gold in the world) from J.P. Morgan to finance World War I, then deceived the American people into being accountable for repayment of the debt through an unconstitutional, direct, income tax instituted the same year as the Federal Reserve Act (1913). 38 World War I had far-reaching implications for the united states of America that still hasn’t seen the light of day. The international system and national borders were changed forever. Economic unrest and instability has prevailed during this century for many nations and people. Thousands of young men, your children, perished in this war and the ones to follow, while many families were disrupted and weakened economically. This was the first of a long series of perpetual wars that have kept the American and Global war machine activated throughout this century. Fueled by the profits of war and the preparation for war, we’ve forgotten how to generate a peacetime economy without it. Now, we are addicted to the economies of war to maintain our bloated standard of living. Our moral and ethical - 154 -"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten War and Preparation for War: Your Children Will “Die” in it standards have plummeted. Our own humanity is an endangered species, and we have invited tyranny into our hearts and souls. Every “problem” is now perceived as a war against something or other (e.g. poverty, drugs, crime, AIDS), and the “solutions” are confined to fighting against an illusive and undefeatable enemy. We the People are now reaping what we have sown. Today, We the People are the perceived enemy of our own government. WAR AGAINST CANCER WAR AGAINST POVERTY WAR AGAINST DRUGS WAR AGAINST CRIME WAR AGAINST AIDS WAR AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE This was the beginning of the end for the American repu-blic (of the people), the rise of the American democracy (of the corporation), the loss of American innocence, and the death of the American dream. Most Americans have been so demoralized as to be asleep to the truth ever since. “ All wars are economic in their origin.” —Bernard Baruch, Financial Dictator Prosperity and the Great Depression After World War I, the American economy was running in high gear because of weapons production. Much of the great industrial expansion was justified by the war and then converted to the civilian production of domestic goods and automobiles. The trickle-down theory accumulated vast wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer of the prime contractors, who made a guaranteed profit on both sides of the war. While the American people were beginning to enjoy some domestic prosperity, the price of that prosperity was pas-sed on to future generations through an ever-increasing debt obligation of the federal United States government. “ A depression is a large-scale decline in production and trade... there is nothing in the nature of a free-market economy to cause such an event.” —Nathaniel Branden The Great Depression was caused by a chain reaction of defaulted loans made to American farmers for farm equipment to expand agricultural production. After World War I, thousands of farmers borrowed money before the bankers contracted the credit “money” supply in the artificial Agricultural Depression of 1921, then proceeded to double the credit “money” supply from 1921-1929 by easing reserve requirements (8% yearly inflation). Credit was freely available with low interest rates. Stocks could be bought on a 10% margin. The economic boom of the 1920’s was based on inflation, not production. 39 When the farmers couldn’t service the debt on new equipment, the banks came to repossess their equipment, only to find it rusting in the fields. The banks repossessed rural properties only to discover they were in such disrepair as to be worthless as collateral. Then, rural banks defaulted on loans to city banks who defaulted on loans to regional banks who defaulted on loans to the large New York banks. The international bankers were directly responsible for engineering the Great Depression and the collapse of Wall Street. The day after a visit from the Bank of England, the primary creditor of the Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised its discount rate (to banks) to 6%, credit suddenly got more expensive, loans were called in, investors curtailed new purchases and stockholders began to sell. The Federal Reserve banks called in their 24-hour call loans made to stockbrokers on October 24th, 1929, meaning that the brokers had to pay their loans within 24 hours. Then came Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929. Before the New York banks defaulted on their loans to for- eign banks, the federal United States government inter- vened to guarantee that the New York banks wouldn’t fail. The collapse of the American, sovereign Power structure, and the bankers behind it, was imminent and had to be stopped. This was the end of the free enterprise system in the united states of America, and gave rise to the Democratic-Socialist State that was to follow. 40 “ ...From now on depressions will be scientifically created.” —Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., (1913) Although the economy had come to a dead halt, “green- backs” were scarce, people were often hungry, and many were desperate, people survived. There was no government-funded, socialized safety net like the one we take for granted today. Charities and help for the poor was privately funded. Security and the true source of wealth lived in people working together and taking care of each other, their families and communities. Local scrips, currencies, and the bartering of goods and services were abundant (there were over 2,500 different local scripts backed by local commodities). The American people during this era were better prepared to take care of themselves during an economic crisis than we are today. They had a wider range of competent skills. They had land and farm animals. They had communities. They still had extended families and small town spirit. - 155 -"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook During the Great Depression, speculation and exploitation lurked everywhere. It was a great opportunity for both the American and European sovereign Power structures to consolidate and enlarge their holdings. The Great Depression bankrupted 16,000 small, local or state banks. A few thousand people came to own one half of the wealth of the nation because they bought it for 10 cents on the dollar, and borrowed (i.e., stole) the dime from the American taxpayer to pay for it. The Vatican acquired many properties during the Great Depression to add to their previous conquests including many of the universities, colleges, hospitals, and other real estate that they still hold today. “ ...raping is a crime, unless you rape the voters, a million at a time.” —Ogden Nash 41 The Great Depression was a great national garage sale. And We the People allowed all this to happen without demanding accountability from the Federal Reserve Bank or our elected representatives. Those were the days We the People should have marched on Washington and demanded the resignation of all our leaders. Instead, We the People had unconditionally surrendered to the international bankers. We’re still paying the price for the mistakes of our parents’ generation, their refusal then, and ours today to make the government accountable to the people, not to foreign principals / creditors and sovereign Power structures. Our children will inherit our unforgivable sin of neglecting our responsibilities. “ There is but one logical end for a nation so dumb.. the loss of its National Sovereignty.” —Sy Foster 42 The New Deal: “Socialism” Secret deals were made between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, foreign interests, the federal United States government, the incoming Roosevelt Administration, and the prime industrial contractors to institute the New Deal of 1933. Each facet of the Power structure was armed with top-notch Wall Street attorneys who created a strategy for “legally” usurping our constitutional republic, keeping capitalism’s private enterprise alive and prospering indefinitely, while economically enslaving and bankrupting the American people. This has been designed invisibly, and absolutely “legally” by the top-notch lawyers and high-rolling law firms. They have effectively transferred all wealth, power and control to sovereign Power structures overseas with the assistance of our own elected and appointed government officials.. 29 “ As soon as Mr. Roosevelt took office, the Federal Reserve [Bank] began to buy government securities at the rate of ten million dollars a week for ten weeks, and created a hundred million dollars in new [checkbook] currency, which alleviated the critical famine of money and credit, and the factories started hiring people again.” —Eustace Mullins 42 Two days after taking office as President, Roosevelt declared a “bank holiday” closing the nation’s banks to depositors for more than a week, and writing emergency banking legislation. The Banking Act of 1933 stripped the currency of any gold redemption value and declared FRNs as currency. “U.S. citizens” were forbidden to own gold coins, bullion or certificates. Editor’s Note: sovereign “state” Citizens weren’t forbidden to own gold. All gold had to be deposited in one of the regional Federal Reserve Banks and exchanged for FRN’s. This was part of a federal United States bankruptcy reorganization plan. Gold had been collateralized against the federal debt, and needed to be paid in full to keep the doors of government open. Thus the government paid its debt with all the lawful “money” We the People had. And We the Sheeple marched to the nearest Federal Reserve Bank and handed over our gold for soon-to-be worthless FRN paper. How’s that for bank robbery! 45 Other New Deal legislation devalued the “dollar” by 41%. The definition of a “dollar” was diluted from 1/20 th to 1/35 th of a gold ounce. New Deal legislation created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to guarantee the worthless paper FRNs. New Deal legislation booted out the Treasurer of the United States, imposed the National Banking Association and other federalized banking institutions upon the sovereign states without legally registering them, and finally decreed that all profits from public bonds would henceforth go to the Feder - al Reserve Bank. This was all done through extraordinary powers executed by the President during a declared state of national emergency, which has never been lifted. Since 1933, the Federal Reserve Bank has “legally” stolen everything from the American people. And we stand for this? 46 “ ...the increase in the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks from 143 million dollars in 1913 to 45 billion dollars in 1949 went directly to the private stockholders of the [Federal Reserve] banks.” —Eustace Mullins - 156 -"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten The New Deal: “Socialism” Another far-reaching implication of the New Deal was the complete “socialization of corporate America,” at public expense, through the federal United States governments borrowing and spending policies, direct subsidies, tax- deductions, and outright theft of the public purse. The American people were now relegated to the status of a “taxpayer” and consumer instead of “Citizen.” We accepted the liability to pay the debt through the imposition of an in - come tax. The income tax structure is an indirect subsidy to “socialize” corporate America. America became a “socialist,” corporate country run by and for the international bankers and corpo - rations virtually overnight with the complete political con - sent of the federal United States government. Because it was given the appearance of reviving the “free enterprise” system, very few Americans noticed that this was a significantly different America. Now, you know what really happened. Federal = Corporate = Socialism The income tax structure for corporate America allowed the expansion of industry, advertising, and all capital expenses to be directly deducted from the tax obligations of corporate America and transferred that debt to the American taxpayer. This resulted in an indirect transfer of assets from the American taxpayer to the stockholders of the largest transnational corporations, and the wheels of the American economy began to turn again. The New Deal also refinanced mortgages at negative interest, separated commercial and investment banking through the Securities and Exchange Commission, and set minimum wages and price controls on every industry. “ As for the Constitution, it does not seem too much to say that it is gone. Shame and humiliation are upon us now!” —Justice James C. McReynolds (1935) 47 In 1942, America had all the monetary gold bullion in the world. Transnational American corporations then proceeded to take the profits from an expanding American war economy and invested them abroad, transferring their assets to foreign banks. Transnational American corporations also expanded their global interests through the foreign aid program which stipulated that all foreign aid must be spent through the prime, industrial contractors. The 1950’s saw the moving of all the major American corporations out of America. They acquired gold equities and deposited them in foreign banks, out of the tax control of the federal United States government. This move overseas was paid for in full by the American taxpayer without exacting any contractual obligations on behalf of the corporations in returns. Thus the complete socialization of the stockholders of the major American corporations was accomplished during and after World War II. 48 The federal debt (@$15 trillion including entitlements and government obligations) is a near accurate accounting of the amount of indirect subsidies that the American taxpayer has handed over to the Federal Reserve Bank and the stockhold - ers of these “public companies” in improved assets and prof - its without any obligation on behalf of the international banks and corporations. We the People must demand repayment and restitution for all these unconstitutional subsidies and unlawful extortions from the American people. We the People must repudiate the federal debt, and reclaim our stolen property. “ To expose a 15 trillion dollar ripoff of the American people by the stockholders of the 1000 largest corporations over the last one-hundred years will be a tall order of business.” —Buckminister Fuller 49 Stealing More Than Money As if stealing trillions of dollars from the American people wasn’t enough, the theft went deeper still. The American people were fast asleep at the wheel, chomping at the carrot of welfare programs made necessary for many Americans because of the contrived shortages and hardships of the Great Depression. They didn’t notice that their beloved country was being sold down the river for all future generations. The New Deal devised by Wall Street attorneys has worked beautifully, almost flawlessly, for over 60 years. The government cannot sever its relationship to the people by taking away their sovereign American National OR ‘state' Citizenship. But YOU can “elect” away your sovereignty, your “state” Citizenship, your Constitution and Bill of Rights. YOU can “elect” away your lawful, sovereign “state” Citizenship by becoming a born or naturalized “U.S. citizen.” YOU can “elect” away your lawful, sovereign “state” Citizenship by entering into any number of contracts with the federal, State, County and Municipal governments. This was another unspoken strategy of the New Deal—to usurp the sovereignty of the people by any means necessary. After the Social Security Act of 1935, sovereign, “state” Citizens “volunteered” away their sovereignty en masse by either enrolling in a federal United States retirement or pension plan for federal employees (Social Security), or by receiving government subsidies or entitlements of any kind (e.g., welfare, subsidies, licenses, permits, legal tender, limited liability for payment of debt, incorporation). You automatically made an “election” to become a “U.S. citizen” when you, or someone acting legally on your behalf, filed for a Social Security Number (SSN). You became a “U.S. citizen” whether or not you ever applied for or collected any benefits. Unwittingly, you became a “U.S. citizen” under the jurisdiction of the federal United States government. - 157 -"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook When someone asked you the simple question, are you a “U.S. citizen,” and you checked the box without asking, you lost your status and unalienable rights as a sovereign “state” Citizen. What began with the unlawful enactment of 14 th Amendment evolved into a corrupt strategy for usurping and abrogating the sovereignty of the American republic, the sovereign states, and your lawful sovereign “state” Citizenship. Every federal United States government since Roosevelt has been a willing accomplice in this monumental fraud and deceit. Recent Presidents have been afraid or unwilling to challenge these unlawful acts on constitutional or ethical grounds. Recent Presidents including Reagan, Bush and Clinton have added insult to misery by selling what little is left of the united states of America down the river to the United Nations, and other international organizations intent on destroying this nation. It is clearly in the interest of the federal United States government to perpetuate this fraud, as it amasses even greater power, as the sovereignty of the “state” Citizens and the sovereign states are diminished. The sovereign American and Global Power structures operating behind the scenes have been deftly stealing away our lawful, sovereign “state” Citizenship, unknown to the American people for over 130 years. American history has been systematically rewritten, and ought to be taught as “fiction” in the public and private schools, colleges and universities. Politicians smile and nod their eager heads to get elected, while avoiding or ignoring the illegalities and unlawful acts —the unconstitutional usurpation of our money system, the direct taxation of Citizens, the 14 th Amendment fraud perpetrated on a nation, and hosts of other federal crimes. Attorneys, judges and officers of the court keep the Common law from the people and hide behind their “Titles of Nobility (e.g., Esquire),” protect public officials operating under the “color of law,” while justice goes begging for most Americans. Judges and government agencies obstruct and make a mockery of justice, routinely violating both the sovereign and civil rights of the American people, delegating unlawful authority and jurisdiction to federal and State bureaucrats that are clearly unconstitutional. The truth, even if it was known and could be proved without a shadow of doubt, would be systematically suppressed through the news media and excluded from the textbook educational institutions. Free people must never surrender their minds. We the majority of the People are no longer interested in the truth. We are far more interested in lies, greed, entertainment, violence and power. The news media would discredit the truth and the messengers who deliver it, and keep the audience distracted with sports, entertainment, and commercials. Free people must never surrender their hearts or souls. If the truth ever saw the light of day, We the People openly opposing or challenging the sovereign Power structure are labeled, discredited, framed, bankrupted, maliciously prosecuted, or even imprisoned. Any of us who dares to dissent or shine the light of truth are accused, attacked and labeled as: white supremacists, patriots, constitutionalists, racists, revisionists, anti-semitic, communists, cultists, anti-government, anti-American, or domestic or paper terrorists. In the minds of most unthinking Americans, an accusation is the same as a conviction, and the media perpetuates these lies. Enough of these cautions. Free people must never surrender to fear. We the People have a choice. To be a sovereign “state” Citizen, sui juris freeman/woman, or free inhabitant of the several states, or to be an economic slave, a U.S. citizen and subject of sovereign Power structures with little regard for your basic human or civil rights. Any person who deprives a sovereign “state” Citizen of any right or privilege secured by the Constitution and Bill of Rights is subject to criminal prosecution, if and when we restore a Common law court to hear the case. > SUI JURIS — free of all legal disabilities . “The united states of America was the first country ever established with an avowed moral purpose—that individual rights are unalienable and government exists only to safeguard those rights.” Have We the People grown too lazy,too stupid, too busy, too comfortable, too enslaved, too filled with the superficial to defend ourselves against the onslaught of tyranny? Time will tell, and time is running out. 50 World War II: The War That Won the World? In 1943, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin spent four days in Tehran discussing how to defeat Hitler, how to redraw the map of Europe, and how to eventually establish a new world order. Felix Witmer, author of The Yalta Betrayal, says their discussion focused on the dismemberment of Germany and the creation of “people's democracies” along the Soviet borders, as well as details such as unilateral support for Yugoslavia's General Tito and various land giveaways to the Soviets. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger says Roosevelt wanted to head off America's instinct to revert to isolationism after the war by establishing an international organization that could maintain peace through force. The United States, Britain, China and Soviet Union would be the “Four Policemen” as he called them, that would accomplish this goal. Stalin proposed the idea of regional peacekeeping; an idea which is reflected in Chapter 8, Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter of the United Nations, which authorizes the Security Council to utilize regional arrangements to keep peace when necessary. - 158 -"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten World War II: The War That Won the World? Several globalist writers of the 1940s advocated the formation of regional economic entities as a more feasible method of bringing about a better world order. The U.S. got its start in regionalism during the Nixon presidency, when he divided the country into ten federal regions with a Federal Regional Council, or Capitol for each one. The next major step was NAFTA, which Henry Kissinger said was “not a conventional trade agreement but the architecture of a new international system.” As P.E. Corbett wrote in Post-War Worlds in 1942, “World Government is the ultimate aim, but there is more chance of attaining it by gradual development.” Similarly, M.J. Bonn wrote in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science in 1941, “...But we are not yet going to have a world state...The formation of regional federations by hitherto autonomous groups is much easier...with every move a step toward a new world order is taken.” 51 Here’s a brief summary of events regarding WWII: • Allied and German bankers were on the same side. Their combined monies expanded the pharma- ceutical cartel known as I.G. Farben, Hitler's war machine. 52 One-hundred American corporations had subsidiaries in Germany and were extracting profits from the war. A deal between Farben and Standard Oil assured a constant supply of oil to Germany during the war. It was Farben and Standard Oil which opened the Auschwitz Concentration Camp on June 14th, 1940. The slave labour of Jews and other political opponents was used to produce the artificial rubber and gasoline from coal. Examples of the companies who invested in WWII included: General Electric, International Telephone & Telegraph, Ford Motor Company (vehemently anti-Jewish and pro-Hitler), W.A. Harriman (Prescott Bush owed his wealth to the Harrimans), Dulles Brothers (wrote Heil Hitler on his letters to German clients) (would become Secretary of State and his brother Allan the first director of the CIA after the war) • Profits to American trusts after the war were $175 billion dollars. 54 The rise of both Hitler and FDR followed the same strategy. Collapse the economy. Borrow more from the banks. Impose “New Deal” solutions. Take advice from the elite- controlled Bank of International Settlements. Economic sanctions, limited loans and high-interest rates created the foundation for Hitler's rise to power and FDR's dominance in America as well. Liberty League was set-up by the Elite to oppose FDR. Its pronouncements assured it would be branded 'extreme Right' and ‘anti-semitic’ thus destroying the credibility of all legitimate opposition to FDR. • Millions of people were duped into fighting and dying for a war they believed was for “freedom.” Once Hitler was elected, credit was offered to the Nazi regime by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. The British policy of appeasement for Germany was based on: (1) Germany as the main force of resistance against communism in Europe; (2) Britain was prepared to be part of a four-power agreement with France, Germany and Italy; (3) Britain would allow Germany to liquidate Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. • Czechoslovakia was successfully invaded and occupied in March 1939. Suddenly Britain was in favor of war with Germany. Hitler had been duped into believing there would be no opposition. The rest is history. Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, a man of war. He used the infamous Regulation 18b to imprison hundreds of British people who opposed the war or pointed out it was being engineered by a secret force. They justified this in the public mind by accusing the opponents of being sympathetic with the Nazi's. Perhaps even some of the London bombings blamed on the IRS were created to justify an attack on Britain's opponents. And this was a country supposed to be “fighting for freedom.” Conservative MP, Captain Archibald Maule Ramsey and Tyler Kent, an American coding officer employed at the US Embassy where Joseph Kennedy was the ambassador were imprisoned under Regulation 18b. Both these men were, and another investigator Anna Wookoff, were imprisoned for having insider information about the causes of the war behind the scenes. America's involvement was a bit more tricky. As a campaign promise, Roosevelt had to pledge not to involve America in any more European wars. But if Japan were involved and we beat the drums of the old goddess of democracy, it would bring America in without further ado. 55 Roosevelt's New York mansion was next door to CFR headquarters. Harry Stimson, a founder of CFR, wrote in his diaries, “ We face the delicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad overt move.” 56 • CFR's War & Peace Studies Project recommended certain diplomatic and economic actions against Japan during their conflict with China. The Japanese were goaded into the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 to get America in a fighting mood. Roosevelt had information from eight different sources indicating a probably attack but did nothing to avert it. Most of the cream of the U.S. Navy was out of port at the time. The Spring prior to the dropping of the bomb, the Japanese had offered to surrender on the same terms as those proposed after the bombs were dropped. But the offer was refused, the bombs fell, and the Potsdam Conference issued an ultimatum for Japan’s surrender. Apparently, this was a planned media event not to be missed. So much for protecting American lives. - 159 -"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook • Harry S. Truman authorized the use of the atomic bomb to destroy the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945. WWII was justified to protect American lives.

Dare we count the casualties to date and those yet to follow? 57 \"The psychological spin behind the exploding of the bombs was to create such a worldwide fear of the power of nuclear energy that countries would give up their sovereignty, turn all their weapons and armed forces over to a world government and surrender their freedom.\" —Retired Colonel Donn Grand Pre 58 Roosevelt ignored a German offer of honorable surrender in 1943. General Eisenhower was prevented by Roosevelt from moving through Germany once the Germans were overrun as it didn't match the Elite's plan for the Soviet Union to be extended to Berlin and the Cold War created. World war as a form of control was to be replaced for several decades by the fear of apocalyptic conflict between East and West. Alfred Rosenberg, an occultist with a Jewish, Estonian and French background introduced a copy of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion to Hitler. Why would he do such a thing knowing that Hitler would circulate it widely to justify his campaign against Jews? He presented himself as blatantly anti-Jewish and became the Nazi’s official ideologist with the role of providing the facts against the Jews despite his Jewish features, background and associations. Many of Hitler's leading officers and thousands of his troops were also of Jewish descent. Eisenhower Starved Germans in Post-War Death Camps Four months after WWII ended, German soldiers and civilians were dying in concentration camps set up by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. With the support of his post-war foreign policy cabal, made up of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Senator Herbert Lehman and supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Eisenhower was able to act out his consuming hatred for the German people. A document in the National Archives says 692,895 Germans were classified as POWs and 363,587 as DEF’s (Disarmed Enemy Forces — an illegal classification according to international law and the Geneva Convention). DEF’s had no right to food, shelter or water. Thousands of the POWs had their status changed to DEF as the months after the war dragged on. Heinz Janssen, a survivor of the Rheinberg camp describes the conditions: “Amputees slithered like amphibians through the mud, soaking and freezing.” Another witness, French Army Captain Julien wrote,”This is just like the photographs of Buchenwald and Dachau.” His unit had discovered 32,000 American skeletons along with German DEF’s huddled under scraps of wet cardboard. Author and researcher James Bacque labored for years to publicize this hushed up story. Information was difficult to document because most records of the Rhineland death camps had been destroyed between 1947 and 1950. Also, The International Committee of the Red Cross refused to open its archives to him. His book, “Other Losses,” was finally published in 1989 after being turned down by 30 American publishers. Here's another example of the victors in war writing the history from their perspective and denying the story of their captives, prisoners and victims. When will the human race stop killing and torturing each other? This is indicative of the other side of history. There are always the ones whose stories are never told. 59 Zionism and the Creation of Israel Editor’s Note: Don’t start railing on me about me being anti-semitic, or whatever, because I’m talking about Israel. These are historical facts. Israel or any country of the world must not be immune to critique and unprejudiced evaluation. Zionism is not a religion or race but a political movement consisting of people, Jews and non-Jews who support the claim for a Jewish homeland. Jewish people are used as cannon fodder by the Elite and by many within the Jewish hierarchy, just the way other people of other nations and races are used by the Power structure to fight their battles. The Balfour Declaration (November 6th, 1917) established the policy for Palestine to be the homeland for Jewish people by a decree by the Rothschilds. Despite promises by T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) that the Arabs would be guaranteed full post-war sovereignty and independence for their support in the war. This was not part of any democratic process whatsoever. At that time less than 1% of the population of Palestine was Jewish. This Declaration was not made public until July 21st, 1937. Semitic comes from the race of peoples in ancient Sumer from whom the Biblical Jews claim to have emerged. But according to Arthur Koestler's The Thirteenth Tribe: The Khazar Empire and its Heritage (Hutchinson & Co., 1976), very few Jews can trace their genetic lineage back to the Semite line. Most are genetic descendents of a people of Turkish- Mongolian-Nordic ancestry called the Khazars who converted to Jewish religion in 740 A.D. Ironically, more members of the old Semite line are Arab, not Jewish. To call someone, “anti-semitic” would more accurately translate into “anti-Arab.” - 160 -"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten Zionism and the Creation of Israel Anti-Semitism is built upon a powerful racial myth, accepted by Jews and non-Jews alike. To be “Jewish” is to follow the Jewish religious faith and has nothing to do with race. 60 The Anti-Defamation League was founded in 1913 and has operated as an intelligence unit, which brands anyone who challenges or questions the Power structure as “anti- Semitic.” Was it set up to benefit the Jewish people? No, it was formed to protect New York Jewish gangsters Arnold Rothstein, the precursor to Meyer Lanksy, the godfather of the organized crime syndicate that funded and armed the Jewish terrorist underground in Palestine. Today, it's the arm of the Israeli/Power structure intelligence agency Mossad and has been at the heart of some horrific events in this century including the Kennedy assassination. 61 - 161 -"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources AMERICAN AND WORLD HISTORY 1.

Almost inevitably he/she comes to the conclusion that the government he/she lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable...” —H.L. Mencken There are many historical facts that most Americans are unaware of. There are also many events that have shaped the world we presently live in that are virtually unknown to the common people. Unless you have taken the time to research across many disciplines, you’ll probably remain in the “Dark Ages,” un- able to think for yourself, or decipher the world we live in. History was written by those claiming victory in war. A defeated nation, people or ideology lost its claim to be remembered as one of the powers that prevailed. Thus, the victors got to write the history for all of us to learn that “might is right.” The victor was exalted as the one with the “right,” and the vanquished became the bad guys, the misinformed, criminals who fought for a lost and often evil cause. Just a few years back the Soviet Union was the “evil empire.” Now, they have joined the “good guys” and are suddenly moral equivalents of the Western “democracies.” 1 Most Americans do not know that there is more than one kind of “Citizen” in the united states of America. Most people were taught to believe that they are “U.S. citizens,” and that all men and women, races and creeds were created equal under the law. Most people believe that they live in a “democracy”, that the federal government has total authority over the 48 states, and their “civil rights” are granted and protected by the government. Most Americans believe that the Constitution for the united states of America and Bill of Rights applies to them, that we live in a free society, and in a free enterprise system. Most people believe that the “money” in their pockets actually is an asset instead of a debt. People believe all kinds of things that are simply not true. “None are so hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.” 2 “ One of the shrewdest ways for human predators to conquer their stronger victims is to steadily convince them with propaganda that they’re still free...” —Dr. N.A. Scott There is an important distinction between “knowledge” and “belief.” Most Americans base their information on beliefs, which are fed to them through the television and public education, not based on well-established fact or firsthand experience. Thus, We the People are too gullible, and believe what we are told without questioning authority or carefully examining the facts. Thus, we are easily manipulated and controlled by the Power structure. Whether that authority is the government, a bureaucrat, our parents, the school or a church leader, we must always base our actions on informed and confirmed knowledge backed up by direct experience, not solely on belief. Otherwise, we are sitting ducks for the spin doctors who manipulate public opinion through the media and shape the issues to their political satisfaction. “ It ain’t so much what a man doesn’t know that causes him so many problems, but what he knows [believes] that [actually] ain’t so. —Will Rogers What you probably did not know, and very well may not believe, is that We the American People are uniquely endowed with absolute sovereign powers having the same prerogative, the power and authority historically reserved for the King, Queen, or the Pope. We the American People are the source of power and authority from which the American system of law and our state and federal governments arose. We the American People are sovereign American National OR “state” Citizens of the free and independent sovereign states of the republic —providing we reclaim it, restore it, and defend that right. 3 We the People are the rightful and lawful masters of our government, the corporations, and banking system. In America, those Power structures were created by the sovereign people to serve the people, not the self-interest of the self-appointed corporate officers. These sovereign powers of We the People were established in the American system of law through the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution, the Articles of Confederation, the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain, the Constitution for the united states of America, and the Bill of Rights. We the People were eminently bestowed with the power and authority to create and abolish governments like any other sovereign power had at the conclusion of the American Revolution, and the signing of the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain. 4 This Treaty conceded that Citizens had the same prerogative as the King, and there was no superior authority over the sovereign “state” Citizens of the original 13 colonies. We the People, as preamble Citizens, existed before, and were the creators of the federal, state, county and municipal governments in the first place. As a universal principle of law, the “created” can never be greater than the “creator.” - 165 -"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ For when the [American] revolution took place, the people of each state became themselves sovereign; and in that character hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters, and the soils under them, for their own common use, subject only to the rights since surrendered by the constitution to the general government.” —Martin vs. Waddell, 41 US (16 Pet) 367, 410 (1842) If this is true, then why don’t most “U.S. citizens” feel powerful or sovereign? Why do most Americans have the gut feeling they don’t make any difference? Why is government irresponsive to the petitions of the people, and have become arrogant with their abuse of power? Because We the People have not been vigilant over the last 220 years since the constitutional republic was founded, and have not been watchful of the encroachments of government and corporations, at all levels, upon our unalienable rights as sovereign people. We the People have not educated ourselves, until now, about our true and lawful sovereignty and Citizenship. In effect, the Constitution for the united states of America and Bill of Rights have been taken from “U.S. citizens” while we’ve been asleep at the wheel of the world’s largest and greatest experimental republic. While asleep, We the People have become the economic slaves and “subjects” of sovereign Power structures operating on behalf of the New World Order who fully understand their own sovereignty and Citizenship. If this is true, then how do sovereign Power structures have rights and powers that We the American People no longer have? Because We the People have unknowingly, unwittingly, and unintentionally, given away our unalienable rights as sovereign “state” Citizens. Without an understanding and comprehension of sovereignty and Citizenship, every attempt to exercise our basic liberties and rights to self-determination will be futile and ineffective. First, we must trace the roots of our American history to its inception, and find out what really happened. “ The ideal tyranny is that which is ignorantly self-administered by its victims. The most perfect slaves are, therefore, those which blissfully and unawaredy enslave themselves.” —Dresden James Church and State The American republic was predicated on the establish- ment of the freedom of religion and the unalienable right to practice your religion of choice without interference by any government, state or “ruler’s law.” The strength of this right was established by the sovereign authority of the Pope and the Canon law derived therein. Understanding sovereignty and Citizenship requires an introductory education about the true history of the united states of America. The Constitution for the usA is an “Ultra-Sovereign Canon Law Trust.” Canon Law Trusts served as the basis for most governments formed in the New World ranging from the Mayflower Compact to the Commonwealths, which became the Union of states, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution for the united states of America.” 5 “ There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle in religion. Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.” —James Madison The political battles between the Church and State go back a millennium, when the Pope and the Catholic Church was the major political power around the world. The monarchs of Europe were often subservient to the Catholic church until such time that the King of England took over the churches in England that had been Catholic, and established the Church of England. It was the Crusades that challenged the ultimate authority of the Catholic church. From the Church of England spawned the Episcopalian, the Presbyterian and the Puritan religious beliefs. Many of these religious, political and social battles are continuing to this day in Ireland. These traditional struggles between sovereign Power structures are the killing-fields in the world today. This was part of the modern rationale for the separation of Church and State, although both were intrinsically linked in the founding of the united states of America. The American colonists abhorred the religious and political persecution by the Monarchs of Europe and the Catholic church. Many came here to practice their religion of choice, and to escape political persecution or economic slavery. So when the 13 colonies were formed, they brought their own law and customs. John Calvin broke away from the Catholic church to create the Puritan religion, “A Covenant to God,” where God was the Sovereign instead of a King, Queen or the Pope. They brought more than religion with them to the British Colonies of America. They brought the “Common law” of England to be the law of self-governance. They brought the “Canon law” of the church to protect those “unalienable rights” guaranteed to all free men by King John when he signed the Magna Carta (1205) under threat of civil - 166 -"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Church and State war. Ironically, the Magna Carta signaled the beginning of the Dark Ages and the Inquisition. 6 The constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion, and separation of Church and State has being usurped by the federal United States, like most of our unalienable rights. Today, the separation of Church and State has boiled down to issues of prayer or Christmas carols in public (i.e., government) schools while the bigger issues are completely ignored. In their corporate and tax-exempt capacities, the Church, once sovereign and truly separate from the State, has effectively merged with the bankrupt and de facto State. When churches incorporated, they lost their 1 st Amend-ment rights to freedom of religion and their sovereignty. The federal United States has turned away from the Canon laws and the Common law and reverted to public policy that once again embodies the old “ruler’s law.” This is a dangerous situation for America. > UNALIENABLE— fundamental rights secured by natural law that cannot be taken away, including the right to practice your religion of choice, the freedom of speech, right to travel, eat, sleep, etc.; cannot be transferred to another or surrendered except by individual choice and contract; the opposite of “inalienable” rights, or “civil” rights which are conferred by statutory law and by government permission and privilege; cannot be liened against. Colonization of North America Both Christopher Columbus (1492) and John Cabot (i.e., Giovanni Caboto) (1497) had Brotherhood connections in Europe with the Knights Templar. The flag flown on Columbus's ships was the Knights Templar's red cross on a white background which was outlawed by the Pope. King Ferdinand of Aragon, Spain and Queen Isabella of Castile, Spain funded the trip with other connections to Leonard Da Vinci and Lorenzo de Medici. Both knew what they were looking for because they had the maps and charts passed down for thousands of years by the Brotherhood. Sir Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis, sets out his vision of a new world in which the power is exercised by a secret society. Roger Bacon's Voynich's Manuscript, written by a 13 th Century Franciscan monk included prophecies about the microscope, the telescope, the car, submarine, aero-plane and the belief that the Earth was a sphere. There was an illustration included of the Andromeda nebula accurately depicted from an angle that can't be seen from the Earth. “The first permanent English settlement in North America was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Many members of the Francis Bacon family were among the early settlers. From that point on, the native culture of North America was doomed, as was that of South and Central America once the Spanish and Portuguese arrived. The way the native peoples were slaughtered without mercy and their cultures destroyed without respect or compassion was one of the most appalling episodes in all of human history.” “Thousands of settlers sailed west from Europe to escape religious persecution after the Brotherhood-engineered Reformation divided the Christian Church into Protestants and Catholics. This created division and conflict and weakened the power of the Pope. But when the persecuted peoples arrived in America, they often proceeded to persecute the native population and the immigrants of other religious beliefs in the same merciless way that they themselves had been treated.” 7 Until after the English Civil War, only people who worked by profession as masons or building craftsmen could be members of the Masonic societies. Reforms opened up membership thus Free-masonery was born. A new Mother Grand Lodge of the World was launched in London in 1717. It encouraged other centers be set-up throughout the world. • York Rite (New York City was named after) • Scottish Rite of Michael Ramsey (based on Knights Templar) The European colonization of North America happened in several major ways. The Spanish accomplished it with vast haciendas beginning in Central America and Mexico and expanding northward into California. The French came to the Gulf of Mexico-Mississippi delta where exiled prisoners were dumped, and to the St. Lawrence area of Canada moving westward via the Great Lakes, then southward on the Mississippi. 8 Two companies were formed, the Virginia Company in the South and the New England Company in the North. These were the first two chartered “corporations” in the New World. (The District of Columbia was created from the Virginia Company.) The King of England gave vast plantation grants to royal favorites on the southeastern coast, below the freezing line, and to others on the northeastern coast where it was much colder and difficult. Here the royal favorites encouraged colonization of any kind which attracted the Puritans and others seeking practice of religious freedom. 9 The original 13 British Colonies were trusts, or “commonwealths,” created by Canon law, which were distinct states or countries in which sovereignty was ultimately vested in the Citizens of each state. The Colonies maintained their historical ties with England through contracts for protection, trade and services, while establishing their own colonial government and tax system. King George of England had the authority to extract rev - enues and claim assets at will. This arrangement eventually led to the abuses of power that precipitated the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution. 10 Because of the underlying religious struggles between various sects wrestling for power in these common-wealths, more than willing to go to war for their beliefs, the leaders knew the struggles had to be resolved through a Constitutional Convention. - 167 -"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook America: The Brotherhood’s First Nation-State The Brotherhood plan called for the establishment of an independent united states of America. Events were engineered in Britain to cause an economic crisis resulting in higher taxation and duties on the American colonies. Freemasonery lodges in the usA began to agitate for a plot against British rule because of the taxes and duties. The same Brotherhood was manipulating both sides leading up to the American Revolution as every major war and crisis has been engineered since. P.Sedir's \"Histoire et doctrine des RoseCroix\"(Paris, 1910) describes this process very well. Even though the British withdrew the taxes except the one on tea, the foment for revolution was unstoppable. Freema - son historian Manly P. Hall said fifty of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons. Enrique De Vincente says seventeen Presidents beginning with Washington were Freemasons, so were his top Gener - als and Benjamin Franklin was the first Grand Master of the Freemasons of Pennsylvania. Through close connections with the British, French and German Brotherhoods the American Revolution was easily won. When the founding fa - thers commissioned a design for the Great Seal, it included classic brotherhood symbols including the pyramid and \"allseeing eye\" that FDR (33rd degree Freemason) eventual - ly placed on the dollar bill in 1935.” 11 > RULER’S LAW —government power is exercised by compulsion, force, conquest or legislative usurpation; all power is concentrated in the Ruler; people are treated as “subjects” of the Ruler; land is treated as the “realm” of the Ruler; people have no unalienable rights; government is by the “rule of men” rather than the rule of law; people are structured into social and economic classes; government is always from the Ruler down; problems are always solved by issuing new edicts, creating more bureaus, appointing more administrators, and charging the people more taxes to pay for the services which often include their own oppression. Dictators like Adolf Hitler took over their government with the full support of international bankers and major corporations including American companies, through the passing of statutory and administrative laws, much like in America today. The same strategy is being perpetrated on the American people by sovereign Power structures under the banner of the New World Order and their legions of attorneys and police to take both constitutional rights and property from the American people. Our own government has become the enemy of the people. “ We the People are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.” —Abraham Lincoln Fourteen Presidents Before Washington There were nine original states, not thirteen. The Constitutional Congress provided that, “Ratification of the convention by nine states shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying same.” Delaware was the first state to ratify, on December 6, 1787. Pennsylvania and New Jersey also ratified that month. Three more — Georgia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts were in by February 6, then came Maryland and South Carolina. The ninth state to ratify, New Hampshire, made the Constitution a reality on June 21, 1788. The official birth- date of the republic is June 21, 1788. We had fourteen presidents before George Washington. They were the presidents of the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789, and their names were Peyton Randolph, Henry Middleton, John Hancock, Henry Laurens, John Jay, Samuel Huntington, Thomas McKean, John Hanson, Elias Boudinot, Thomas Mifflin, Richard Henry Lee, Nathan Gorham, Arthur St. Clair, and Cyrus Griffin. John Hanson is considered by some to be the first United States president, since he was the first to serve under the Articles of Confederation. His term of office ran from November 5, 1781 to November 4, 1782. 12 The Famous War Inevitable Speech Editor’s Note: This famous speech by Patrick Henry catalyzed action behind the American Revolution as profoundly as his Common Sense pamphlet. Mister President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth - and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those, who having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land...They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains, which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. - 168 -"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven The Famous War Inevitable Speech Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it was capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find that we have not already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done every thing that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. They tell us, sir, that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be next week or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supi- nely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means the God of Nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we are base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the Plains of Avery. Forbid it, Almighty God - I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! 13 Declaration of Independence The people had exhausted all their administrative remedies having petitioned the King for a redress of grievances without regard or response for over fifty years. The last resort of a free people is to declare their indepen-dence through a Common law document, the “Solemn Writ of Mixed War.” The people must be prepared to defend their “Declaration of Independence.” One compel-ling reason for the Declaration of Independence was to eliminate Admiralty / Maritime law from the domestic law of the colonies, although it did not set us free from the outright ownership of this country by the original 48 controlling families of Europe. 14 All men/women are created equal. All have God- given unalienable rights. Governments are instituted to secure these rights among people. Government derives its just powers from the consent of the people. These are the tenets of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) by unanimous declaration of the thirteen (13) united states of America in Congress. These are historic words that founded a new nation. They are as appropriate today, as they were then. “ When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.” —Declaration of Independence Samuel Ward, Governor of Rhode Island, chaired the Continental Congress during our nations process of declaring its independence. Sam Ward nominated George Washington to be the General of the Revolutionary Army, and he kept the army supplied with food, clothing, arms and munitions at Valley Forge. Sam Ward penned these words in a letter to General Washington: “I sir, dedicate to you my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor.” These words became the last sentence of the Declaration of Independence. As a tribute to this great leader, his friends honored him by creating a symbol that lives on today — Uncle Sam. “ We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” “ That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it...” “ We, therefore, the Representatives of the ‘united states of America,’ in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name, and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states...” —Declaration of Independence - 169 -"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Story of the Flag of the United States On June 3, 1777, an unexpected petition was brought before the Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia. The sovereign Indian nations had sent representatives to acquire an “American Flag.” Though they were prepared to pay for it, offering up to three strings of wampum in exchange, the Founding Fathers were unable to oblige. There’s probably no way of knowing whether the Indian representatives were astonished at the refusal or whether the Congress was embarrassed. But it had been eleven months since the Declaration of Independence had been signed and delivered to King George III, almost a year since the United States had declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, and yet they were still without a national flag. Eleven days later, presumably as a result of the Indian petition, the following resolution was taken up and passed: “Resolved that the Flag of the united states be 13 stripes alternate red and white, that the Union be 13 stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.” The date was June 14, 1777, and we now celebrate the anniversary of that event as “Flag Day.” Whenever the Founding Fathers understood that they would be addressing future generations, they took great care in choosing their words. The flag resolution was no exception. The first two, which were entered into the hand written Congressional journal, got crossed out. First they wrote that the flag of the united States “consist” . . ., then they wrote that the flag of the united States “be distinguished by”. . ., then they wrote that the flag of the united States “be.” The dictionary says that such a grammatical construction is used to “to express futurity, prearrangement, or obligation.” From their careful wording, it would seem that they intended to make the design of the flag permanent. And 22 years later, when Kentucky and Vermont, having just joined the Union, also wanted representation on the Flag, that’s just what many of them said. The date was January 4, 1795, and a very heated debate took place. It was argued that “if Congress allowed the national symbol to be altered, then Congress may go on adding and altering at this rate for one hundred years to come.” It was thought that changing the Flag would be a dange-rous precedent and that the Flag “ought be permanent.” But others said that these objections were a “consummate piece of frivolity,” and a “trifling piece of business, that the new states should not be “offended,” and that in the “national interest” the Flag should be compromised. This opinion prevailed and the Flag, the republic for which it stands, and the Constitution itself have been compromi-sed ever since. Today the Flag has 50 stars, not 13, the republic for which it once stood for no longer exists, and in the opinion of the federal government, excepting in cases where the most detestable crimes of rape and murder are involved, the Constitution no longer applies. Articles of Confederation The “free and independent states” so declared by the Declaration of Independence did not surrender their sovereignty to the federal United States government when the Constitution for the usA was created. The Articles of Confederation were agreed to by Congress on November 15, 1777. They were ratified and in force on March 1, 1781. “ Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every Power, Jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States...” —Article II, Articles of Confederation The Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence are prima facie evidence of the sovereign right of the sovereign “state” Citizen to create and abolish governments at will, that the “united states of America” is distinct from the federal “United States” government, and that Citizens have unalienable rights. These are ordinances within the “Law of Nations.” The 1st Constitution for the united states of America is a trust document, an addendum to the Articles of Confedera - tion to “make a more perfect Union” not to disband the Union of states. The relationship between the Articles of Confederation and the 1st Constitution is paramount as it il - lustrates the distinctions of Citizenship between the several states, and the federal United States. “ The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” —Constitution for the usA [4:2:1] The federal United States government is obligated to recognize the rights, privileges and immunities of the sovereign “state” Citizens. The only exceptions to the acknowledgment of constitutionally protected rights, privileges and immunities are 1. paupers; 2. vagabonds; and 3. fugitives from justice. The federal United States gov - ernment has promised only to perform for sovereigns, freemen, the good, honest, hard working people. 11 The authors of the Articles of Confederation clearly refer to the “states in the Union,” “free inhabitants of each of these states,” and “free citizens in the several states.” The Articles of Confederation didn’t limit the sovereignty of the states. 15 The United States, in Congress assembled, is still bound by debts and engagements entered into before the 1st Constitution for the united states of America. The 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd Constitutions (distinctions forthcoming) were ex- tensions of the original contract “to create a more perfect Union,” not to dissolve the Articles of Confederation. - 170 -"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Articles of Confederation “ All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.” —Constitution for the usA, Article VI 1 st Constitution “for” the united states of America There are a lot of general misconceptions about the Constitution. Historically, there were three distinct national and federal Constitutions — the 1 st Constitution “for” the united states of America, the 2 nd Constitution “of” the united states of America and the 3 rd Constitution of the “United States.” The 1 st Constitution established the national character of the new government based on the sovereignty of the sovereign states and their respective “state” Citizens. The 2 nd Constitution was an internal document of the federal United States, and included a Bill of Rights further limiting the federal government’s authority over the sovereignty of the states and its respective Citizens. The 3 rd Constitution was a coup d’etat of the 1 st and 2 nd Constitutions instituted after the Civil War, and removed a key amendment from the 1 st and 2 nd Constitutions. The sovereign states were free and independent and created the federal government to serve their interests in very limited areas: 1. to provide for the common defense; 2. to coin money, regulate the value thereof & fix the standards of weights and measures; 3. to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States; 4. to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme Court; 5. to make treaties with foreign nations; 6. to guarantee every state a republican form of government. There are many deeply ingrained misconceptions about your Constitution for the united states of America. We the People assume that if you “reside” in the “United States,” the Bill of Rights and due process apply to you, that U.S. citizens have the same rights as everybody else. We the People now assume the Constitution gave us our rights. These myths are absolutely not so! The Constitution did not give us any unalienable sovereign rights. We the People already had all the unalienable sovereign rights we needed based on the Common “law of the land.” The Constitution limited the federal government and reaffirms in the Bill of Rights that sovereignty rests with We the People and the sovereign states, not the federal government. The 9 th and 10 th Amendments state clearly that any powers or authority not delegated specifically to the federal government were explicitly reserved to the people and the states. “ The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” —9th Amendment When the Constitutional College (i.e., Convention) (May 25, 1787) was called to create a new central government and draft the 1 st Constitution “for” the united states of America, the founding fathers knew they couldn’t trust any one individual, colony or religious sect with the power of a central government. They knew they didn’t want the old ruler’s law whereby the people had to submit to a central government that had total authority and power wielded by a supreme ruler or sovereign. Strategically, the founding fathers also had to have the endorsement of the churches to demonstrate the sovereignty of the proposed new government to the world. The only common belief among the founding fathers was that all of the colonies were “Canon Law Trusts” organized for the common benefit of the people. The Constitution for the usA began to take shape as a Canon Law Trust. There would be three “trustees,” the three branches of government — the Judicial, Executive, and Legislative all to act under the ultimate sovereign — one nation under God. Individual Sovereign = State Citizen = Elector All understood and agreed that this new government and its laws would not and could not eliminate the laws and covenants which had already been adopted by the colonies. Those laws were the “Common law” of England for self- governance, and the “Canon law” for individual liberties. Thomas Jefferson is credited with developing the new government by having studied ancient civilizations that lived under the “People’s law” including Israel under Moses, the Anglo Saxons, and the Iroquois Confederacy. Innovations included an electoral college composed of sovereign “state” Citizens, a county sheriff whose oath is to uphold the sovereignty of the state republics, the county as the seat of government and the Common law courts, and the foundation for home rule under a republican form of government. 16 “ The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to the one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to everyone exactly the functions in which he is competent... “ To let the National Government be entrusted with the defense of the nation, and its foreign and federal relations... “ The State Governments with the Civil Rights, Laws, Police and administration of what concerns the State generally. - 171 -"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ The Counties with the local concerns, and each ward direct the interests within itself. “ It is by dividing and subdividing these Republics from the great national one down through all its subordinations until it ends in the administration of everyman’s farm by himself, by placing under everyone what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the best.” —Thomas Jefferson All government in the united states of America was based on the principle of “home rule.” A township was the most powerful and smallest unit of government formed from the sovereignty of the individual, and the one closest to home. Then came the county, state and federal governments, all of which derived their power and authority directly from the consent of the sovereign “state” Citizens. This is a historical and legal fact that must be the premise for all government power, authority and jurisdiction. SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUAL TOWNSHIP COUNTY STATE NATIONAL / FEDERAL The Constitution is a commercial contract or compact between the sovereign states to create a United States corporation in the District of Columbia (D.C.) to facilitate commerce, international and interstate trade, to serve the states limited needs for a national government, and to provide for the national defense by maintaining a navy. “ [the federal United States] is a for profit corporation which 16 Stat. 419 created by the name District of Columbia” —District of Columbia vs. Cluss, 103 U.S. 705, 26L. Ed. 455 The drafting of the articles of the 1 st Constitution for the united states of America was going well until Rhode Island demanded that the 1 st Constitution include a “Bill of Rights” (1791), a “contract” between the sovereign people and their new federal United States government providing more prima facie evidence that the “state” Citizens are indeed sovereign. At the first session of Congress, 189 amendments to the original draft were submitted, 12 were approved by Congress, and 10 were ratified (i.e., accepted) by the original states (i.e., 13 colonies). The Bill of Rights is the first 10 Amendments, organic Common law, and is modeled after the English “Petition of Rights” (1618). The Bill of Rights did not amend anything in the 1 st Constitution, except that it recognized the collective powers of the sovereign people to place a limitation upon the powers of the new government. 2 nd Constitution of the united states of America The 2 nd Constitution of the united states of America — a Constitution “of” the new government, was established side by side with the 1 st Constitution “for” the united states of America. It limited the International Law Merchants power and au - thority under Admiralty / Maritime law to deny unalienable rights to the people who choose not to join with them in joint, commercial ventures. It also limited and bound the of - ficers of the new government to the “law of the land.” The 2 nd Constitution of the united states of America is a commercial contract, not a social agreement, and was a continuation of the already existing, International Merch- ant-State. A 3 rd Constitution of the United States was instituted under martial law after the Civil War (1868 - 1871). The 2 nd Constitution for the united states of America is a “federal government employee handbook” intended to limit the federal government’s ability to encroach upon the unalienable rights of the sovereign “state” Citizens, and the sovereign states of the republic. The Constitution authorized the creation of both a national and a federal, corporate government. “ People of a state are entitled to all rights which formerly belonged to the king by his prerogative.” —Lansing vs. Smith, 21 D.89 The federal United States Inc. was created from the state of Virginia and Maryland who ceded land to found the new seat of the federal government. A small, brotherhood-backed elite group of property owners with ties to European Power structures conspired in secret, without the direct consent of the other 4 million sovereign “state” Citizens, to create the expanded federal government via the federal Constitution. “ No private person has a right to complain, by suit in court, on the ground of a breach of the Constitution. The Constitution it is true, is a compact, but he is not a party to it. The states are party to it.” —supreme Court of Georgia, Padelford, Fay & Co. vs. Mayor and Alderman, City of Savannah, 14 Ga. 438,520 (1854) The sovereign states, not the sovereign “state” Citizens were direct “parties” to the Constitution. Without sovereign states represented in the U.S. Congress and sovereign “state” Citizens there is no Constitution for the united states of America, only the Constitution of the united states of America, and the 3 rd Constitution of the United States instituted after the Civil War. This 3 rd Constitution altered the original two Constitutions by removing the original 13 th Amendment prohibiting officers and citizens of the United States from accepting any Titles of Nobility. - 172 -"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven 2nd Constitution of the united states of America All taxes to the federal government had to be apportioned directly from the states. The federal government has never had any authority to directly tax a sovereign “state” Citizen unless it was apportioned through each state. The federal government had to “beg” from the sovereign states to raise revenue, or sell bonds directly to the Citizens. The only authority the federal government has ever had to tax is through excise taxes built into the cost of all consumer goods used in interstate commerce or through tariffs for international trade (Even today the income tax is an excise and the 16 th Amendment gave the federal government no new taxing authority.). 15 “ We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the united states of America.” —Preamble, Constitution for the usA How does our present-day national and federal government actually operate? Instead of a republic “of the people, by the people, and for the people”—our legislative democracy is run “by the lawyers, for the international bankers, and paid by the taxpayers.” Today, our federal U.S. government employees serve their own self-interest while in office, meanwhile creating reams of statutory law and chartering corporations that rule and subjugate the former sovereign “state” Citizens who have unwittingly become “U.S. citizens.” Whatever happened to all those unalienable rights? Whatever happened to your sovereignty? When did you last read your Constitution? Editor’s Note: Support Annual Citizenship Day & Constitution Week, @September 17th-23rd The fact is that only sovereign, “state” Citizens in a sovereign state have a Constitution, Bill of Rights and due process under the American law. And there are very few Americans who are still sovereign and free. Unless we swell the ranks of sovereign “state” Citizens and repatriate into the united states of America, the American Common “law of the the land,” our Constitution and Bill of Rights won’t be able to stand much longer, and our beloved nation will be gone forever. The Constitution is powerless in a federal zone or area under the exclusive legislative democracy of the federal United States OR the foreign powers operating therein. It can only limit the federal government for sovereign “state” Citizens in sovereign states. If you live in the District of Columbia, an unincorporated U.S. territory, in any federal zone or area, or are a U.S. citizen, then you have no Constitution or Bill of Rights. \"...Congress is not subject to the same constitutional limitations [within the federal zone], as when it is legislating for the united states [of America]...\" —Hooven & Allison Co. vs. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652 (1945) A lot of people complain that it’s too much effort, it doesn’t make any difference, or that you’ll become a government target if you become a sovereign “state” Citizen. Freedom is not for whiners. Given the tyrannical de facto government that is presently in power, it may be true. But someone, somewhere has to draw the line in the sand and place the necessary checks and balances back on the government, or we’ll be forever surrendering our precious rights and liberties. “ Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.” —P.J. O’Rourke 20 If you’re unwilling to take responsibility and take the neces - sary steps toward reclaiming your sovereign Citizenship, then don’t complain that you don’t have any “rights.” You cannot be a U.S. Citizen, receive benefits, privileges, subsidies and welfare, and still expect to have your unalienable sovereign rights. It doesn’t work that way. You’re either IN or you’re OUT. You cannot be half pregnant either. So my friend, what happens when suddenly the benefits are gone, you’re left holding the bag, and the bag is empty. If you want to restore a constitutional republic, you’ll have to do what it takes to reclaim your sovereign “state” Citizenship. Take the time to study American history and law. Get educated while you can still afford the books and seminars! In 1998, the Constitution is still the “law of the land” for the united states of America. Unfortunately, it is not law that is commonly practiced, respected or honored either by U.S. citizens, by your elected representatives, or by the so-called justice system. Elected officials are bound to an oath of allegiance to the Constitution before they can execute their office. But very few practice that oath, nor do they legally file their oaths as required by law. There is a lot of lip service being paid to the Constitution when it suits them in the media, but very little action. Read the Constitution. Teach it in school. There is much debate and controversy about the calling of a “Constitutional Convention (i.e., Con-Con).” The proposed Constitution for the New States of America would brush aside the Constitution of the united states of America and substitute 10 regional governments under United Nations control. This must never happen! Stand up for your rights. 17 “ Everyone wants to live at the expense of the State.

They are like parallel universes occupying the same geographical space, but not at the same time. The first distinct government is the “Union of states,” the “united states of America,” or the “48 states.” This is the non-domestic, “National government” operating on behalf of the American National or sovereign “state” Citizen. This is the Republic. NATIONAL = REPUBLIC “ The [federal] United States government is a foreign corporation with respect to a state.” —In re Merriam, 36 NE 505, 141 N.Y. 479, affirmed 16 S.

This is the domestic, “Federal government.” This is the Democracy. FEDERAL / CORPORATE = DEMOCRACY There are at least three different legal meanings of the term “United States.” The “States” of the “United States” are not the same as the “states” of the “48 states” of the united states of America. Each meaning implies a distinct country, with a distinct citizenship and jurisdiction. Editor’s Note: Hawai’i and Alaska are special cases as are a number of other states (i.e., Republic of Texas) —thus we only refer to the 48 continguous states of the Union. “...The term ‘United States’ may be used in one of several senses. It may be merely the name of a sovereign occupying the position analogous to that of sovereign in a family of nations [e.g. United Nations]. It may designate territory over which sovereignty of the United States extends [federal United States], or it may be a collective name of the states which are united by and under the Constitution [48 states]...” —Hooven & Allison Co. vs. Evatt 324 uS 652, pg. 672 & 673 (1945) The “48 states” are sovereign, foreign countries with regard to the federal “United States.” The “States” of the “United States” are not the same as the “states” of the “48 states” of the united states of America. Which government is acting on your behalf? Of which country are you a citizen? “ The term ‘foreign country’ when used in a geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of a government other than that of the [federal] United States.” —26 CFR 1.911-2(h) Remember that the federal “United States” was created and limited by the authority and power vested in the Constitution. Pursuant to the Constitution, the federal “United States” has no jurisdiction outside of the 63 miles of the District of Columbia, or any unincorporated territories purchased by treaty except where jurisdiction has been extended by contract. 21 “ To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) ...and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature...

There can never be some territory over which both a state and the federal United States both exercise sovereignty. Joint government perhaps, but not sovereignty. When a federal territory enters the Union as a sovereign state (e.g., Oregon), there occurs a transfer of sovereignty, from the federal United States government to the new state government.” Those born in Oregon before its 1859 admission into the Union were U.S. citizens, while those born and qualified in Oregon after admission are Oregon “state” Citizens.

Prior to the 14 th Amendment (1868), there were no U.S. citizens. There were no citizens of the United States who were not Citizens of their respective Union state. As recently as 1988, Congress still referred to each of the individual states of the Union as countries. “ Persons in the [Union] state not its citizens are either: (a) Citizens of other [Union] states; or (b) Aliens [federal U.S. citizens].” —Title 1 U.S.C. § 242 The 10 th Amendment is not a general presumption, but a prohibitory rule of law.

Federal grants-in-aid and other federal programs forced upon the sovereign states as a matter of “do it or else” policy in the areas of agriculture, education, welfare, national secu - rity, health-care, etc., have always been beyond the constitu - tional authority of the federal United States government, and cannot, by law, be imposed on the sovereign states, ex - cept under a perpetual national state of emergency (which has been in effect since 1933). 25 “ The powers not delegated to the [federal] United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” —10 th Amendment, Constitution for the usA S297 Assignment of judges to courts of the freely associated compact states... (a) The Congress consents to the acceptance and retention by any judge so authorized of reimburse- ment from the countries referred..—Title 28, §297 26 (b) The Chief Justice...may assign any circuit or district judge...to serve temporarily as a judge of any duly constituted court of the freely associated compact states... Over time, the federal United States government has slow - ly, and intentionally, along with its foreign principals / creditors, encroached upon the sovereignty of the state re - publics and their respective “state” Citizens through the tyranny of deception, misrepresentation of the law, out - right manipulation of the political, economic and legal sys - tems, and by coup d’etat. Encroachments of state sovereig- nty have been ongoing since the inception of the republic. The sovereign states and “state” Citizens have also volun - tarily surrendered many of their sovereign rights through their willing and naive acceptance of federal United States government benefits, entitlements and subsidies. The sovereign states can, by contract, waive their sovereign rights just as “state” Citizens do, by accepting federal grant “money” and mandates. This has been the carrot pulling the horse toward a gradual erosion of sovereign rights in exchange for government granted privileges and centralized control. “ Government is not sovereignty. Government is the machinery or expedient for expressing the will of the sovereign power.” —City of Bisbee vs. Cochise County, 78 P.2d 982, 986, 52 Ariz.1 State constitutions, like the national and federal Constitution, applies only to sovereign “state” Citizens. Because Citizenship is determined by the state, not the federal government, foreigners (i.e., U.S. citizens) to the sovereign state republic are not “state” Citizens. Therefore, if a state has relinquished its “state” Citizens to the federal United States government, then its state constitution is, in effect, without a constituency and is moot. - 175 -"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “The states relinquish jurisdiction only at their discretion and under their conditions.” 27 The 17 th Amendment (1914) of the Constitution was aimed directly at the erosion of state sovereignty. It provided for the direct election of U.S. Senators by the voters instead of the state legislatures appointing U.S. Senators. The Constitution had empowered the states with the veto power to block acts of the U.S. Congress by veto in the U.S. Senate. The 17 th Amendment effectively blocked all moves by the states to curb the power grab of the federal United States government. No sovereign state has voted its approval, or veto, for any acts of the U.S. Congress since 1914. The loss of state sovereignty accelerated after the first federal United States Inc., bankruptcy (1933), the perpetual declared national state of emergency and the State Compact Act (1934) whereby the states agreed to go off the gold standard despite all state constitutions forbidding foreign notes and currency. The sovereign states continued to give away the powers to administer Social Security (1939), and the Courts of Common Pleas (1938). After the United States Inc. went bankrupt again after WWII (1944), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) began choosing the “Governors” of the 48 States and transferring what was left of state sovereignty to the foreign principals / creditors of the United States Inc. Due to the bankruptcy, all states formed State corporations under the IMF (1968) thus birthing the “State of California,” “State of Oregon” versus “California state” and “Oregon state” as republican forms of government. 28 Henceforth under the Government Reorganization Acts, all the states of the Union became one administrative body un - der judicial review, merging all three branches of govern - ment under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The states gave up their independent Militia and National Guard (1947), public highways (1956), public education, State banking and the State court system (1982), and someday health-care, except that the federal government has run out of creditors to fund the socialized program. 29 “ The words ‘people of the United States’ and ‘Citizen’ are synonymous terms and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our Republican institutes, form the sovereignty and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the sovereign people, and every Citizen is one of these people and a constituent member of the sovereignty.” —supreme Court Decision, D.Scott case, 60 U.S. 393 There are many documented cases of irregularities in the ad - mission of various states (e.g., Ohio), states being admitted as federal States not Union states (e.g., Alaska, Hawai’i), the amendments to state and federal constitutions, states having two different constitutions, elections that never happened, missing amendments etc. That politics has long been plagued with corruption and deceit is a sobering reflection on our times, and the history preceding it. The “California republic” was admitted to the Union in 1849, its state constitution ratified, guaranteeing “allodial” property rights to all California “state” Citizens. The “State of California” incorporated for the first time in 1879, wrote another state constitution similar to the original one, but never bothered to ratify this constitution by its “state” Citizens. This act illegally began the surrender of the sovereignty of the California republic to the federal United States government without the consent of its “state” Citizens. Similar events and various kinds of treachery has occurred in other states. Once again, the people are asleep at the wheel and not holding their elected and appointed representatives accountable. The “Washington Republic” had two state constitutions, the first was written in 1879 and the second was written in 1889, and financed by the Rothschilds for $20,000. It was never signed by the governor, nor was it admitted by Congress. The state was admitted post-de facto into the Union by Executive Order of the President in direct violation of the Constitution. The Constitution for the “Oregon Republic,” as ratified in 1859, was purportedly lost for nineteen years in the state archives before another, not the original, was mysteriously found to replace it. Ohio also entered the Union post-de facto by Joint Resolution 121, passed August 7, 1953, as PL-204, Chapter 337 admits the State of Ohio into the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803. The Resolution admitting “Ohio state” is an opinion of Congress, not public law, thus it is not limited by the Constitution for the usA. Whether Ohio, as a sovereign state was ever properly admitted is moot. It’s the constitutional oath that binds the public officials of Ohio state into the federal United States government. Does anything in politics surprise you anymore? 30 In a recent supreme Court Ruling, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that the Constitution gives states sovereign immunity from lawsuits in federal courts, except those involving civil rights. The 5-4 ruling marks the third time in five years that the court has favored the states as separate and sovereign governments. Sovereign states Must Re-Appoint U.S. Senators and Repeal 17 th Amendment Each state legislature must take the sovereign prerogative to re-exercise its appointment power and put itself back into the equation of lawmaking.

Article V of the Constitution for the united states of America specifies that “no state without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.” Those states did not consent to give up their representation at that time. Each state, to reenter the Union of states under the Constitution, must appoint U.S. Senators through their respective legislatures, ratified by the de jure governors of those states, and revoke the 17 th Amendment. This is part of the provisional government process that is being formulated in three states — Colorado, Texas and Oregon, and expanding to twenty-six this year. This will put some teeth into the resolutions of the twenty- six states who are using the Tenth Amendment to fight overgrown federal government, debauched money, taxation, Executive Orders, de facto judges, cabinets, and treaties like NAFTA & GATT. 31 The sovereign state republics have been giving away their power for a long time to the federal United States, since the Enrollment Act (1863) during the Civil War. Thus, We the People must restore the state republics by re - claiming our “state” Citizenship, repeal the 17 th Amendment of the Constitution, reappoint senators to the U.S. Congress via the state legislatures, refuse all federal grants and man - dates, stop accepting foreign bills of exchange (i.e., FRN’s) and restore a constitutional money system. We the People must also reconstitute the electors of each state republic, elect de jure governors and representatives, and see to the appointment of judges who will uphold the Constitution and defend our sovereignty. “ ...a state has the same undeniable and unlimited jurisdiction over all persons and things within its territorial limits, as any foreign nation...” —New York vs. Miln, 36 U.S. 102(1837) Corporate Federal States & the Buck Act There are two distinct political entities within each state republic, just as there is both a national and federal char- acter to the United States government. One political entity is republican, while the other is corporate and federal. The “State of California,” like all the other incorporated States, with “State” in capital letters, became a “federal enclave” pursuant to the Buck Act of 1940 when it began receiving federal grants and mandates. Thus the corporate and federal “State of California” became an extension of the exclusive legislative democracy of the District of Columbia, and falls under federal jurisdiction and authority (until being reorganized under International Monetary Fund jurisdiction and authority in 1968). Although both political entities may appear to occupy the same geographical territory, the “residents,” “persons,” or “franchisees” of the federal State of California are distinct from the sovereign “state” Citizens of “California state,” with “state” in small letters, or the “Republic of California.” Residents, persons or franchisees are also considered the property of the federal government. They cannot hold title or own real property. A corporation cannot have “citizens,” but it can have “persons” which are legal fictions, “residents” and “franchisees (thus the Franchise Tax Board).” In the corporate “State of California,” real estate can be equitably titled to a legal fiction (e.g., a person or corporation), wherein in the “Republic of California” only living human beings can hold allodial title to land and property. To which “State/state” are we presently electing governors and legislators? Presently, we are electing de facto Governors to the corporate State as Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Editor’s Note: Aaron Russo and Hoppy Heidelberg are running for Governor of Nevada and Oklahoma respectively. Simultaneously, sovereign “state” Citizens should be electing de jure governors to the republic. Governor Eric Madsen is the lawfully elected, de jure governor of Colorado state. He was elected by the electors (i.e., allodial property owners in Colorado). 32 By what authority does the federal United States government corporation have to extend its jurisdiction over the “states” and install a “de facto” government? 27 The Buck Act (1940), codified as 4 UCS §105-113, accomplished this by supplanting state law with federal law and jurisdiction, abducting all sovereign “state” Citizens through various adhesion contracts, and relocating them in federal “State” enclaves (except Indians, not otherwise taxed; 4 U.S.C.§ 109). Federal enclaves & bankruptcy doesn’t apply to Indians . This is one of the nuts and bolts schemes that laid the groundwork for the “shadow government,” National Security State and foreign rule over almost all Americans today. The Buck Act authorized any department of the federal government to create a “federal area or enclave” (e.g. federal sobriety checkpoints, SSA areas, public housing federally funded, federally funded highways, public schools) for imposition of the Public Salary Tax Act (1939). The Buck Act is a municipal law of the District of Columbia for taxing all federal and State government employees, and those who live and work in any “federal area” (includes all two-letter “State” abbreviations like CA, OR, TX, etc.) Thus the corporate, federal “State” has shadowed the “de jure” or lawful government of the “state,” and replaced it with the exclusive legislative authority of the federal United States government corporation. These references concur with the definitions found in the Buck Act. 33 “ State government” means the government of any of the 50 State [capital ‘S’] governments or the District of Columbia. —31 CFR, Ch. 1, 51.2(q) - 177 -"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ State government” means the government of any of the 50 states [small ‘s’]. —31 CFR, Ch. 1, 52.2(o) “ Governor” means the Governor of any of the 50 State governments or the mayor of the District of Columbia. —31 CFR, Ch. 1, 52.2(i) “ Governor” means the Governor of any of the 50 states and the CEO of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. —31 CFR, Ch. 1, 52.2(f) 10 th Amendment State’s Rights Today, the 48 sovereign state republics have exchanged vir - tually all of their sovereignty for federal grants and man - dates. In a desperate effort to reclaim their sovereignty 26 federal States have passed or introduced “Sovereignty Reso - lutions” to reassert 10 th Amendment rights. They do not realize that the corporate Federal State is as distinct from the state republic as the federal corporation is distinct from the national government. To reassert state sovereignty requires sovereign “state” Citi - zens domiciled in the state, a lawfully established “electoral college” electing a legitimate legislature, state representation in the U.S. Congress via the appointment of U.S. Senators, and the re-introduction of lawful “money.” Otherwise there is no state republic or state constitution. Without “state” Citizens and the aforementioned infrastructure, state sovereignty is a moot issue. The corporate States are threatened with extinction when the final bankruptcy of the federal United States corporation is declared (just like the Soviet Union folks), and the States are dissolved in the New World Order and replaced with regional, international governments. Some of the corporate States are catching wind of the massive reorganization of power happening in the united states of America, and resisting further federal and international encroachment. “ Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative & regulatory processes of the States.” —supreme Court decision, New York vs. U.S., 1125 Ct.2408 (1992) Threatened by the shift of power, some “State” legislatures are making an important defensive move in resisting continued federal encroachment upon their sovereignty. The States must also stop accepting federal grants and entitlements if they are serious, and not just paying lip service, to reclaiming state sovereignty. Some “States” we’re aware of include: Colorado, Oklahoma, California, Missouri, Hawai’i, Illinois, Utah, Idaho, Washington, New Mexico, Nevada, Wyoming, Oregon. 34 Colorado passed House Joint Resolution 94-1035, and deputized their Citizens to prevent the federal government from coming into the State. The resolutions have been primarily motivated by federal land management policy whereby the federal government has been taking both private and state property without compensation or due process, based on environmental laws and other hidden directives of the foreign powers executing a bankruptcy on the American people. Colorado passed the first State sovereignty legislation refuting federal mandates, which would include Executive Orders of the President. After 130 years of encroachment, it’s about time, although a bit too little too late. Without an educated and responsible Citizenry willing to reclaim the sovereignty of the state republic and its “state” Citizens, these efforts of the corporate State to protect its eroding power base will be futile. This is a window of opportunity for sovereignty and Citizen- ship issues to come to the forefront of our consciousness. And perhaps, We the People will reclaim our sovereignty and the state republics will be re-empowered as well. Oklahoma’s House Resolution #1047 entitled U.S. Military Forces Under U.N. Authority takes a stand against the presence of U.S. military in U.N. operations and petitioned Congress to cease providing funding for military operations not authorized by Congress; to cease participation in military activity under U.N. authority; to cease rendering aid to any activity under U.N. jurisdiction; and to cease support for the establishment of a New World Order or any form of world government.

There was no federal Citizenship of the Union. One was first a natural-born Citizen of a state. We the People are all sovereign “state” Citizens, free inhabitants, or sui juris freeman / women of the state in which we are “domiciled,” unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g. any adhesion contract with the corporate, federal United States government). 31 “ The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a [state] Citizen.

He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the State. ..He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.” —Hale vs. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1905) > INHABITANT—one who resides actually and permanently in a given place, and has his/her domicile there. > DOMICILE—an individual’s permanent home or principal establishment; one can have many “residences,” but only one legal domicile; for living human beings. > RESIDENCE—corporate address of a legal fiction or “person”; your home or business address is considered the “residence” of a legal fiction originally registered in your “Name” via your birth certificate; implies more than a physical presence and less than a domicile. “ In all elections...by this Constitution, every [white male]* citizen of the United States ...shall be entitled to vote...” —Article 2, Section 2, Oregon Constitution 32 Historically, white male property owners were the original sovereign “state” Citizens. All other people were either considered property, slaves, Indians, or “wards of the state.” Women and slaves were property. Slave traders were forbidden in America by colonial law until 1661. During the slave trading years in the Americas, 111,000,000 blacks were captured and only 10,000,000 survived the journey to the colonies. Blacks who had been baptized as Christians could not be enslaved under British laws, so they were instead defined as “indentured servants.” 36 Blacks could not be Citizens of the United States unless a sovereign state would naturalize them. Indigenous American people, or Indians were considered “wards of the state” and could not be Citizens of the United States. Prior to 1868, Americans didn’t consider themselves U.S. citizens, anymore than Americans today consider themselves to be U.N. citizens (although the latter is more true than we’d like to believe). 37 The Constitution created the District of Columbia (D.C.) and the federal United States. Prior to 1868, there were no U.S. citizens. Even in the District of Columbia, the people residing there were considered Citizens of their respective states. Not until after the Civil War and the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment was passed under martial law, was the U.S. citizen created. A natural-born American is not a U.S. citizen unless born or naturalized in the federal United States, and/or a resident of the District of Columbia (D.C.), and/or a resident of a federal enclave, zone, or area (e.g., the corporate State of Oregon), thus subject to federal jurisdiction. “ Both before and after the 14 th Amendment..., it has not been necessary for a person to be a citizen of the [federal] United States in order to be a Citizen of his [Union] state...

The newly freed Black freeman were at the mercy of the white male “state” Citizens and the racist public laws of most of the several states, although New York and Virginia had opened the door to Black freemen to become full sovereign “state” Citizens prior to the 14 th Amendment. The 14 th Amendment was fraudulently passed and imposed upon the sovereign states after the Civil War and the defeat of the South. The 14 th Amendment created another class of Citizenship— corporate “persons,” which are legal fictions, born or naturalized in the federal United States. This “U.S. citizenship” offered the newly freed Black slaves “civil rights,” not the unalienable rights of a sovereign or constitutional rights. The surviving sovereign white male Citizens of the South became “prisoners of war,” and could not reenter the Union except as U.S. citizens loyal to the federal government with the same second-class status as the former slaves. When women were finally given the “civil right” to vote, they became naturalized U.S. citizens, the same status as the former slaves. Neither Black freemen, nor women were given sovereign, unalienable, constitutional rights. Those rights were now reserved for the sovereign, white male “state” Citizens of the North and West and the emerging sovereign Power structure in America. As Black Americans have long understood living in a fundamentally racist society, they didn’t get “equal rights” with whites after their so-called emancipation. Racism is one of the paramount issues, which has brought the great ideals of the American republic to its knees, and destroyed the integrity of the united states of America. Now you know why. 37 “ People of African descent are not and cannot be citizens of the United States and cannot sue in any court of the United States.” —Chief Justice, Roger Tany, supreme Court (1857) The passage of the 14 th Amendment, however unlawfully and fraudulently done, was the beginning of a strategy and constructive fraud that continues to this very day—to make U.S. citizens of all Americans without our informed knowledge or consent, and rob us of our birthright as free and sovereign people. First the Black slaves, then the southern white males, then the women and finally the northern white males after the Great Depression surrendered their sovereignty and rights to the federal United States government. Our morally weak and ethically deficient United States government, and our duly elected representatives have been easy prey for both domestic and foreign Power structures who have used the supremacy clause of the Constitution, and other hooks and tricks, to undermine the basis of our sovereignty and rob us of our lawful rights and Citizenship. Those individuals, families, and businesses who understood sovereignty, Citizenship and the law, retained their unalien - able and constitutional rights, and became much of the sovereign Power structure as we know it in America today. “ There is no such thing as a citizen of the United States. One must first be a Citizen of a state, and by reason of this Citizenship one is then a citizen of the united states [of America].” —Ex Parte Frank Knowles, 5 Cal. Reports 300 (1855) If you were born in and are a free inhabitant any of the 48 sovereign states, or moved from a federal territory to one of the 48 sovereign states, you have the unalienable right to choose to reclaim your sovereign “state” Citizenship. No government can take away this right by any law or statute. You have the right to determine which laws and which country you’ll live under. You can leave the “Republic” for the “Democracy,” and vice versa. The newly freed Black slaves, women, indigenous American people, and the born or naturalized U.S. citizen have the right to reclaim their sovereign “state” Citizenship, and restore the Constitution and Bill of Rights as the law of the land. Even if you were born in Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia (D.C.) as a federal U.S. citizen, then moved to the “Republic of California” or any of the 48 sovereign states, you have the right to reclaim your sovereign “state” Citizenship. It’s important to understand the dual character and nature of our lawful “diversity of citizenship.” 40 “ In our country the people are sovereign and the government cannot sever its relationship to the people by taking away their citizenship.” —Richards vs. Sec. of State, 752 F2d at 1418 “ Citizenship of the United States does not entitle citizen of privileges and immunities of citizen of state, since privileges and immunities of one are not the same as the other.” —Tashiro vs. Jordan, 256 P 545. The government cannot take away your lawful Citizenship, but the sovereign “state” Citizen of any of the 48 sovereign states has the right to elect, volunteer, or waive their rights by entering into a contract. Our right to contract is unlimited. Most Americans became U.S. citizens by entering into a contract with the government. This is how We the People lost our lawful Citizenship, our Constitution and Bill of Rights and ultimately our country. - 180 -"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Sovereign, American Nationals AND Sovereign “state” Citizens We the People unknowingly and unwillingly “elected” away our sovereignty in exchange for government privileges (e.g., social security, federal employment, negotiable instruments, public highways, public utilities, government services, limited liability for payment of debt etc.). Often this “election” occurred under threat, duress or coercion (i.e., tdc) by some branch of government, insisting that we must. Often we have not been told what our choices and options are. An “election” is always, by definition, a voluntary act. To act voluntarily one must have full possession of ones faculties and be fully informed as to the nature and implications of the contract. “ Thus, the dual character of our citizenship is made plainly apparent. That is to say, a citizen of the United States is ipso facto and at the same time a Citizen of the state in which he resides. And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not create a national citizenship, it has the effect of making that citizenship ‘paramount and dominant’ instead of ‘derivative and dependent’ upon state Citizenship.” —Colgate vs. Harvey, 296 U.S. 404, 427; 80 L., Ed, 299 (1935) 41 There is a great responsibility that accompanies being a sovereign Citizen. Not only must one be fully and completely responsible for oneself, but also for ones thoughts, words and deeds. Sovereign Citizens must be spiritually, mentally, emotionally, politically, economically and legally responsible for their lives, and the lives of their families, children and communities. Sovereignty begins in the heart and soul of a man or woman, a full-grown adult with the maturity and intelligence to make his/her own decisions, and accept the consequences of such actions. Sovereignty is an attitude, and a way of life. This is a call for all who are ready, willing and able to accept the challenge of rediscovering your own power, and limiting the usurpation of that power by the government. “ If we don’t hang together, we shall surely hang separately.” —Benjamin Franklin Sovereign Citizens accept the duty to come to the aid of other sovereigns in distress. This is known as the mutual defense of unalienable rights. Alone we cannot defend our rights, our bodies, or our property. Only when we join forces, do we stand a chance of protecting what’s ours. This is our vision of a new nation of sovereign “state” Citizens reclaiming what is lawfully ours. Leaders wanted! Apply within. 42 Fortunately, part of this fraud has been unraveled, too. By legal definition, found in the Immigration and Nationality Act at 8 USC §1101(a)(22), all Americans are nationals of the United States, with the United States citizen-subject class being a minor category within the universal category \"national of the United States.\" SOVEREIGN “STATE” CITIZEN AMERICAN NATIONAL If an individual born in the united states of America does NOT have a birth certificate issued by one of the federal States, has not contracted for government benefits, privileges or licenses, has NOT been issued a social security numbers or taxpayer I.D. number, and has NOT naturalized into the federal United States, then: 1. he or she is a sovereign “state” Citizen (with a capital “C”) of the state republic where he or she is presently domiciled, or 2. retains the status of a “national of the United States” in the original state republic where he or she was born whether or not he or she is presently domiciled there. 43 U.S. citizenship is an impaired and diminished status that must be remedied to reclaim your inherent American sovereignty. The courts have ruled that “U.S. citizenship” is not “citizenship” at all, but a contractual nexus with the federal United States government corporation, in exchange for benefits or privileges. As a “U.S. citizen,” you are an officer or employee of a government corporation. Editor’s Note: Form 1040 is for government officers and employees only. As a U.S. citizen you are the chattel and property of the government corporation and they have the statutory right to regulate, control, and tax you. U.S. citizenship is a voluntary adhesion contract. Once you have made a choice and rescinded U.S. citizenship, then and only then can the American reclaim his/her sovereignty and repatriate into the united states of America under the Law of Nations. There are many patriots who are unwilling to recognize these basic facts or to take any effective action regarding their impaired status. They turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the legal necessity of cleaning up their impaired status as essential to the restoration of a de jure constitutional republic. Unless Americans wake up and reclaim their sovereignty, they do not have the legal standing to self- govern themselves. U.S. citizens are an impaired status of individual who has in fact contracted with a de facto government for government services. U.S. citizens have volunteered into the present system through ignorance, fear and the overriding need for false “security.” You cannot complain about bad government if you are unwilling to take the steps necessary for reclaiming your sovereignty. You must revoke, rescind or rebut these adhesion contracts by formal declaration and give notice and grace to the - 181 -"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook government corporation. Or you must eliminate the presumption of your signature and seal on those contracts. Most patriots know just enough information to be dangerous to themselves. Superficial or incomplete actions can be dangerous. They take a seminar, read a book and are raring to go out and cause themselves trouble. To alleviate this danger, one must have all the pieces of the puzzle in place, and you must educate yourself comprehensively. There are many Americans who simply want to stop paying income taxes or join a militia, yet they want to continue in their impaired status as U.S. citizens. Sovereignty doesn’t work that way. Many Americans are jumping on the patriot bandwagon without having laid the foundations for their own freedom by securing the unalienable right to self-govern. Either you’re a sovereign, or you’re a subject. You cannot be half- pregnant, or half-sovereign. Either you are or you aren’t. The choice is yours! Immigration and Naturalization in the sovereign state and Jural Societies Since the fifties, when immigrants have come to the united states of America and sought freedom, opportunity and “Citizenship,” they have been naturalized almost exclusively and directly into U.S. citizenship via the federal United States and the Immigration & Naturalization Service (INS). Prior to that, one could naturalize directly into one of the several sovereign states of Union. Today, the state district or superior courts still have the judicial power to naturalize Citizens directly into the state, although this power has not been exercised since the bankruptcies. The power to naturalize, by virtue of the Act of Congress of 1802, is a judicial one, and the Congress has no power to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of a state. \"The provision of the Constitution of the United States which gives Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, is construed to mean that the rule when established shall be executed by the States. Under the Act of Congress of 1802, every Court of Record in any individual State, having Common law jurisdiction and a seal, and clerk or prothonotary, shall be considered as a District Court within the meaning of this Act, and such Courts shall have the power to naturalize. The Legislature of California has by express enactment, conferred jurisdiction on the District courts of this State to grant naturalization, according to the rules established by Congress. All other courts of this State, being courts of inferior and limited powers, and although some are Courts of Record, yet having only statutory, and not Common law jurisdiction, they have no power to grant naturalization, and any attempt of the kind by them would be coram non judice, and void.\" —Ex Parte Frank Knowles 44 Besides restoring the power to naturalize Citizens directly into the sovereign states, We the People can organize jural societies, constitutional Common law courts and grand juries to bring forth indictments against public officials who are blatantly and consistently violating the spirit of, and the letter of, the law of the land. “ Federal statutes provide causes of action for parties injured by individual deprivations of any rights or privileges of citizens of the United States.” —42 U.S.C., Section 1983 (1985(3)) Jural Societies A jural society is used in Blacks Law Dictionary to define a “Citizen.” A “Citizen” is defined as “a member of a free city or jural society. Jural is synonymous with the definition of a “state,” or an organized political community. A citizen without a state or organized political community is described as a “stateless person” thus subject to international law. We the People who founded this nation secured to themselves the right of popular assembly to preserve their traditionally vested rights and customs through the 1st, 9th and 10th Amendments secured by the federal and state constitutions. JURAL SOCIETY = CITIZEN = STATE We the People are legally and politically in the united states of America as sovereign “state” Citizens organized as a jural society. U.S. citizens and foreigners are here commercially through the 14th Amendment and subject to government regulation and the civil rights acts. Persons or residents organized for commercial purposes cannot be a state as defined by international law. Organizing jural societies in each of the sovereign states provides recognition to those sovereign “state” Citizens who choose to reclaim their sovereignty and rights. The jural society is a forum for the sovereign voice of We the People and the basis for creating new sovereign “states.” 45 > EXPATRIATION —voluntary act of abandoning or renouncing one’s country, and becoming the Citizen or subject of another. 46 “ Whereas the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” —Title 8 U.S.C. §1481 47 “ Citizenship...is retained unless a citizen voluntarily relinquishes it.” - 182 -"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Immigration and Naturalization in the sovereign state and Jural Societies —Afrojim vs. Rusk (1967) 387 US 253 18L, Ed.2d 757, 87 S.Ct. 1660 pg 780 2d/AmJur 99 48 Alaska Revised Statutes §1999 provided that: Whereas the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and whereas in the recognition of this principle this Government has freely received emigrants from all nations, and invested them with the rights of citizenship; and whereas it is claimed that such American citizens, with their descendants, are subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the govern - ments thereof; and whereas it is necessary to the mainte - nance of public peace that this claim of foreign allegiance should be promptly and finally disavowed: Therefore any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officer of the United States which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the republic. Naturalization Via Common Law Marriage There are a lot of theories about immigration and naturalization, and who can become an American. Foreigners who have immigrated and naturalized as federal “U.S. citizens” are citizens of the United States, and also Citizens of the state in which they are domiciled — if they exercise that right. For example, Puerto Ricans and District of Columbia citizens born or naturalized in any U.S. territory can exercise their sovereignty in any of the forty-eight states by claiming a domicile there (excepting Alaska and Hawai’i which are not sovereign states of the Union). True, they cannot claim their sovereignty “residing” in any U.S. territory or federal zone (neither can American-born U.S. citizens), although they could be an American National living in any U.S. territory if domiciled in any of the forty- eight states. If the foreigner born in another country (besides the united states of America) has NOT completed the immigration or naturalization process as citizens of the United States and are “residing” in the United States as a “resident alien” with a green card, they cannot be a sovereign “state” Citizen unless or until: 1. complete immigration and naturalization into the federal United States as citizens of the United States. 2. immigrate and naturalize via a Common law marriage to an American, sovereign “state” Citizen. 3. immigrate and naturalize directly into sovereign “state” Citizenship via a Superior court, or 4. immigrate and naturalize via a properly consummated Constitutional Common law Court before a jury of peers. If a foreign citizen immigrates into U.S. citizenship and marries an American Citizen, the claim to sovereignty as an individual is transferred by marriage. A couple married by certificate, not by license, for 7 years would establish a domicile under the Common law if not challenged. Given notice and grace without objection would set the stage for American Citizenship to follow if declared before a Common law jury of peers. By law, there is no federal citizenship, but there is a Common law process for foreigners to achieve naturalization into American Citizenship. It just hasn't been formally recognized for generations, nor have the Superior courts been operating at-law since 1944. There is also evidence of state-issued passports prior to WWII. This raises the sensitive issue of deportation for foreigners. Massive immigration flooding the American borders is a hot political issue as it has made the American Citizen, especially the sovereign “state” Citizen, a minority in his/her own country. For some twisted reason, new immigrants expect lots of benefits streaming in from the State and federal government paid for by the dwindling working classes, without even having a clue what being an American in a free-enterprise country is really about. It has served the federal United States government corporation well to flood the country with immigrants, legal or illegal, as it thoroughly destabilizes the American system and further destroys the sovereignty of its Citizenry. Will the foreign-born immigrant educate themselves about the nature of freedom and what made America great? It was NOT the welfare-state mentality or benefits streaming in from government that made America great, but building a life here on the skills, talents and hard work of its Citizenry? That these Common law processes of immigration and naturalization will meet with resistance from the federal government is almost assured. They do not want anybody reclaiming their sovereignty in America. That there might be grounds for deportation for a foreigner who chose to exercise these rights is likely. But is not the price of freedom worth the effort and the sweat necessary to pave the way for others to follow. If you want the easy life, a life without change or resistance, then stay where you are. Becoming a sovereign “state” Citizen of this great country whether foreign or American-born is a great undertaking. “ The first requirement for state Citizenship for purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction... is United States citizenship. A person who is not a citizen of the United States cannot be a Citizen of a state for diversity purposes. Similarly, a United States citizen who is domiciled in a foreign country is not a ‘Citizen of a state,’ and may not invoke federal diversity jurisdiction.” —Title 28 U.S.C. §1332 48 Declaring Your Citizenship Education is the first step on the long road home to becoming an American National, sovereign “state” Citizen or sui juris freeman/woman. The word “citizen” means “subject of” and the word “State” means “sovereign power.” Although the term “state” Citizen - 183 -"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook appears to be an oxymoron, it actually means quite the opposite of the above definition due to the shift in capitalization of the two words. In a constitutional republic, the “state” is created by its “Citi - zens” who are the sovereign powers. As a “Jural Society,” the “state” was created for the express purpose of serving and protecting the sovereignty of its “state” Citizens who are not “residents,” corporate “persons,” nor individuals effectively connected with any corporate political organization. As such, a state Citizen is a sovereign entity recognized by law as outside the jurisdiction of statutes, public policy and po - litical codes. 49 A sui juris freeman/woman is a natural-born human being without Citizenship, residency, date of birth, address, or any other adhesion contract with the government. Being free of ALL legal disability, a sui juris freeman/woman acts with inherent, non-merchant rights as a freeman/wom - an, the legal definition of which is a non-immigrant, non- resident alien. It is improper for a freeman/woman to speak of having constitutional rights. 50 Today, it requires immense courage, total responsibility, administrative and legal challenges, and an organized, lawful “revolution” of millions of Americans to make the necessary changes to the political, economic and legal system. Herein lies an opportunity to alter the course of history, to move away from the totalitarian New World Order toward new social, economic and political organizations created with liberty and justice for all, based on sovereignty for all the people of the world. This is what the founding fathers and mothers had in mind for America. When enough thoughtful, considerate American Citizens take charge, become sovereign “state” Citizens and take back their government, a true constitutional republic of We the People can once again unfold for all the people this time around. Liberty begins with a commitment to lifelong education about the law, procedures and lawful means of presenting oneself. Liberty means being committed to personal, social and environmental responsibility for the well-being of the entire human community. Sovereign “state” Citizenship doesn’t imply a return to the rampant individualism, anarchy and lawlessness of our past. We cannot go back two hundred years, nor are we proposing a return to the days of the wild, wild west. We cannot return to the days of exclusively white male property owners, to the days when blacks, indigenous American people and women were deprived of their sovereignty and civil rights. Either we’re all going to be sovereigns, or we’re all going to be slaves in the next millennium. What you will gain by reclaiming your sovereignty —perhaps your liberty, property and personal responsibility? What will you lose — perhaps your chains and comfortable complacency? When will you take the necessary steps and reclaim your sovereignty? Every individual begins as an entity unto himself or herself, sovereign and free. Combined with other sovereign and responsible individuals, then and only then do lawful nations arise. We the People must join together through lawful, constitutional ends and means to create self-government by mutual consent. We can network new social, economic and political organizations without creating a large, centralized, totalitarian world government. We can create quite “another world order.” You must know who you are and declare it! Only you can determine your Citizenship, not the government, not anybody else. Sovereignty is not for everyone. Sovereignty is for leaders and visionaries, activists and pioneers, healers and teachers, innovators, men and women of courage, and true patriots who love a country crafted by their own hand. Sovereignty must begin in the heart and soul of a human being and move forth from there. If you have established your sovereignty there, then the rest will follow. If you have not established your sovereignty in your own heart and soul, all the paperwork in the world will do you no good. There is no form you can fill out that makes you a sovereign individual. It takes a lifetime of commitment, years of sincere study and effort to complete the initial administrative paperwork to ground sovereignty sincerely in your heart and soul. You will not the see the world quite the same, once you realize you are the source of power and responsibility. The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. - 184 -"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Declaring Your Citizenship Notes and Sources AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP 1.

An important distinction is between de jure and de facto. De jure means legitimate, lawful, by rights and just title. De facto means the acceptance of a government, an action, public policy or state of affairs, but is at the root illegal or illegitimate. The constitutional republic of the united states of America and its sovereign “state” Citizens are the de jure government and lawful authority, while the legislative democracy of the federal United States is presently a de facto government having extended its power by coup d’etat and deception. 4 > DE JURE — lawful government derived from the right and just authority of We the People in a republic. > DE FACTO — government by default, an imposed authority or foreign power usurping the law and subjugating We the People in a democracy. Restoring the American Common “law of the land” to protect the American people from the continued encroachment of government and corporations is an essential component of rediscovering America, and restoring our constitutional republic. Law is the philosophy of a nation in action. With 220 years of American law and thousands of years of substantive Common law, there is a rich history to draw upon for preserving the rights of American National OR “state” Citizens and limiting the authority and intervention of government. We the People must restore the “substance” of American law which is today rarely practiced in the United States. We must expose and challenge the “color of law” practiced through the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a system of law administering an undeclared bankruptcy against the property and rights of the American people by an unconstitutional banking authority operating on behalf of foreign sovereign Power structures. Every year there are thousands of criminal-making “statutes” passed controlling behavior, lifestyle and the commercial activities of ordinary Citizens. Editor’s Note: There were 286,000 new laws, statutes, rules and regulations passed in all jurisdictions in America last year alone. These extensive volumes of statutes make un-convicted “criminals” of virtually all Americans. All a maligned prosecutor has to do is find the appropriate statute that penalizes, punishes, persecutes or prosecutes any targeted individual or business, find a rubber-stamp grand jury to indict, and destroy their lives with litigation. It happens every day in these united states of America. Plaintiffs almost always win in court. In federal court, Plaintiffs, often the State, wins convictions about 95% of the time. That’s pretty poor odds for Defendants. So being on the offensive is strategically necessary to secure an advantage in the court system. The court system as we know it does not seek justice in any sense of the word. How much justice can you afford? How much could O.J. Simpson afford? How much can President William Clinton afford? How much can you afford? Are you prepared to be sued? Are you judgment-proof? Corporations, including our governments, are presently in the business of “legally” stealing your property and rights everyday. We the People must reassert the power of justice in this land by taking responsibility for insuring that the American law stands. The American law can only stand if the American people, regardless of status, stand behind it. You must take the Constitution and Bill of Rights seriously and demand your elected representatives do the same. “ The first step in liquidating a people is to erase their memory.” —George Orwell 1 Natural Law & Unalienable Sovereign Rights “Natural rights” are those unalienable sovereign rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, inherent to all human beings. As a human being, you have the unalienable right to breathe, to walk and talk, to eat and sleep, to exercise all your unalienable rights as a free individual, providing you do violate or infringe upon the unalienable rights of other free individuals or damage or cause injury to them or their property. As free individuals, We the People must respect the laws of the land as they were intended to be upheld — that all men and women are created equal, that all men and women have natural rights with equal protection of the law. These natural laws and unalienable rights were then codified into constitutional laws and statutes —unalienable rights protected by the Common law, the Constitution for the united states of America, and the Bill of Rights. These unalienable sovereign rights include: • right of due process • right to a trial with jury • right to choose applicable law in your jurisdiction • right to travel - 187 -"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook • right to contract • right to work • right to marry and bear children • right to own property • right to alias • right to entity • right to privacy • right to keep and bear arms • right to freedom of religion, speech, and assembly Natural law defines the relationships between free sovereign individuals based on the “golden rule.” All men and women are created equal under the “natural law” regardless of race, class, creed, or color. This is the foundation of the Law of Nations, which is the code of conduct and behavior between sovereigns, nations, or other free entities. “Natural law” and unalienable sovereign rights exist whether or not enacted as acts of Congress or by any state legislature. Civil liberties are immunities from government interference, while civil rights are statutes granting benefits, privileges. Civil rights are given by statute or administrative law, and can be regulated or taken away at any time. Any “right” granted by the government is not an unalienable sovereign right, but a privilege or benefit. 2 “ Law is defined as a habit of obedience to a person or people who pretend to a higher authority over others.” Regardless of your choice of Citizenship—a sovereign American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen, or “U.S. citizen”—a basic comprehension of law, jurisdiction, due process and contracts is necessary to exercise either your “unalienable sovereign rights” or your government-granted “civil rights”. You will learn about the Common law, “color of law,” the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), how to get Common law remedies in an Admiralty/Maritime OR Equity jurisdiction, and courtroom strategies. You will learn to present yourself in your sovereign capacity, or defend yourself in propria persona, or pro se. You will learn advanced tools for exercising and defending your “rights” including affidavits, constructive legal notices, non-statutory abatements, cross-claims and cross-libels, civil rights or Title 42 actions, and commercial affidavits and liens. You will learn how to diplomatically and effectively deal with government officials who are stepping outside their lawful authority or jurisdiction and violating your unalienable rights and immunities, or constitutional rights as a sover- eign “state” Citizen. Although, the courts are confrontation - al, your posture doesn’t have to be belligerent and angry. These are ineffective strategies and will get you in trouble. You will learn how to handle a traffic stop, how to use your constitutionally guaranteed rights as a jurist to judge not only the facts, but the law itself, and how to challenge the constitutionality of a statute. Nothing in law is ever certain, or absolute. American law is only enforceable if We the People are willing to stand behind it and use it in our daily lives. “ The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men/women to do nothing.” —Edmund Burke 1729—1797 Basic Concepts of Law Law, like many other professions, has its own language and basic concepts that must be understood. In law, “black” could mean “white” and “white” could mean “black.” Always refer to a good law dictionary (e.g. Black’s Law Dictionary, Bouvier’s American Law Dictionary) for the legal definition of any terms. For example, in popular usage the word “person” has come to mean you and I as human beings, people or individuals. We often refer to each other as “persons” without comprehending the jurisdictional trap. But the legal definition of “person” is very specific. In fact, in the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) alone, there are over 162 unique definitions and applications of the word “person.” Sometimes it means a natural-born human being, but not consistently. So when I ask, “Are you a person required to file an income tax?” You best know what context or definition is being applied. > PERSON — legal fiction, corporation, trust or other commercial entity; natural-born human being or individual; in common usage, the term ‘person’ does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the [word] are ordinarily construed to exclude it. This discrepancy between the legal definition and the common-use definition of terms has created a lot of misconceptions about the law, due process, and courtroom procedure. These have served those who would benefit from our ignorance of the law. 4 An important distinction exists between “lawful” and “legal.” What is “lawful” always pertains to the substantive Common law of the land—including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights (e.g., your lawful right to contract or right to travel). What is “legal” pertains to the statutory forms and usages of the law—commercial, administrative, legislative, rules and regulations (e.g., business licenses, driver’s license). “ Unlawful” pertains to a violation of the Constitution for the usA or the Bill of Rights. “Illegal” pertains to a breech or violation of a private, statutory contract. An activity or behavior can be both “unlawful” and “legal” simultaneously, or vice versa (a bad law can be unlawful and legal at the same time). “Legal” is not necessarily “right.” “Illegal” is not necessarily “wrong.” Law is the philosophy of a nation in action. - 188 -"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Basic Concepts of Law “ An unconstitutional act is not law; it conferred no rights; it imposes no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.” —Norton vs. Shelby County, 118 US 425 p.442 In 1998, the Constitution is still the “law of the land” of the united states of America. “Statutory” laws (i.e. legislative, private, corporate, police and administrative law), created by the federal legislative democracy of the United States, and those created by the corporate States must conform to the principles and original intent of the Constitution. “ No statute or Code can work to violate the common law rights of the sovereign people.” —Bouvier's Law Dictionary There are many “bad” statutory laws on the books that do violate constitutional law and principles, (providing we haven’t “waived” these rights by contract). Bad laws require legally enabled, sovereign “state” Citizens to challenge them. U.S. citizens have no such right. “ The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.” —16 Am Jur 2d, Sec 177, late 2d, Sec 256 The Constitution is Controlling In any administrative or court case, demand that the agency or court not uphold any unconstitutional applications of any statutes. Marbury supra has been upheld nearly 400 times in the ensuing nearly 20 decades and has never been overruled or reversed. It has been repeatedly upheld in the courts that: “ All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void.” —Chief Justice Marshall, Marbury v Madison 5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 174, 176. (1803). “ The duty of the court is to insure the Constitution is construed in favor of the citizen” —Byars vs U.S., 273 US 28. “ The Court is to protect Constitutionally secured rights” —Boyd v U.S., 116 US 616. The Constitution was written in plain, simple language, using words that everyone could understand to insure that the intent of the founding fathers would not be misinterpreted. Each word was carefully chosen and today we need only understand the meaning of the words as used in those days. “ The framers of the statute are presumed to know and understand the meaning of the words used, and where the language used is clear and free from ambiguity, and not in conflict with other parts of the same act, the courts must assume the legislative intent to be what the plain meaning of the words used import.” —First National Bank v United States, 38 F (2nd) 925 at 931 (March 3, 1930). “ A legislative act is to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislature, apparent upon its face. Every technical rule, as to the construction or force of particular terms, must yield to the clear expression of the paramount will of the legislature.” —2 Pet. 662. “ The intention of the legislature, when discovered, must prevail, any rule of construction declared by previous acts to the contrary notwithstanding.” —4 Dall 144. “ The intention of the law maker constitutes the law.” — U.S. v Freeman, 3 HOW 565; U.S. v Babbit, 1 Black 61; Slater v Cave, 3 Ohio St 80. By definition of the word “Code,” one can see that statutes are regulatory law. “ A body of law established by the legislative authority of the state, and designed to regulate completely, so far as a statue may, the subject to which it relates.” —Bouvier's Law Dictionary (1914) Jury Rights & Who Judges the Law? As sovereign “state” Citizens, We the People have the unalienable sovereign right to “take the law into our own hands.” We can obey a “good” law, challenge a “bad” law either by disobeying or ignoring it. Of course, if we do so then we must be responsible to defend our rights and challenge the law. - 189 -"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook We the People have the unalienable sovereign right to a trial with jury should the corporate State choose to prosecute us when we disobey or ignore a bad law. If enough people ignore a bad law, it will be as if it were null and void. Prohibition ended not by repeal, but by noncompliance with the law. “A law is never overturned until at least one individual challenges it, and is never repealed until enough people ignore it.” As a jurist, you have the right to judge not only the facts but the law, despite what judges and attorneys tell you. A man in the old West was being tried for stealing a horse. It so happened that the man was accused of stealing a horse from another man whom no one in the town liked. The case was tried and presented to the jury. The evidence against the accused man was strong. The Judge asked if they had reached a verdict. They replied, “We find the defendant not guilty if he will return the horse. After the Judge silenced the laughter in the courtroom he told the jury that he could not accept that verdict, that they’d have to deliberate and find another. No member of the jury had any liking for the man whose horse had been stolen as he had at one time or another gotten the best of each of them. About a hour later, the jury reentered the courtroom and the Judge asked if they had reached another verdict. The courtroom was silent. The jury answered, “We find the defendant not guilty and he can keep the horse. The moral of this story is that the jury has not only the right to judge the law and the facts, but has the common sense intelligence to do so. In a republic, justice is determined from the bottom up, not the top down. 5 Sovereign “state” Citizens have the right and the judicial capacity to challenge the constitutionality of a statute all the way to the supreme Court. What we don’t have is a judicial system that honors or acknowledges the sovereignty of the people, OR the supremacy of the Common law. The California supreme Court Annual Review of Lower Courts recently concluded that State courts routinely violate the constitutional and due process rights of defendants, including fully informing juries of their right to judge both the facts and the law. You have the right to vote your conscience. The jury has more power than anyone else in the courtroom. You need to know that, exercise it and not get disqualified because you do. “The jury is also free to judge the merits of the law itself, its use in the case at hand, the motives of the accused person, and anything else necessary for it to reach what it feels is a just verdict...Judges seem to have forgotten that they are supposed to serve merely as referees of courtroom disputes, and as neutral legal advisors to the jury.” 5 As a “U.S. citizen (i.e., alien)” though, you have no right to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, although you can vote your conscience on a jury. An “alien” has no right to raise the question whether a statute violates the Constitution because an “alien” is not a de jure Citizen. “ I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.” —Thomas Jefferson Today during jury selection, jurors are routinely screened assuring only U.S. citizens are selected. This is a fundamental violation against the sovereign rights of “state” Citizens. The statutory “civil” right to a trial by jury (for U.S. citizens) was not authorized by Congress until the Civil Rights Act of 1968. If every defendant insisted upon his/her right to a jury trial, the entire judicial system would collapse overnight. This would insure that the assembly line of “justice” for revenue collection currently practiced in the courts would cease or slow down. In practice, the jurors are only allowed to hear what the government allows them. The greatest enemy of the large law firms and corrupt de facto governments is the impartial judge and the educated, fully informed jury. Before anyone can be brought to trial for an infamous crime by those acting on behalf of the government, an indictment must be obtained from people serving on an independent “grand jury.” The grand jury is based on Common law in which a jury is called to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant a trial of the person accused of a crime. The grand jury, state or federal, has powers to subpoena, to take testimony from witnesses and/or dismiss a case. When Hoppy Heidelberg sat on a federal grand jury regarding the Oklahoma City bombing, he acted independently of the federal prosecutor and was rebuked and discharged for acting responsibility and fulfilling his duties as a juror. This aint’ the way it’s supposed to be. “ A grand jury’s purpose is to protect the public from an overzealous prosecutor.” —Minneapolis Star and Tribune 6 The principle was established in our republican form of government that ONLY the people should have the power to institute criminal prosecutions, not the professional prosecutors or the attorney generals. This disallows government prosecutors from maliciously prosecuting Citizens for political crimes, or bringing charges without sufficient evidence to proceed to trial. When you are acting as a jury member, you have the power with your “vote” to disregard the instructions of any judge or attorney in rendering your “Guilty” or “Not Guilty.” If only one juror votes “Not Guilty” for any reason, there is no conviction and no punishment at the end of the trial. Thus, those acting on behalf of the government must come before the common people sitting on juries to get permission to enforce a law. Do you understand the power in this? - 190 -"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Jury Rights & Who Judges the Law? When Laura Kriho sat on a jury and decided her conscience couldn’t convict for the alleged crime, she was indicted for obstruction of justice by the judge. This ain’t the way it’s supposed to be. Having juries bow to the judges instructions to judge only the facts, not the law, is an insult to the intention of our founding fathers and mothers, but it’s the way the courts operate today. Nobody is above the law, especially those acting on behalf of the government. If the law is an unjust one, then it must be judged null and void by juries acting in consort. The only real power a judge has over the jury is their ignorance and fear of retribution. “ It is not only his right, but his duty... to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court. —John Adams Whose Flag is Flying in America Today? In MARITIME law, the “Law of the Flag” is flown to notice all who enter into contracts with the master that he intends the laws of the flag to be the basis of all contracts. A gold-fringe on a flag was always used on merchant ships when they entered a foreign port to show that any dispute in that port would be settled under International Law Merchant Codes of law in an Admiralty / Maritime jurisdiction. The gold-fringe is called a “badge” which is a distinctive border. It signifies an “ensign” in the navy, and is also a “Military flag.” “ The placing of a fringe on the national flag, the dimensions of the flag and the arrangements of the stars in the Union are matters of detail not controlled by statute, but are with the discretion of the President as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.” —34 Op Atty Gen 483 (1925) There is much debate about whether or not the gold-fringe signifies an Admiralty/Maritime OR a Military/Martial law jurisdiction. In a “statutory” courtroom having the rules of one blend with the rules of the other appears consistent with practice. We are under Military/Martial law because of the perpetual bankruptcy of the federal United States corpora- tion and thus courts are ruled under emergency war powers acts. §1. Flag: stripes and stars on The flag of the United States shall be thirteen horizontal stripes, alternative red and white; and the Union of the flag shall be forty-eight stars, white in a blue field.—July 30, 1947, ch.389, 61 Stat. 642 Executive Order No. 10798 Ex. Ord. No. 10798, 24 F.R. 79, which prescribed proportions and sizes of flags until July 4, 1960, was revoked by section 33 of Ex. Ord. No. 10834, set out as a note under this section. Executive Order No. 10834. Proportions and Sizes of Flags and Position of Stars Ex. Ord. No. 10834, Aug. 21, 1959, 24 F.R. 6865, provided: WHEREAS the State of Hawai’i has this day been admitted into the Union; and WHEREAS section 2 of title 4 of the USC provides as follows: “On the admission of a new State into the Union one star shall be added to the union of the flag; and such addition shall take effect on the fourth day of July then next succeeding such admission.” You may have noticed that the State courts no longer fly the familiar United States flag that we symbolically raise on July 4 th , and flew above most federal buildings. This flag signifies a military flag, not a civil flag of the United States. All of the state and Municipal courts openly display it with the gold-fringe, or admiralty banner. Federal courts have always operated in a genuine Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction. 24 There also is a civil flag of the United States that hasn’t been flown since the Civil War. We’ve been in a perpetual state of war since the federal United States declared itself to be supreme over the sovereign state republics. Now the States are treated as mere U.S. territories and possessions. The U.S. government has apparently decided the sovereign states are its territories, so it asserts its military power over them under the “law of the flag.” Instead of the United States military or civil flag or the flag of the sovereign state republic, the gold-fringed Admiralty / Maritime/Military/Martial law flag flies in State courts, federal courts and buildings, public schools, banks, and even inside the oval office of the President of the United States. Today, the U.S. military flag appears alongside, on top of, or in place of the state flags in nearly all locations within the states. The UN flag has no business whatsoever flying within a sovereign state republic. The people of the United States actually have two national flags, one signifying the military government and the other signifying the civil government. As the war against the American people is still going on, the U.S. government hasn't flown the civil flag since the Civil War, except in the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs. Peace has never been declared, nor have hostilities against the people ended. The government is still operating under quasi-military rule. We the People have been under a perpetual state of national emergency since the Civil War with few interruptions. Prior to World War II, the United States flag, neither military nor civil, didn’t fly anywhere within the sovereign states except over explicitly federal areas. State flags flew high and proud. In a sovereign state republic it is proper for the flag of that state to fly above the United States flag. - 191 -"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook We the People could reinstate both the state and U.S. civil flags, declare a state of peace and reclaim the sovereignty of the states. Imagine that! 7 Gold-Fringed Flag Returned to Court County Commissioners in Ferry County, Washington removed a gold-fringed flag from the courtroom because Commissioner Jim Hall said he was shown government documents proving that fringed flags are inappropriate. Commissioner Hall, who assured everyone that he doesn't subscribe to constitutionalist views, said the flag was removed to appease “anti-government constitutionalists,” according to an article in Spokane's Spokesman Review. After several months of fruitless negotiation, presiding Su - perior Court Judge, Larry Kristianson, threatened legal ac - tion against Hall, saying he could order the flag replaced and have Hall jailed if he got in the way. To avoid a confrontation that could have been “politically explosive” it was agreed that the judge would buy a new fringed replacement flag with his own money if the commissioners would promise to leave it alone. “No person is authorized to come into the court and take accouterments of the court without the court's permission,” he said. 8 Distinctions of American Law The genuine distinctions of jurisprudence (COMMON LAW, EQUITY, ADMIRALTY/MARITIME), and the courts practicing in various jurisdictions have been merged into a uniform, apparently seamless web of “federalized courts” administering the law of commercial contract. Most of the state/State courts have merged with the federal mandates and relinquished their independence under the separation of powers doctrines. Article III of the Constitution specifies that all courts must be under one of the following three genuine jurisdictions: 1. Common Law; 2. Equity; or 3. Admiralty/Maritime. > COMMON LAW— system of jurisprudence based on his - torical, judicial precedent (court decisions and case law) rather than legislative enactment (public laws & statutes); a court of Common law is a tribunal with jurisdiction over cas - es in Law; includes the law merchant and mercantile law, a body of commercial law of the merchants of England from which the negotiable instruments law derived; law does not compel performance; you are free to do anything providing you do not infringe on someone else’s life, liberty or proper - ty; there must be a damaged party; no victim—no crime; courts of Common law have merged with courts of equity in most jurisdictions; Common law courts have been created by the people in a few jurisdictions in the absence of Com - mon law remedies in the existing, “statutory” court system. > EQUITY— system of jurisprudence based on providing an exact remedy for every injury, in cases where the common law would give inadequate redress; (e.g,. bankruptcy court); compel performance on American or quasi-contracts; it has no criminal penalty; contempt of court is the only criminal action in an equity court. > ADMIRALTY/MARITIME— body of law separate from every other jurisprudence with jurisdiction over all actions and breeched international contracts at sea or within the jurisdiction of the legislative democracy of the federal United States courts; has civil, statutory jurisdiction with criminal penalties; the sovereign rights of the open sea (where no nation has jurisdiction) has long been legal home to sovereign Power structures (e.g., international banking families); the law merchant and maritime are inseparable in a country dependent upon sea commerce (e.g., England). > MILITARY/MARTIAL LAW— similar to Admiralty / Maritime except that it’s under the jurisdiction of the military tribunal in a state of a national emergency; our courts mirror both under the gold-fringed flag. “ The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in [Common] Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the [Common] Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority... to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction... to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State; between Citizens of different States; ... and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” —Constitution for the usA [3:2:1] In approaching an officer of the court, either by appearance, by special appearance to challenge jurisdiction or by affidavit, identify the jurisdiction of the court and get it on the record. The judges and officers of the court will hedge when you ask, as they do not like to be boxed into a answer. They will offer some story about it being “statutory,” which is clearly not a constitutional jurisdiction. > STATUTORY LAW— legislative, private, corporate, and administrative procedures law of the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia; no Common law concepts of unalienable rights; not a constitutional jurisdiction, not a signatory to the Constitution, subject to no law except it’s own; subject to “trust territory” treaty law placed under the administration of a country, renamed United States Inc., by the United Nations and their foreign principals/creditors. “ Where the people fear the government you have tyranny; where the government fears the people, you have liberty.” —Citizens Rule Book Here’s some important rules of the game. You can be tried only once in each jurisdiction (no double jeopardy). There are two types of action that can be taken against an individual: civil OR criminal. - 192 -"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Distinctions of American Law Civil actions can be brought by or against U.S. citizens, including sovereign “state” Citizens, a state republic OR a federal, corporate State. If a state/State charges you with a civil offense, it must go to federal court. The Constitution provides for only Common Law and Admiralty/Maritime in criminal actions. The federal government doesn’t have the constitutional authority to bring criminal charges against any Citizen in the state republic. All criminal actions against any Citizen must be brought by the state itself. Federal statutes and criminal code only applies to federal government employees and other “U.S. citizens” in their ex - clusive legislative jurisdiction. Most of the people criminally charged and convicted in federal prison were never in the proper or lawful jurisdiction of the democracy. Understand - ing sovereignty and the separation of powers is essential to develop a winning strategy in the courts. > CIVIL ACTION— to protect a private right or to compel a civil remedy; no criminal penalties attached; concerned with the rights and duties of persons with regard to contracts or tort; has no fine; matters of form rather than substantive law; Equity courts and jurisdiction; you have the burden of proof in a civil matter; constitutional rights do not apply; how much damage and what remedies will compensate for the damage done? > CRIMINAL ACTION— done with malicious intent with a disposition to injure persons or property; traffic and tax cases are defined as criminal cases (with fines); only Common law and Admiralty deal with criminal cases; a person charged with a crime is brought to trial and either found not guilty or guilty and sentenced; requires an indictment from a grand jury; a criminal conviction renders a person legally incompetent; you are not a “criminal” unless convicted. Due Process and the Bill of Rights There is little “due process of law” left in the Article 1, administrative and legislative tribunals, mostly the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) rules and procedures apply, along with the Administrative Procedures Act and judicial review providing you appear and agree to be subjected to their jurisdiction. Very few legal processes satisfy the minimum due process requirements and can be argued on that basis. Inadequate, insufficient or unlawful process can be abated with a “Non- Statutory Abatement.” The UCC has been almost universally adopted by the corporate States and many international jurisdictions as well, although many of the new changes have yet to be adopted. “ Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.” —Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436 p.491 “Due process of law” is more than simply knowing what your rights are as read to you by a government official when you are under arrest (e.g., Miranda rights). Due process embodies the principle that government may not deprive an individual of life, liberty or property unless certain rules and procedures required by “law” are followed. In my experience in the courts, due process is violated consistently at every level of the system, but more so at the lower end. The questions are what “law” is being applied, does it apply to you, and whether or not the particular “court” has jurisdiction over either the “subject matter” or over you. The federal United States government and the court system at all levels, in any jurisdiction, are operating under the “presumption” that all Americans have accepted government benefits, therefore are “subject” to the federal United States government. Thus, follows the presumption, every American is liable for the payment of government debts. The U.S. citizen “causes” a presumption of contract. Despite the so-called “presumption of innocence” rule, the defendant in these administrative courts are prima facie guilty of being a “debtor” to the government. Contracting with the government at any level compels us to perform according to the terms of the contract. 9 Since the federal United States government has no general jurisdiction over sovereign “state” Citizens, they will attempt to trick you into “volunteering” into federal jurisdiction along with their civil and criminal code, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The unwritten law, is of course, the Common law, (the Law non scripta) which is that system of law guaranteed to the sovereign people by the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. “ The adoption of the 14 th (or 15 th ) Amendment completed the circle of protection against violations of the provisions of Magna Carta, which guaranteed to the sovereign people their life, liberty, and property against interference except by the ‘Law of the Land,’ which phrase was coupled in the petition of right with due process of law. The latter phrase was then used for the first time, but the two are generally treated as meaning the same. This security is provided as against the United States by the 14 th (or 15 th ) and 5 th Amendments, and against the States by the 14 th (or 15th) Amendment.” — Davidson v New Orleans, 96 US 97. As cited above, the meaning of the due process clause is that the common law shall be the unalienable right of the sovereign People, nor can it be removed from them by mere statutes. - 193 -"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook No new systems of law can be forced upon them. I have the right to live under the protection of the Constitution; it is your birthright. To restore due process of law, you must learn to avoid many jurisdictional traps. You cannot win in the administrative tribunals on constitutional grounds once you have “appeared” within their jurisdiction. The Constitution has no application within a federal zone, or in a court of Admiralty/Maritime codified as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The law of the land applies only under the Common law. “ The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” —4th Amendment, Constitution for the usA Most Americans do not know what rights they have or how to exercise them. Too often, We the People have been trampled or penalized in our best efforts to secure these rights by overzealous or power-hungry government officials who often make choices to enforce specific laws against certain people for various reasons at their own personal discretion, not for the sake of justice or the true public interest. The rules of the game of “law” are changing so quickly, are so complicated and inaccessible to the common people, that most people haven’t a clue as to what the rules are. Only the professional insiders (e.g. attorneys, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, clerks etc.) in the so-called criminal justice system know how the system actually works, and even that is dubious assumption given their track record. These supposed public servants are not giving the people responsible notice, nor instructing them about the rules of the game. The law is often being used against the people, often to extort funds for servicing the public debt at every level of government (e.g., exorbitant traffic tickets or bails). To have rights and exercise due process, you must know what they are, then be able to defend those rights. Otherwise you don’t have any! Once you know who you are, whether a sovereign “state” Citizen or a U.S. citizen, you’ll have a clearer set of options. In any court case, you have the right to obtain a reasonable postponement so you can prepare your defense, or preferably your offense. You have the right to be informed of the charges against you. You have the right of pre-trial discovery. You have the right to call or subpoena witnesses to testify on your behalf. Most Americans still believe in the myth of “civil rights” and that all people are treated equally under the law in a “democracy.” Nothing could be farther from the truth. Specific classes and races of people are treated more harshly under the hard glove of the law (as they’ve always been), prejudiced and subject to exorbitant bails as preventive detention, incarcerated without sufficient or probable cause, railroaded through the justice system like so many cattle. Institutionalized injustice and corruption of the criminal justice system for the sake of the revenue-collection by local, State and federal government must stop! 5 th Amendment Rights The Fifth article of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution for the united States provides: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” A similar provision exists in all the State constitutions; the phrases “due course of law,” and the \"law of the land\" are sometimes used; but all three of these phrases have the same meaning and that implies conformity with the ancient and customary laws of the English people or laws indicated by Parliament. 10 “ No [real] person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,...; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” —5th Amendment, Constitution for the usA For example, if the IRS summons you to an audit, you have the right not to show the IRS any of your books or records. Demand your 4 th Amendment rights, and do not volunteer information under any form of intimidation. Demand to see the enacting clauses and enforcing regulations that give them any authority to tax your income. If the IRS wants to pursue your case (and they probably don’t), let them do some extra legwork. The Privacy Protection Act provides for a $1,000 penalty for improper search and seizure. 12 “ Only the rare taxpayer would be likely to know that he could refuse to produce his records to IRS agents.” —U.S. vs. Dickerson, 413F2d 1111(CA7 1969) To prove tax evasion, or “willful failure to file,” the government must first prove “willfulness.” The supreme - 194 -"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve 5th Amendment Rights Court ruled in 1992 that a taxpayer who sincerely believed that federal income tax laws did not apply to him or her could not be convicted of tax evasion, since tax laws required “willful” conduct. If you sincerely believe the law doesn’t apply to you, then you cannot be guilty of any criminal “willfulness.” 11 In 1977, the IRS investigated 8391 cases, 3408 were recommended for prosecution, 1636 were indicted by grand juries and 247 were convicted, and less than half of them spent time in a federal prison. You’re 400 times more likely to be killed in an automobile each year than going to jail for willful failure to file a tax return. 12 “ The 5 th Amendment is an old friend and a good friend. It is one of the greatest landmarks in man’s struggle to be free of tyranny, to be decent and civilized.” —supreme Court Justice William O.

The individual states delegated specific powers to the federal United States including the authority to interface with other sovereign nations on behalf of the sovereign people, deliver mail, raise and train a national army in times of need, maintain a navy, and coin money for profit. “ Poor people have access to the courts in the same sense that Christians had access to the lions.” —Judge Earl Johnson Jr. Originally, there were only 3 federal laws. Today, there are over 3,000. The federal United States government has far exceeded its original authority. “Congress passed almost 2,500 new “laws” in 1992... There were 67,715 pages of new regulations written and published in the Federal Register in 1992, and that suffices as legal public notice of the new laws and regulations... Each U.S. citizen is considered responsible to know, understand, and abide by these new laws and regulations. Ignorance of the [Common] law in America is no excuse.” These reams of “statutory” laws have become so complex and oppressive that even teams of top-notch professional Attorneys cannot keep track of every statute, its applicability, and its consequences. The U.S. Congress primarily makes laws that pertain to the federal “United States” and its subjects. But it also makes laws for the “united states of America” which have general applicability. - 196 -"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Federal Law and United States Code These are called “positive” law. Positive law is actually and specifically enacted or adopted by proper authority for the government of an organized “jural society” or state. There are 50 Titles of United States Code (U.S.C.), some of which have been enacted as “positive law”— the irrefutable law of the united states of America. This law has survived the test of time. Positive Law Many of the titles of the United States Code (U.S.C.) are “non-positive law” which are still pending enactment as “positive law,” (e.g., Title 26, Internal Revenue Code). Only positive law applies to sovereign “state” Citizens of the several states, while non-positive law does not. Only 21 of the titles of the U.S.C. contain positive law and they are indicated in the Code. Positive law must also be published in the Federal Register. If a statute is not published in the Federal Register it indicates that the statute has limited applicability. Non- positive laws are contracts, applicable only to those who have voluntarily entered into the jurisdiction or the contract (e.g., U.S. citizens, or signing a 1040 form). Rules become law when you agree to obey them. Non- positive, private corporate law is presumed applicable unless you challenge jurisdiction and venue as a sovereign “state” Citizen. As a U.S. citizen of the District of Columbia, you are subject to the letter of all the laws and statutes, including the non-positive law. 16 “ ...Provided, however that whenever titles of such [United States] Code shall have been enacted into positive law the text thereof shall be legal evidence of the laws therein contained, in all the courts of the [federal] United States, the several states, and the territories and insular possessions of the [federal] United States [within the 48 states].” —1 U.S.C., Section 204(a) Limits of Federal and Federal State Jurisdiction Editor’s Note: Dan Meador has argued this juris-dictional argument on several occasions. Herein lies some history and what's possible once we bring this issue into the light of day. Sooner or later the government won't be able to ignore the obvious fraud they've been perpetuating on the American people for generations. Thank you Dan for your incredible research. \"In the American system, the people are sovereign. All government operates on the premise of delegated authority, with the people retaining all the rights and powers not specifically delegated. In this system, only peers can charge and ultimately convict a fellow sovereign. Government does not legitimately have independent power and authority to charge or prosecute the sovereign except during times of war and substantial emergency.\" This has been the case since the bankruptcy and emergency war powers acts of 1933. A. Drew Edmondson, Attorney General for Oklahoma responded to Meador's Memorandum of Law by arguing lack of jurisdiction for the Oklahoma supreme Court, the absence of an actionable controversy, and presumption in support of carte blanche legislative authority. The dual character of the state; the de jure state republic and the de facto federal State, and the multiple characters of the United States — particularly Congress' role as government for the state republics within the constitutional framework, and as government for the self-interested geographical Unit - ed States — was not challenged or refuted. The operational link between the geographical United States and the de facto federal State was not disputed. And finally, the unconstitutional character of Civil Law facilitated by State and United States code was not challenged. The Attorney General did not dispute that the Constitution for the united states of America mandates gold and silver coin as legal tender for payment of debt. Nor did he dispute that the10th Amendment and the “Separation of Powers Doctrine” prohibit the state republics from acquiescing to federal authority, thereby functioning as federal States, without constitutional amendment which specifically delegates authority to the United States which is not already articulated in the Constitution (New York v. United States, et all, 1992). Title 31, United States Code. Federal agencies are eligible for participation defined at 5 USC §§102 & 105. Legitimate federal States can participate, but the state republics are excluded. This limits the legal operating sphere for United States-chartered financial institutions to the District of Columbia and United States territories, insular possessions and federal enclaves such as military bases. State republics participate in the scam, but as de facto (i.e., unlawful) federal States, not as state republics party to the Constitution for the united states of America. Numerous blocks of cooperative federalism was instituted during the Roosevelt Administration, including the Buck Act (4 USC §§101 - 107) which authorizes federal States to enter into compacts and other joint enterprise. Freemen/women and sovereign “state” Citizens have insisted on their right to protection under Common law. They have also invoked 11th Amendment separation of powers between the “state” (the sovereign is the “state” in fact) and federal jurisdiction and authority. These are well established principles in law. Many people, including the Freemen, have challenged the authority of the federal government or the FBI to operate within any of the states of the Union (U.S. vs. Lopez, 63 U.S.L.W. 4343 (April 25, 1995); New York vs. Mihl, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 102 (1837); People vs. Godfrey, 17 Johns, 225 (N.Y. 1819). The U.S. supreme Court held that Congress could exercise no police powers within the states. This would apply to the FBI also, as it is a creation of Congress (Keller vs. United States, 213 J.D. 138, 20 S. Cr. 470 (1909). The FBI, in order to deal with any issue in good faith would have to present a delegation of authority signed by the Presi - dent (California Bankers Association vs. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21). Treasury Decision 95-A specifically states that any agency - 197 -"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook that purports to represent the United States has to have such a certified delegation of authority, or they don't have it. This would also be relevant for IRS actions in the states, as the IRS is not part of the federal government as most people believe, nor do they have any delegation of authority. Under the UCC and most state statutes, all “persons,” in - cluding government agencies, transacting business in a state, shall execute and file with the secretary of state, an ap - plication for registration of the assumed business name. Failure to do so bars that person from maintaining any suit or action in any of the courts of the state under that name. Since the FBI refused to present any such authority, why would any Citizen, including the Freemen, benefit from ne - gotiating with an agency that had no authority? The law provides important protections for people who are pending extradition (e.g., the Freemen). A grand jury is a rare event in Montana; the state constitution provides that only a district judge can convene one. 28 USC §1359 dictates the fact that a district court shall NOT have jurisdiction of a civil action concerning foreign bills of exchange. The federal court cannot gain jurisdiction under “diversity of citizenship.” 17 To date, the Montana Freemen have not been properly or lawfully “indicted,” nor convicted, as they did not grant ju - risdiction to the federal government. They remain political prisoners in a system that no longer honors or respects the law or the separation of powers. How do we make our government accountable to the law? Federal Jurisdiction Limited By Supreme Court Ruling Alphonso Lopez was convicted in Texas for carrying a gun to school in March, 1992. Prior to the ABA’s monopoly over the courts and the rise of federal power, defendants charged in criminal cases pursuant to federal law alleged to have occurred with the state were dismissed upon motion or appeal. Chief Justice John Marshall made clear the Constitution prohibited the federal government from assuming any police power within a state. On April 26, 1995, Chief Justice Rehnquist writes the overall opinion of the Court's findings: “ The Act [a federal criminal statute intended to be enforced within a state] exceeds Congress’ Commerce clause authority. To uphold the government's contention [that it can bring criminal charges for a crime alleged to have been committed within a State] would require this Court to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional Commerce authority to a general police power of the sort held only by the States.” —Supreme Court Reporter, 55 CCH S.Ct., Bull This could be the precedent for the release of thousands of federal prisoners convicted under federal law in criminal matters because they were unconstitutionally convicted. 18 Defeating Bogus Presumptions STRATEGY: Defeat the underlying presumptions described as constructive trusts (operates as a logical syllogism). Major Premise All human beings are persons. Minor Premise Dan is a human being. Conclusion If both A & B are true, then Dan is a person. Bogus presumptions include: 1. The states are federal States rather than independent state republics party to the Constitution. 2. Those subjected to statutory Civil Law are citizens or residents of the geographical United States. For example, the presumption that Congress has unrestricted legislative jurisdiction within the geographical United States. Rather than being state republics party to the Constitution, the states are presumed to be federal States. Therefore, Congress presumes to have unrestricted legislative authority throughout the American empire, inclusive of what should be independent state republics subject only to constitutionally delegated authorities. 3. A third contributing element is the presumption that the American people in general are “citizens of the United States” as prescribed in section 1 of the 14th Amendment. Until 1868, when Congress adopted this amendment, which was never properly ratified, there was no such thing as a “citizen of the United States.” The de jure people were Citizens of their respective state republics as principals rather than subjects. 4. “Person” has become a poorly defined term, limited to specific applications of the law. For example, the Oregon Revised Statutes has over 150 different definitions of the word “person.” Are you a “person” required? You better well know before arguing whether or not you're required to obey a particular statute. 19 Sovereignty and Separation of Powers In the American system, the people are sovereign. All government operates on the premise of delegated authority, with the people retaining all rights and powers not specifically delegated. In this system, only a jury of peers can charge, indict and ultimately convict a fellow sovereign. Government does not legitimately have independent power and authority to charge or prosecute the sovereign except during times of war and substantial emergency. Federal and state constitutions reaffirm the people are the ultimate political power in the united states of America. Why? Because all laws and governments were created from the authority of the sovereign. - 198 -"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Sovereignty and Separation of Powers Look at the state constitutions, and you’ll see that the people are the ultimate political power. In Oregon, the Bill of Rights was the first Article. “ We declare that all men, when they form a social compact are equal in right: that all power is inherent to the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness; and they have at all times a right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such a manner as they may think proper. — Article 1, Section 1, Oregon Constitution Every sovereign American National OR “state” Citizen is his/her own King/Queen, ruling not over others, but over him/herself. We the People retain our judicial powers and are in fact, and in law, justices of “Our One Supreme Court.” > QUO WARRANTO — by whose authority? The fourth branch of “government” in this republic is We the People with full judicial capacity and sovereign powers. We the People assembled under Common law right are the judge, the jury and the executioner if need be. I assert, the court system was never intended to be an institution separate from the people, worse intended to be a court system used against the people. Look at the state constitutions, and you’ll see that the people are the ultimate political power. There is no superior power to the sovereign. \"The people of this state do not yield their Sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.\" —California Government Code, §54950, Declaration, Intent; sovereignty By not waiving Common law venue, not accepting a nom de guerre (i.e., war name under emergency and war powers acts) or 14 th Amendment slave name, not admitting to being a defendant, not accepting a court-appointed attorney, insisting on Common law and trial with jury, and invoking the “11 th Amendment” of the Constitution, the separation of powers between the state and the federal is mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). The federal government or federal State cannot bring a criminal action against a Citizen — only a grand jury of, by and for the people can. 11 th Amendment Precludes Jurisdiction of the United States Courts Within the States FRCP, Rule 54 defines “Act of Congress” as being specifically applicable only to the District of Columbia and within other United States territorial jurisdiction. Aside from everything else, the 11 th Amendment precludes jurisdiction of United States courts within the states. Within the framework of the “Foreign Sovereign Immuni-ties Act of 1976,” the de jure people, Citizens of the state republics, are states in fact where the geographical United States is concerned. “ Citizens” Of State Republics = “States” In Fact The courts must offer due process, and protect constitutional rights under the “7th Amendment.” We the People have a choice of venues (i.e., Common law or corporate). “ The Judicial power of the [federal] United States shall not be construed to extend to any suite in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state. —11 th Amendment 20 We the People have the choice of applicable territorial law. Law in the law books is presumed correct. Do not waive your Common law venue! Acceptance of an attorney to “represent” you vs. “presenting” yourself is a lienable event and must be avoided at all costs. To execute this requires scripting and coaching by someone experienced in these matters. It’s easy to get tripped up and stumble into their jurisdiction. §1-105 Territorial Application of the Act; Parties Power to Choose Applicable Law (1) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this Act applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state. Venue and Jurisdiction Always and clearly “Reserve all your Rights” under the Common law pursuant to UCC 1-207 in your “Refusal for Cause, Without Dishonor.” Unalienable sovereign rights are guaranteed by both the state and federal constitutions, the organic law of the land, although these courts are reluctant to admit it. If the court proceeds in a cause of action against you under the Common law without proper and lawful jurisdiction, then the judge has lost his/her official immunity, and can be personally sued for violations of your rights under color of law. You have the right to know the nature and cause of the action. You can challenge the jurisdiction of the court. One way to illustrate a simple challenge of jurisdiction is through a “Special or Limited Appearance.” Here’s a sample jurisdictional argument as it relates to a Municipal court. Let’s pretend for a moment, that there isn’t any monkey business going on in the courts, and it’s operating as it should. That’s a stretch of the imagination, but here goes the monologue. - 199 -"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Sample Jurisdictional Argument: Municipal Court “The 6th Amendment of the Constitution requires a court and its employees to inform me of the “nature” and “cause” of any action against me so that I can properly defend myself. Since the Municipal court only has criminal jurisdiction, and has no subject matter jurisdiction to hear civil matters, I must presume this is a criminal action.” “There are two distinct criminal jurisdictions authorized by the Constitution: (a) criminal action under a Common law jurisdiction; (b) a contract violation under the criminal aspects of an Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction. As the court must well know there are distinctly different defenses for a criminal action under a Common law jurisdiction or an Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction. I must know what jurisdiction and venue the court is operating under to properly defend yourself.” “ Where jurisdiction is challenged, it must be proven.” —Hagans vs. Lavine 415 US 528 at 533 “ No sanction can be imposed absent proof of jurisdiction.” —Standard vs. Olson 74 S.Ct 768 “ If any tribunal [court] finds absence of proof of jurisdiction over person and subject matter, the case must be dismissed.” —Louisville RR vs. Motley, 211 US 149, 29 S.Ct.42 > JURISDICTION— the authority by which courts and judicial officers take cognizance of and decide cases; the legal right by which judges exercise their authority; GENERAL, ORIGINAL, SPECIAL; inherent power to decide a case. > VENUE— the neighborhood, place or county in which an injury is declared to have been done; place where an action is brought to trial. (e.g., The Internal Re-VENUE Service must, by law, bring you into their VENUE, their place to impose an assessment and collect a tax.) So let the judge or officer of the court answer your questions. They’ll give you some goobledygook and assert that the court is under “statutory” jurisdiction. In some cases, the judge has actually admitted being under Admiralty or Military jurisdiction and pointed out the gold-fringed flag to prove it. They are getting bolder with the truth. Point out, there is no such jurisdiction as a “statutory” jurisdiction authorized by any state or federal constitution. If they are practicing law in a “statutory” jurisdiction, challenge the court to produce the book containing the Rules of Criminal Procedure for a statutory jurisdiction. If they cannot, then conclude that they are conducting a criminal action under a secret jurisdiction known only to licensed attorneys. Challenge the court to produce any evi- dence which would give them the authority to proceed in either criminal jurisdiction authorized by the Constitution. Admiralty / Maritime Or Statutory Or Military / Martial Law??? If the judge admits to a COMMON LAW jurisdiction, which is doubtful since the federal United States has been perpetually bankrupt since 1933, then they must, as would say, “produce an injured or damaged party as evidence (corpus delecti).” If they cannot produce an injured or damaged party, then this case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, since without an injured or damaged party there can be no cause of action under the Common law. If the judge admits an EQUITY jurisdiction, demand to have the plaintiff produce the American or domestic contract or quasi-contract that, as you would say, “compels perfor - mance with my signature and authorization on it.” If they cannot produce any such contract, then this case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, since there can be no cause of action without a private contract in force. If the judge admits an ADMIRALTY/MARITIME jurisdic - tion, as the gold-fringed flag in the court indicates, have the plaintiff, as you would say, “produce the original, valid, inter - national contract in dispute with my signature on it.” If such a contract exists, the validity of the international contract must be settled before the trial on issues may begin. If they cannot produce such a contract, then this case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. There is no in personam (personal) jurisdiction in any Admiralty/Maritime proceeding, only in rem (property). Here’s your final statement. Statement Challenging Jurisdiction “I have demonstrated with a preponderance of the evidence regarding the jurisdictional issues, whether argued in personam, in subject matter, Common law or Admiralty, that the court has never had any jurisdiction over the defendant, nor can any ever exist with regards to a sovereign, ‘state’ Citizen. The “guilty by default” on the original citation is void ab initio, because of the lack of both in personam jurisdiction, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It follows, therefore, that the contempt of court charge is also void ab initio. This case should be dismissed and the previous convictions stricken from the records. All future actions against the defendant are estoppeled. You are hereby instructed to enter this “Limited or Special Appearance” in the official court records. I rest my jurisdictional arguments.” FRCP Rule 12(b) Defenses and Objections (b)“...the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: 1. lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter 2. lack of jurisdiction over the person ...A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading... (h)(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.” - 200 -"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Venue and Jurisdiction “ The law requires proof of jurisdiction to appear on the record of the administrative agency and all administrative proceedings.” —Hagans vs. Lavine, 415 U.S. 533 “ Therefore, it is necessary that the record present the fact establishing the jurisdiction of the tribunal.” —Lowe vs. Alexander 15C 296; People vs. Board of Delegates of S.F. Fire Dept. 14 C 479 Common Law The united states of America is a COMMON LAW country, despite the fact that very few lawyers or attorneys study the Common law of England, which is the basis for the state constitutions of thirty-eight (38) states, including California, Washington, and Oregon, and most of the Commonwealth countries England or France had colonized. Common law was not embodied in a specific text or defined code (except in the California Codes of 1872). Rather, it evolved case after case in court decisions which applied the doctrine of precedent or stare decisis. Other features of the Common law include due process of law, juries and the rule of law. Louisiana is an exception having based it’s state constitution on the Common law of France, not England. The other great system of law in the Western world, besides the “Canon law,” was the “Civil law” which was derived from the laws of the Roman Empire. Civil law is the basis for the EQUITY courts in which the judge rules. Attorneys make their living practicing the expedient and highly profitable “statutory,” or commercial law, even though they practice law in jurisdictions where the Common law is still the basis of state law. Before the undeclared federal bankruptcies (1930, 1933, 1938, 1944, 1968, 1993) eventually dismantled the substantive Common law, and replaced it with “colorable,” commercial, Negotiable Instruments law, their international Law Merchant, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), We the People had access to effective, low-cost remedies and conflict resolution in the Courts of Common Pleas, and the Article III, constitutional Common law courts. We must restore these Common law courts to provide recourse and remedy these days. 21 “ Common Law...was adopted as part of organic law of Oregon when state was admitted into Union.” —U.S.F. & G. Co. vs. Bramwell, 108 Or. 261, 217 P. 332, 32 A.L.R. 829 > COURT OF (COMMON) LAW— tribunal with jurisdiction over cases in law which are no longer distinguished from the courts of equity or admiralty; law does not compel performance. In theory, the Small Claims court is still a Common law court and will not allow an attorney to present him/herself before it. According to the Common law, it’s you against your claimant, and the judge will make a decision based on the facts, not on the performance of a professional orator. In theory, the clerk of the County Recorder’s office is still the seat of the constitutional Common law court that prevailed in this country for many years before the judges were removed and replaced with the administrative tribunals that now operate under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). “ The Constitution is to be interpreted according to Common law rules.” —Schick vs. U.S., 195 US 65, 24 Sup Ct. 826, 49L. Ed. 99 Very few people realize that they have a fundamental choice. We the People can live our lives, conduct our business, and resolve disputes under the Common law, or we can submit to “colorable,” commercial law. There is no crime or cause for action under the Common law unless there is a loss of life, liberty, or property. So long as the Constitution is still the law of the land, so is the Common law. Disrespect for the Common law indicates disrespect for the Constitution and the laws preceding it. The Constitution is a Common law contract between the sovereign states and its federal government and must be interpreted as such. “ ...a statute will not be construed so as to overrule a principle of established Common law, unless it is made plain by the act that such a change in the established law is intended.” —Starkey Construction Inc., vs. Elcon, Inc., 248 Ark 958, 978A, 457 SW2d 509, 7U.C.C.RS 923 “ A statute should be construed in harmony with the Common law unless there is a clear legislative intent to abrogate the Common law.” —United Bank vs. Mesa Nelson Co., 121 Ariz 438, 590 P2d 1384, 25 U.C.C.RS 1113 “ The Constitution is to be construed with respect to the law existing at the time of its adoption and as securing to the individual citizen the rights inherited by him under English law, and not with reference to new guarantees.” —Mattox vs. U.S., 156 U.S .237, 15 Sup Ct. 337, 39 L.

Ct. 456 Invoking Common Law Venue The Common law is the highest law of the land. It has never been abolished and is in effect today. An Article III, Section I (Constitution for the united states of America) Constitutional court is a superior court over all statutory, legislatively created Article I courts. An Article III court is a Common law court, also referred to as “Our One Supreme Court,” is preserved under the 7th Amendment and FRCP 38(a). Judicial authority for the supreme Court is authorized under national supreme Court rules “other jurisdiction” in 28 USC, Rule 17.1. The supreme Court can co-exist in the District Court of the United States. The common law court movement in the united states of America is a lawful and constitutional extension of the supreme Court system to every county and locale in the usA. The judicial branch of government is vested in the sovereign American people, not in the administrative courts administering a U.S. bankruptcy. Instead administrative tribunals are attempting to run their secret “star chambers,” routinely denying due process to defendants and plaintiffs in an effort to cover up the truth about the bankruptcy of the United States corporation. Additional proof of the validity of these claims are evident in current (1995) revisions to Title 28. There are significant revisions to Title 28 of the USC (1995 edition) which indicate major strides toward the return of power to the people. In Title 28, the statement (1989 edition) that the supreme Court “sits at the pleasure of the President [as approved by Congress], now reads that the supreme Court “sits at the pleasure of the people.” Title 28 now provides a fund of $1 million to pay the salaries of Common law justices, and for the means to replenish that fund. 22 On July 17th, 1996, the first “King's Bench” to be seated in the U.S. federal court since President Lincoln declared martial law in 1861 was convened in the case of the Freemen of Justus Township. The King’s bench is the supreme court of Common law in England. Schweitzer and the freemen have not waived their Common law venue, thus the federal court was procedurally required to provide one. 23 See the transcripts from the federal court proceeding in Billings, Montana on July 17th, 1996, where federal Judge James M. Burns recognized Chief Justice Leroy Michael, which is Schweitzer's Christian name, in a Common law extradition preceding. Schweitzer was not only recognized as a sovereign, but leading the extradition proceeding–leading the purported \"defendants\" from the corporate, statutory side (i.e. U.S. District Court) of the court to the Common law side (district court of the united states) of the federal court. How can We the People, the courts, the judges, the attorneys, the politicians continue to deny the truth? This is not just an opinion, not a belief, not a conspiracy theory, but a basis in irrefutable law that the people of America are indeed sovereign. Chief Justice Leroy Michael (i.e., Schweitzer) is moving to quash the indictments acting with the authority of the chief Justice of the supreme Court, known at the Court of International Trade in the USC.

A “Writ” is a written court order or judicial process directing that a sheriff or other judicial officer do what is commanded to do. The “All Writs Act” permitted federal appellate courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in the aid of their respective jurisdictions. 25 > WRIT OF CERTIORARI - An order by the appellate court which is used by that court when it has discretion on whether or not to hear an appeal from a lower court. If the writ is denied the court refuses to hear the appeal, and in effect, the judgment below stands unchanged. > WRIT OF ERROR - A writ issued from a court of appellate jurisdiction, directed to the judge(s), requiring them to remit to the appellate court the record of an action before them in which a final judgment has been entered, in order that examination may be made of certain errors alleged to have been committed. > WRIT OF MANDAMUS - A writ issued from a court of superior jurisdiction, directed to a private or municipal corporation, or to an executive, administrative or judicial officer, or to an inferior court, commanding the performance of a specific act belonging to his, her or their public, official or ministerial duties, or directing the restoration of the complainant to rights or privileges of which he/she has been illegally deprived. 26 > QUO WARRANTO - A writ of right for the King or Queen, against him who claimed or usurped any office, franchise, or liberty, to inquire by what authority he supported his/her claim, in order to determine the right. It is a Common law writ designed to test whether a person exercising power is legally entitled to do so. 27 “ The supreme authority in the united states of America is the individual sovereign Citizen.” —Michael Louis Minns 27 Underground Lawyers One of the best all around law-related books I’ve read is Underground Lawyer by Michael Louis Minns, Attorney. Here’s an honest lawyer who has not compromised his principles after 25 years of law practice. This book is full of practical wisdom for the do-it-yourselfer, pro se litigant, concerned citizen, legal assistant or underground lawyer. He’s one of the first mainstream attorneys that I’ve seen acknowledge the American Citizen as a sovereign, while revealing how the legal system actually works, for better or for worse. There are good and bad judges, good lawyers and bad lawyers, and you never know the true landscape of a case until you show up in court. “ An attorney straight out of law school will do $500 worth of work for $5. An attorney after a lifetime of practice does $5 worth of work for $500. There is some merit to this claim.” —Michael Louis Minns, Attorney 28 He suggests that Americans must challenge the government, and reclaim our own authority under the laws of the united states of America . Members of a jury can stand up to the judges and other jurors who refuse to allow you to exercise your constitutional rights to judge both the facts and the law. Patriotic citizens, like our tax protesting forefathers, opposing federal income taxes should be supported not branded as criminals. He also comments on: how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operates like the American Gestapo, how divorce lawyers practice disorganized crime, how the American Bar Association persecutes laypersons for the “unauthorized practice of law,” what the role of legal assistants in a law office should be, the difference between criminal and civil cases, judicial and election reform, the American jury system, the insurance con game, and the banking scam. He suggests that Americans should campaign for stronger privacy protections, study and simplify the law, and break up legal monopolies. He makes several references to the Citizen as the sovereign. Coming from an attorney this is music to our ears. Another excellent and well-known lawyer/attorney is Gerry Spence, noted trial lawyer. He has never lost a criminal trial and his most notable cases include Karen Silkwood and Randy Weaver, number in the hundreds. Here’s an excerpt from his recent book. The Laws of Arguing 1. Everyone is capable of making the winning argument. 2. Winning is getting what you want, which also means helping “others” get what they want. 3.

Would you rather put your destiny in the hands of a jury of your peers, or a corrupt, corporate government? We the People must organize and convene “constitutional Common law courts” in every county of every sovereign “state” republic as the foundation for the restoration of our sovereignty. Therein We the People can reinstate remedy and recourse under Article III of the Constitution, and reclaim our judicial power independent of corporate government. Our sovereign rights have been trampled. Judges and attorneys are foreigners having accepted Titles of Nobility and special compensations, our petitions have been ignored, the writ of Habeas Corpus and the Constitution suspended through perpetual states of national emergency under the War Powers Acts. We the People have been charged with victimless crimes, imprisoned after conviction with no indictment by a grand jury, and denied the rights to a fully-informed jury trial that judges both the facts and the law. We are compelled into contracts, forced by law to obtain insurance, licenses, and converted into criminals for exercising our unalienable and constitutionally protected rights. The constitutional Common law courts duly organized as lawful process are remedy and recourse against de facto government. Constitutional Common law courts have their own seal, notaries, bailiff, marshals and a Bureau of Records & Conveyances. Petitions are voluntarily brought before the Common law court, then writs and judgments issued to the inferior State and federal Article 1 courts. Constitutional Common law courts are courts of original jurisdiction and the highest courts in the land. You can bring your entire case before the Common law court if you’ve been damaged or a crime committed against you. 31 Forty-two states are presently reconstituting Common law courts at the county and/or state level. Twenty-six were represented in Oklahoma recently at a conference (ironically it occurred simultaneously with a BATF convention next door in the same facility). There is one state-level supreme Court presently convening in Oklahoma and the Tenth & Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal have tacitly recognized several of these Article III courts by remanding cases back to them. The first business of the Article III supreme Court of Oklahoma was to reinstate the organic Constitution for the united states of America including the original 13 th Amendment as ratified in 1819. Since the Article I, legislative tribunals created by the U.S. Congress have not provided remedies or redress under the Common law, the American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen has the unalienable right to create remedy and provide for the redress of grievances. This is the reason for these Common law courts being re- consummated. A republican form of government is built from the bottom-up. Twelve to twenty-four sovereign individuals can consummate a Common law court, appoint a jury, judges, constable, bailiff, clerk, notary, and issue writs and render judgment on cases voluntarily presented before it. Initially, these courts have been issuing “Quiet Title” to property and asseverating status by repatriating American Nationals OR sovereign “state” Citizens. This is supplemental to a formal declaration by affidavit with constructive legal notice given to the government of your asseveration of status. Some of the writs of these courts are being enforced through the lien process and some of the unorganized militias have voluntarily aligned themselves with these constitutional Common law courts. The media has, as expected, framed up Americans engaged in lawful process as “paper terrorists.” The Article III, Common law courts must move quickly in conjunction with their respective provisional governments and Constitutional Conventions to adopt amendments to their rules and procedures that permit the full participation of women and minorities so as to open sovereignty to all responsible Americans of legal age (21). All men and women are indeed created equal and must all enjoy full, unalienable rights. There must never again be a second class Citizenship in the united states of America, although some qualifications and responsibilities will apply. Whether black or white, male or female, a property owner or not, or an Indian, American Citizenship must be open to all willing to claim it. The choice is then ours where our allegiance will stand. “Common law Courts are established under the rules of the Common law and can either be ‘Courts of Record’ or ‘Courts not of Record.’ A Court of Record is a Superior Court that has the ability, through a Common law jury to hold in contempt, to judge, and the judgments are of such supreme eminence their truth cannot be held in question... A Court of Record is established by Constitution or legislation and can be a Superior Court, Court of Common Pleas, a Court of Chancery, an Equity or Admiralty Court. —Jerry Henson 32 Many of the Common law courts have re-consummated their rules and procedures based on the old territorial rules which is a good starting point for laying the foundation and restoring the organic law. - 204 -"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve Constitutional Common Law Courts But some of these old rules leave us exposed to the accusation of being white supremacist, racist or sexist for not enjoining participation by other than white, Christian males. This is a matter of strategic importance. Either we're all going to be sovereigns, or we're all going to be slaves in the next millennium. The time is now! 33 Common law Supreme Court Judgments 1.

Without the six elements of a valid contract, none exists.” —PL#95-147, 91 Stat. 1227 (Oct. 28, 1977) Our government has reverted to the old ruler’s law with the nobles and lords reigning over its loyal subjects. Judges, Attorneys, Senators, Congressmen and Presidents have all accepted special “Titles of Nobility,” and powerful positions in the privileged ruling class of America. The legal fraternity took over the reigns of government five generations ago, and has maintained a monopoly over all three branches of government ever since. The original 13 th Amendment is a profound challenge to the de facto government and legal fraternity that presently rules the federal United States, and all its political subdivisions. The supreme Court had declared the Agricultural Adjustment Act and National Industrial Recovery Act, which were major components of Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation, unconstitutional in 1935-1936. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, not to be derailed by the supreme Court, under the authority of his declared state of national emergency (federal bankruptcy is a national emergency), then demanded a reorganization of the entire federal judiciary, directly challenging the independence of the judicial branch of government as guaranteed by the Constitution. This precipitated a change in our American system of law from “public (Common) law” to “public (international bankers) policy,” or “private (corporate) commercial law.” The legislative bodies in America are now the “sovereigns” over the courts, executive officers, and it’s so-called U.S. citizens. Their function is solely to pass “public policy” statutes in the interest of the nation’s principals/creditors, wherein the civil statutes contain criminal penalties under an admiralty jurisdiction. 37 The new and improved supreme Court after FDR, ruled that all federal cases will be judged under “Negotiable Instruments Law” in Erie Railroad vs. Thompkins (1938). After this case, Common law was officially blended with the procedures of Equity. New federal Rules of Civil Procedure took effect along with the Social Security Act (1938). In the next ten years, the Courts of Common Pleas began to disappear, and virtually every American became a U.S. citizen by enrolling in the Social Security system. The sovereignty of the states and its respective “state” Citizens was almost completely destroyed by this federal, corporate, socialist coup d’ etat. 1 Color of Law The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are still the supreme law of the land. Although many people pay lip service to the state and federal constitutions, many more Americans have never read it, and government officials have pledged superficial allegiance while routinely violating its principles and intent. 42 U.S.C. §1983. Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit, in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia. All acts of the state legislatures and the U.S. Congress must be consistent with and derived from the Constitution for the united states of America. A “colorable” law or statute appears to be a law, acts like a law, but ultimately does not have the authority of law. Many statutes, administrative laws, and rules and regulations present the appearance of a legal right, but are without lawful substance. It is through “colorable” statutes and administrative law that corrupt shadow governments are created. Colorable law is that which is in appearance only, and not reality, what it purports to be, hence counterfeit, feigned, having the appearance of truth.” “Colorable law,” commercial law, and political law are synonymous terms. These laws are nothing more than mere “bylaws” of the corporation that regulates the business or commerce of the government agency, international or domestic corporation. They are listed variously as political code, commercial code, statutes, public policy, and as such, are all under “color of law.” The federal United States is a foreign corporation. The U.S. Congress writes bylaws their members (i.e., U.S. citizens) must obey. The real, substantive laws of a state, which are judicially enforceable, although they may appear under the listing of statutes as civil code, penal code or variations thereof, may generally be thought of as being contained within the “organic law” or codified “Common law.” Acts performed under “color of law” by any federal, state or municipal government, or its employees, may include “illegal” acts done by government officials, bureaucrats, employees, etc. not only within, but also without and beyond the limits of their lawful authority. These acts are “illegal.” So when an official steps outside the bounds of their lawful authority, they become personally liable for the offense, as would any private citizen. “ The appearance or ‘semblence, without the substance, of legal right... misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because wrongdoer is clothed with authority of state, is action taken ‘under color of state law.’” —42 U.S.C. § 1983 - 209 -"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Any government official, employee or agent of the corporate government—police officer, county sheriff, judge, magistrate, attorney, congressman, senator, bureaucrat, IRS agent, federal agent, employer, including the President of the United States, who conspires to deprive a sovereign “state” Citizen of any right or privilege secured by their respective state constitutions, Constitution and Bill of Rights, or acts improperly under the color of law, is subject to criminal prosecution in both their individual and official capacity. The sovereign “state” Citizen has powerful, lawful tools to protect one’s unalienable rights, and make all government accountable to the Constitution, and the law of the land. A thorough understanding of the law and how the legal system actually works is required to defend one’s rights against the intrusions of government. “ Public officials are not immune from suit when they transcend their lawful authority by invading constitutional rights.” —American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO vs. Woodward, 406 F2d 137 t. 18 U.S.C. §241.

We the People also live in a commercial culture, dominated by commercial agreements and contracts whereby our freedoms, rights and sovereign, “state” Citizenship has been “contracted” away. Every time you sign your name on a form, you are entering a commercial agreement that can bind you to perform as specified. Some of these contracts may be harmless (e.g. renting a video), yet others may bind us in ways we do not fully comprehend (e.g., long distance phone companies bind you to the law of the District of Columbia). These are called “adhesion contracts.” Contracts must be voluntary in nature and fully disclosed to be enforceable. The parties must also be able to perform. 2 > ADHESION CONTRACT— a contract so heavily restrictive of one party (e.g., U.S. citizen) while nonrestrictive of the other (e.g., the government corporation) that doubts arise as to the voluntary nature of the contract; take it or leave it basis; weaker party has no realistic choice as to its terms. Did you realize that when you completed and signed the “Form 1040” tax return, you “volunteered” into the jurisdic - tion of the federal United States government, admitted be - ing a corporate “person” and federal government employee, agreed to abide by all the rules and regulations of the Inter - nal Revenue Code (IRC), and therefore became subject to the State and federal income tax? Did you know that “Form W-4” is a Gift & Estate Tax Form for federal government employees, not for American “state” Citizens? 3 Were you ever told by anyone in the government that when you applied for a Social Security Number (SSN) you became a U.S. citizen and waived your unalienable rights as a sovereign, “state” Citizen, became a federal govern-ment “employee” by enrolling in a federal government retirement and insurance benefits program, transferred your Power of Attorney to the Social Security Administra-tion, and was made liable for the federal debt? 4 Did anyone ever fully or honestly disclose the intent of the State Motor Vehicle Codes when you applied for and received your driver’s license? Were you aware that the driver’s license and vehicle registration laws are occupation taxes for commercial drivers (e.g., truck drivers, taxi and chauffeurs), and that sovereign, “state” Citizens needn’t apply providing you “own” your own “place-travel device?” The driver’s license and vehicle registration are voluntary contracts to become subject to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) codes, get licensed, get insurance, register your vehicle and pay the fees (which are occupation taxes). You also unknowingly agreed to transfer the lawful title (i.e., MSO) of your vehicle to the State when it was purchased from the original dealer. 5 - 210 -"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Adhesion Contracts At a traffic stop, when a police officer asks for your “driver’s license,” “vehicle registration,” and “proof of financial responsibility,” they’re asking for you to provide evidence to indicate that: 1. you’ve entered into a contract with the State; 2. you’re within their jurisdiction. If you are a “resident” of the State, then you’re required to have a State-issued driver’s license. If you’re operating a “motor vehicle,” then registration, plates and insurance are required. If you present any of this evidence, then the presumption stands that you are subject to the Motor Vehicle Code. You have just indicted yourself, and the police officer is witness to it. If you have violated one of the Motor Vehicle codes, he/she has the authority to issue a “citation” for a breech of contract or infraction. Likewise in theory, as a sovereign “state” Citizen, you wouldn’t admit to being a “resident” of any of the fifty federal States. Not A “Resident” Of Any Of The Fifty States If you have no driver’s license, vehicle registration or proof of financial responsibility relative to their jurisdiction, and no other presumptive evidence that you’ve committed a crime in force, then the police officer has no lawful option under the Common law, except to release you. Usually though, the police officer doesn’t know or make this distinction and you’ll be getting a hassle. Be prepared to have your papers in order for a traffic stop. 6 To have a valid contract there must be: 1. a valid offer and acceptance of valuable consideration; 2. two or more parties involved; 3. parties who are of legal age and competent understanding; 4. a termination date; 5. full disclosure; and 6. the contract must be voluntary in nature. “ Adhesion contracts do not bind the citizen to a commercial contract. Without the six elements of a valid contract, none exists.” —PL#95-147, 91 Stat. 1227 (Oct. 28, 1977) U.S. citizens are bound by many adhesion contracts including voter’s registration, marriage and business licenses, incorporation papers, selective service registration, postal addresses, bank accounts and credit cards, tax returns, social security numbers, drivers and vehicle licenses; and subject to tens of thousands of statutes. Here are a few examples of the hidden nature of these contracts and how they impact your freedoms and life. 7 CO NTRACTS • VOTER’S REGISTRATION is an unrevealed, private “contract” obligating the “voter” or “resident” to pay municipal, county and State bonds via the property tax (i.e., trustee fees) and a State income tax; voters have also unknowingly given their Power of Attorney to the State. Electors are not bound to a contract or a political party. Electors are sovereign “state” Citizen’s with allodial property in any state. • A MARRIAGE LICENSE is an unrevealed, private “contract” with the State who is a legal third party to your marriage wherein they have control over the product (i.e., children) or the disbursement of community property (via a divorce). The State gets the power to take away your children if they deem it necessary for any reason. Do you want the government in your bed telling you how to raise your children? The doctrine of parens patria gives the State supremacy over parental rights. • BUSINESS LICENSES negate your Common law “right to work” in the profession and skill of your choice or talent. Do you need permission from the government to go to the bathroom too? Free yourself from “permission” to contract when you have the unalienable “right to contract.” • INCORPORATION for your for-profit or non-profit business with limited liability for the payment of debt is a BENEFIT from the government which costs the private individual 100% ownership and control over the corporation. Corporations are creations of and chartered by the State. When you are incorporating, you’re now working for a government - protected enterprise, and subject to all the rules and regulations thereof. When the churches incorporated recently they lost not only their sovereignty and independence, but their 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion as well. Don’t make the same mistake. Consider other legal structures that preserve Common law rights. • NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS are owned and controlled lock, stock and barrel by the IRS and it’s foreign principals/creditors. If you’re working in the non-profit sector, the Federal Reserve and its principals/creditors are your bosses. They don’t give grants and funding away without receiving control over the agendas of these organizations, some of which are well meaning. • SELECTIVE SERVICE registration is for U.S. citizens only. If you place your signature on that private contract, you are bound, body and soul to it. The government corporation owns you completely. They decide whether or not your teeth need pulling, not you. You have no choice once in military service. The draft is voluntary servitude. • POSTAL ADDRESSES utilizing zip codes and two- digit abbreviations for the State are private contracts for federal government employees. Having or using a “zip code” supports the presumption that you are indeed a federal “employee” subject to the income tax and the Form 1040. Domestic mail is “within” the federal United States. Non-domestic is “without” the federal United States, between the sovereign “state” Citizens and the state (intrastate). Unknowingly, when you opened a checking account, or re - ceived a credit card, and signed your “name” on the bank signature card, you entered a contract with a bank, who is - 211 -"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook also under contract with the Federal Reserve System, who has in turn contracted with the IRS to collect taxes. This chain of contracts gives authorization to the IRS to access information about your accounts, lien your assets, snoop into your records, garnish your wages, and to subject you to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). By not comprehending the power of contracts, you have unwittingly waived many of your rights by simply signing your bank signature card. We the People fall into this trap many times, creating a lengthy paper trail of “presumptive evidence” through these adhesion contracts, which are used to establish jurisdiction and establish facts that can and will be used against us in a court of Equity/Admiralty. > PRESUMPTION— an inference in favor of a particular fact; a rule of law by which finding of a basic fact givers rise to existence of presumed fact, until presumption is rebutted. 8 There are many other adhesion contracts besides the ones discussed above. An adhesion contract is one in which the state legislature or the Congress of the federal United States government was acting as your agent (or legal representative) to bind you to their contract. Four types of adhesion contracts have attached themselves unknowingly and often unwillingly: a) interest b) tax c) statutes d) treaties As an American, sovereign “state” Citizen the Constitution offers no protection once you’ve volunteered into a contract, having waived your rights in exchange for any government privileges or benefits. A U.S. citizen is “presumed” bound to these adhesion contracts. They are as valid as if you signed each one yourself. Only a sovereign “state” Citizen is not “presumed” bound to these adhesion contracts. 9 Adhesion contracts entered unknowingly, unwillingly or unintentionally can be nullified by declaration in the form of an “Affidavit.” A U.S. citizen may “rescind or revoke” any adhesion contracts they’ve entered into unknowingly and unwillingly, to clear their “name” of all legal disabilities and become a sui juris freeman/woman. A U.S. citizen may also argue that the signature on the contract never existed because there was not full disclosure. You can repudiate all signatures on past IRS and SSA Forms by a general “Affidavit” along with a “Constructive Legal Notice” sent to all pertinent government corporations and agencies. This will establish a paper trail of evidence to support your declaration and claim of sovereign “state” Citizenship and/or sui juris freeman/woman, and refute any presumptions that exist. You can then reclaim your sovereign Citizenship within the state, under the state and federal constitutions, or maintain your freeman/woman status. Be prepared to defend those rights. > AFFIDAVIT— a written or printed declaration or statement of facts, made voluntarily, and confirmed by the oath or affirmation of the party making it, taken before an officer having authority to administer such oath. 10 > RESCIND— to abrogate, annul, avoid or cancel a contract; nullifying a contract by the act of a party. 11 > REVOKE— to recall authority or power previously conferred; to annul an act by calling or taking it back. Only you can determine your Citizenship. The government may presume to know who you are, but they cannot tell you who you are. To be a sovereign “state” Citizen, you must eliminate all presumptions that you’ve entered into contracts that bind your performance to them. State courts were federalized in 1982 under Equity/Admiral - ty/Maritime jurisdiction, thus have no general jurisdiction (unless there are un-rebutted, international adhesion con - tracts still in force) over a sovereign “state” Citizen. Sovereign “state” Citizens must be tried in a federal court under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. 12 You have the right to see any and all contracts. You have the right to get information the government may have about you through Freedom of Information & Privacy Act (FOIA & PI) requests. You have the right of discovery in a court proceeding. All contracts must be entered into knowingly, willingly and voluntarily to be enforceable in any jurisdiction. Be careful when signing your “name” and entering into contracts unseen. Your “name” is your property, just like your fingerprint. Your “name” is also your “Power of Attorney,” providing you haven’t given it to someone else to legally act on your behalf. Henceforth, whenever signing your name, read the fine print, ask for the hidden contracts, and always add the following citation from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) under your “signature.” For example: 13 “ I, Johnny Liberty, hereby reserve my right not to be compelled to perform under any contract or commercial agreement that I did not enter knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally. And furthermore, I do not accept the liability of the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or commercial agreement.” 22 —Johnny Liberty, Special Appearance Without Prejudice, UCC 1-207 All Rights Reserved. The effect is an explicit “Reservation of All Your Unalienable Rights”—which will nullify your authorization and legal “name” if there are any hidden or unseen contracts. Your right to contract is unlimited for both sovereign “state” Citizens and U.S. citizens. But each distinct status is determined under distinct jurisdictions of law either “without” or “within” the federal United States. Notice these distinctions and watch out for jurisdictional traps inherent in perjury statements (e.g., driver’s licenses, tax forms). - 212 -"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Adhesion Contracts Perjury Jurat Whenever under any law of the United States or under any rule, regulation, order, or requirement made pursuant to law, any matter is required or permitted to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the sworn declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same, ...such matter may, with like force and effect, be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the unsworn declaration, certificate, verification, or statement, in writing of such person which subscribed by him/her, as true under penalty of perjury, and dated, in substantially the following form: 28 U.S.C. 1746, Unsworn Declaration under Penalty of Perjury. 1.

There is a road back to freedom, but it is still a lonely, solitary one for the courageous and the brave freedom fighters willing to confront the injustice, ignorance and fear rampant in our commercial culture today. Be aware how significantly adhesion contracts have shaped this New World Order. Be aware how the attorney’s and legislators who write and litigate these contracts, and the police officers and courts who enforce them have taken our country, the united states of America, and reduced it to an idea whose time may come again. Our beloved constitutional republic must be restored and quite “another world order” brought into view for the 21st Century. Revoke all adhesion contracts with the government and reclaim your sovereign state Citizenship. It’s our last chance to rediscover America for all the people. “ The right of the Citizen to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or avocation, and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary and essential.” —Justice Peckham, Allgeyer vs. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578 at 589 (1897) Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is “colorable law.” It is not law, but gives the appearance of law, and it is upheld by the courts as law. This “colorable” law is known only to judges and licensed attorneys, although it was designed to protect the common people from unscrupulous merchants and bankers. The UCC governs U.S. citizens and negotiable instruments, contracts in either Equity or Admiralty / Maritime. Many of the original elements of our judicial system, as authorized by Article III of the Constitution, are now dangerously missing. Instead of a jury of our peers, cases are tried by a jury of strangers who are instructed not to judge the law, but just the facts. To be on a jury in a court today, an individual must be a “colorable” person, or a 14th Amendment U.S. citizen. When you demand your constitutional rights in a court under this “colorable law,” you’ll get all the rights you deserve—the rights of the business world, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). 14 We the People make a huge, strategic mistake expecting to get a fair trial and due process based on American law and our Bill of Rights, assuming that our common sense understanding of the Common law is available to us. “Many times we are not allowed to face our accuser, [who is] often a legal fiction in the form of some branch of corporate government [or Foreign Principal / Creditor]. In these cases, we must prove our innocence while the prosecution sits back smugly in complicity with the Judge, as only they are aware that there is now a predetermined presumption of guilt built right into these new laws.” 15 “Recent statutes had been passed which allow the government to seize and sell immediately the real and personal property and private papers of ‘accused’ drug dealers before the cases even go to trial...Even more shocking is that now these laws are being used in other cases where the government feels the need to inflict immediate and disabling hardship on the defendant in order to keep him from presenting a viable defense. Fortunately, these statutes have just been declared unconstitutional by the supreme Court.” 52 “ There is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers... No legislative act... contrary to the Constitution could be valid.” —Alexander Hamilton 17 There are no longer any genuine Article III courts except those being formed by dedicated patriots throughout the usA. The Judges no longer have the powers and immunities of Article III judges, but have only ministerial powers in legislative tribunals as per Article 1 or the territorial courts of Article IV of the Constitution. Article III courts were created by the Constitution and are the legitimate courts of the land based on substance and law. The laws passed, and the courts created under the exclusive legislative authority of Article 1 are not required to be consistent with the Bill of Rights or the Common law. America is no longer a nation of laws, but of petty tyrants operating as bureaucratic tribunals (e.g. construction contractors board, building and planning departments, licensing agencies). A “statutory” jurisdiction has been in effect created without constitutional authority. - 213 -"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook “ To constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme Court” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:9] “ To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District [of Columbia]... become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which Same shall be” —Constitution for the usA [1:8:17] Justice and the Common law are not available unless you know how to invoke them. There’s a bit of magic, a lot of study and preparation, and a waving of the magic wand of words and citations. As “colorable” law, the UCC is based on negotiable instruments, a medium of exchange not based on real substance—paper money, checks, credit, FRNs, or other securities. The Common law is based on substance (gold and silver), while the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is based on bankruptcy (FRN’s). The Negotiable Instruments Act (1938) has in effect bound all corporate entities of government together along with their franchisees (i.e., U.S. citizens), in a vast system of commercial agreements. “Everyone in this system is a statutory Law Merchant dealing in negotiable paper under limited liability for payment of debts.” This is what has drastically altered our court system from one under the Common law to a legislative, administrative tribunal system of commercial, “colorable” law based on negotiable paper. This is how U.S. citizens are held to the letter of every statute of federal, State, County and Municipal government, unless they exercise the remedy provided within the UCC 18 All contracts since the New Deal and the federal bankruptcy of 1933 have been “colorable” contracts. Ever since America went off the gold standard in 1935 and declared FRNs as “fiat” currency or legal tender, we’ve been using the “colorable” consideration of FRNs instead of gold to negotiate these “colorable” contracts. The term “colorable” was changed to “commercial” and an (unconstitutional) “statutory” jurisdiction was created in the courts to enforce these “colorable contracts.” This statutory jurisdiction is legislative rather than judicial in nature. Thus the Equity/Admiralty courts were merged with the Common law courts to enforce these commercial agreements. This is obviously unconstitutional as it dissolved the independent judiciary and created a jurisdiction not authorized by the Constitution. There is very little in our commercial culture that is not either government owned, controlled or subsidized. We have been forced into accepting the “benefit” of discharging our debts with legal tender (FRNs), rather than paying them with money of real value (gold or silver). Without a legitimate payment of debts and contracts based on gold or silver, a system of “colorable” law was introduced that brings every American into a commercial contract with the corporate government monopoly (State Socialism). Although our unalienable rights cannot be taken from us, we may contract them away at will. All this has been accomplished by carefully orchestrated plans and practices of the Federal Reserve Bank, and through the quiet introduction and implementation of the Uniform Commercial Code in all 48 corporate States and U.S. possessions. Texas was the last State to adopt the UCC in 1967. \"The entire taxing and monetary systems are, hereby, placed under the U.C.C.\" —The Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 19 Under the UCC, We the People are obligated, as in any commercial agreement, to the terms and conditions of the contract. But we are unaware of the terms of this contract, which are scattered and hidden in millions of pages of regulations, statutes, codes and ordinances at the federal, State and local levels. Most of us are even unaware that such an agreement exists. The prevailing benefit being given to the American people is the privilege of discharging debt with limited liability instead of actually paying debt with lawful money. You cannot be sued for not paying your debts. If you exercise the benefits of a contract, it is presumed that you intend to meet the obligations associated with those benefits. If you can get everybody to exercise a benefit, then you’ve got people obligated, thus under federal jurisdiction. Every system of civilized law must have “remedy” and “recourse.” > REMEDY— a way to get out from under that law; remedy means rights with or without tribunal (UCC 1-201.34); remedies are to be liberally administered (UCC 1106.1). > RECOURSE— if you have been damaged by the law, you can recover your loss. The Social Security Number is the foundation instrument (contract) upon which the courts presume to have standing to send you a presentment (i.e., citation, ticket, fine, penalty, invoice). When you are forced to use a “benefit” or “privilege” of the government (e.g. postal service, highways, public utilities, welfare, city services, limited liability, FRNs, etc. ad infinitum), you must first reserve your rights under the Common law not to be bound by any contract or commercial agreement that you did not enter knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally (see UCC 1-207). For U.S. citizens, this is a remedy against the tyranny inherent in the American courtroom today. Once the court has acknowledged your reservation of rights and the Common law, you must design a strategy for your own affirmative defense. 20 > AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE— one that serves as a basis for proving some new fact, whereby a defendant offers new - 214 -"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) evidence to avoid judgment against him/her; derived from the Common law “demurrer.” There is remedy and recourse to be found in this “colorable law.” There are specific sections in the thousands of pages of the UCC that can be used to assert our Common law rights. More in-depth study is required to develop a personal strategy toward using these remedies in an actual court situation. Also find references to these remedies and recourses in the state law as well (e.g., UCC 1-207 = ORS 71.2070). “ Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no Constitution, no Law, no Court can save it... Where do you stand Citizen?” —Judge Learned Hand (1961) UCC 1-207 “The making of a valid reservation of rights preserves whatever rights the person then possesses and prevents the loss of such right by application of concepts of waiver or estoppel ... a reservation of rights can only reserve a right that is existing...the failure to make a reservation thereof causes a loss of the right and bars its assertion at a later date.” 21 > WAIVER— an intentional and voluntary surrender of some right. > ESTOPPEL— a restraint arises where a person has done some act that the policy of law will not permit him to deny, or will not permit a certain argument because it would lead to an unjust result. > WITHOUT PREJUDICE— implies that no special privileges, benefits or Titles of Nobility exist. “ Any expression indicating an intention to preserve rights is sufficient, such as without prejudice, under reservation, or with reservation of all our rights.” —Anderson on the UCC 23 UCC 1-103.6 “The code is complimentary to the Common law, which re - mains in force, except where displaced by the code.

Patriot Attorney Dismisses the UCC There are a few “patriot” attorneys or “people’s lawyers” that I have the utmost of respect for. Many others are oppor - tunists seeing a lucrative market in the screw-ups Americans find themselves in when they misapply or misunderstand various “silver bullet” approaches to law and the courts. In American, you get as much law as you can afford. I resent the attitude of attorneys and many lawyers that they know the “law.” It’s as arrogant as many doctors with regards to “healing.” It has been my experience that very few know anything about the “law,” but practice “lies” and deceit instead. Most of them know they’re robbing the people of their rights and country, yet do nothing about it. I would be surprised, literally shocked, if there were 100 attorneys in the entire country who really know the “law of the land.” The argument over the UCC and its applicability is a case in point. From Attorney Mark Osterman’s point of view, the UCC is the single best piece of legislation passed in a hundred years. The UCC was not designed to handle traffic issues and putting “Without prejudice, all rights reserved U.C.C. 1207” accomplishes absolutely nothing from a legal standpoint. According to Mr. Osterman, the UCC only applies to the sale of goods, bank drafts, checks and negotiable instruments. A ticket for no driver’s license does not apply to any of these transactions. Regarding rejecting a bench warrant under UCC 3-501, Section 3 deals with “commercial paper.” A bench warrant is not commercial paper. Judges have also advised us that the UCC has no bearing in traffic cases. Mr. Osterman also suggests that the UCC deals with FRN’s in your pocket and the checking accounts we use. This is true. Using the UCC in traffic court may result in your visit to the local psychiatric ward with an order from the court, because its application makes no sense in traffic, criminal or domestic-family law. If your intent is to protest, make the protest known and seek protection under the First Amendment, not the UCC. It’s true that Americans often misapply the UCC, but to say it never works just isn’t true. Does it work all the time? Certainly not! Are there people in jail who used the UCC? Certainly. In a bankrupt federal United States, in courts under emergency powers, all paperwork and due process is flawed, and every legal action is commercial in nature. The traffic citation is an invoice presented for payment. An invoice or “true bill” is commercial paper. Whether the UCC applies to traffic cases may not be the ultimate issue at hand. Considering that every encounter with the police and judges is a crapshoot, and there is no consistency or uniformity in the justice system, I conclude that we must craft any and every remedy possible to restore our rights in a constitutional republic. Attorneys and lawyers are equally unreliable in criminal defense cases and you have to pay an exorbitant fee when found guilty anyway. 70% of folks in Texas can't afford to hire a lawyer.

So what's it gonna be? Attorneys, judges and the UCC or American Citizens knowledgeable about the law and the Constitution. 26 Right Way L.A.W. Recommends Refusal for Cause You probably never thought of traffic tickets in terms of contracts to purchase certain goods and services. But according to Right Way L.A.W. reported in Anti-Shyster, they are part of a commercial contract. If you don't agree with the contract, it is absolutely essential to object to traffic citations in a timely fashion (within 10 days) using a “Refusal for Cause (or Fraud).” When a law enforcement officer writes a ticket (s)he is actually issuing a commercial instrument called a “citation,” and the recipient of said “ticket” automatically becomes party to a commercial contract. The commercial instrument is actually a “confirmatory writing,” an instrument defined in UCC 2-201 that defines a “product being purchased,” which in this case is, fines and court costs. Right Way L.A.W. explains that anyone using International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt credit (Federal Reserve Notes) as a medium of exchange, is subject to the Uniform Commercial Code. UCC 2-201 is called the “Statute of Frauds.” It deals with the legality of contracts and says contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more are not enforceable unless there is some “writing” indicating that a contract for goods has been signed between the parties. UCC 2-201, Subparend (2) says that if one of the parties objects to the terms of the confirmatory writing, their objection must be registered within 10 days after receipt or the contract stands. Don't wait for your court date to register an objection. It'll be too late under the UCC. At this point, you may think that refusal to sign the citation would prevent entering into a contract. Not so! If you sign the citation, the action falls under UCC 2-201. If you don't sign, it still falls under UCC 2-201 because the 10 day period to object to the “writing” automatically goes into effect, according to commercial law. It is a maxim of law that law applies in spite of ignorance of it. Therefore, it is presumed that everyone who fails to object during the 10 day period agrees to all the terms of the contract. You're guilty by default. I assert, it's important to respond to every citation, notice to appear or other paper action of the government, so as to not support their presumptions and agree to the terms of their contracts by acquiescence and neglect. 27 “ Governments descend to the level of a mere private corporation, and take on the characteristics of a mere private citizen... where private corporate commercial paper (FRN’s) and securities (checks) are concerned... for purposes of suit, such corporations and individuals are regarded as entities entirely separate from government.” —Clearfield Trust vs. U.S., 318 U.S. 363-371 Attorneys or Title 42 Lawyers Regard for Attorneys in our society doesn’t run very high. Why do we hold Attorneys in such contempt? I will assert that Attorneys are the primary agents responsible for the demise of the united states of America and the selling out of the American people. Attorneys are “officers of the court.” According to Corpus Juris Secundum, their first duty is to the court and to uphold the statutes, not to their client. All this is contrary to ethics, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Here’s an example of how most people feel about attorneys. “GOOD NEWS: A bus load of attorneys went over the cliff and died. BAD NEWS: There were 3 empty seats.” Most attorneys & judges, and the legal fraternity in general, are not well educated in constitutional, treaty, Canon law, Common law, trust law, diversity of citizenship, the history of the united states of America, or how the economic system actually works and shapes the practice of commercial law. Except for their knowledge of courtroom procedure in the commercial courts of specific jurisdiction and the statutory law, they are at least as knowledgeable about sovereignty, Citizenship and your rights as you were before you read this book. Many attorneys don’t even understand the system to which they are licensed. Many haven’t looked at the Consti - tution since reading it once in law school. 29 If an attorney lacks the ability to practice law in multiple jurisdictions, including offshore, and if an attorney is not experienced in constitutional law and committed to the highest law of the land, it is doubtful whether he/she will understand or represent your guaranteed human, civil and sovereign rights. In other words, unless they get an education like the one you’re getting, they won’t be much assistance to you. And even then, they could be a serious and expensive liability. 30 Fifty percent of the elected government officials since the Civil War have been lawyers. Lawyers are pivotal people, not only in government but in the transnational corporations. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was formed in 1926 to counter the repression of the progressive movements by big-business. The National Lawyers Guild was an alternative to the big- business American Bar Association (ABA) and the civil liberties-focused ACLU. The NAACP Defense and Education Fund was key to the passing of “civil rights” legislation in the ’60s. Presently our legal system is as bankrupt as the economy. “The legal system...is collapsing and can no longer be saved in its current form. There is anarchy in the courts, inconsistency and tyranny.” 31 Administrative tribunals have become a circus where attorneys intimidate and twist words (root of “attorney” is attornment —to twist), where fairness and justice are no longer served. “How much justice can you afford?” Many are - 217 -"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook akin to professional liars or actors who will do anything to win a case or get a role. Choices are made as to which laws will be enforced against which people. High bail is used as preventive detention. In political trials, the courts are openly partial to the prosecution. Despite the so-called presumption of innocence, the defendant is prima facie guilty, until proven otherwise. The legal system is no longer concerned with matters of right or wrong or justice, but is a high-stakes, speculative game of attorneys pressuring witnesses and creating enough confusion to lead a jury or a judge into a verdict that supports his/her client. Attorneys no longer practice law. Attorneys are often in the business of stealing your assets, your rights and Citizenship, and doing it within a system that permits it to occur. As officers of the court, Attorneys claim immunity for their actions, as do the judges, prosecutors and other elected officials. No Attorney dares to expose any misconduct in the courts, thus the entire justice system is prone to internal corruption that goes unreported and unabated. 32 Not everyone who completes law school goes on to become an attorney and a member of the State Bar Association. Lawyers who have made an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve as their “brothers keeper” (as consultants or counsel, not by representing them in court) are called “Title 42 Lawyers.” We the People have unknowingly revoked our “Power of Attorney” through various adhesion contracts with the government (e.g., social security, driver’s license). We the People have unknowingly declared ourselves to be incompetent “wards of the court” whenever we contract with an attorney to represent us. Quite literally, you have to be “crazy” to hire an attorney. > COUNSEL— those who give counsel in law; any counselor or advocate, or any number of counselors, barristers, or servants; as the plaintiff's or the defendant's counsel. > ADVOCATE— to call for, to plead for;...In English and American courts, advocates are the same as counsel, or counselors. > BARRISTER— a counselor, learned in the laws, qualified and admitted to plead at the bar, and to take upon him the defense of clients. > ATTORNEY— one who takes the turn or place of another...One who is appointed or admitted in the place of another, to manage his matters in law. The word formerly signified any person who did business for another; ...The word answers to the procurator, (proctor) of the civilians. The judge may try to trick you into accepting the court’s jurisdiction by demanding that you obtain an attorney or by appointing one for you. You do not have to have an attorney. You have the right to defend yourself (propria persona, pro per, pro se). You have the right to retain your own “Power of Attorney.” You can retain any counsel that you choose. “Counsel of choice” can be anybody—a friend, family member, or fellow patriot. You could also retain a “Title 42 Lawyer,” or an “Attorney in-fact,” as a standby to counsel you in court. This does not revoke your “Power of Attorney” the way retaining an Attorney does. The right to counsel of choice, guaranteed by the 6th Amendment, contains no licensing requirements. Attorneys Are Unregistered Foreign Agents There are presently no individuals properly licensed by the state to practice law who could lawfully prosecute, judge or defend either U.S. citizens or sovereign “state” Citizens. Attorneys and lawyers have not applied for or received a license to do business in the state, either as a foreign agent or agency, pursuant to the Bar Association Act of 1913. Pursuant to this act, all members of the American Bar Association are at - law, citizens of Washington D.C., thus foreign to the sovereign state republics. As such, they must register with the Secretary of State in any state in which they choose to do business as a foreign agent or agency. The “Certificate” issued by the State Bar is merely a certificate of membership in a private, fraternal organization, signed by the clerk of the supreme Court of the state. The clerk has no power to issue a license to do business. Bankers and lawyers with “Esquire” behind their names are agents of the monarchy, and have also accepted a Title of Nobility which is strictly forbidden by the Constitution. Bar Code of Ethics Apparently Lacking The venerable but never venal publication Anti-Shyster, has again offered a $10,000 challenge to the Texas State Bar Association, claiming the group cannot produce five licensed attorneys who are provably honorable human beings and proud members of the association. The Dallas-based magazine's challenge — resurrected for the 22 nd time in its latest edition — would allow the public to decide whether the lawyers made their case in an open debate against five challengers selected by the publication. “To win, all five attorneys must convince the public they are each honorable persons and proud to be Bar members. If the public votes against just one of the five attorneys on either issue, the Bar loses the debate and the wager,” the challenge states. “If that seems like a difficult condition, bear in mind that here are 54,000 members of the Texas Bar who are professionally trained to debate and argue issues in public forums.” Furthermore, “If you would like to double the bet, produce five judges to represent the bar... Frankly, I doubt the Bar can find five members who have guts enough to stand up in public and argue for their Honor. You lawyers are big 'n' bad in a court of law where no one watches but a judge and another attorney. Let's see what you can do in the Court of Public Opinion. Let's see what you can do in the open, without a judge to protect you or secrecy to conceal you.” The challenge concludes, “You are being subpoenaed... You will respond.

Such actions taken here today, adumbrate a future dark and replete with injustice and even more Court corruption. First, I watched completely amazed and disappointed as they passed a resolution to virtually stop all camera coverage or any form of electronic recording ability in court. Now, with an assured shadow over the courts, Judges can even more readily “change” the transcripts behind closed doors and thus change testimony, decisions, facts, even many more sublime records of the court. Essentially, the Judges of this State, in a clear move to protect “Judicial Discretion,” are turning out the lights, and locking the doors of the court room. This can only accomplish one thing — hurt the defendant, and assure the courts of more unrestrained injustice. Indeed, one Judge testifying made the absurd comment, “I can see no First Amendment right or protections in allowing any type of electronic recording in the courts.” With such clear, party-line stupidity and bias placed forward by ‘experts’ as this, We the Citizens of California are doomed. In a vote of 13 to 6 the measure passed to bar cameras from California court rooms! This is but one staggering feature of this Judicial tribunal that assembled today in Chico, California. Also under consideration by the Judicial elite are even more draconian measures to aid courts, Government and Judges, and to simply deny citizens their Constitutional rights. Things being proposed for passage are: 1. A two juror hung jury minimum, rather than a one juror hung jury system. 2. Massive increases to Court Budgets. 3. Actively suppressing the Fully Informed Jury initiatives. 4. Cutting Juries from 12 to 8 Jurors. 5. Not naming, but numbering the Jurors, so that they be “unidentified.” 6. Not allowing Jury trials for low level crimes and infractions. (e.g., Less than 1 gram marijuana = no jury trial.) We will join the illustrious ranks of Communist China, North Korea, South Africa and other oppressive regimes. This is a far cry from Abraham Lincoln’s attesting that he would “rather let 500 guilty people go rather than unjustly incarcerate 1 innocent person.” 35 Another Bad Lawyer Joke On their way to get married, a couple has a fatal car accident. The couple is sitting outside heavens gate waiting on St. Peter to do an intake. While waiting, they wonder if they could possibly get married in Heaven. St. Peter finally shows up and they ask him. St. Peter says, “I don’t know, this is the first time anyone has ever asked. Let me go find out.” and he leaves. The couple sits for a couple of months and they begin to wonder if they really should get married in Heaven, what with the eternal aspect of it all. “What if it doesn`t work out?” they wonder, “Are we stuck together forever?” St. Peter returns after yet another month, looking somewhat bedraggled. “Yes,” he informs the couple, “ You can get married in Heaven.” “Great,” says the couple, “but what if things don`t work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?” St. Peter, red-faced, slams his clipboard down onto the ground. “What`s wrong?” exclaim the frightened couple. “Come on!” St. Peter exclaims, “It took me three months to find either a priest or minister up here! Do you have any idea how long it's going to take for me to find a lawyer!?” - 219 -"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Notes and Sources COMMERCIAL LAW 1.

Citizens of a State, having yielded them in part to the sovereign, do not enjoy them to their full and absolute extent [except in a Republic]. But the whole body of the Nation, the State, so long as it has not voluntarily submitted to other men or other nations, remains absolutely free and independent.\" —Emer De Vattel, The Law of Nations or the Principles of Natural Law 1 Editor’s Note: The following is excerpted from the Sovereign Hawai’i(an)s Handbook by Johnny Liberty, thus the references to the Kingdom of Hawai’i as a distinct and independent nation. The same applies to the united states of America and other nations as well. The founding documents of the united states of America and the Kingdom of Hawai'i hail a more than similar and equal heritage, reflecting among other things, the original source of divine wisdom, the very source of true sovereignty. Both nations were founded on spiritual principles and the maxims of Common law. With regards to sovereignty and the principles of self-government, power does not come from the top-down, but from the bottom-up. Most people still believe that the government gives us our civil \"rights\" and has the power to control our actions. That is so only in \"democratic\" or “socialist” forms of government. In a \"republican\" form of government, power rises up from the heart, the soul and the political will of the individual and is based on the unalienable \"rights\" of We the People. To demonstrate how the principles of self-government work in a republican form of government based on individual sovereignty, such as the united states of America, I'll provide the following illustration. Twelve to twenty-four sovereign individuals can gather and organize a jural society, a constitutional Common law court, a grand jury, or a township. Each of these sovereign individuals retains their full judicial power and has not contracted any of their unalienable rights to any government or corporation. Each of these sovereign individuals are spiritually, emotionally, legally, politically and economically sovereign. They have no liens or encumbrances upon their name or property. These are the basic buildings blocks of self-government and a republican form of government. Twelve to twenty-four sovereign individuals gather and form a jural society, then a township, then the townships form counties which in turn form sovereign states which in turn form Unions of sovereign states (e.g., Articles of Confederation, Constitution for the united states of America). From this sovereign process , there and only there does the federal United states government or corporations come into existence. The Constitution for the united states of America rests on the organic law of the individual sovereign governed under the private international law of the Law of Nations. It cannot exist any other way except through usurpation and fraud. Both the American and the Hawai'i(an) systems of constitutional government were based on the inherent sovereignty of the individual and were established under the Law of Nations. \"In pursuance of the Law of Nations, and recognition set forth in Public Law 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510, at page 1513, and in pursuance of the recognized impaired Constitution for the Kingdom of Hawai'i, all authorities are derived from the same said sources as foundation for proceeding to reinstate the Nation.\" —John B. Nelson 2 Both the Constitution for the united states of America and the Constitution for the Kingdom of Hawai'i consummated by Kamehameha III were recognized and created under the Law of Nations.“ The essential nature of the Law of Nations is well established. We are to understand the code of public instruction that defines the rights and prescribes the duties of nations in their intercourse with each other. The faithful observance of this law is essential to national character and the happiness of mankind.” 3 \"Congress shall have Power... To provide for define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations...\" —Constitution for the united states of America [1:8:10] \"The King has the power to make Treaties. Treaties involving changes in the Tariff or in any law of the Kingdom, shall be referred for approval to the Legislature. The King appoints Public Ministers, who shall be commissioned, accredited and instructed agreeably to the usage and Law of Nations.\" —Constitution for the Kingdom of Hawai'i , Article 29 (1852) & 30 (as amended in 1864, 1887) - 223 -"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The “Law of Nations” is the private international law between sovereign individuals, families, tribes, courts, grand juries, townships, counties, states and nations. This has been well established under various international conventions for thousands of years. All the administrative rules and regulations, statutes and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), and constitutions of various countries are based ultimately on the organic “Law of Nations.” The “Law of Nations” is the “Law of Sovereigns,” derived from the principles of natural law. It is from the “Law of Nations” that constitutions are created and lawful de jure governments consummated. Any government that portends to hold power and wields authority without being answerable to these Laws are de facto and unlawful governments ruling by occupation, usurpation and exploitation. De facto governments justify their existence by the rule of force and coercion instead of the rule of Law. Legitimate, lawful de jure governments of the sovereign people by the sovereign people and for the sovereign people do exist by the rule of Law. The federal United States government is presently a de facto government ruling by occupation, usurpation and exploitation. Not only is the federal United States government bankrupt, but it has usurped its limited authority and jurisdiction, not only in the united states of America but in the Kingdom of Hawai'i. The federal United States government is desperately in want of lawful authority and dominion, but it can have none without the consent of the inherent sovereign people. The sovereign American people created the federal government through the Constitution and the organic law that preceded it. It is a universal rule of the Law of Nations that the Created (i.e., the government) can never be greater than the Creator (i.e., the sovereign). The federal United States government bases its entire existence upon the political will of the sovereign people. Having obtained no consent to supercede its authority, such a government will self-destruct. Such a principle has been universally accepted and followed in at least the following cases as of the date of the O’Donoghue case (April/May 1933): Benner v. Porter, 9 How. 235, 242-244; Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 447; Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall, 648, 655; Good v. Martin, 95 US 90, 98; Reynolds v. United States, 98 US 145, 154; The City of Panama, 101 US 453, 460; McAllister v. United States, 141 US 174, 180 et seq.; United States v. McMilan, 165 US 504, 510; and Romeu v. Todd, 206 US 358, 368. Under international law, Jus cogens are \"rules universally recognized and so firmly recognized and so firmly established as to need no justification and are binding on all nations belonging to the community of nations.\" The binding, peremptory nature of jus cogens does not allow for derogation. Once an international norm becomes jus cogens, it is absolutely binding on all states, whether they have persistently objected or not. Even though the United States was not a signatory to the Vienna Convention, the principle of jus cogens is binding upon the United States. 4 Counter-Claims and Cross-Libels in Admiralty / Maritime In International law, as in commerce, contracts of specific performance can only be agreed to by parties capable of making such a contract, or through representatives with power of attorney. A slave or subject cannot enter into a contract without the consent of the master. If you are indeed a sovereign “state” Citizen, with your full and complete right to contract unhindered by any contract with the government, then the “Law of Nations” is the code of behavior between sovereigns, nations, and other free entities. The willingness to fight and defend what is yours is a requirement of keeping your sovereignty. The rights to property determine sovereignty. The sovereign, on land, has rights of property, and the right to acquire property by hard work. No one owns the sea. Landless corporate governments are only able to act under the rules of an Admiralty/Maritime contract. Artificial corporations have no unalienable rights, no property rights, no basis for a claim under the Common law or the Law of Nations. You can rest assured that any court actions in revenue, traffic, or insurance are Admiralty/Maritime actions. The ever-present, gold-fringe (badge) around the Military (ensign) flag, falsely believed to be the American flag, confirms the jurisdiction and the presence of an international contract. There are three causes for an Admiralty/Maritime claim, either a tort, a claim, or a prize. An Admiralty action is against a thing, a ship, or property, in rem, not an individual. It is predicated upon a sworn affidavit of complaint or verified contract of performance. Instead of the damaged party swearing out a complaint, a “proctor” acting for the damaged party produces an “information” and bond to the clerk who then registers a “Notice of Claim” against the “vessel,” or “vassal.” Thus the vessel, or vassal is “arrested,” like in drug forfeiture and other property seizures, thus establishing the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of the seizure. I have good reason to believe that the “war on drugs,” and “war on crime” forfeitures are in fact the prizes (on sea) or booty (on land) under Admiralty law. The RICO statutes and forfeiture laws are used to justify the arrest of the property. If seized property is claimed as a prize of war, there must be solid evidence that the property is a man-ofwar, or that there is contraband cargo to verify the seizure. They must have found “drugs” or contraband on the property, and that is the only evidence that can be entered - 224 -"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Chapter Fourteen Counter-Claims and Cross-Libels in Admiralty / Maritime into the proceeding to justify a claim based on a prize. All this is being done in an Admiralty/Maritime jurisdiction. The “proctors” are either another judge, the prosecuting attorneys, the City Manager, or the U.S. Attorney acting on behalf of the international principals/creditors (i.e., International Monetary Fund) who are not present. A “Notice of Seizure” is published to notify all claimants to come forward and file a claim against the vessel, or vassal, by the U.S. Marshall. Then a “special master” (U.S. Attorney) recommends to the judge what should be done, either (1) dismissing the claim; (2) an auction of the vessel; (3) the claimants are satisfied by the owners offer of payment. So how does all this relate to you as a sovereign “state” Citizen, or a vassal (U.S. citizen) of the federal government (ship of state)? To initiate an action, the police officer at a traffic stop, or prosecuting attorney presumes that you are a “vessel” of the federal United States having been enrolled via a birth certificate, duly registered with a Title (Capitalized NAME), with a certificate of a date of birth (launching). Action begins with an information (presentment or citation) filed with the clerk of the court, and the government absolves itself of posting bond if the accused (presumed to be a U.S. citizen and federal government employee) is in government service. A “Notice to Appear” is given to the accused. If he/she fails to appear to defend claims against the vessel, an arrest, attachment or garnishment of property is recommended. There is no sworn affidavit, nor evidence of contract entered into the court at this point because the presumption stands that the vessel, or vassal has no rights. The court wants the owner (you) of the property (person or legal fiction) to be in the possession of the court to establish jurisdiction. When your property (your body) is arrested under an Admiralty proceeding, you cannot argue jurisdiction. You have granted jurisdiction by your appearance, and by virtue of the fact that your property has been seized. Once jurisdiction has been established by the appearance of the owner, the proceeding shifts from Admiralty to Equity. In Admiralty, the original, signed contract must be placed into evidence before an action can conclude. In Equity, a quasi-contract can establish a claim. Under Equity rules, you’re faced with defending yourself against a quasi-claim to specific performance. It’s your signature on the traffic citation, or on the driver’s license that compels you to perform. The citation/summons gave you notice of the “in rem” action against your property. You must always explicitly “Reserve your Rights,” and either refuse to sign, or sign under threat, duress and coercion (tdc). You must file a rebuttal as a “Cross-Libel,” or as a “Refusal for Cause, Without Dishonor,” denying their presumptions and claims. You can file your refusal as a counter-libel in Admiralty, pursuant to Rule 9(h), special pleadings of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). Otherwise their presumption will act against you. You must not consent to the binding arbitration, summary process proceedings, and demand a competent court of judicial power to adjudicate your case. You are not consenting to the proceedings, but are there by rule of necessity on orders of the summons. It is mandatory to file a “Counter-Claim.” You give notice and demand to cure, or demand to show cause, or demand the original contracts, or verified complaints, or demand the identity of the true party who ordered the actions that damaged you, or other demands for a remedy. If they answer, determine if the answers are refutable for failure to substantiate claims, failure to present original contracts, failure to produce proof of evidence that the seizure of your “booty” is authorized under prize law, or other grounds under the rules of evidence. The courts cannot give you a Common law remedy until you file a “Cross-Libel” pursuant to 28 USC§1333, Savings to Suitor, based on the First Judiciary Act. In your “Complaint” accuse them of kidnapping for ransom, “legal” extortion, perjury, robbery ashore, and other violations of your person and property. This verified complaint is served upon all known parties that have damaged you including their superiors. Subpoena the names of the superiors so you can join them to the suit. You must join all necessary parties. Failure to enjoin all necessary parties is grounds for dismissal of your Cross-Libel. All parties who fail to answer your Complaint have granted you grounds for a “Summary Judgment.” If the Cross-Libel is dismissed without hearing, you can now claim a discharge of all debts pursuant to UCC 3-601. You can now proceed to file suit against the public officials who damaged you in their private capacity, either by Title 42 USC §1983, Common law tort, or Commercial Lien based upon violation of their signed oaths of office. 5 “ Savings to Suitors clause of 28 U.S.C. 1331(1) enables Maritime litigants to pursue available Common law remedies, if they prefer them to those supplied in Admiralty; it affords litigants choice of remedies not forums.” —Pacific Far East Line, Inc. vs. Ogden Corp., (1977), ND Cal) 425 F Supp 1239 Title 18 U.S.C. §1652, Citizens as pirates Whoever, being a citizen of the United States, commits any murder or robbery, or any act of hostility against the United States, or against any citizen thereof, on the high seas, under color of any commission from any foreign prince, or state, or on pretense of authority from any person, is a pirate, and shall be imprisoned for life. 6 - 225 -"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Title 18 U.S.C.§1661, Robbery ashore Whoever being engaged in any piratical cruise or enterprise, or being of the crew of any piratical vessel, lands from such vessel and commits robbery on shore, is a pirate, and shall be imprisoned for life. 7 In Rem Seizures [Editor’s Note: This white paper was written by Kimberly A.

These Supplemental Rules are mentioned in FRCP 9(h), but they are not published in the standard FRCP. “With respect to seizures, there is no presumption that the government needs a warrant. To be reasonable under the fourth amendment, seizures need only be based on governmental interests that outweigh the intrusions upon an individual's privacy rights.” 8 “ The officers of the law, in the execution of process, are obligated to know the requirements of the law, and if they mistake them, whether through ignorance or design, and anyone is harmed by their error, they must respond in damages.” —Rogers vs. Marshal (United States use of Rogers vs. Conklin) 1 Wall.

Caveat: I advise a serious course of study for the novice before taking your issues to court. Whenever possible, pursue an administrative strategy you can implement yourself. Make your “special or limited appearances” administratively without fail or default. “ I am concerned for the security of our great Nation; not so much because of any threat from without, but because of the insidious forces working from within.” —General Douglas MacArthur If you’re seriously pinned to the wall or the prosecutors have decided “you’re lunch,” then consider building a powerful support team of legal researchers, paralegals and/or Title 42 lawyers to assist you. Having friends, associates and family in the peanut gallery of the courtroom lends emotional support and credibility to your efforts to “take on the system.” Having witnesses to the actions of the officers of the court tempers their intent to bulldoze your rights and due process. Non-Confrontational Strategy Do not adopt a posture of belligerence, superiority or haughty and righteous anger toward the system. They will step up their efforts to crucify you and may very well succeed. Take copious notes, tape record what is permissible and take it to the media if you’ve got a story. As a sovereign “state” Citizen and sui juris freeman/woman, appearing and granting jurisdiction in the Equity/ Admiralty/Maritime/Military courts are your last resort, except when pursuing a necessary lawsuit to reclaim rights or seek damages. The courts are time-consuming, expensive and frustrating snake-pits, and you’d best be well-prepared before entering those disreputable chambers. In most actions, you can present yourself and stand in your own character, OR represent yourself pro se or in propria persona. Get assistance from competent legal researchers or paralegals to prepare your paperwork. Get assistance from Title 42 lawyers or bar-licensed attorneys if they’re willing to go to bat for you. Lawyers and attorneys can bring forward issues and law that the court will not permit you to do. Argue for having your “counsel of choice” whether layman or professional. It’s your unalienable right. There are some situations where attorneys can resolve the issue better than representing yourself. What are your objectives? Are there procedural issues that an attorney can resolve (Article I actions)? There are others where attorneys will become a serious liability to your liberties. Are there issues of law to be raised that an attorney cannot raise (Article III actions)? You need to know the difference. Remember, if you hire an attorney, a lot of your strategies will be moot. Attorneys cannot bring an issue in law before the court and they will not violate their allegiance to the court without risking losing their licenses to the American Bar Association. Screen and interview any candidates seriously before retaining them. If they’re not willing to lose their license to zealously defend your sovereign rights, they aren’t going to serve you well. Many legal actions can be done administratively without ever entering a courtroom. Administration Before Litigation Administrative Procedures Acts There are numerous researchers (e.g., Karl Granse) who have perfected statutory processes for challenging the unlawful actions of government agencies through admini- strative procedures. The “Administrative Procedures Act (APA)” was enacted in 1946 (60 Stat. 237, 5 USCA) to govern practice and proceedings before federal administrative agencies. These Acts codified due process for administrative rulemaking. An administrative remedy is a procedure for allowing a person to assert a right to some kind of relief before an administrative agency. Administrative review generally reviews an administrative proceeding. 1 General Affidavits & Constructive Legal Notices From a legal and political perspective, the first step in reclaiming your sovereign American National OR “state” Citizenship is to revoke your signature on all contracts you’ve entered with the government by general “Affidavit.” You do not have to extract every document or contract from every government office (nor will they comply with your request) to become a sovereign “state” Citizen, although it’s important to clean up your paper trail. Any of these contracts could be used against you in a court as prima facie evidence of your “legal disability.” This is how the State finds evidence to validate its jurisdictional claim against you. An Affidavit is your truth, not mine. Do not parrot any sample Affidavits or form letters word for word without verifying their accuracy and understanding what it means. You must be knowledgeable in answering questions and inquiries from the government. Create Evidence Of Your Jurisdiction After revocation, you must create a paper trail of positive evidence, as a matter of public record by Affidavit, including: revocation of power of attorney, certificate of citizenship, declaration of domicile, tax-exempt foreign status, recession of participation in social security. - 229 -"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook An Affidavit is a written and sworn personal declaration or statement of facts made before an officer of the court. An un-rebutted Affidavit stands as the truth in law. A lawful Affidavit is all that’s necessary to generate a prima facie case. Failure to deny is an admission of guilt. 2 Affidavits must be notarized, filed with the County Recorder or sworn in the presence of two witnesses (this makes an affidavit admissible as evidence). Copies are then sent with a “Constructive Legal Notice” to the appropriate government agency by certified mail-return receipt (nondomestic mail) requested (this is evidence of service). A “Legal Notice” is any information communicated to a Plaintiff, Defendant or affected party by an authorized individual. County Recorders in many venues are becoming reluctant to file papers they deem “irregular” and have been instructed by U.S. Attorneys (e.g., Oregon and other States) not to file affidavits, liens or other papers. County Recorder’s and their superiors who fail to file your affidavits or other legal documents “on demand” must be legally noticed for breach of office. Practice Administration Before Litigation Having a document “notarized” makes the document cognizant in a foreign venue, although it may also admit to your presence in a federal area. Having two Citizens witness your documentation in lieu of a notary and/or filing with the County Recorder may be a better strategy. Filing can be done in any jurisdiction cognizant to the court. National recording services and filing in foreign, Common law nations can also be used to authenticate your papers. You can exercise an entire legal proceeding administra- tively, by Affidavit, without ever entering a courtroom. Quiet Title Action In addition to the general Affidavit and Constructive Legal Notice, a sovereign “state” Citizen must perfect his or her status and title to property by petitioning a constitutional Common law court. This legal process is called an action or declaration of “Quiet Title.” When the state republics and their respective courts were sovereign and fully functioning, “Quiet Title” actions were commonplace over both the natural person and property. Even immigration and naturalization into “state” Citizen- ship was a function of the Superior courts via “Quiet Title” before a jury of peers in a Common law venue . Perfecting Status And Property Rights Several years ago many counties and states had over 140 functioning Common law courts. They were re- consummated by and for the people as there were no cognizable Common law actions in the statutory court systems of the federal States. No issue of law can be raised except in a Common law court or venue. The constitutionality of statutes cannot be challenged except in a Common law venue by individuals in their sovereign capacity. These courts came under attack by the federal and State governments, activists were accused of being “paper terrorists” because they were indeed “taking the law into their own hands” and providing recourse and remedy where the statutory courts had failed. The media whipped up hysteria and the prosecutors maliciously attacked the founders of the movement. Having Common law recourse and remedy in a Common law venue is essential to restoring due process and sovereign rights. There is no sovereignty without it in our system of law. Quiet title actions must be restored. If you cannot find a Common law court or venue to “Quiet Title,” then you can asseverate your status by making a “Declaration of “Quiet Title” and publish it for three consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper. Only you can determine your status and Citizenship. Don’t expect the government or the courts to support you in this endeavor. > RES JUDICATA — it is already decided; final action in an administrative or judicial process. We the People cannot rest on our laurels, or shortcut the process towards perfecting our status and rights. We must employ every possible remedy and recourse to protect and establish our rights, status and property res judicata. Res judicata means “it is already decided.” This is the final word in any lawful process. Writs or judgments from a Common law court on matters it is competent to hear are res judicata. Quiet Title will perfect your status, rights and property rights. 3 Refusals for Fraud and Notices of Default If you get a citation, summons or any other annoying or invasive contract or correspondence from the government, you can refute the “presentments” by “Refusal for Fraud, Without Dishonor, pursuant to UCC 3-501.” This section of the UCC is based on the refusal of instruments which are non-bona fide or fraudulent in nature. Giving Notice And Grace Lawful process requires that you respond to an invitation into their jurisdiction and give “Notice and Grace” of your timely refusal. This is also a matter of mutual respect, in communi-cations between jurisdictions. Just because the govern-ment hasn’t given you full disclosure, and “Notice and Grace” of their actions, doesn’t mean you cannot act more intelligently and respectfully than they. Restoring Lawful Process If you fail to respond to an invitation into their jurisdiction, then you are guilty by default. You must return the citation or presentment to the issuing police officer and the court, or the administering agency in a timely manner along with a “Constructive Legal Notice” showing good cause for your refusal. - 230 -"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen Refusals for Fraud and Notices of Default > PRESENTMENT– invoice, bill, citation, summons; invitation to volunteer into their jurisdiction. A timely refusal would be 3 days to refuse the “presentment,” without dishonor. You must also revoke all “Power of Attorney” that the court, the judge or the clerk presumes to have over you. They will not have any actual or inferred “Power of Attorney” to enter any form of plea, nor to find you guilty of anything by default, although they may attempt to do so anyway. Your refusals are setting an eventual trap for them to fall into, and are creating evidence to prove it. The strategy is to create reversible error at the lower court level, which can be reversed on appeal, and to give them ample opportunity to violate your rights and due process of the law. This won’t be difficult to do as it is routine public policy, procedure, and practice for most government officials and administrative agencies. You must get strong and wise enough to effectively and lawfully apply the necessary checks and balances to assure a limited government, and hold them personally and officially liable for actions taken against you. These days a “Refusal for Fraud” certainly doesn’t guarantee that a citation will disappear or be dismissed. You are engaged in the first step of an administrative process that will probably end up in litigation down the road. What you are in effect accomplishing is getting evidence and facts into the case record (case file), and pointing out where your rights and due process have been violated. This is evidence you’ll need down the road to defend your right to travel, or any other right that your are reclaiming. Remember if you cannot exercise your rights, you don’t have any! Refuse The Invitation Into Their Jurisdiction If you have not placed your signature, knowingly and willingly on the “presentment,” it is NOT a valid, enforceable contract. You cannot be forced into a contract against your will. If you have refused for fraud, they cannot legally issue a capias, or warrant for your arrest. A true warrant needs: 1. probable cause; 2. affidavit; 3. a clear description of what and who shall be seized. If they do issue an unlawful capias or warrant, you have more evidence to support your case that your rights have been violated. Ask the court to take “Judicial Notice” that this Refusal for Fraud is based on: 1. the lack of jurisdiction over the defendant— jurisdiction is hereby challenged. 2. the [Municipal, District, Circuit] court has no actual or inferred Power of Attorney to act on behalf of this Citizen, nor does the [Municipal, District, Circuit] court have any civil authority in matters of Equity—this proceeding is estoppeled. 3. the fraudulent use of a presentment (i.e., citation) to extort revenue from this Citizen, after the police officer and the Court have been duly noticed of their lack of jurisdiction —ignorance of the law by a police officer is no excuse for violating the rights of this Citizen. 4. this motorist is a non-operator, not a legal “person,” and is not required by public law to have a driver’s license, nor pay any occupation tax, as he is not, nor has he ever engaged in the use of the roads for commercial purposes. 5. the state legislature makes the public laws and statutes while the courts, government agencies and executive officers must enforce the laws and the legislative intent therein. 6. the corporate State of Oregon cannot compel this Citizen to enter into a voluntary contract against his will . 7. the prohibitive, exorbitant and punitive bail requirement for an appearance. 8. the right to travel is an unalienable and guaranteed right for all Citizens, affirmed in hundreds of cases including the U.S. supreme Court—exercising a con- stitutional right cannot be converted into a crime. 9. this Citizen has contracted no obligation whatsoever to pay federal, State, County or Municipal debt 10. this Citizen is not a resident alien, not a juristic “person,” not subject to administrative tribunals or statutory laws of the federal United States. Domicile, Not Residence Please note that I do not “reside” in the federal enclave designated on the summons as “OR,” nor do I own or rent an “address” for commercial purposes. Therefore, if you choose to correspond or properly service me, you must use the address exactly shown below my signature, and evidenced by my “Declaration of Domicile.” The court and its employees are hereby directed to: 1. incorporate this letter into the official record regarding this matter; 2. to produce and deliver to my correct mailing location a certified copy of the original, signed affidavit and/or equity/admiralty contract that supposedly brought me into your jurisdiction. If you disagree with this refusal in any way you have ten (10) calendar days in which to respond to me, otherwise I will consider the matter closed. I am disappointed that you have unlawfully refused in the past to answer my Refusal for Fraud, or to adjudicate the challenge of jurisdiction. You have an obligation and a duty to this Citizen to respond. 4 Once you have served your “Refusals for Fraud” and the particular agency or court does not answer the points raised in your refusal (which they likely will ignore), then send them a “Notice of Default” to adjudicate the matter res judicata. From an administrative perspective, you have served lawful process. “ No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.” —Title 18 U.S.C.A 4001 (a) - 231 -"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Non-Statutory Abatements A Common law procedure known as the “Non-Statutory Abatement” is proving successful to estoppel various court actions of the commercial, Article 1 courts. Most Americans are ignorant in questions of law, jurisdiction, and venue, which make us the slaves of courts, process and court procedures that make it easy for governments to prey upon our rights and property. Abating Improper Process “Non-Statutory Abatements” are Common law actions used to quash improper, unlawful, inadequate or defective process on its face by returning the paperwork to its source and demanding corrections to the process before agreeing to be joined or submitting to jurisdiction. Virtually no process initiated by a government or administrative agency abides by the minimum due process requirements well established in law. They have forgotten or are too busy or lazy to do it right anymore. Just to illustrate how wrong the government or administrative process is: paperwork is sent to the wrong name (JOHNNY FREEDOM LIBERTY instead of Johnny Freedom Liberty); paperwork is sent to the wrong venue (OR instead of Oregon state); paperwork is sent without a seal of a court of competent jurisdiction, or the signature of a judge; paperwork is sent by a public official without a signature under penalties of perjury; or paperwork is sent with other repugnant presumptions. Abatements also respond effectively to the majority of emergency and war powers by refuting the government’s presumptions and paperwork head on. Used properly, abatements can stop all actions filed by such governments before any “case” gets started and without going to court. Abatements are simple and administrative in nature and can have the power and effect of an indictment or the filing of a civil suit. Refuting Government Presumptions Abatements unanswered or ignored become Res Judicata or final judgment. No issue at-law can be retried without viola- ting the Fifth Amendment (i.e., double jeopardy clause). Abatements have met with a high level of success and are extremely low cost when you prepare your own response. Costs will seldom exceed the process server fees. Abatements properly filed are a public record of unlawful acts by governments and can be used to prosecute such entities when lawful government is restored. Abatements are a major tool in rolling back emergency powers and martial law government. 5 Police and the Traffic Stop U.S. citizens, American National OR “state” Citizens encounter the “law” most often at the traffic stop with “police officers” who demand our driver’s license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. This is where it begins and where it ends. The traffic stop is the bottom line where the rubber meets the pavement, where the “Attorney-Police-Prison State” makes initial direct contact with the people. Attorney — Police — Prison State Who hasn’t felt intimidated or afraid at the approach of a police car in the rearview mirror, and terrified when the blue lights come on behind you? More people are afraid of the police and loss of liberty than ever before. Why is this in the “land of the free?” If your sovereign un - alienable rights are not respected here, then expect to fight to defend them. Police officers are not the “law,” nor are they above the “law.” It is their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution and the “law of the land” without exception. There is no statute, no code, no administrative rule or procedure above the “law of the land.” Police officers are supposed to be enforcing the American system of law, intended to “protect and serve” We the Peo - ple, from both the tyranny of government and the masses. Under no circumstances have they taken an oath to disre - gard the American people or insult them as “constitutional - ists” as I’ve heard recently at a traffic stop. Police officers need education as much as any other segment of the popula - tion. It all begins and ends at a traffic stop. Most Citizens, including the police officers themselves, do not understand the constitutional limitations or implications of police power, especially as it pertains to sovereign “state” Citizens. All police officers and public officials are required by state law to be bonded. A bond is a security against their oath of office that they will perform their duties without fail or sacri - fice their bond. Without a bond, and very few have one (except the Secretary of State and other key government posts), their public office is vacant, their public immunity is gone, and the police offi - cer or public official becomes individually and personally li - able for their actions at a traffic stop. Without a bond, police officers are nothing more than “rent- a-cops” hired by a particular municipal, county or State cor - poration. Televised incidents like the beating of Rodney King have both enraged and invoked fear and confusion about what the police can and cannot “lawfully” do. Highly publicized trials like O.J. Simpson have given us bad impressions of the legal fraternity, and the corruption inherent in the justice system. Police officers, like any other government official, have limi - tations of what they can and cannot do under the “color of uniform.” Establishing “law” and proper procedures at the police level is essential. Police officers are in fact “revenue agents” of the corporate government, and are enforcing a private statute at a traffic stop. The Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) Code regulates commercial entities and licensed “persons.” - 232 -"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen Police and the Traffic Stop It’s a private statute because it applies only to a special class of “person” at the exclusion of another class . Only “persons” driving or operating a motor vehicle for commercial purposes are required by American law to have a “driver’s license” and vehicle registration. The Motor Vehicle Acts legislated by various state legisla - tures excluded “manufacturer’s and dealers” from register - ing their vehicles for individual use. Thus a “Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin” is sufficient evidence of ownership. Private use by private “state” Citizens not engaged in commercial transport was also exempted. You also cannot be given a citation if you travel by horse and buggy. 5 Recall that a “person” is a legal fiction created by the 14 th Amendment. U.S. citizens are “persons” required. A sovereign “state” Citizen has the unalienable, un- enumerated, natural “right to travel.” This natural right has been upheld by many court cases. It’s a right that must be defended though in these times. > DRIVER or OPERATOR OF A MOTOR VEHICLE— if you make money on the travel and transportation of goods (not for personal use); if engaged in interstate commerce; for commercial purposes only (chauffeurs, taxi, truck & bus drivers). A sovereign “state” Citizen is not a legal “person,” therefore the DMV Code doesn’t apply to you (California Motor Vehicle Code, §290). “State” Citizens can use the highways freely for personal use. California Motor Vehicle Act (Stats. 1913, p.639) ... requires professional chauffeurs, or drivers of motor vehicles for hire to pay an annual license tax, but exempts all other operators of such vehicles from such tax and regulation. See also General Laws of Oregon, 1925, Chapter 380, p.756-778, or research the Motor Vehicle Act in your respective state. When a police or peace officer steps out of their police car, they step out of uniform and become a private Citizen acting under the “color of law.” If they violate your constitutional rights, the police officer becomes personally liable. Some police officers are aware of this, most are not. They must be educated as much, if not more, than the rest of us. Remember, more police officers are killed at a traffic stop than anywhere else, so understand that they might be a little edgy when confronted. Do not act belligerently. Be calm, be respectful. “ Motor Vehicle means every description of carriage or contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes.” —18 U.S.C. 31 6 Avoid getting any needless citations by “driving” safely and carefully. It’s just unCOMMON sense! Being a sovereign Citizen doesn’t justify endangering the lives of others or traveling recklessly (e.g., while intoxicated). It’s a call for complete and total responsibility for your actions. It’s a call for financial responsibility as well. Your individual attitude and statement may be sufficient to deter him/her from writing a citation in the first place. If not, and he/she writes the ticket, then reserve your rights. All this can be stated in your “Constructive Legal Notice.” Editor’s Note: Police officers are now being trained in the liabilities that attach to them when they violate the rights of Citizens under Title 18 and Title 42. 7 Don’t expect them to pay much attention, or expect them to validate your sovereignty. If they’re interested, take the time to talk with them. If not, be on your way as expeditiously as possible. If the police officer goes beyond his or her lawful authority and violates your rights, you can file a “Counter-Complaint and Summons,” file suit for false arrest or imprisonment, or perfect a lien against their property. Put the police officer on “Notice” that any act that damages you will be considered willful. Ignorance of the law is no excuse for a police officer who is a State witness upon whose testimony a citation (e.g., information, summons, presentment) is initiated. If the State witness at a traffic stop is not taught the necessary distinctions of law, or the ability to discern the question of Citizenship, or jurisdiction, then the law will be broken, and rights will be violated routinely. The officer has a lot of discretion in whether or not to write the citations, but little or none on the procedure to follow. Oftentimes, citations issued have been arbitrary, inconsistent and often inapplicable (e.g., being cited for failure to register, even though I had just \"registered\" the vehicle that morning; cited for lack of insurance even though I had proof of insurance; cited for a driving while suspended even though the license had been revoked). These subtleties seem to be lost on many officers who claim, like many government employees, to be simply doing their job. I have never been asked by a police officer at a traffic stop if I was a U.S. citizen OR an American National OR a “state” Citizen. They operate under the presumption that all Americans are of the same Citizenship. If I had been asked, he/she could have established jurisdiction before proceeding to enforce the private statute. Had I contested his question, or reserved all my rights, or had evidence to demonstrate that I was a private, sovereign individual, then the police officer had no right, no authority to enforce a private statute against this Citizen. The indiscriminate enforcement of the law by police officers has led to countless violations of civil liberties, and the aroused anger and frustration of the general public to the boiling point. These indiscriminate enforcements are the result of agency policies and government directives that are wholly inconsistent with both the intent of the legislature, and the administration of lawful process. Do not permit a police officer to conduct an illegal search of your vehicle or property. Do not give them your consent. Demand your 4th Amendment rights. Otherwise, they could use any evidence found against you. Unless the red lights are flashing, technically, you’re not under arrest. If they persist, reply respectfully with: - 233 -"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Statement to Police Officer Gentleman, I am a law-abiding citizen going about my lawful business. I am carrying no contraband. I have committed no crime. Unless you can state probable cause to the contrary for the benefit of my tape recorder here, I shall be on my way. With respect to more significant law enforcement concerns (e.g. violent crime, abuse, etc.) for both the police and the Citizen, police could be assisted by dedicated citizens and community organizations who can deal with the roots of these and economic problems, besides criminalizing or punishing offenders. Community policing is becoming a more sensible alternative. Too many police departments spend too much of their limited energy extorting revenues for local municipalities through traffic and parking citations than actually dealing with real, threatening crimes and social problems. This imbalance must be corrected and trust restored. “Something must be done to change the perception that police are punishers and enforcers, rather than protectors of the people.” This is not to conclude that the police, or any government official, are necessarily evil. They are people with families and concerns along with the rest of the Citizens. But police officers need to understand Citizenship as well as the statutes they are hired to enforce. The duties and powers of the county sheriff are without equal in the state. His/Her function is to protect the sovereignty of the Citizens and the state. 8 “ The Citizens, their persons, their property, health and morals shall be protected and made safe. In the exercise of executive and administrative functions, in conserving the public law... he represents the sovereignty of the state and has no superior in his county.” —Anderson on Sheriffs False Arrest and Imprisonment False imprisonment consists of any type of unlawful restraint or interference with the personal liberty of an individual. False imprisonment is classified as a tort under the Common law, and also as a crime. It has been labeled as a tort, a trespass, an assault, a wrong, a damage, and an injury. Depriving a human being of their liberty is legally no different than depriving a person of their property. Unlawful detention or deprivation of liberty is the basis of an action for the tort of false imprisonment. Actual seizure or the laying on of hands is not necessary to constitute an unlawful detention. One who interferes with another’s liberty of locomotion does so at his/her own peril. All who do so without lawful authority can be sued for the trespass upon liberty and loss of time. The illegal arrest of a person without a warrant, or under an invalid warrant, entitles him/her to compensation for the damages sustained by reason of the false or unlawful arrest and imprisonment. There are two kinds of damages, actual and punitive. Actual damages are such compensation for the injury as would follow from the nature and character of the act. Punitive damages are those that grow out of the wantonness of atrocity, or aggravated by the act. Anyone who assists of participates in an unlawful arrest or imprisonment is equally liable for the damage caused. 9 Writ of Habeas Corpus The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 10 ensures that a first-time offender not previously convicted of a serious crime, be given a sentence other than imprisonment. For innocent citizens railroaded into prison, prior to a petition for “Writ of Habeas Corpus,” and within five years of conviction, one has the right to a single (statutory or Common law?) petition by Motion that is virtually unknown. 11 Should you be arrested and incarcerated for any reason, and there is no probable cause, an improper warrant, no valid presentment, no indictment, information or charge, violations of state or constitutional rights, fraud or lack of due process, a “Writ of Habeas Corpus” may be your best “get out of jail free card” for sovereign “state” Citizens. Sometimes a “Motion for Bond Reduction” is required before filing the Writ. It remains to be seen how a “Writ of Habeas Corpus” can be brought today in a Common law venue, although that was it’s original intent and purpose. The following was developed for statutory applications, but I assert it could be invoked in a Common law venue as well. Some of the elements of a good “Writ of Habeas Corpus” include the following: 1) Petitioner was informed that he would be held indefinitely or until he surrendered his unalienable, substantive and perfect rights. All counts involved are non-jail civil violations under Vernon’s Civil Statutes and no probable cause determination has been had to determine that the defendant does in fact have the ability to pay pursuant to Ex Parte Byran, 662 SW 2d 147, therefore the defendant is in debtors prison. 12 2) The jurisdiction of the lower court issuing the commitment papers restraining (name) in his liberty are fatally defective and the district courts review of the record upon certiorari will reveal that the following is true and correct to wit. The jurisdiction of the alleged court issuing the commitment orders restraining the defendant of his liberty are fatally defective for the following reasons to wit. - 234 -"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen Writ of Habeas Corpus A) The defendant was never provided with a copy of the information or complaint, or the affidavits attached thereto by an accuser. B) The defendant was never informed as to the true nature and cause of the accusations against him. C) In any cause, civil or criminal in nature, the plaintiff has the absolute duty and obligation to prove each and every element necessary for jurisdiction. There is no pleading by any attorney authorized to appear in behalf of the municipal corporation with authority to represent the municipal corporation or the State. There are no facts, no evidence, no pleadings, no motions or any documents going to show the jurisdiction of the accuser/plaintiffs unless this court will allow a police officer to practice law without a license or will allow the alleged judge to practice common barratry from the bench as there are no facts or testimony before the alleged judge, and any decision is based upon extra record evidence in violation of Federal Rules of Evidence 102 & 201. 13 D) In order for the plaintiff to make its case, the police officer, an alleged but yet to be proven agent for the plaintiff, would have to plead the municipal corporation’s own infamy, in that he would have to admit that he is in disguise upon the highways, the disguise being that of a conservator of the peace, and there have been no facts or evidence, nor can there ever be any facts or evidence, as to a breach of the peace, therefore, the plaintiff’s true character as a privateer collecting contributions, information and other things of value for a foreign principle would be disclosed. I assert that the district court of the united States (Common law side) not the U.S. District Court (Statutory and commercial side), has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the “All Writs Statute” (28 U.S.C. 1651), and the Savings to Suitors Clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789 Session 1, Chapter 20§16 & 9a (28 U.S.C. §1333). Savings to suitors is an extraordinary Common law remedy whenever said remedy is the only complete and adequate remedy, and it is hereby and herein declared that statutory relief is not a complete or adequate substitute for the unalienable perfect remedy at law. 14 Petition for Redress of Grievances When the State consistently deprives a Citizen, or Citizens, of all their substantive rights, remedies and recourse, and after all administrative and judicial remedies have been exhausted, the Citizen retains the unalienable, natural right to create a Common law remedy through a “Petition for Redress of Grievances.” This is the last resort short of a declaration of war. When the State, by and through its officials and agents deprives a Citizen of all his remedies by the due process of law and deprives said Citizen of the equal protection of the law, the State commits a Common law act of “Mixed War” against the citizen. The Citizen has the right to recognize this act, on the part of the State by the publication of a “Solemn Recognition of Mixed War.” The sheriff is the Chief Executive of the county, superior to the Governor, the President of the United States and superior to the IRS so far as county matters are concerned. This writ has the same force by law as the “Declaration of Independence.” It invokes the Citizen’s constitutional 9th and 10th Amendment guarantees of the right to create an effective remedy where otherwise none exists.” 15 The “Declaration of Independence” (DOI) was also a “Commercial Affidavit.” The first part of the DOI stated the unalienable rights given by the Creator, the second part defined the crimes of King George, and the third part gives the Crown options as to what comes next. Either we will be friends in peace or bitter enemies in war. The rest is history. Governments and the judicial remedies and recourse to be found therein exist as a substitute for the duel or battlefield, so that commercial differences can be resolved peacefully rather than by violence and war. 16 \"When the right to do a thing depends upon legislative authority, and the legislature has failed to authorize it, or has forbidden it, no amount of acquiescence or consent or approval of the doing of it by a ministerial officer can create a right to do the thing which is unauthorized or forbidden.\" —Department of Insurance vs. Church Members Relief Asso. 217 Ind 58, 26 NE(2d) 51, 128 ALR 635 Re-Declaration of Independence Editor’s Note: Here's a \"Re-declaration of Inde-pendence\" written by Johnny Liberty in the North Ame-rican News Service (Summer 1995) for restoring the sovereignty of the American people. Would you sign it? Preamble All thirteen free and independent, sovereign states of America, excepting the sovereign Indian nations, were in agreement in making the original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The people then, as the people now, have gathered the courage to liberate themselves from the bondage of foreign “rule.” When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a nation, a group of people, or an individual to declare themselves free from the “rule” of another, then it is com - mon decency, with respect to the opinions of all other peo - ple, to explain the reasons or grounds for the declaration. Statement of Unalienable Rights and Natural Law We the People believe these truths to be self-evident, to be so obvious that they need no proof, that all people, both men and women, regardless of race, sex, creed, or color are creat - ed equal under the natural law. We believe the Creator gives all of us certain unalienable rights that cannot be taken away. These unalienable rights are above and beyond the civil rights any government may enumerate. That among these rights are life, liberty, property, family, community, and the freedom to enjoy happiness. To assure that these unalienable rights are protected and preserved for all the people, governments are created to enforce and defend the public trust. The source of authority - 235 -"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook from which all governments are created shall remain with the people for all time. We the People are the sovereign power from which all laws and governments arise. If a government abuses its power or usurps the public trust, then the people have the unalienable right and a duty to change, alter or reform their government, or to abolish it completely and start a new one that will abide by the principles of natural law. UnCOMMON SENSE dictates that an established govern - ment should not be overthrown for petty reasons. However, it is the nature of human beings to tolerate mistreatment, to grow accustomed to tyranny and chains rather than risk get - ting rid of a repressive and uncompassionate master. Government maybe a necessary and often unpredictable evil, but at certain times during its history, a government will go too far in abusing the rights of its people. Today, more and more of the American people are realizing that the federal United States government has consistently lied, cheated, stolen, abused and killed its own people for many generations, that the American people have more to fear from their own government than enemies abroad or criminals within. That the natural expression of our freedoms, the right to own property, and the unalienable rights secured by the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are perceived as a threat by our own government is a symptom of the inevitable conclusion that the federal government must be stopped! Illegal, immoral and unconscionable activities of a government out of control have now reached into the lives of all Americans. When this happens, it is the peoples' right and duty to abolish the current government and set up a new one that will better protect our rights, preserve our liberties, and uphold the public trust. Through this “Re-Declaration of Independence,” We the People must once again become a free, sovereign people. We the People can reclaim our sovereign Citizen- ship of one of the several states of the constitutional Republic. Cause for Action The following is the cause for action by the thirteen colonies, now forty-eight sovereign states and unincorporated territories of the united states of America. We the People have suffered patiently, petitioning our government for redress of grievances without remedy, recourse or response. We the People are now convinced that we must change our government and must no longer accept the “rule” of the federal United States government who is beholden and loyal to its creditors and foreign powers. We must cast off the shackles of foreign “rule” including the Federal Reserve, International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the New World Order. Today, after many years of increasing tyranny, we are convinced that it is time to take action. To demonstrate this, let the facts be presented to an unbiased world, without prejudice. Charges Against the Federal Government And its Principals/Creditors Today's federal government has refused to pass laws necessary for the good of the American people, and what is worse, has passed a multitude of laws that have transgressed its limited authority and taken away the basic unalienable rights of most Americans. Laws are passed for the benefit of special interest groups, the monied powers, and the State of New Columbia, not on behalf of the people of the united states of America. The federal United States government has usurped the powers reserved to the sovereign states and the sovereign “state” Citizens, intentionally destroying the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights which were designed as a limitation against the unwarranted expansion of government authority. The federal government has also conspired against the rights, privileges and immunities of the Citizens of the United States by instituting the 14th Amendment under martial law after the Civil War. The sovereign “states” have been usurped by corporate “States” which are merely regional districts and extensions of the municipal law of the District of Columbia. Local, home and state \"rule,\" and the separation of powers have been replaced with federal law and supremacy, effectively overriding all constitutional limitations on federal government authority under threat, duress and coercion. The sovereign states, original parties to the U.S. Constitu - tion, no longer are represented by their Senators in the U.S. Senate. Instead, they are elected directly by the popular vote of U.S. citizens who are foreigners to the Republic. The Republic was co-opted by the federal government during the Civil War, when the Federal Reserve System was established, and after the first bankruptcy of the federal United States declared a perpetual state of national emergency. The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights have been suspend - ed indefinitely under the War Powers Acts, Trading with the Enemy Acts, and 470 consecutive states of national emer - gency. The constitutional Republic has been usurped by a legislative Democracy and corporate, socialist dictatorship instigated by the federal government, international bankers and transnational organizations. Federal control over every aspect of the economy has result - ed in a corporate, socialist state-controlled system that has in effect destroyed local and state economies, free enter - prise, individual incentives for productivity, jobs, security, and our precious freedoms. The nationalization of the public trust has cost the American people their money, property, labor and freedoms for all future generations. This has all been accomplished through monumental fraud, deception, coercion, propaganda and disinformation cam - paigns, non-disclosure, and the usury of a debt currency sys - tem. The result is the bankruptcy of the federal government and the complete confiscation of all the property of the American people. Treaties have been passed to supercede the U.S. Constitu - tion, state and local laws, and the will of the American peo - ple. Having been conned out of our lawful “state” Citizen - - 236 -"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen Re-Declaration of Independence ship, the American people have unwittingly become subjects of the federal government and the foreign powers that con - trol it. The federal government discourages the legal naturalization of Citizens in the states, preferring to naturalize foreigners as subjects and as the property of the federal government. Through the Internal Revenue Service, the federal govern - ment has harassed and intimidated its own people as “tax - payers” and conned them into paying an un-payable and fraudulent debt. Upstanding judges, attorneys, government employees, or elected representatives that dare to speak out against the tyranny in government are silenced, made into scapegoats, lambasted, discredited, fired or counterattacked by the IRS. The IRS is the American gestapo collecting a “public debt” from the American people owed by the federal corporation and its subjects only. It is nothing less than organized crime operating under the immunity of government. The sovereign people of the united states of America are not beholden to the federal debt created by fraud under a perpetual national state of emergency. Through the use of completely controlled and manipulated media, the federal government insures the election of those who support its interests and policies, while discrediting any who would disagree with the government's position. There are no free elections, and no free and independent press. The two-party monopoly discourages third-party political organizing. Un-elected government employees working through admin - istrative agencies set policies and regulations contrary to the intent of the U.S. Constitution, the will of the people, acts of the U.S. Congress, or their elected representatives. These administrative agencies are out of control, operating solely for the sake of extorting property and assets from the American people through bureaucratic schemes executed on behalf of the creditors of the federal United States. New land patents are no longer available, the allodial titles have been stripped from the old land patents due to bank contracts and title insurance fraud, and the public lands are held by the federal government in its corporate capacity on behalf of its creditors. The federal government has hypothecated all the land patents and allodial titles as collateral against an unpayable federal debt. We the People are once again “serfs” relegated to “renting” the land and paying tribute to the landlords. Federal and State courts are monopolized by “union lawyers” having accepted Titles of Nobility (e.g., Esquire) from foreign powers. The federal government has passed a myriad of laws and regulations that subject the American people to the endless detail of regulation and control over every aspect of their lives and business. Many Americans are forced to comply with the letter of ev - ery law or lose life, property and freedoms without due pro - cess or the protections of the U.S. Constitution or Bill of Rights. Attorneys, courts and judges have conspired to rob the American people of their property to execute a bankruptcy against the American people of behalf of the creditors of the federal United States. The federal government has made judges dependent upon the legal precedents established through various bankruptcy organizations for the benefit of the creditors through admi - ralty/maritime law. The federal government has assured the tenure of their of - fice and the amount and payment of their salaries, guaran - teed themselves immunity from prosecution for crimes com - mitted while in office, and have destroyed evidence and rou - tinely obstructed justice. The federal government has long held a double standard of justice, one for the people and one for government officials. The federal government has, since the birth of the Republic, grown larger and larger, with so many superfluous rules and regulations that the lion's share of substance and productivi - ty has been taken directly from the people without compen - sation or gratitude. Government employees take little or no responsibility for preserving the public trust or serving the people who pay their salaries and pensions. Government employees hold an attitude of contempt for the hardworking hands that feed them. The size and expense of the federal government has grown each year, finding it necessary to keep standing armies among us, instituting a vast war machine and a perpetual state of national emergency that has not ceased even in times of peace. Military and police power has been elevated as superior to and independent of the civilian power of the people. The at - torney-police-prison state has become the top funding prior - ity of the post-Cold War era, a federal government which is quickly turning the war machine against its own people. These actions have commenced without the approval of de jure legislatures or the sovereign people. Injustices Against the American People The federal government has been so corrupted by special interests that the “laws” passed by them have resulted in tyranny, injustice and increasing social disintegration and violence. We the People have had virtually no voice or representation in the government for generations. The federal government has combined its power with private interests to subject the American people to a jurisdiction foreign to the U.S. Constitution, unacknow- ledged by our laws, and giving false consent to pretended legislation under the color of law. Here are some of the injustices that have resulted: Through private and international treaties, foreign troops and international police are being introduced and quartered in our communities for the martial law control of the American people. Plans are made for the confiscation of all arms and the defensive capabilities of the people. Concentration camps are being built and funded by the federal government to house American citizens who refuse to cooperate with the New World Order. - 237 -"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Murders and crimes by government troops are either covered up or go unpunished. Evidence and crime scenes are destroyed and the media is cooperative in the obstruction of justice and the persecution of the innocent. The federal government often operates as a cover-up for organized crime, including the importation of dangerous drugs and narcotics. Free trade is sanctioned only for the cartels and monopolies with the money and influence to conspire against the American people and commit treason against the U.S. Constitution. Our elected representatives have consented to treason in their silence and complicity. Income taxes, liens and levies are imposed upon the American people without due process of the law, without a valid assessment process, with no commercial paperwork or valid commercial affidavit. Citizens are being killed and property seized based upon these fraudulent and unjust acts. A trial by a jury of one’s “peers” is impossible for a sovereign “state” Citizen when juries are comprised of “voters,” “drivers,” or U.S. citizens only. Juries are instructed by corrupt judges to consider only the facts and not the law in criminal cases. Attorneys have monopolized the justice, legal, and political system and tamper with grand juries who have an obligation to bring charges for crimes against the American people. Through Admiralty/Maritime law, statutes of pretended crimes and trumped up charges are invented to indict those who dare to dissent or object to the tyranny of the government. Property is seized and bodies are arrested as acts of war against the people of the united states of America on behalf of our true accuser, the creditors of the federal United States. Our prisons are full of innocent people who have dared to speak out against the crimes committed by our own government. The substantive, constitutional Common law system has been abolished and replaced with a bankrupt, statutory Equity/Admiralty law system operating in a foreign jurisdiction, wherein the nature of the crime or the cause of action is never revealed, wherein you do not face your true accuser, wherein crimes without victims are prosecuted by the State which has resulted in the loss of freedom, liberty and property for millions of Americans. The federal government has wrought great destruction upon the American people by experimenting with us like guinea pigs for generations (radiation, medical, military), having wrought havoc and despair upon the lives of so many American people, and have justified such actions as necessary for national security, and to bring about the total submission of the people and the American way of life. Through the lack of full disclosure and by fraudulent means, the federal government has effectively robbed the American people of their lawful Citizenship and unalienable rights to enhance their own power. The sovereign Indian tribes are as much slaves to the federal government as are its citizens. Through monetary gain, media manipulation, and government schools, the federal government has forced our fellow Americans into government service and subject status by becoming federal government employees, getting Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and volunteering into taxes through the 1040's and W-4's. Incentives have been created to make federal police agents of all Americans who would falsely testify against their brothers or sisters for profit, who would lie to avoid prosecution, who would profit from providing evidence of false witnessing, and engage in spying against their fellow Citizens. The immorality of our own government is conclusive and condemning. All Remedies Exhausted During the entire period of these injustices and oppressions, We the People have petitioned the government at every level for redress of grievances. We have begged our representatives to listen in the most humble of terms. We have filed lawsuits and sought remedy and recourse in the courts. Every plea has to date gone unheard and has been ignored. Our every petition has been answered only by repeated injury. From these actions it is quite obvious that this government is tyrannical, moving swiftly toward a totalitarian state, and unfit to rule a free sovereign people. We have appealed to our federal government. We the People have warned them from time to time about how we feel about the rule-making of the U.S. Congress and the extraordinary authority of the President, but to no avail. We have reminded them that we believe America was founded on freedom, and we continue our search and demand for a better life without unnecessary regulations, laws and the forces of occupation. Today, as yesterday, We the People have appealed generally to the UnCOMMON SENSE and compassion to do what is naturally right for a free people. We have called upon our common kindred in the government, instructing them that a continuation of these actions would result in the breaking of our common bond with them. Our words have fallen on deaf ears. They are deaf to the voice of justice. They are loathe to value freedom. We have organized citizen's militias to defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. We have been lambasted by the government and the media as criminals, anarchists, white supremacists, racists, domestic terrorists, and other derogatory terms for daring to expose government corruption. Today, as yesterday, We the People are forced to announce our individual separation from the tyranny and corruption of the federal United States government and all its political subdivisions, and regard them as we do the rest of humankind — enemies in war, friends in peace. - 238 -"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen Re-Declaration of Independence Statement of Sovereignty Therefore, having no legal representation and belonging to one of the several free and independent, sovereign states of the Union, as the free and sovereign people under the state and federal constitutions, we hereby appeal to our Creator for approval of our action, hereby re-declaring our independence.

Without this all the reservation of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.” —Alexander Hamilton 1 If you are compelled to appear in court for a civil or criminal violation, to challenge jurisdiction (Special or Limited Appearance) or the constitutionality of a statute, it’s important to be well prepared before facing a judge or a jury. One must understand the elements of courtroom procedure, the rules of civil and criminal procedure, the rules of evidence, and which jurisdiction the court is operating (LAW, EQUITY, ADMIRALTY /MARITIME/ or STATUTORY). Challenge Jurisdiction Before Pleading To challenge jurisdiction, one must understand the nature and cause of the action, challenge the oaths of office of court officers that abuse the process, refuse unlawful process for fraud, develop grounds for dismissal, motions to dismiss, and understand various pleadings (guilty, not guilty, non est factum, non assumptit, corum non judice, confession and avoidance). Then one can choose to continue in that jurisdiction, change venue to the Common law, or develop an affirmative defenses (demurrers). > NON-ASSUMPSIT — did not undertake or promise as alleged. > CORUM NON JUDICE — declaring the court does not have jurisdiction or venue over the special character of the sovereign Citizen. Until now, the cards have been well stacked in the court’s favor, and an elite, secret club of attorneys, judges, and prosecutors are the only ones who actually know the rules of the game. They appear to make it up as they go to expedite their agenda of expropriating your rights and property. The time is upon us when all the pieces of this gigantic puzzle are finally falling into place, and the sovereign “state” Citizen will be able to effectively challenge the monopoly of the legal fraternity, and restore the checks and balances that belong in our constitutional republic. The Power structure will be compelled by the sovereign “state” Citizens to play fair and abide by the law, or blatantly abrogate the law in broad daylight (with the video cameras rolling and the INTERNET reporting), and be exposed for all to see. The Power structure is vulnerable to lawful process. The truth will be told, and justice shall be done. After you have created prima facie evidence of your sovereign “state” Citizenship, understand the elements and procedures of a court, and are prepared to argue and defend your unalienable rights, anticipate that the present judicial establishment (political by nature) will abrogate lawful process consistently without remorse. If you are damaged by violations of your rights or the abuse of process, there is remedy and recourse. Step 1: Filing Papers And Notice Of Indemnification You must learn how to properly file papers with the court clerk. Whenever in doubt, ask questions. If they are stubborn or hesitant tell them “I file on demand!” Do not be intimidated by court clerks, they are supposed to be your public servants. Keep an original and make several copies. One copy goes to each opposing party. In civil cases, papers can be mailed and a proof of service by mail included in the filing. In criminal cases, papers can be dropped off at the attorney for the opposing party (e.g., in a traffic ticket case, a copy is usually dropped off at the City Attorney’s office). You can take a “Notice of Indemnification” with you before you present your case in court. Indemnification is a bond that the court must post on your behalf at least five days before your court appearance, if you demand it. If the administrative tribunal then violates your unalienable or constitutional rights, whether a sovereign “state” Citizen or U.S. citizen, you’ll have a recourse for collecting damages and compensation. 2 > INDEMNIFY— to bond, insure or secure against any loss or damage that may occur in the future. Step 2: Preparation For Appearance You must have a clear statement prepared before you go to court. Create a statement from your affidavits, retain your full Power of Attorney, with the general details of your case. Send any other pertinent affidavits that might help your case. Keep a few aces in your hat if you need them. Don’t lay all your cards on the table out-front. You will want to put in writing your explicit “Reservation of Rights” under the Common law pursuant to UCC 1-207. You might also consider bringing your own licensed court recorder, if you are appearing in a traffic or municipal court which are not courts of records. If you’re concerned, and you have good reason to be, that the court records might be perjured, or altered by the court, or if you intend on appealing, then it must be a court of record. If you’re seriously challenging your traffic ticket, then request from the court clerk that the appearance be scheduled for a court of record, instead of a traffic court. Municipal courts and often District courts are not courts of record but administrative summary process only. You have far more options and power in court as a sovereign “state” Citizen or sui juris freeman/woman to reclaim your rights than you do as a U.S. citizen who has already waived your constitutional protections and volunteered into contracts that bind you to the statutory law. - 241 -"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Your ability to defend your government-granted privileges evaporates quickly in a statutory jurisdiction. You can only win on a procedural technicality. Becoming a sovereign “state” Citizen is important to establish before you have your day in court, to overcome the presumptions that you are a U.S. citizen, and have indeed entered into contracts with the government. Your sovereign status will one day afford you luxuries and affirmative defenses that a U.S. citizen does not have available. Step: 3 Appearance And Jurisdiction When compelled or volunteering to make an “appearance” before the court, you are submitting to the jurisdiction and authority of the court, unless you challenge jurisdiction, ask for a “Jurisdictional Hearing,” or make a “Special or Limited Appearance.” Discover what jurisdiction the court has, the rules pertaining to that court, and how it applies to you, if at all. Look into the courtroom prior to your appearance. If you see an Admi - ralty/Maritime flag (gold-fringed American flag), you can safely conclude that it’s an Admiralty / Maritime / Equity ju - risdiction or a Military/Martial law tribunal operating under emergency powers. Demand to see the signed, original inter - national contract if you are forced to appear or file a non- statutory abatement. > COMPULSORY APPEARANCE— required showing up in court of a plaintiff or defendant, either pro se, or through an attorney; an appearance and pleading involves a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the court; appearance is compelled by the service of process (you get a notice, summons, subpoena, or a date noted on the traffic ticket); “Refuse for Fraud” your citations or presentments, “Without Dishonor, pursuant to UCC 3-501,” and then file a “Special or Limited Appearance” to challenge jurisdiction. > SPECIAL or LIMITED APPEARANCE— for the sole purpose of questioning the jurisdiction and authority of the court over the defendant either in personum, or in subject matter; the court cannot proceed until the challenge to jurisdiction is adjudicated, and the burden of proof is on the court to establish jurisdiction; challenge jurisdiction on paper and file with the court clerk; also revoke their Power of attorney; do not motion or move the court to do anything until jurisdiction is established, otherwise your jurisdictional arguments are moot; doesn’t work in Admiralty or Military courts. > JURISDICTIONAL HEARING— a proceeding before a magistrate without jury to determine an issue of fact, specifically regarding whether or not the court has jurisdiction; you cannot challenge jurisdiction in Admiralty or Military courts. “ Once you challenge jurisdiction in a criminal case, the courts have the burden of proof ... and they are required to back their jurisdictional claim by showing you pertinent statutory charges.” —5 U.S.C. 556(d) Step 4: Arraignment And Pleadings There are specific rules and court procedures that must be followed. You’re better off to sit mute and not incriminate yourself, than to give your consent, agree unwittingly, or unknowingly violate court procedures. Standing in court or approaching the “bar” implies your consent to be tried under “statutory” law. Do not stand in court until the court has answered your request regarding its jurisdiction. Jurisdiction must be squarely challenged. Your rights must be explicitly reserved at each step of the proceeding. Failure to deny is an admission of guilt (28 U.S.C. 8(d)).3 Hiring or retaining an attorney also implies your consent to be tried under the statutory law of that court, and waiving your right to represent yourself. By hiring or retaining an attorney, you’ve agree to become a “ward of the court,” subject to the rules and procedures known only to the State Bar Associations, subject to the jurisdiction of the court, and their mercy. Remember an attorney’s first duty is to the courts (creditors of the federal United States) and to the Bar Association, not to the client (you). 4 > WARD OF THE COURT— infants and persons of unsound mind; most people have been regarded as children all their adult lives. “ The more laws that are written, the more criminals are produced.” —Lao-Tse, Tao Te Ching Sample Arraignment 5 COURT: When asked by a government official what you meant when you wrote “Without Prejudice” by your “name,” you must say: CITIZEN: “Your honor, my use of Without Prejudice UCC 1-207 with my signature on this document indicates that I have exercised the remedy provided for in the UCC in book 1 at section 207, whereby I may reserve my common law right not to be compelled to perform under any contract or agree - ment that I have not entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally, and that reservation serves as Notice upon all administrative agencies of government, federal, state and lo - cal, that I do not, and will not, accept the liability associated with the compelled benefit of any unrevealed commercial agreement.” Once you make a plea, you’re under their jurisdiction. Entering a “not guilty” plea in a civil matter is admitting to the existence of the unpaid bill. “You are not refusing to enter a plea, but merely wishing to understand the basis of the charge (debt) before pleading, which is why you are insisting on a presentment under UCC 3-505 without dishonor. Tell the judge, on the record, that you require such presentment to determine your plea.” “ It is an elementary rule of pleading, that a plea to the jurisdiction is the first in the order of pleading, and that any plea which refers to the court any other question, is a tacit admission that the court has a right to judge in the cause, and is a waiver to all exceptions to the jurisdiction.” - 242 -"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Challenge Jurisdiction Before Pleading —Birty vs. Logan, 6 Bush Ky. 8 COURT: The judge will read you the charges and penalties involved. He/she will ask if you understand. You must say: CITIZEN: “I understand what you have said and the penalty involved. I understand the words you have used and the meaning of those words. But I do not understand how the subject matter or the penalty can possibly apply to me.” COURT: The judge will ask you to plea (guilty or not guilty). Do not plea. Once you plea, or the court pleas for you, then jurisdiction is assumed. This is where you challenge the court’s jurisdiction. You must say: CITIZEN: “Your honor, I cannot enter a plea as I desire to challenge the jurisdiction of this court and am now asking this court to set a jurisdictional hearing. Until jurisdiction is proven, once challenged, no plea can be accepted.” COURT: If the judge enters a plea you must object. CITIZEN: “I object to the court entering a plea because I desire to challenge the jurisdiction of the court, and until jurisdiction is proven, once challenged, no pleas can be accepted. The court is not permitted to accept a plea until jurisdiction is settled.” COURT: If the judge denies motion to dismiss. CITIZEN: “I object, the court has done nothing on the record to prove that the court has jurisdiction.” COURT: The judge may say, the statute says...blah, blah, blah. You must object. CITIZEN: “I object. I have not filed any arguments. I have not made any legal arguments. I have merely made a motion and that is why I want the hearing so we can settle this issue of jurisdiction. Then I can file my formal motion. All I have done is challenge the jurisdiction. Now that I know the charges, I am asking the court to set a hearing, plain and simple, set a date and we will have the jurisdictional hearing. If jurisdiction is proven, then I will go on and plea.” COURT: As a last resort, if the judge persists and assigns a plea then you must say: CITIZEN: “I object. If this court proceeds with entering a plea on my behalf without first establishing jurisdiction for the record, then this court is doing so under a hidden, statutory jurisdiction with an unrevealed contract known only to the secret society of the State Bar Association.” If this doesn’t get the case dismissed, then demand a “Writ of Mandamus,” which is a request to have the case reviewed by a superior court. Writ Of Mandamus Step 5: Jurisdictional Hearing File your “Statement” with the court prior to the hearing. Then prepare for an interesting exchange between yourself and the magistrate or judge. Sample Jurisdictional Hearing 6 COURT: The judge will say, “How do you challenge jurisdiction?” You can say. CITIZEN: “Your honor, I have some questions concerning the nature of the action that I don’t understand. (6th Amendment) Is the action against me civil or criminal? COURT: It’s a criminal action. He/she won’t say civil, otherwise it would go to federal court. CITIZEN: “Your honor, the Constitution authorizes two criminal jurisdictions for the court. One of these is Common law . But under the Common law there must be a corpus delecti or damaged party before the court can recognize any jurisdiction. This cannot be a Common law action because there is no sworn complaint from a damaged party. Therefore this court does not have a criminal jurisdiction under Common law.” (If the judge replies that this is a Common law court, then demand a “Bill of Particulars.”) “The only other criminal jurisdiction authorized for the court is the breech of an International Maritime Contract under the criminal aspects of an Admiralty jurisdiction. I’m not aware of having ever entered any maritime contracts, so I deny that any exist. Can you tell me what jurisdiction the court is exercising in the action against me?” COURT: The judge may reply: “It’s a statutory jurisdiction.” Statutory = Admiralty / Maritime = Military / Martial Law CITIZEN: “Your honor, I’ve never heard of that jurisdiction, and the Constitution doesn’t mention any such jurisdiction. Please, where can I obtain the published rules for the criminal procedure for statutory jurisdiction? (There aren’t any, of course.) COURT: The judge might be mad or upset and refuse to practice law from the bench or give advice. CITIZEN: “Let the record show that the courts have authority to conduct a criminal action under a secret jurisdiction that is known only to the courts and licensed attorneys, thereby denying the defendant the right to defend in his own person.” “I am appealing the legal determination made by this court that it can conduct criminal action under a statutory jurisdiction, and in my appeal, I am naming you, your honor, as witness in my favor, and I’ll issue a subpoena duces tecum, in which you will be required to bring a copy of the rules of criminal proceedings in a statutory jurisdiction when you enter the appeals court.” “And I am subpoenaing the Prosecuting Attorney as my witness to the fact that the judge said...blah, blah.” > SUBPOENA — command to appear at a certain time and place to give testimony on a certain matter; subpoena duces tecum requires the production of books, papers and others things.

The jurisdictional issue, or lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be argued in virtually every case, state or federal. Wrongful jurisdiction is always a basis for appeal until the issue of distinguishing judicial power from legislative power, the Common law versus the commercial sides of the court is properly adjudicated. The separation of powers is paramount in a constitutio-nal republic. The problem is that the courts are not pres-ently accountable to the law or enforcing these doctrines. Wrongful prosecution and the misapplication of a com- mercial statute upon a private, sovereign individual is common in all the cases we've seen. Americans are being compelled into a contract without knowledge or consent. > MINOR PREMISE — a concurrent or joint resolu-tion of the legislature is not law, and neither are statutes. > MAJOR PREMISE — only a properly convened grand jury can indict and convict a sovereign. Nisi prius rules of Civil Law are repugnant to state and national constitutions; the key concern is the exercise of non-jurisdictional authority via way of Title I courts of the United States; Title 1 courts have been incompetent at law since Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64-92. > NISI PRIUS — a trial held for the issue of facts before a jury and presiding judge; no issues of law raised; jury judging the facts not the law. The jurisdiction of Title 1 courts of the United States operating as nisi prius courts under Title IV authority, is specifically articulated at 18 USC §7(3), which prescribes the inland (within the state republics) special United States territorial and maritime jurisdiction. Within the state republics, this foreign corporation, the United States Government, has jurisdiction only on federal enclaves such as forts, magazines, dock yards, and other needful buildings where state legislatures have ceded jurisdiction (or participated in federal funding or mandates). FRCP, Rule 54 defines “Act of Congress” as being specifically applicable only to the District of Columbia and within other United States territorial jurisdiction. Aside from everything else, the 11th Amendment precludes jurisdiction of United States courts within the states. Within the framework of the Sovereign Immunities Act, the de jure people, Citizens of the state republics, are states in fact where the geographical United States is concerned. “ Non-Constitutional,” Not “Unconstitutional” Law State District and Circuit Courts operate as legislative courts to effect “nonconstitutional” law, not “unconstitu-tional” law. The federal State and United States code law is in - 244 -"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Challenging “Statutory” Jurisdiction derogation rather than abrogation of constitutional and common law indigenous to the state republics. If any given statute abrogates the Common law, it changes it. However, the statute which is in derogation of Common law operates outside Common law, inclusive of the constitutions, without materially affecting or altering it. 7 §1-103 Supplementary General Principles of Law Applicable Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mis - take, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provision. For example, Note 6 for § 1-103 of the UCC states that the Code “complements,” not replaces constitutional or com - mon law. The constitution and Common law is black, and the code is white occupying the circle. AmJur, 2nd edition under the subheading “conflict of law,” it was discovered that non-constitutional code law accom - modates private international law. However, when non-con - stitutional law is confronted with constitutional and com - mon law, statutory code law must yield or fall if it conflicts with constitutional and Common law indige-nous to the state republic. Non-constitutional statutory law remains non-constitutional so long as it yields to or is corrected by constitutional and Common law. It becomes unconstitutional when it is imposed on sovereign rather than subject classes, or when it is challenged on con - stitutional grounds and the court does not concede under the mandate for judicial notice of constitutional and Com - mon law. If an original action in law is filed in any given county (with - in the proper framework of Common law), the appeal route is through the state supreme Court (i.e., state Supreme court) which has original jurisdiction at law or in equity and subsequently the law side of the supreme Court of the united states of America. 8 In other words, state (or federal State) district or circuit courts do not have a Common law capacity, they operate ex - clusively as nisi prius courts of the de facto federal State un - der Title IV authority of the United States. Appeals on the Civil side of the court would be to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Magna Charta is the first cornerstone of the Common law. Title 1 courts have been incompetent at law since Erie Railroad vs. Tompkins. The supreme Court declared that there is no general Com - mon law in the United States, thus acquiescing to the per - petual emergency declared March 9, 1933. The U.S. supreme Court retains original jurisdiction at law under Rule 17 and other rules and statutes of the U.S.C. Modern codified Civil Law dates to the British Judicial Act of 1873. Codes of civil and criminal procedure, the uniform fair debt collection act, state income tax codes, the Uniform Federal Tax Lien Filing Act, traffic codes, state health and welfare laws, divorce and child support laws, the UCC, and a bevy of other code legis - lation all presume that the state republics are federal States to the detriment of the population at large and particularly the sovereign “state” Citizens of their respective state re - publics. 9 Imposition of fines, incarceration, and other penalties for non-performance and various alleged crimes are premised on the presumption of a contractual obligation to some higher federal authority and their principals. On nearly all legal documents generated by courts and other government institutions, a fictitious corporate “person” is created by capitalizing all letters in the name, (i.e., JOHNNY LIBERTY) in order to perpetuate the fraud and deception and steal the lawful character of the sovereign who would otherwise be entitled to existing rights and remedies preserved in the Common law under their Christian name. A few obvious constitutional and Common law principles condemn closing courts to “choice of counsel” by granting exclusive domain to bar-licensed attorneys, members of the club subject to the court in the same manner as other government employees. Within the framework of Common law, the term “counsel” includes both attorneys at law and non-attorney counselors of law. The exclusive domain of attorneys in both state and federal courts is the representation of dependent and incompetent persons--corporate entities that exist by consent of government, their agencies or indigents. Right to counsel of choice is maintained by the constitutions and Common law. The nisi prius court is legislative rather than a judicial court. It poses a special problem for the judges who operate in a ministerial rather than a judicial capacity. A magistrate cannot deprive the de jure people of life, liberty or property without effecting a Bill of Attainder. Legislative and administrative branches of government cannot pass then enforce laws against the de jure people. This kind of justice is condemned by the Separation of Powers Doctrine as well as being repugnant to principles of Common law. This perverse system of peonage could be peacefully corrected in short order if those who hold legislative, judicial and enforcement offices would simply comply with the law when constitutional and Common law are presented in opposition to statutory law. But history teaches us well, that wealth, power and privilege are never voluntarily surrendered. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act Editor’s Note: According to Joe Stevens, invoking the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act has been effective in some cases for the sovereign American arguing immunity from prosecution in a statutory jurisdiction. If you consider that the American National and/or sovereign “state” Citizen has the judicial capacity to create a government, and the sovereign state republic is a foreign state, then the argument follows. The American legislator has taken an early incentive to draft a national statute on foreign sovereign immunity. The “Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA)” was for a large part the merit of Monroe Leigh, a Washington D.C. based international lawyer and at that time legal advisor of the Department of State. Not only was the FSIA carefully drafted, but there is valuable additional - 245 -"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook information to be found on the interpretation of the Act in the House Report that reads as follows: New chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code, starts from a premise of immunity and then creates exceptions to the general principle. The chapter is thus cast in a manner consistent with the way in which the law of sovereign immunity has developed. Stating the basic principle in terms of immunity may be of some advantage to foreign states in doubtful cases, but, since sovereign immunity is an affirmative defense which must be specially pleaded, the burden will remain on the foreign state to produce evidence that a foreign state or one of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities is the defendant in the suit and that the plaintiff’s claim relates to a public act of the foreign state — that is, an act not within the exceptions in sections 1605-1607. Once the foreign state has produced such prima facie evidence of immunity, the burden of going forward would shift to the plaintiff to produce evidence establishing that the foreign state is not entitled to immunity. The ultimate burden of proving immunity would rest with the foreign state.” This passage of the House Report shows that foreign sovereign immunity has been drafted as an affirmative defense which has to be specifically pleaded. This would imply that the persuasive burden as to the existence of the facts determining sovereign immunity (i.e. the non-applicability of the exceptions to immunity, drafted in the Act) is on the foreign state. As a result, the foreign state would also be charged with the evidential burden, the burden of going forward with the evidence, at the beginning of the trial. This means in practice that the foreign state would have to produce a prima facie case with regard to the following facts: i. that it is a foreign state according to §§1603(a),(b) FSIA, and; ii. that the activity which is in question, was of a public, governmental nature. After production of such proof by the foreign state, the evidential burden would shift to the plaintiff so that he proofs the applicability of one of the exceptions to immunity (§§ 1605-1607). When this proof fails, the court must grant immunity to the foreign state because of the general rule of immunity, established in the FSIA. Article I, Court Actions and Motions Strategies for a number of lawsuits are being developed to prepare the sovereign “state” Citizen for necessary legal action to remove the hurdles the government erects to discourage those who dare to exercise their unalienable and constitutional rights. There are strategies to challenge the unlawful “occupation taxes” being imposed upon all sovereign “state” Citizens in a bureaucratic scheme to extort revenue. This tax is imposed upon all Citizens through the drivers license and vehicle registration fees. These licenses are, by legislative act, for drivers who are operators of commercial vehicles only, not for Citizens traveling by right, freely from place to place. The government has been complicit in constructive fraud by permitting this abuse to go unabated for years. Refuse all your citations and presentments for fraud, without dishonor, pursuant to the UCC 3-501, then present them a notice of default, until your pro se litigation is ready to go to trial. Properly done, this admits evidence into the case record that can later be used for an appeal, a cross-claim or cross-libel in admiralty, or a Title 42§§§1983, 1985, 1986 civil rights action brought in the district court of the united States in a Common law venue and jurisdiction. The proper and appropriate use of “Non-Statutory Abatements” can also estoppel an action against you by challenging the improper paperwork or insufficient process of any of the emergency and war powers courts. If you are unable to afford the filing fees or court costs, you can file a “Petition in Forma Poperis.” This is for a pauper needing access to the legal system without paying the fees up front. If you lose the case, you won’t be asked to pay court costs. But remember that a sovereign cannot be a “pauper” with - out compromising your status. You must be economically sovereign as well as legally and politically sovereign.

The right to counsel is a fundamental right and must be defended in the courts of this land today. The American Bar Association monopoly over judges, attorneys and other officers of the court has left the Citizen defenseless in his/her own land without the continued and necessary assertion of this right. Know this. This right to counsel of choice is protected by the Constitution for the united States of America, specifically the First Article of the Bill of Rights, in the matter of freedom of speech, the right to assemble peaceably, and the right to petition the Government for redress of grievance. It is also specifically secured to We the People at the Fifth Article of the Bill of Rights concerning due process of law, and again at the Sixth Article of the Bill of Rights. As in the doctrine of the Ninth Article of the Bill of Rights, the fact that the Sixth Article of the Bill of Rights secures a right to counsel in all criminal matters cannot be construed to deny that right, to say nothing of the right to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government, and to defend one’s life, liberty, and property in the courts. Any rule of procedure for the court is there precisely to guarantee due process of law to private Citizens, as a matter of right. You can require that the court apply no laws that would abrogate your rights, and that the court answer to its duty to guarantee due process of law in all proceedings. You can contend on good authority (the Constitution for the united States of America and supreme Court standing case law) that the legislature cannot violate your right to counsel of choice, as such act would be unconstitutional. “ The court by common law had no power t o admit an attorney ...to practice.. . It was the policy of th e common law, in order that suits might no t multiply and increase, that both plaintiff an d defendant appear in person ... the justices coul d not permit a person to appear by attorney, th e king, by the plenitude of his prerogative, migh t appoint an attorney, and give any person a righ t to appear in this manner... ” —Ricker's Petition , Strafford, June 1890. Furthermore, the Oregon State Bar Association (or any other State Bar Association) is nothing more than a private club, is not any form of state agency, does not speak for the state and does not act for the state and has no power to control the lives of private Citizens. The whole fraud about only permitted “licensed” attorneys in a court is a sham. It was held that a state may NOT pass statutes prohibiting the “unauthorized practice of law” or interfere with the right to freedom of speech, secured in the first Amendment. 11 The terms “attorney” and “counsel” are Common Law terms and: “ It has been held, and is undoubtedly the law, that, where Common law phrases are used in an indictment or information, such phrases must have Common law interpretation.” —Chapman vs People, 39 Mich. 357-359; in re Richter (D.C.) 100 Fed. 295-297. The meaning of the Common law terms is quite clear and the term “Assistance of Counsel” does not necessarily mean that “Counsel” will be a licensed attorney. A licensed attorney may be a counselor behind the bar, but all counselors may not be licensed attorneys: “ An attorney-at-law ...is one who is put in the place, stead, or turn of another, to manage his matters of law.... An officer in the supreme court of the United States, and in some other courts, who is employed by a party in a cause, to conduct the same on its trial on his behalf. He differs from an attorney at law.” —Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, 3rd edition.(q.v.) In the supreme court of the United States, the two degrees of attorney and counsel are kept separate, and no person is permitted to practice both. It is the duty of the counsel to draft or review and correct the special pleadings, to manage the cause on trial, and, during the whole course of the suit, to apply established principles of law to the exigencies of the case. —1 Kent, Com. 307 (emphasis added). The right to counsel of choice was once well understood to be the “right” of the people as defined in the “Will of the Sovereign People's” Constitution. No governmental entity was ever given power, responsibility or authority, by the “Will of the Sovereign People,” to take such a “right” away, especially not to give it to a private orga - nization which is not part of the state government, which operates a monopolistic “club” for the exclusive benefit of its members and to the detriment of Citizens of this state. The Founding Fathers sought to specifically secure the right to counsel of choice in all criminal matters, and did not think it wise or proper to write in the words, “counsel of a - 247 -"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook licensed attorney,” and because the words “licensed attorney” do not appear in the Constitution, no court can insist that only licensed attorneys can be counsel. It is still an unarguable fact that the Constitution for the united States of America is the supreme law of the land, and that the Constitutions embody the “common law of God” which the judges in every court have sworn a hallowed oath to uphold. “ If the state should deprive a person the benefit of counsel, it would not be due process of law.” —Powell v Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 70. Furthermore it was decided in Argersinger v. Hamlin, that no defendant may be deprived of liberty, or put into jail in any case in which he/she was denied counsel of choice.” The right of an indigent defendant in a criminal trial to the assistance of counsel, which is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, is not governed by the classification of the offense or by whether or not a jury trial is required. No accused may be deprived of his liberty as the result of any criminal prosecution, whether felony or misdemeanor, in which he was denied the assistance of counsel. In this case, the Supreme Court of Florida erred in holding that petitioner, an indigent who was tried for an offense punishable by imprisonment up to six months, a $1,000 fine, or both, and given a 90-day jail sentence, had no right to court-appointed counsel, on the ground that the right extends only to trials 'for non-petty offenses punishable by more than six months imprisonment.” 12 Challenging Oaths of Office All elected officials owe an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Otherwise their office is a fraud under American law. Citizens must take the law into their own hands and challenge the oaths of office of all elected representatives, public officials, police officers (e.g., U.S. Marshals have not vowed to protect the Constitution, but the interests of the creditors of the United States). Although many states do not require the oaths of office to be filed, federal law does provide a filing requirement. Supreme Court justices are required to make an oath or affirmation and file that oath. Pro tem judges and lawyers serving as judges have the same oath as the county judges even though there are no more county judges, but county commissioners instead. County commissioners are required to take an oath of affirmation. Most elected officials have not legally filed their oaths of allegiance with the County Recorder or the State Records Department, although they are required by law. The reason they do not is that their office routinely violates their oath of allegiance and thus they’d be perjuring themselves by their daily actions against the united states of America. U.S. judges are required to take a double oath in order to get their coveted job. The Judicial Act of 1789 contains the lawful oath required of all federal judges. 13 If their allegiance is not to the Constitution, or serving the interests of the American people, then you best find out who their allegiance is to. You’ll be surprised. For those still voting, elect a responsible judiciary and representatives that will appoint officers willing to restore the constitutional republic. Citizens must at every opportunity challenge the lies and deception, the masking and concealing of the criminal element in government, the law-breakers and treasonous politicians who have violated the public trust, the Constitution and common sense morality. All must be brought to justice, whether they are socialist- Democrats or socialist-Republicans. Blatant disrespect and violations of the American law must not be tolerated. Citizens must stand up and fight such individuals or institutions, and support the “law of the land,” otherwise the law has no standing. This takes great courage and I honor anyone who finds they have the perseverance and guts to face the lions preying in the courtroom today. Sheriff Richard Mack has set legal precedent by being the first sheriff in the country to publicly reaffirm his commitment to his sworn oath to uphold the Constitution. Most public officials are in direct violation of 4 U.S.C. §101 and 102 having either not performed their duty and obligation to uphold the Constitution, or have not recorded or certified their oath of office. It is up to We the People to make the government accountable to the law, and to bring criminal charges against them if they fail to perform their duties. “ Every member of a State legislature, and every executive and judicial officer of a State, before he proceeds to execute the duties of his office, take an oath in the following form, to wit: I, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States.” —4 U.S.C. §101 Oath by members of legislatures and officers. 14 “ Such oath may be administered by any person who, by law of the State, is authorized to administer the oath of office; and the person so administering such oath shall cause a record or certificate thereof to be made in the same manner, as by the law of the State, he is directed to record or certify the oath of office.” —4 U.S.C. §101 Same; by whom administered. 15 Here’s an excerpt from an “Oath of Office” for United States Judges pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C. §454 (first oath) and Title 5, U.S.C. §2231 (second oath). - 248 -"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Challenging Oaths of Office “I, John B.

So help me God.” Original 13 th Amendment Arguments The “original 13 th Amendment” had in fact been ratified prior to the Civil War by thirteen states, enough for ratification, and was published in the official copies of the Constitution for the usA throughout the united states. Over 30 or more official publications from Maine to Colorado contained the “original 13 th Amendment.” That it suddenly “disappeared” and was replaced with another 13 th Amendment is now a matter of historical and legal fact. It has been hypothesized that the unrevealed motive behind the War of 1812 was to delay the ratification efforts of the sovereign states regarding this “missing”, original 13 th Amendment,” and destroy the records. 16 A book published in New Hampshire in 1840 by Joseph Coe was certified by a special act of Congress, as having the original Constitution for the usA with the original 13 th Amendment. This copy is prima facie evidence of the original 13 th Amendment having passed. David Dodge and Brian Marsh have a certified copy of an un-catalogued book from the archives of the State of Virginia, also found to have the original, 13 th Amendment in it. Virginia was the 13 th state required to ratify the original 13 th Amendment. There is also evidence that the issue has come before the supreme Court at least 4 times. It cannot be used as precedent because the corporate United States government has ordered the cases sealed. This original 13 th Amendment can be presented in any court of law as a challenge to the legal fraternity who have all accepted a Title of Nobility. Attorneys-at-Law and Esquire are Titles of Nobility, thus cannot hold public office, nor are they Citizens of the United States. If the missing 13 th Amendment were restored, “special interests” and “honors” would be rendered unconstitutional. This could compel the entire government to operate under the same laws as the Citizens are expected to obey. Without their current individual immunities, government officials would be unable to abuse common Citizens without fear of legal liability. Imagine a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Imagine a government truly accountable to the people, that could not systematically exploit its own people. Imagine a government without attorneys. 17 Article III, Court Actions and Motions These are perhaps the most profound legal strategies to have been developed since the original republic of the united states of America. Most litigators and Citizens have forgotten the separation of powers doctrines and that all state courts have the capacity to operate on either an Article I or Article III capacity AND federal courts have the capacity to operate in Article III or Article IV capacity. Not all courts are the same. One side is the Common law side in its Article III capacity. The other side is the Equity/Admiralty or what’s called the Statutory side in its Article I or Article IV capacity. So for example, when most people think of taking something to federal court, they automatically think — “U.S. District Court.” Correct, if you want to bring an action before the Equity/ Admiralty or Statutory side of the court in its Article IV capacity. This is a territorial court (e.g., like Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States). Wrong, if you have any issues of law at stake, or you are operating in a sovereign capacity in a “state.” There are NO issues of law EVER presented before that side of the court. They have no jurisdiction in law, nor do the judges have the capacity to judge the law. Article I judges can only judge facts. In fact, as Dan Meador has so eloquently proved, U.S. Magistrates have the judicial authority of nothing more than a park ranger. 18 If you must raise an issue of law, then you must invoke the Common law side of the court (state or federal) and in the case of a federal action bring it in the “district court of the united states” in its Article III Common law capacity, not its Article IV Territorial capacity. The supreme Court and Congress, both exercising their respective Constitutionally granted authority, established by rules, law and the operation of power vested in Congress at Articles I, III and IV of the Constitution for the united states, have created courts of the United States deriving authority from distinct and different Constitutional grants of power or jurisdiction, with each court duly authorized to exercise its judicial power ONLY within separate jurisdictions. In Mookini v. United States, 303 US 201 the supreme Court examined the application of rules and the statute authorizing the court to promulgate rules for United States courts. In the published opinion in Mookini supra, the court held that: “No provision was made with respect to proceedings in cases brought in the District Courts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone and Virgin Islands, in the Supreme Courts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, or in the United States Court for China.... The statute contains no requirement that the Court must prescribe identical rules with respect to all the courts mentioned regardless of varying conditions, or that rules for all these courts must be prescribed at one and the same time.” Note that the list of courts specifically excludes the “district courts” in any of the 48 states (Mookini was decided February 28, 1938). The U.S. supreme Court did hold that - 249 -"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook courts of the territories were capable of being distinguished from courts in the states. “ The term “District Courts of the United States,” as used in the rules, without an addition expressing a wider connotation, has its historic significance.” — Mookini v. U.S., 303 US 201, 205 The supreme Court thereby stated that the definition or distinction of a “district court” was not being invented (or coined) for the Mookini case, but instead that the definition of the courts was firmly rooted in history, the law and the Constitution. The court went on to hold that: “It [referring to the term “District Courts of the United States”] describes the Constitutional courts created under Article III of the Constitution. Courts of the Territories are legislative courts, properly speaking, and ARE NOT District Courts of the United States. We have often held that vesting a territorial court with jurisdiction similar to that vested in the District Courts of the United States DOES NOT make it a “District Court of the United States.”—Reynolds v. United States; The City of Panama; In re Mills; McAllister v. United States; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation; Summers v. United States; United States v. Burroughs, (cites omitted) [Emphasis added.] Not only did the promulgating order use the term District Courts of the United States in its historic and proper sense, but the omission of provision for the application of the rules to the territorial courts and other courts mentioned in the authorizing act clearly shows the limitation that was intended. The Mookini holding is clear and unequivocal. There are two courts. It is further clear from the court’s holdings that the aforesaid two courts have differing Constitutional origins. One, the “district court of the united states” is the true Constitutional Court authorized by Article III of the Constitution, and the other is a court of the Territories, deriving its authority from the language of Article IV which makes the latter court a territorial court — a “legis-lative” creation, rather than a true Constitutional one. Courts created by Congress under Constitutional authority at Article I section 8, clause 17, or Article IV section 3, clause 2 are certainly courts, but the jurisdiction and venue of said courts differs from the “Constitutional” courts which are authorized by Article III of said Constitution. In a very well articulated case, O’Donoghue v. United States, 289 US 516, the Court was required to rule on the Constitutional issues surrounding whether all federal Court judges were covered by the Constitutional provision in Article III that a judge’s compensation cannot be reduced during the time the judge holds office. The supreme Court, in making its determination, succinctly explained the difference between legislative territorial courts and true Article III Constitutional courts. > TERRITORY— U.S.C.S. Article III §2 cl. 1 at case note #91: Territory is not state within meaning of that term as used in Art. III, §2 cl. 1 (cite omitted). One of these issues was whether the courts established by Congress in the District of Columbia were to be considered as exercising the Article III judicial power of the United States. “The granting to the courts of the District [of Columbia] of an extensive jurisdiction in purely national matters establishes their status as courts of the United States and their exercise of judicial power under Article III of the Constitution.” “There is a vast distinction between jurisdiction and judicial power. The former may be granted, qualified or taken away at the will of Congress....But after having created an inferior court of the United States and defined the subjects over which it shall have jurisdiction, Congress cannot limit the exercise of judicial power, because that comes directly from the Constitution and is not derived from Congress.” 19 The foregoing sets forth and explains the fact that judicial power is exercised in all courts, regardless of their Constitutional origin, but jurisdiction is determined by Congress, not by the court (since the “venue jurisdiction” of the courts is different). Further, in the holding of the court, when the jurisdiction as set by Congress was that of an Article III court, the Judicial Power of the United States was given by the Constitution and could not be limited, constrained or otherwise imposed upon by Congress. The converse would, of course NOT be true: i.e., Congress could control (or at least limit) the exercise of authority in tribunals established to administer the laws of the Territory or in courts established under the authority of Congress at Article I, section 8, clause 17. The O’Donoghue case went on to argue that there were clear historical, contextual and constitutional distinctions between courts of the territories and courts which extend the judicial power of the United States through and from Article III of said Constitution: “ The constitutional provisions in question must be construed in the light of their history and of the development of our institutions, and not without reference to the distinction which has so clearly been drawn between constitutional and legislative courts.” — O’Donoghue, supra at page 523. The exercise of judicial power is not a characteristic which distinguishes one court from another, see paragraph 3 above and again from the O’Donoghue case: “ The exercise of judicial power is common to both legislative and constitutional courts, and determines the status of neither. —Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 US 438, 449” O’Donoghue, supra at page 524. It is, however, the “nature” of the judicial power which is determinate of the status of any court. - 250 -"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Article III, Court Actions and Motions Justice Sutherland, in delivering the opinion of the court in the O’Donoghue case, restated the intent of the Founding Fathers to establish a judiciary which could and would effect its work unconstrained by influences from either of the other two branches of government: an issue of paramount importance in distinguishing between the jurisdictions of two or more courts created by Congressional authority; e.g., the “United States District Court,” a court of the Territories, and the “district courts of the united states,” courts of true Constitutional authority pursuant to Article III of the Constitution. The court held: “[I]t will materially assist us in arriving at a correct determination if we shall first consider the great underlying purpose which the framers of the Constitution had in mind and which led them to incorporate in that instrument the provision in respect of the permanent tenure of office and the undiminishable character of the compensation of the judges.” “The Constitution, in distributing the powers of government, creates three distinct and separate departments — the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. This separation is not merely a matter of convenience or of governmental mechanism. Its object is basic and vital, Springer v. Philippine Islands, 277 US 189, 201, namely, to preclude a co-mingling of these essentially different powers of government in the same hands. And this object is none the less apparent and controlling because there is to be found in the Constitution an occasional specific provision conferring upon a given department certain functions, which, by their nature, would otherwise fall within the general scope of the powers of another. Such exceptions serve rather to emphasize the generally inviolate character of the plan.” —O’Donoghue, supra at pages 529, 530. Justice Sutherland and the court went to great pains to clearly describe and explain to us for all time, why it is so very important to distinguish between Article III Judges (with undiminishable compensation) and judges of other courts, and why it was that the Founders of our country and our country’s government were explicit and clear about the function and distinctions: In framing the Constitution, therefore, the power to diminish the compensation of the federal judges was explicitly denied, in order that their judgment or action might never be swayed in the slightest degree by the temptation to cultivate the favor or avoid the displeasure of that department which, as master of the purse, would otherwise hold the power to reduce their means of support. The high importance of the provision, as the contemporary history shows, was definitely pointed out by the leading statesmen of the time. Thus, in The Federalist, No. 78, Hamilton said — “The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.” And, in No. 79 — “Next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. . . .In the general course of human nature, a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.” Chief Justice Marshall, in the course of the debates of the Virginia State Convention of 1829-1830 (p. 616, 619), used the following strong and frequently quoted language: “The Judicial Department comes home in its effects to every man’s fireside; it passes on his property, his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not, to the last degree, important that he [the judge] should be rendered perfectly and completely independent, with no other to influence or control him but God, and his conscience? I have always thought, from my earliest youth till now, that the greatest scourge an angry Heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and sinning people, was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary.” 20 The court went on to state the obvious: that diminution could occur in different forms: “Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and other indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition. Nothing short of this will give full effect to its spirit and principle.” 21 And then the court went on to state: “In the light of the fore - going views, — time honored and never discredited — it is not extravagant to say that there rests upon every federal judge affected nothing less than a duty to withstand any at - tempt, directly or indirectly in contravention of the Consti - tution, to diminish this compensation, not for his private ad - vantage — which, if that were all, he might willingly forego — but in the interest of preserving unimpaired an essential safeguard adopted as a continuing guaranty of an indepen - dent judicial administration for the benefit of the whole peo - ple.” 22 Because of the high (some might even characterize it as extreme) degree of importance to have an independent judiciary, it is equally important to note that the court carefully considered which portions of the Federal Judiciary were to be protected by the letter and spirit of the Constitutional provision against reduction of a judge’s salary during his tenure at the bench, and why there was a difference between courts. “This court has repeatedly held that the territorial courts are legislative courts, created in virtue of the national sovereignty or under Article IV section 3 clause 2 of the Constitution, vesting in Congress the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States”; and that they are not invested with any part of the judicial power defined in the third article of the Constitution. And this rule, as it affects the territories, is no longer open to question.” 23 That congress has the authority to create courts “inferior” to the Supreme Court cannot be held to doubt; it is ONLY the extent and exercise of the authority of courts which determines whether they are true “constitutional” courts or courts of the territories or courts created by virtue of Congressional authority at Article I, section 8 clause 17. The inquiry as to the judicial authority and the extent and - 251 -"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook exercise thereof in the various “federal” courts has been examined many times by the Supreme Court: “The authority upon which all the later cases rest is American Insurance Co. v.

The pertinent question there was whether the judicial power of the United States described in Article III of the Constitution vested in the superior courts of the Ter-ritory of Florida and it was answered in the negative.” 24 And the Marshall court in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, went on to declare: “The Courts [the territorial courts], then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3rd article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States.” 25 [Sample Header Court Action] 4 U.S.C.A. §1 In the district court for the united states District of Colorado (Denver) In its Article III Common Law Capacity Johnny, Liberty ex. rel., Proper Party Plaintiff, vs. Big Bad Wolf, et. al., all in private capacity Defendants Incorporated Case No. 96-B-2558 BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a)(b) MOTION TO STRIKE AND CORRECT THE RECORD and BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF Fed.R.Civ.P. 27 PERPETUATION OF TESTIMONY A Common Law Action brought under Article III of the Constitution for the united States Trial by Jury Pursuant to the 7th Article of the Bill of Rights Endorsed Hereon American Flag of Peace Editor’s Note: Thanks to Tim Richardson for the following research and documentation in it’s entirety. The “U.S. District Court” uses the symbol of the flag of the executive branch of government, the President of the united states of America, a symbol which is codified nowhere in the laws of the United States, except in a Military handbook at section 840 Chapters A and B, sections 1 & 2. Also see 34 Opinion of the Attorney General number 483 (1925) wherein diligent study and investigation by the proper party plaintiff finds that the President, in his capacity as Commander- in-chief of the military is authorized to define and use the gold-fringed flag. Said gold-fringed flag is not authorized by any other codification or operation of law, act, or resolution of Congress, or the Constitution and does not symbolize the civil authority of the government of the union of states. Only the flag described in the law at 4 U.S.C. §1 is authorized for use by the civil authority of government. Since symbols such as the flag are such powerful conveyances of information, and since there is no authorization for a gold-fringed flag in the Constitution or in the laws made pursuant thereto (outside of the Executive military power), and since the proper party plaintiff did specifically incorporate this case under the “American Flag of Peace,” and under the venue jurisdiction of the Article III “constitutional” court, which are described in the laws of the United States pursuant to the Constitution, the Proper Party Plaintiff is standing firmly within the law and the rights guaranteed to the Proper Party Plaintiff by the Constitution, and the Proper Party Plaintiff hereby requires that all future pleadings in this matter address themselves under the “American Flag of Peace” and further that any other symbols of “foreign jurisdiction” be banned from the venue jurisdiction of this action. Examination of Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 1 of the US Code, reveals that this law has been duly enacted by the Congress of the United States and is positive law, and the aforementioned section defines the flag of the United States to be of: three colors, red, white, and blue. 36 U.S.C. §176 of the Code states that, “the flag should never have placed upon it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.” Thus we have the law of the United States stating in clear terms, that the “gold-fringed” flag IS NOT a proper flag of the United States. The law of the flag: “In maritime law: it is the law of that nation or country whose flag is flown. On a ship or government office or in a courtroom or wherever it is displayed gives notice by this flag to all who enter into contracts with the master that he intends the law of that flag to regulate such contracts, and that they must either submit to its operation or not contract with him.” 26 Civil Rights Actions: Title 42 U.S.C. §1983 These statutes create a cause of action against any individual or person who, acting under color of state law, abridges rights created by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. It was originally passed by Congress as a part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. It does not create federal court jurisdiction but a cause of action, a legal entitlement to relief, against those who, acting pursuant to state government authority and the Common practices or policy of various state agencies, violate federal law. You must prove that it was the custom and policy of the state government authority or state agencies to violate your rights. Other applicable statutes include Title 42 U.S.C.§1985, Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, Title 42 U.S.C.§1986, Action for neglect to prevent conspiracy, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Organization Act (RICO) statutes. 87 - 252 -"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Civil Rights Actions: Title 42 U.S.C. §1983 \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any, subjects or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\" —Title 42 U.S.C. §1983 27 When federal officials violate a person's civil rights they are said to be acting under color of federal law. They can be sued pursuant to the Bivens Doctrine. 28 The jurisdiction to hear this action exists under 28 U.S.C. §1331 and 28 U.S.C. §1343 (a)(3). These sections grant jurisdiction to redress violations of federal laws that provide for the equal rights of citizens. Immunity To overcome the defendants claim of qualified immunity and the immunity defenses raised by government entities in a “Motion to Dismiss,” the plaintiff must sufficiently plead: 1) that under the circumstances the reasonable person would have known that the conduct violated well established law; 2) that the conduct was in accordance with the entity’s policy and custom; 3) that in the case of a single occurrence, the conduct was initiated by or acquiesced to by a final policy maker with respect to that particular conduct; 4) that the defendants conduct violates rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States; and 5) that the violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s damages. This is the point in the proceedings where evidence can be entered into the court record regarding the oaths of alle - giance and oaths of office, and the lack thereof, of the indi - viduals claiming government immunity from prosecution. “ Immunity did not protect a state official who was acting under an unconstitutional state law or who was exceeding his properly granted authority.” —Osborn vs. Bank of the U.S., 9 Wheat 738 (1824) Often federal officials, including members of the U.S. Congress and the justices of the U.S. supreme Court, will argue their defense solely on the position that they were immune from the consequences of their acts, including the consequences of their refusal to perform a duty. These arguments of government immunity have in effect placed federal officials above and outside the law. Thus they are protected from criminal prosecution and the government corruption continues unabated. These are the mentalities that permit inflicting massive harm upon the public, and irresponsibility on behalf of the government to be accountable to the law. The legal fraternities position was, and is still today, that federal officials, judges and members of Congress could engage in outright criminal acts of cover-up, misprision of felonies, obstruction of justice, and be immune from the consequences. Even the U.S. supreme Court Justices when personally sued for violation of rights under color of federal law argued: “ The nine justices of the supreme Court are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from plaintiff’s claims. A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was...done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority.” —supreme Court Justices Argument Against the Lawsuit of Rodney Stich 29 This contradicted an earlier decision by the same U.S. supreme Court Justices who held: “ There is little support in the common law for a rule of judicial immunity that prevents injunctive relief against a judge. There is even less support for a conclusion that Congress intended to limit the injunctive relief under §1983 in a way that would prevent federal injunctive relief against a state judge.” —Pulliam vs. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984) 30 To overcome the defendants claim in the Motion for Summary Judgment,” the plaintiff must also argue sufficiently in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits that there are material facts to prove the case with the preponderance of the evidence. Although these statutes were originally created for U.S. citizens, in particular the newly freed black slaves, they are applicable to sovereign “state” Citizens as a remedy for continued violations of unalienable and constitutional rights under the color of state law. There is a debate as to whether or not a Title 42§1983 subjects the sovereign “state” Citizen to federal jurisdiction or not, and whether or not it compromises sovereignty or not. Rick Shram and Richard McDonald are still hotly debating the issue. I assert if the action is brought on the Common law side of the federal Court (i.e., district court of the united states) then jurisdiction is not waived.

No insurance company will insure against constitutional violations. If a Title 42 action gets beyond rule 12B and the federal judge doesn’t toss it out as frivolous, then the bonding company for the defendants must post a bond for 10% of the total suit. Then you can proceed to take depositions and interrogatories. Have fun with it. Commercial & Common Law Liens Ed itor’s note: Beware the “lien” has become a political hot potato. It’s such a powerful tool and if misused, it can be fatal to the user. Many people have used the lien process frivolously or incorrectly and ended up in prison. Others used the lien process lawfully and ended up in prison (e.g., Montana Freemen). The Power structure does not like anybody playing around with their monopoly of the lien process. It’s the basis for the entire international banking system and it’s ultimate unraveling. A word of caution to the wise . A “Lien” is a hold or claim against the property of another as a security against a charge or debt. If your unalienable or constitutional rights have been violated by an official or agent of the government, or a crime has been committed against you, or you have a legitimate claim to collect on a debt, then you have the Common law right to “perfect” a lien against the personal property of that official, agent or debtor. These liens are filed through the County Recorders office in the county in which the official, agent or debtor has property or published in a legal newspaper. In many venues liens filed by Citizens are not being accepted for filing due to decrees by the Attorney General (e.g., Oregon ). Many Common law liens are no longer accepted for filing in County Recorder’s offices, but they can be filed in the Common law court’s Bureau of Records & Conveyances or by National recording services. Or file them in more amiable venues, or in foreign jurisdictions if necessary. “ A Common law lien is a mere right in one man to retain that which is in his/her possession belonging to another until certain demands of the person in possession are satisfied.” —Bell vs. Dennis, 93P.2d 1003, 1005, 43 N.M. 350 Liens are the underlying basis for the entire international banking system. Liens are the foundation of all commerce and are traded, exchanged, transferred and discounted securities. They are based on commercial affidavits which is also the basis of the entire legal system—swearing under oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. An act of Congress (e.g., budget) is a true “bill” or invoice, which obligates federal U.S. citizens to pay the “bill” through income taxes and other excises. When your rights have been violated, your property taken, or a crime committed against you, then a true “bill of particulars” under the Common law specifies the nature of the offense or complaint. The three parts of a perfected lien include: 1. true bill or complaint; 2. debtor; 3. assign. Common law liens are non-negotiable instruments exchangeable for gold/silver which is lawful money. International banks pay debts with each other in gold/silver, not commercial paper. Commercial liens are commercial paper and negotiable instruments. Commercial liens imply a debt in the absence of any lawful money. Commercial banks discharge debts with each other in debt currency or negotiable instruments, not gold/silver. If a bank or corporation cannot meet its financial obligations, then the parties can renegotiate or the creditor initiates a “hostile takeover” of the debtor. This is done through the commercial lien process. When the IRS sends you a “Notice of Intent to Lien” they are noticing you of their intent to attach a commercial lien to your property for a purported tax “bill.” In the case of the IRS, the true “bill” and the assessment is a fraudulent and imperfect commercial lien process because it is not based on a sworn commercial affidavit or true “bill.” A perfected lien is based on a sworn affidavit of truth and a true “bill” that stands un-refuted at-law. When you write a check for $20.00, you’ve just put a lien on the bank for $20.00. When the bank supposedly “loans” you “money” they have just put a lien on the collateral or securities you’ve posted against the bank credit purportedly loaned you. This bank credit was created from thin air, which is illegal, and is hypothetically based on a perfected commercial lien. Once a commercial lien is perfected, it is a saleable, traded, exchanged security like any other stock, bond, or mortgage contract. It is deposited in a bank in exchange for bank credit. Then the bankers can write checks directly on these deposited liens under the Uniform Commercial Code. There are three parts of a perfected lien. First, the true “bill” or invoice is properly noticed and answered. If the true “bill” once served is ignored or unanswered it becomes the truth in commerce by default as a UCC 4 Form. Then the debtor is noticed of your intent to lien. If they fail to answer, you list them as the debtor on a UCC 1 Form and you as the assign on a UCC 3 Form. Then you get a court judgment from an Article III court and you’re on the road to a perfected lien. These perfected liens or securities can now be tendered for deposit upon a commercial bank or sold. Caveat We do not advise amateurs playing with liens. They demand the finest attention to detail and lengthy study. A lien is a double edge sword and can cut both ways if improperly administered. This is a powerful tool of liberty. Do not misuse or abuse the process for greedy or self- interested purposes. You do not have enough information in this book to perfect a lien. Enter at your own risk. We - 254 -"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Commercial & Common Law Liens disclaim any responsibility or liability for the misuse of this information. A report was aired on Peter Jennings on November 2nd, 1995, attacking the people using the commercial lien process and dubbed them “paper terrorists.” Every time we expose the system for what it is the Power structure comes up with a new designation for “terrorist.” It was the international bankers, attorneys and de facto governments that came up with the UCC in the first place to execute a bankruptcy against the people. Now they are being held accountable to the same standard of recourse and they don't like it one bit. People using the lien process against judges, politicians, law enforcement personnel and media are completely and perfectly within the law as proven in a recent court decision in the 14 th Judicial Circuit in Texas. The lien process is res judicata (i.e., it is already decided) and the party that had been liened is stuck with the penalty. One individual in Washington state has brought forward a lien against nine state government officials for violating the laws pursuant to their oaths of office. His lien action was done on behalf of the 5 million residents and comes to $200 billion of restitution. Terry has filed a lien outside of his State of residence for $26 million against government officials because the courts refuse to allow the instrument to be filed in the County Recorder’s office. The Montana Freemen had perfected a lien for $15 trillion against the principles / creditors of the United States. They are presently political prisoners of the international bankers.

The part of me, I don’t want to see, for fear of losing what I believe, Black or white, right or wrong, this mode of our thinking must change. For you and I, the earth and sky, creates no enemy.” —Johnny Light Virtue, wisdom, the golden rule, morality, ethics, the inherent goodness of human beings has all been but forgotten, neglected and ignored in our contemporary media culture. Once in a blue moon we focus on the brighter side of human nature instead of drowning our heart and soul in negative, sensational stories focusing on the dark side of the human condition. We the People have surrendered virtue to everything goes, everyone for themselves, the “me” generation, greed, selfishness, mistrust and disrespect, intolerance and fear- mongering, hate crimes, projection and denial. Good slaves exhibit none of the following virtues: confi - dence, loyalty, commitment, love, sensitivity, intelligence, community, family, transcendence, ascension, rooted-ness, grounded-ness, frugality, wisdom, knowledge, compassion, warrior-ship, creative, productive, beautiful, simple, multi- faceted, multi-cultural, humility. Innocent people are often the brunt of jokes, considered naive and foolish. Innocence and vulnerability is openly murdered world-wide. The predator-prey, master-slave, perpetrator-victim relationships still prevail in our contemporary society as the power struggle continues between the various facets of ourselves, at war with the world of illusion. Our short-sighted cosmology perpetuates this war of pola- rities, opposites and dualities inherent since the world began. How have we poisoned the American soul? Let me count the ways. Many Americans are disabled emotionally if not physically, morally and intellectually. On both sides of the obsolete political spectrum, We the People suffer from a “listening disability.” We can scarcely hear each other anymore. We no longer tolerate dissent or differences. Our minds have closed to other perspectives. We do not offer the time of day to a stranger, or take the time to hear another point of view. We have the power, if not the will, to listen. We the People are deaf to the suffering of our fellow human beings, to the cries for help, to the needs of the homeless and indigent. We demand punishment for victimless crimes. We demand incarceration of the poor and uneducated to ease our minds and provide an illusive and impossible “security” instead of addressing the real social, political and economic issues. We are blind to the future that awaits us all unless we act responsibly and reach out a helping hand. America is presently a conquered land, an exploited and squandered country. America is a pre-fascist, high- technology police-attorney-prison State developing at light speed. Another genocidal holocaust of global proportions is being fashioned for the 21st Century. This time America will witness the malaise, social violence and civil war on her own soil as this once great civilization disintegrates, unless we act now to prevent these atrocities. 1 “ Everything you do may seem insignificant, but it’s very important that you do it.” —Gandhi Problem Solving and Learning We the People also suffer from a “learning disability.” Americans have surrendered “learning” for “education.” Education in the 20th Century is nothing more than brainwashing and social conditioning in conjunction with the mass media. Our educational system is “dumbing us down.” We are taught confusion, class position, indifference, emotional dependency, intellectual dependency, provisional self- esteem, and that one can’t hide from authority. We are taught not to think, not to create, not to innovate, not to make mistakes, not to change the system, not to question authority, not to dissent from the status quo. Blame, judgment and punishment awaits those who dare to challenge these pre-thought thoughts, this social programming designed to make us docile, willing slaves to the established order. 2 “ We’ve had a society under central control in the US since just before the Civil War, and such a society requires compulsory schooling, government monopoly schooling, to maintain itself.” —John Gatto 3 Learning and problem-solving is not possible unless there exists an environment supportive of our ability to make mistakes and freely apply correction to our course. Like an airplane whose set-course is incorrect 98% of the time, the ships navigator “learns” and applies correction to the set- course continually, eventually arriving at the “correct” destination. In the American political, social and economic system, we do not solve problems. Instead, we deny responsibility, pass the buck, and blame someone else for not doing something. - 257 -"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook We don’t solve problems because that’s not the goal of the status quo. We the People are not permitted the necessary learning curve without blame, judgment, rejection and punishment being reaped upon those who dare to apply correction to our set-course. Stand up and dare to actually solve a problem and you’ll be shot down by some bureaucratic sniper. Dare to solve a problem or confront the system and you’ll be discredited or falsely accused by those with some political or economic turf to protect. Big government exists because there are problems that cannot and will not be solved. Problems justify the existence of huge bureaucracies and payrolls, huge regulatory systems, huge police forces, huge tax burdens and altogether too many irrelevant academic prostitutes who will tell us what we want to hear to justify any research project, study or commission. 4 Real problem-solving requires the facilitation of intelligence gathering, synthesis and integration of disparate, paradoxical views into a process that generates results, action plans and coalition building. Problem-solving involves the breakdown of misconceptions and false perceptions into working models of reality. This is not the goal of established Power structures intent on maintaining power and control, at any cost. “ If you don’t like the news, go out and make some of your own.” —Skoop Nisker 5 We don’t solve problems in America because we aren’t allowed to make any mistakes. Instead we give ourselves permission to lie, cheat, steal, and deny the truth to protect and defend our blamelessness. This is a symptom of our having never grown up or experi - enced the true sense of personal empowerment. There are real problems to solve in America and around the world. Looking good, being blameless and right will not solve anything. It will only postpone the consequences of our institutionalized ignorance. Eventually we will have to pay the piper. Or pass it on to the next generation who will not be as forgiving. We do not solve problems because we’re unwilling to take risks. The basis of any sound educational system is the encouragement and support for being able to take risks, make mistakes and learn from them, and apply correction without retribution. This is all but lost in government, business and our educational institutions that teach quite the opposite. Deny any wrongdoing, ignore the facts and truth, discredit your opposition and appear blameless in the eyes of your peers. Herein virtue must be applied otherwise all attempts at problem solving will fail. These virtues include honesty, respect, the golden rule, a superior morality and ethics that is trans-religious, yet inherent in all religious traditions, love, a code of ethics, character above personality, truth instead of image, the dream makers above the image-makers. The healing of broken people, broken hearts, divided minds, imprisoned spirits requires forgiveness and love, not shallow apologies and excuses. Freedom requires responsibility. Responsibility is the ability to respond to what shows up in your experience. Non-responsiveness is genuine disrespect. Neglect can be more harmful as abuse. “ Our worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that’s the essence of inhumanity. —George Bernard Shaw Visions for the Next Millennium We the People have the organized intelligence at hand to deal with the many complex, interrelated issues and problems faced today. Human beings must first be willing to join together, surrender their limiting world views and beliefs, educate themselves and create a new consensus and context for reinventing the world. And we must not lose our humanity in the process. Humanity is faced with the greatest crisis and challenge of the millennium. Our global environment, millions of years of evolution, and our human survival depend on capably organizing our collective intelligence across traditional cultural, national, and professional boundaries. Humanity must achieve a global consensus on an agenda and action plan for the 21st Century, without surrendering to monolithic Power structures bent on totalitarian control and domination. Our old ways of thinking, being and acting are no longer appropriate. Conventional “wisdom,” planning, concept- ualizing and communicating are no longer effective. Command-and-control political, economic and social systems must relinquish their domination and exploitation of people and the global environment. We must be willing to share power, resources and creativity with respect to all life and the unalienable right of self-determination. 6 Through the constant barrage of media and our own experience, We the People have witnessed the destruction, violence, and injustice in which human beings are immersed. More important though, in these times, is to pay attention to the “good news” for a change, and shift our focus from the destructive impulses to the creative ones. Our emphasis must be on the creative possibilities for all humanity and all living beings co-existing, co-evolving together on a fragile planet. “ The Earth does not belong to us, but we belong to the Earth.” —Chief Seattle We the People must not neglect or ignore what human beings are capable of creating in the realms of genius— inventing culture, art, and technology. - 258 -"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen Visions for the Next Millennium We must extract, organize, synthesize and present working options, opportunities and solutions comprehensively through whole systems to effect a transformation of the human spirit. We have the means, the processes, and the technology. We need to manifest the political and spiritual will to act. We the People can survive and thrive in an ecologically bal - anced, sustainable economic, and just world for all people and species. We need men and women of integrity, courage and unCOMMON SENSE willing to devote themselves to the greatest undertaking conceivable to human beings—to create a conceptual framework, a paradigm shift for a new social, economic and political order of the highest magnitude. It is either sovereignty, respect, freedom, and dignity for all the people, or we will all be prisoners in totalitarian systems of our own design. “ Golden Age getting nearer the sky is getting clearer. And the waters abounding in pure and clean surroundings. There’s plenty for everyone and everyone has their way. Sun is shining warm on this golden day. Healing Age mend the wounds open up to golden tunes. Within your heart lies waiting the songs you’ve longed for sharing. Solar Age a new beginning unlimited energy we’ll be winning.

In the Golden Age hearts, minds and souls together will unfold. As one race of humanity, under one sun we’ll live as family.” —Johnny Light 7 First, We the People must unravel our social, cultural and political preconceptions that have divided us against ourselves and each other. Overwhelmed and saturated with information, there is less significant, interpersonal “communication” occurring today than before the aid of computer, video, fax and satellite technology. Technology is being applied by the Power structure to divide us, not to bring us together. We the People must utilize the communications tools we have available and maximize real human and organizational “connectivity,” not just linear data flow. Systems integration is essential. Knowledge and wisdom are the real powers. Through effectively organized communications networking, We the People can connect individuals, innovative and creative businesses, organizations, projects, programs and media, and link them together in an intelligent, global “network of networks.” This is a powerful commitment to being in communi- cations. This is how we can win this battle without firing a single shot. 8 Second, We the People must reassess our personal, political and family values and reprioritize our actions in the world. What are the implications of our values and the resulting actions? What is our true responsibility to ourselves and to each other? How can we restore the family and tribe as the basic building blocks of not only society, but our own humanity as well. Let us celebrate our diversity and unify with a common cause to free ourselves from tyranny manifest at all levels of our existence. Third, We the People are far too “busy” for our own good. Too busy running around like rats in a maze, disconnected from ourselves, each other, our communities and the environment that supports our very existence. It is time for each of us to pause for reflection and reevaluate our lives and the purpose therein. Are you too busy to respond to the most incredible opportunity of a lifetime if it were presented to you? What could be more important? One purpose for being human is to comprehend and experience the very essence of interconnectedness, and what our niche might be in the grand scheme of the universe. “ When one door closes, another opens. But we often look so long and so regretfully at the closed door that we not notice the one which has opened for us.” —Helen Keller Fourth, the “people of the lie” must break the long chains of denial by ‘fessing up and telling the truth. What a great day it would be if we had the courage to speak the truth in broad daylight without reservation, or fear of retribution. That would be a national holiday. Are we so accustomed to and vested in lies that the truth no longer gets any consider - ation? Truth is always the first casualty in war, and we’ve been at war for so long that peace is only a dream. 9 The government lies to us. The media lies to us. Most advertisers lie to us. We lie to each other. Fundamental untruths and our lack of integrity are the basis for economic injustice, government corruption and the total control of the international bankers over the world’s precious resources. Money is not what it appears to be, nor are most of our economic and political preconceptions. Money ought to flow like love, not like blood. We ought to forgive each other our debts, instead of using and exploiting each other economically. Our way of life is not ecologically sustainable. Greed is endemic. Fear is a cruel and self-righteous master. - 259 -"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Truth is an endangered species, because too many people are no longer connected, committed or interested in universal, spiritual principles that underlie our very existence. Many prefer to experience the world as “make believe,” as entertainment, or as a fictional story than as it really is. We have also forgotten how to see, think and experience holistically, as part of a system, not in control. Being in control is our greatest illusion. The truth is stranger than fiction. Fifth, and perhaps the most difficult of all, is our commitment to economic and social justice for all the people, while exercising our unalienable rights. There can be no “security” unless systems and means are created to create opportunities for all the people, not just the privileged few. How can We the People be content in exercising our unalienable rights at the expense and exclusion of the basic rights of a majority of the world’s population? History will repeat itself over and over ad absurdum, unless we address and solve the issues of economic and social justice, without creating huge, totalitarian welfare States. Sixth, once we have liberated ourselves from intellectual and mental slavery, we can truly invest in “Another World Order,” a “True World Order” that boldly longs to be created on this planet—a “golden age” of possibility that could transform our fears into unfettered creativity, the likes of which humanity has never witnessed, except for temporal renaissances throughout time. It is for this and many other purposes that we live and must persevere in this vision for the next millennium and beyond. 10 “ Without a fully active role in community life one could not hope to become a healthy human being.” —Aristotle A New Cosmology In America, the dominate Western, scientific, Christian- Jewish world view is based on separating man from nature, mind from body, heart from soul, the stomach from the brains ad nauseum. This results in the whole world being divided infinitely against ourselves and each other. We must evolve a broader cosmology that emphasizes unifying concepts, without denigrating our religious traditions. We are all prejudiced and biased, more or less, regardless of the particular religious, scientific or cultural perspective we’ve been conditioned into. Breakthrough your denial, acknowledge your point of view, and be tolerant and respectful of others. There is room on this planet for many religious views providing they tolerate and respect each other. Since the landing on the moon when astronauts took the first breathtaking photographs of the Earth, and scientists confirmed what the mystics knew all along; that the Earth is a continuous, ever-changing, water-bound and blue, cloud surrounded, living organism without artificial, man-made boundaries. We are living on a fragile, delicate and sacred world without borders, tipped on the brink of environmental disaster. Having the overview of a generalist is crucial in these interesting and dangerous times. In the present age of extreme specialization where brilliant people know so much about every insignificant thing, and when that knowledge is taken out of context with what all the other brilliant people know, we have created a masterful deception that threatens the survival of the entire system. Every special interest, single focus, one-dimensional cultural perspective believes it has the whole picture and sees reality as it is. In fact, the whole picture is created from a composite of all the special interests, cultural perspectives and contextual frameworks; all the knowledge of human and natural history, past, present, and future; information received from books, audio and video media and other sources, through the senses and direct experience; through the psychic realms, the unconscious dream states, and the entire mind-body-spirit continuum. This is the new cosmology that is evolving. “ We create the world as we see it, not the way it is.” —John D. Van Hove 11 Reality is not an absolute, nor is it completely relative. There are aspects which are based on universal principles that are unyielding, unchanging, and other aspects that are relative to your point-of-view. Yet we often think and act as though our perception equals reality, without question. In fact, perception is the lens through which we see the world and it is subject to conditioning, beliefs, education and personal discriminations of every kind (e.g., age, sex, race, class, culture). As the new physicists have discovered, the perceiver affects the phenomenon so profoundly as to change the results of the experiment. Thus, we consistently alter our realities by the way we perceive, conceive and ultimately in what we believe to be happening. If we sincerely believe that the world is flat, then for all practical purposes it is flat, for us. And our reality will reflect that belief, until evidence to the contrary is so overwhelming that we alter our belief structure and see differently. A common language arising from common perceptions of reality is the roadmap towards creating our world view. To challenge our assumptions, we must reflect on our language, perceptions, conceptions and experience. Mutual respect is the highest human value, along with listening, loving, cooperating, communicating, learning, healing, sharing and trust. - 260 -"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen A New Cosmology “ If we’re going to explore new territories, manifest new visions and dreams, then we’re going to need better conceptual maps: a planetary language, maps to design access to both information and resources, maps to understand the natural interconnections and interdependence of the whole planet, maps to comprehend the principles of whole systems, and the skillful use of communications tools and networking.” —John D. Van Hove 12 Teaching Preparedness The prioritizing of education in all areas of our lives is absolutely essential to any “rediscovery” of America and the restoration of a constitutional republic. We must also reflect upon ourselves, asking the time-old questions. Who are we? What are we doing here? Where are we going? We don’t have twelve to twenty years to go back to school and relearn, so we must get on the fast track and get smart quick. This takes teachers who can synthesize difficult subject matter and articulate it to diverse groups of people through well-prepared resource materials and seminars. Find people with experience and wisdom you can trust. Discriminate and make your own choices. Take responsibility for your own life, your family and your community. Find people in your own community who have integrity and walk their talk. Teaching “preparedness” is a fine art. Our goal is to transfer important, survival information into action without disabling people emotionally through fear-mongering, judgment and demonizing potential allies. We must be considerate in the ways we communicate, that we do not alienate or further polarize or divide people through overzealous proselytizing. Some of the information presented in the “patriot movement” is shocking and hard- hitting. Yes, the truth is hard to take. But let it be empower - ing, not disabling for people. Ignorance is no longer bliss. But the truth cannot be heard if it disables the recipient. Take notice that there are presently many subcultures, races and religions domiciled in the united states of America. Perhaps America was at one time a predominately Christian nation, but that is no longer the case. We must teach not only tolerance but respect for other religions, lifestyles, and ways of being. This is best done through the example of our own living. Jesus Christ was very tolerant of different people. He loved them all unconditionally. This is the primary Christian teaching. Love your neighbor as yourself. One important criterion for rediscovering America, for founding a new nation is one of inclusion, not exclusion. As leaders and teachers, it’s our job to identify the common ground, to weave the common threads that make a renewed nation. If we excluded everyone who thought, felt or acted differently than we did, we’d be a movement of one, not a nation of many. There is no other country in the world that represents as much diversity as we have in America. This is our strength. A solitary individual doth not a nation make. Divide and conquer has played into the hands of the Power structure far too long. We must break the chains of intolerance and oppression in our own hearts, before we can honor and respect others. We must face the facts that our own humanity is an endangered species, as well as our nation. That we must also care for the Earth and the health of our bodies. By acknowledging that everyone has something to contribute, skills, resources and knowledge, we’ve expanded the scope of the “patriot” movement to include more people, not less. By organizing communications and networking, we can communicate broadly with thousands of “different” people. By organizing community self-reliance, energy interdepen - dence, home-schooling, media activism and literacy, we have created the possibility of a new social, economic and political organization that exceeds our present capabilities. We the People must relearn our own American history in the context of current events. One who refuses to learn from the past is condemned to repeat it. Take the time to study American law, your Constitution for the usA, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence and the Common law. Understand how the global economic, legal and political systems actually work. Organize alternative currency systems and economic networks. 13 Preparedness for Survival Resist being harnessed by the New World Order as an economic slave, chattel or agent. Restore American, private- sector free enterprise to its prominence and productivity before government intentionally regulates and disables it to death. The U.S. government replaced the private-sector with non- productive, socialist, transnational schemes for destroying the American economy and controlling it from abroad. You must recognize that the United States has been a socialist-democratic state since the first federal bankruptcy socialized the corporate state through the New Deal (1933). Recognize that declared national emergencies and executive orders are symptomatic of the financial collapse of the U.S. corporation, the federal government and its political subdivisions. Recognize that we must eliminate all deficit spending (thus the size of government) and eliminate the welfare state to re - store private initiative and incentives for productivity and excellence. There are no more free lunches. Fund self-reliance and economically sustainable enterprises, owned and controlled by sovereign, American Citizens. Prepare for the collapse with community-based infrastruc - tures, local scrips, and barter network organizations.

Shift all investments out of U.S. Dollar enumerated mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. Invest in more secure stores of value (gold and silver), and com - modity-based items. Stop paying all income taxes and funding government oppression. Repudiate the federal debt. Stop voting and obligating yourself to pay an unpayable debt with your property and rights. Boycott all unnecessary consumer items. Prepare for survival into the 21st Century. Preparations for your own personal and family survival include adequate food and water, radio communications, land to grow food and retreat from the cities, healthcare provisions, water/air purification systems, and fuel for generators and vehicles (solar-hydrogen, solar-electric). We must also be able to protect ourselves against biological/germ warfare, AIDS, cancer and other degenera - tive diseases, and be prepared to build our immune systems with ozone/herbs and other natural means. We must be prepared for any government encroachment or attack by joining with others in citizens militia, community networks, and mutual survival infrastructures. Too often the emphasis has been exclusively on personal and/or family survival. This is an important foundation. But we mustn’t forget that our neighbors, communities and friends are the second, necessary tier of our strategic plan for survival. It cannot be everyone for themselves, without regard for each other. We must not only provide and take responsibility for ourselves, but must consider being prepared to be generous to those unprepared. For if we do not, it will be our unraveling. No man or woman can create and maintain a fortress against the entire world. If our neighbors are not considered, they may very well turn against us. Utilize the resources, skills and support that we can be for each other and set-up these infrastructures before the social disintegration gets any worse. Take the time to talk and interact with your neighbors. Build alliances and network everyone you can. “ He is truly a fool who trusts his health to a doctor, his rights to a lawyer, his money to a banker, or his soul to a preacher.” —Anonymous Be strong when confronting “petty tyrants” posing as bureaucrats and government authorities. Be gentle as a lamb and cunning as a wolf. For this we all need courage and unCommon Sense. Changes Consider the environmental changes that are imminent on the earth and where you will locate if the sea level rises or earthquakes become more common. Consider a piece of land that you can secure, free of debt if possible, and linked with others of like mind and heart. Consider setting up that land with provisions for food, health care, education, communication and other basic hu - man needs in case the lines of supply are cut off for any rea - son. Let’s not become mere “survivalists” escaping from the troubles of the world and arming ourselves to the teeth for a violent revolution. Let’s thrive on the abundance of resources and intelligence available to all people. Let’s support and care for each other the way tribes and villages once did. 15 Join with others to teach and educate about our true history without prejudice and propaganda. Put your television away and restore your own ability to think, see and feel for yourself, make your own judgments instead of surrendering to the hard hand and cold heart of an emerging, totalitarian, police state. Balanced View of the Environment This author still considers himself an “environmentalist” having attended several Land, Air, Water (L.A.W.) Conferences, having been involved in many Earth Day celebrations, and having written an independent strategic plan for the environmental movement. I am deeply committed to preserving as much of the natural habitat on the planet as possible, as our mutual life-support system depends upon such wisdom. We can best accomplish this through strategic planning, design-science, establishing sustainable economic systems, restoring constitutional court systems, and freeing the people to becoming productive and creative Citizens. As I delved deeply into this work, I came across an impasse in the existing environmental movement that I will address in this article. The grass-roots environmental movement must be credited with having raised much awareness of the environmental damage we have reaped upon our Earth. Many productive changes have already been implemented and have slowed down the destruction of our life-support system. Recycling, health foods, less pollution, better water and air quality, preservation of animal habitats, gene banks etc. have all contributed positively to the quality of life. Our research uncovered how the grass-roots environmental movement became institutionalized after Earth Day-1990 and the international Earth Summit Conference in Rio. This was the day the environmental movement died and was resurrected as a strategy for global domination. Environmental laws are now being used as a vehicle for taking control and transferring ownership of all the natural resources and private property in the world. The United Nations, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are the instruments for erecting global, monopolistic empires on behalf of the New World Order. - 262 -"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen Balanced View of the Environment It’s essential that environmentalists do not surrender the control and ownership of natural resources to the internationalists. They will be no more responsible than the federal government and certainly less than private property owners in protecting the public trust. I also concluded that the single-issue, single-minded focus of the environmentalists kept the movement divided. No one was willing to cross their special-interest and develop a strategic plan that would embrace all the issues and concerns. The primary strategies for protecting and defending the environment were politically naive at best. First, the environmental movement relied heavily upon the supremacy of federal law and regulations as the primary means for implementing environmental policy and controls. There is an unholy alliance between the environmental movement and the federal government which is corrupt to its core. The federal government has been coopted by foreign powers and is not acting in the best interest of the American people or the environment. Isn't that obvious to any intelligent observer? And this is without raising any of the constitutional issues that the patriot movement is bringing to America's attention. If the environmentalists could see how they are being used by the government, the bankers and the corporations, they'd stop this nonsense tomorrow. They have presumed far too long that you could depend upon the government and the commercial courts to protect the environment and obey the law, despite the fact they have a terrible track record. Second, environmentalists have relied upon court injunctions, civil disobedience and other temporary tactics for delaying, if not stopping altogether logging on both public and private lands. Giving the power to attorneys licensed by foreign powers, operating on behalf of foreign creditors to decide what happens to the environment is like throwing your children into the lions’ den and hoping they won't get eaten. Attorneys wage wars of words and lies in the courtroom and it has not ultimately protected any endangered species or ancient forest. Yet, environmentalists have given their power to these attorneys and environmental regulations to decide the fate of the Earth. That is not only foolish, but outright dangerous. The destruction of the environment will be delayed perhaps, but not stopped. Third, environmentalists have condoned the relentless assault upon private property and individual liberties, which has created a backlash known as the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Wise Use movement. Rigid positions always create the opposite as the truth is much bigger than any particular point of view (i.e. the position of Earth First, “No compromise for Mother Earth”). It’s the nature of a polarized mind. The truth is always larger than any one of us. The depolarization of the environmentalist/logger/jobs scenario is essential for any constructive dialogue and coalition-building between individuals with diverse interests in the environment. Loggers and private property owners must acknowledge the importance of maintaining a sustainable and healthy environment for their own longevity and productivity as. Environmentalists must acknowledge private property and individual liberties. These are not mutually exclusive concepts. Fourth, it’s not the small woodlot owner that has reaped the greatest environmental damage but the mega-corporations who remain unchecked and uncontrolled in their profit- seeking destruction of the environment. Environmental regulations have put the small woodlot owner out of business, but the mega-corporations are still operating business as usual. This is playing directly into the hands of the global monopolists who can better control a few large corporations than a bunch of individual free- enterprisers. The environmental movement still fails to recognize the bigger, global picture. The fact that the federal government is bankrupt and subject to the direction and control of its creditors. The fact that the forests are being logged not for the benefit of the American people, not to create jobs, but to make international transfer payments against an un-payable federal debt. The fact that environmentalists are being used as pawns by the New World Order to transfer title and control of all property into the hands of a few, individuals who already control most of the wealth of the world. Through this single-minded, emotionally reactive blindness, environmentalists are ultimately destroying the environment by transferring more power to the federal and world governments with the worst track record for environmental protection. Into the hands of the tyrants we give away our power justifying the good that never comes from such ignorance. The ultimate enemy of the ancient forest and endangered species is not the logger trying to raise a family or the private property owner, but the international banks, the transnational corporations and a corrupt federal and emerging world government. These interests have conspired for generations and acted consistently to destroy the environment for short-term profit. Wake up and smell the ancient forest! It's being hacked to death and the present environmental strategies are not working! It's time to reinvent a truly environmental movement that also embraces private property and individual rights. - 263 -"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook It's time for the so-called left and so-called right to talk to each other in the same room.

I'm not willing to give up my rights in exchange for environmental protections that aren't effective. I want to support and develop effective strategies that work. Wake up and watch the ozone depletion accelerate. We'll be living in caves before the year 2020. Wake up and watch the oceans rise; the burning of fossil fuels continues to heat up the environment. Wake up and watch the extinction of thousands of species that hold the key to our own evolution, perhaps a cure for cancer or AIDS. It's in everyone best interest to preserve and respect the mutual life-support system of the Earth. Only an ignorant fool would say otherwise. 16 Land Use Conflicts and Resolutions on the Rise Somewhere along the way, the American people gave away the right to manage their own land, both public and private. This right was given in exchange for the services of an environmental watchdog — the government. What the people failed to comprehend is that in giving away the responsibility of environmental problems, the power to determine and enforce solutions is also given away. As a result, communities are increasingly divided and land use disputes are escalating. Media usually portray such conflicts in simplistic terms be - tween two opposing groups by sensationalizing the polarity between them. Little attempt is made to explore the complex dynamics that have led to these inner-community standoffs. Cultural transition and environmental problems affect entire communities — not just “loggers,” “ranchers” and “environmentalists.” A study of the Rogue Valley and Deer Creek communities provides deeper insight into the root causes and possible solutions to the growing number of land use disputes sweeping the nation. Throughout 1989 and 1990, Beverly Brown, author of Fencing the Northwest Forests, conducted formal interviews with residents in the Rogue Valley region of Oregon. She was seeking perceptions and attitudes within the local community toward changing land use regulations. Brown learned of long held traditions: “Oral histories are filled with accounts of people fishing, picking berries and mushrooms, hunting and even poaching when people were hungry. Neighbors crossed each others’ fence lines with the understanding that collective access to domestic gathering, and fishing and swimming sites were of mutual benefit. Recreation was always available in the woods and on the major rivers, often close by.” The 1980s brought an influx of urban immigrants. Most of the newcomers were of a higher education and income level status, and differing views of land use colored the community. The newcomers pressed for land use regulations, resulting in the fencing off and decline of public access to lands previously enjoyed by all. Their presence increased the value of land and housing to prices out of the reach of most locals. A multitude of government intrusions such as new tax policies, permits required for wilderness use, and restrictions on the use of wood stoves caused further dissension. Interviews with locals revealed strong resentments toward the growing numbers of city-dwellers that had moved into the area over the past decade. Brown discovered that most everyone she spoke with was concerned about protecting the environment, regardless of socioeconomic status. But the polarization of ideological differences regarding timber use and private property stewardship resulted in a breakdown of community relations. Brown examines the ramifications of such actions: “In their efforts to save the forests, environmentalists often lose sight of the severe cumulative effects of their own housing, fencing, zoning, neighborhood association and forest entrepreneurial pursuits . . . To what extent do environmentalists’ well-meaning desires to restrict many other forest activities, as well as rhetoric about bringing a halt to all logging, coincide with the symbolism of closing the land?” Government imposed land use restrictions in Rogue Valley resulted in bitter community divisions, with a large number of residents feeling victimized by their unprecedented loss of autonomy. Vina community members living in the Deer Creek Basin area faced a similar loss of land use rights, though the standoff in this case was not over public property, but against private property owners. Like Rogue Valley, the history of Deer Creek shaped the character of current residents. Nat Bingham, author of A Voice from Deer Creek, writes of local ranchers, “Because of the inaccessibility of much of the basin, the strong commitment to private land ownership, trespass prevention and family values, Vina as a community has changed very little since the nineteenth century compared to most of California.” Before the settlers came, the Yahi inhabitants practiced seasonal burning to promote the native perennial bunch grasses and prevent brush overgrowth. The settlers learned many sustainable land use methods from the Indians, including the management of deer grazing areas. Descendants of these early pioneers now herd cattle instead of deer. Area rancher Sue Knox traces her use of traditional land use methods through her lineage to this time. “The Indians knew when to travel to follow the deer,” says Knox. “You know not to overgraze — you learn a balance. The main thing is to know where you are, to know if you are on good or bad ground, so you know how to graze it. That's where the government goes ‘off the beam’ — they make the same grazing rules for everywhere. The old-timers learned the hard way from overgrazing and studying the land.” But when Deer Creek's Chinook Salmon population declined sharply in the 1970s, environmental organizations blamed the problem on overgrazing. Ironically, the loss of grasslands due to government fire banning regulations was later found to be the primary factor in the salmon decline. - 264 -"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen Balanced View of the Environment But cattle grazing and timber harvests did destroy sensitive riparian areas along streams, and the community was still at odds. Environmental groups lobbied to place Deer Creek under the federal and state Wild and Scenic River Acts. But residents were not impressed by previous government land mismanagement (i.e., burning prohibition and grazing allotments). Their mistrust of this new intrusion grew when they realized that a little-known section of the law would open the river banks on privately owned land to the public. So community members decided to work with, rather than against, the opposing groups to create their own solutions. Residents, environmental groups, the federal National Marine Fisheries Service, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations and biologists all came together and formed a work group focused on habitat protection. In the end, Deer Creek was not placed under government protection. Instead, the Deer Creek Conservancy was established to restore environmental balance along the rivers. Voting is limited to watershed landowners. The ranchers took responsibility to repair the damage they had caused. Community relations among differing groups grew stronger through the mutual respect they had extended to one another. The Conservancy wrote and sponsored legislation to protect Deer Creek Basin, without the public access restrictions, that was signed into law in 1994. A plan to reinstate grass burning is in the works. The salmon population has increased fivefold during the past two years. The people did not need a watchdog — they found the best solutions for their own problems themselves. Escalating land use conflicts are not the simplistic battles between isolated groups, as media imply. These conflicts are the result of complex community traditions and dynamics. Self-righteous groups on both sides of an issue are so intent on imposing their will on others that they no longer see the cost of their actions. Societies that look to government to solve problems of their own making have lost the ability to shape their own future. Government solutions to the land use problems in Rogue Valley made everyone a loser. Even the environ-mentalists who seemingly won their \"cause\" must now live in the shadows of broken community bonds. The solutions to the land use problems in Deer Creek made everyone a winner. Mutual respect not only yielded workable solutions, but strengthened community bonds. Those responsible for the problems took responsibility for solving them. 17 Depolarization of Left and Right Whether you identify with the so-called Left, or the so-called Right, there are extremists from either side of the political spectrum who will employ identical tactics to denounce, discredit or falsely accuse their opponent. The dehumanization of your opponent is the bottom-line of any propaganda war. If you can take away the humanity from your opponent, then you have permission to kill them. Let’s stop this nonsense. Let’s stop the polarization now. Take the humanity away from the children and women in Iraq by not focusing your cameras on the human carnage, but on the smart bombs and the building wreckage, and you've justified the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. As it is with the battle between the environmentalists and the loggers, if you keep your distance and don't get too close, don't listen, don't look into each others eyes, deny each other the chance to speak, then you can maintain the polarization for extended periods of time. I cannot justify violence of any kind for any cause short of self-defense after being physically attacked. First, comes the war of words, the labeling, dehumanizing and discrediting of your opponent. Then, if tensions have escalated long and dangerously enough, it eventually comes to physically confrontations and body bags. This is the nature of war. War is a constant in a polarized, paranoid mind. To be free, we must master our own minds and put them to rest. For example, the media has portrayed Earth First, a perceived bastion of the far Left, as “eco-terrorists.” The same media has portrayed people who believe in the U.S. Constitution, a perceived bastion of the far Right, as \"domestic terrorists.\" Is there any similarity in these accusations? People from the so-called Right attack the so-called Left. People from the so-called Left attack the so-called Right. Who is the victor in all this? The status quo, establishment Power structure is laughing all the way to the bank with your rights and property, that's who! Divide and conquer is the most popular and effective means of controlling whole populations and keeping them engaged in useless war. Just be certain that the so-called Left and the so-called Right never get together and figure out who the common enemy is. The FBI blew up Judi Bari's car then accused them of planting the bomb. The BATF and lots of other federal police incinerated innocent women and children at Waco, and shot a pregnant mother in the head at Ruby Ridge. Sound preposterous, it's true. As you’ve read countless times in this book, the Power structure orchestrates events that keep the people divided, conquered and terrorized. Do not submit to this kind of programming. Both the so-called Left and the so-called Right have been under attack at one time or another over the course of history. Yet, instead of finding our common ground, we continue to fight each other. The war of words and innuendos defeats any meaningful dialogue that might penetrate through the lies of our times. Holding a position of “no compromise” guarantees that the war will go on, and We the People will certainly lose. This war must stop to be able to win the battle for freedom and our own lives. 18 - 265 -"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Breaking Through Victim Mentality Victim mentality will always create victim reality and victim circumstances. If you imagine your sorry state in life, pitiful and pathetic, wounded, betrayed and abandoned, then sure enough the universe will cooperate and create that reality for you. It’s not bad luck — it's our own creation. And like it or not, human beings are all Creators on this planet so we might just as well get good at it. Creative mentality will always manifest creative reality and events in your life. If you imagine your life as working, incredible, juicy and happy, guess what’s coming your way? As David Icke says so well, “We are all imaginations of ourselves.” Whether or not we have a small or large, limited or expanded imagination, the truth remains that we create our own realities — for better or for worse. Consider what you’ve created today and how you could’ve been happier in your life. Oh, that’s “too simple minded” you'll say in defense of your limited creative power. “I'm not responsible.” These mantras, affirmations and meditations will enlighten me. I'm “new-age.” I believe that everything is everything. Just listen to yourself! Oh, but I believe that God is the Creator, not me. I believe in the literal words of the Bible (which limited edition?). Oh, but Jesus is my savior. He's going to come again and save me from myself (we killed him the first time do you think he'd fare any better today?). Stop making excuses for being miserable. Stop making your religion an excuse for not being a responsible Creator on this planet, in this life now! God save us from religion and the bear trap minds that refuse to open to their infinite possibilities. “Oh, but somebody hurt me - mother, father, sister, brother, stranger and someone else was to blame. It's their fault. It's their responsibility. I was abused. My father was angry. My mother neglected me. I didn't get to breast feed.” Give it up! Aren’t you sick to death of hearing yourself moaning and groaning, denying yourself and responsibility for being a Creator? You have not exclusively created every event in your life, as many were cocreated by willing cast members, but you certainly have created “meaning” around these events that haunt you. This is what “hell” is - a victim mentality, an attitude with no exit. And the reverse is also true. We can create a heaven on earth if we choose. It's understandable to be so “victimbound” as we're raised with constant messages of limitation. No, you can't do that. No, you can't be that. Get real. Get a job. Get married. Get rich. Be successful. Look good. Be right. Christianity informs us we're hopelessly “born sinners” with a limited imagination. Religion is the greatest form of mind control ever created by man through the manipulation of fear, guilt and shame. Liberate our minds from mental slavery. Free your spirit. Stop giving your power away to other people’s concepts of “God!” Experience “God” directly, not through others. So how do we reinforce a victim mentality? It's the “vibe” that pulls it in. We magnetize energies with our thoughts. If you're angry, you're going to be a magnet for angry people. By hanging around the people and circumstances you attract, the anger is perpetuated. Misery loves company and victims love a whole herd around them. There are support groups, radio shows, magazines, websites for every possible victim identity. All these reinforce your victim-hood. Sooner or later, it becomes an identity. It's becomes a statement of who you are. It's becomes who you are. So it must be so. If you’re joyful and happy, you’ll attract other joyful and happy people. Expand your imagination of yourself and free yourself from the prison so you can experience paradise. 19 Expanding Imagination The solutions to poverty, hunger, sickness, disease and much of what we perceive as “problems” on the planet are rooted in expanding our imaginations of ourselves. Most problems are actually created by man to perpetuate the fear-based systems that manipulate and control us. Let’s take a hard look at ourselves and what we stand for. Let’s expand our imagination of ourselves. How can we stand for so much hunger and starvation on this planet when there's plenty of food for everyone? Millions of children die from starvation and billions are hungry every night. Our pets eat better than most people in the Western world. We compost enough food from restaurants in the West to feed many of the world's hungry. Food is left unharvested in the fields. Prime agricultural land is suburbanized instead of planted. Farmers are bankrupted and cannot afford to grow food. It's a limited imagination about how to get the food to the people. It's a limited imagination of who we are and who is hungry. If any one of us is hungry — then I am hungry still. How can we stand for billions of peoples lives reduced to poverty when there's plenty of “money” (since if you remember it's created out of thin air by the international bankers). Billions of people have no “credit” from the bankers to engage in even the most rudimentary financial transaction. Millions of people are working their lives away paying for three houses for the privilege of living in one. Billions of people are not engaged in productive or meaningful work. It’s not that there isn’t plenty of “jobs” or work that is needed and wanted to be done, but our entire orientation is problem-oriented from scarcity consciousness. Let’s focus on expanding our imagination about what is meaningful and constructive work, and commit to wrapping our lives around right livelihood. It's a limited imagination about power, about money, about wealth that creates lack. It’s takes an expanded imagination to create the “money” where it's needed most. Money is power and there's plenty of it when the people reclaim their sovereignty and empower each other and themselves. - 266 -"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen Expanding Imagination Money is created from the interaction of energy and infor - mation (i.e., currency). The creation of “money” is every - one’s responsibility. Wealth generation is the highest agenda of the hour. Wealth and success for everyone, not defined solely in material terms. How can we stand for millions of people suffering from can - cers and degenerative diseases so a few people can profit richly from their misery, instead of making the “cures” avail - able. Limited imagination prevents working solutions from being implemented. Limited imagination creates so much unnecessary suffering. Rooted in fear, greed and insecurity the human race suffers from lack of imagination, not re - sources, intelligence or solutions. Let’s focus on creating al - ternative and independent health systems, knowledge-bases and healing work to make the existing health system obso - lete. Power structures simply set up the circumstances and condi - tions whereby ordinary people can be manipulated into sub - mission and their imaginations curtailed. Bureaucracies thrive, as agents of power, yet have none of their own, except whatever you submit. Do not submit to the shepherds waving their sticks, herding you into the corral. Go your own way. Be free, truly free. Let’s focus on freedom and freedom technologies for retain - ing, reclaiming and restoring power to the people. Most people believe they are “free.” Yes slave, you are free to select any one of the 50 channels on your remote control, and choose which form of mind control you want to sub - scribe to. Yes slave, you're free to pick a Ford or a Toyota. Yes slave, you're free to borrow our money at 10% or 12%. It's a free country after all. Let’s focus on thinking our own thoughts, creating our own media and educational systems, and getting free of the programming and propaganda sys - tems. But consider if you’re really free? You're not really free if you cannot be who you are, say what you think and do as you feel so long as you don't trespass on another. You're not free if you're a slave to your corporate job. You're not free if you've forgotten how to think, act and feel for yourself. You're not free if you don't know who you are and express your uniqueness. That's real freedom — remember. Let’s fo - cus on real freedom for all the people this time. Let’s educate around freedom and respect each others’ rights. Stop giving your power to these sovereign Power structures and marvel as they vanish from your sight. Get them out of your life and out of your sight. Stop participating in your own oppression. Revoke your ad - hesion contracts with agents of power. Learn how to become a sovereign being on the planet. Focus on the positive, pro-active steps you can take to re - claim your sovereignty. Hierarchical power structures are fundamentally vulnerable as the power is not at the top, but in the foundation. Those at the top are riding on the backs of those below. The global elite who rule over nations and herds of people only accom - plish it with our daily consent to hold them above us, to sup - port their lusts for power and position. We the People feed them our power. They willingly accept and feed off the pow - er we give away everyday due to our limited imaginations. The road to paradise is only a breath away.

If we don't change our direction we're likely to end up where we're headed. American Law American law can teach us the principles of our once great nation, principles we have loved, the foundation of our freedoms and unalienable rights we've enjoyed. Law can inform us of the deeds and conditions of our present “political” doctrine, the corruptibility of government and emerging new world order, contrasting the republic and the democracy as distinct forms of governance. If you have interest in knowing the heart of a nation look into the prisons and courts and see where we're headed. Are we such a ruthless people still? Business Business can teach us what our values really are. To love each other or the so-called almighty “dollar.” Choose your currency well. Choose debt-free, gold/silver and commodity backed systems that create true economies of, by and for the people, instead of global casino operations run by criminal syndicates (i.e., transnational corporations and international banksters). Choose to serve others by providing goods and services that are needed and wanted not for profit of $money$, but for the abundance and prosperity of all humanity.

We are the links that bind us together. We are an emerging global brain of individuals working together to expand consciousness and awakening on the planet and in the universe. Community Community teaches us how to live together on the land, in our villages, towns and cities, learning the old tribal and family ways that support us into a deep soul experience of belongingness. Everyone is included, one for all and all for one. It takes a whole village to raise a whole child as a free man or woman (not a slave). Education Education teaches us by the example of others. Formal schooling is supplemental after we learn to be a human being first and foremost. Our heroes and teachers live in the community around us, in our families. We learn best what we are capable of teaching. We are all teachers first and learners second. The direct experience of life is our own best teacher. There is no replacement by systems of schooling, social conditioning or mass media without the loss of self and empowerment for which we pay dearly the rest of our lives.

Choose to learn to govern yourself, respect others and apply the golden rule, not to rule the gold except in your own heart and soul. Spiritual Being spiritual is about going your own way and finding your own truth through direct experience on your soul's journey. If your religion does not practice loving relations with all beings, then it has nothing to offer you but slavery and chains to bind you to outside powers over you.

Everyone is extraordinary and unique. To honor each other’s uniqueness and allow each other to coexist outside the prison is what the mythological “Garden of Eden” was all about. Paradise is created when We the People decide to keep our power instead of giving it away. We don't have to get it back from the government, the church or the global elite. We don't need permission to become a sovereign being. We are sovereign by birth. Keep your power. Empower others to keep their power. Use your power wisely. Love each other and practice the golden rule. Paradise is that simple folks, so obvious. When visionaries and activists talk about creating “paradise” on earth, you'll hear every lame excuse. “I can't do that. I have a job. I have to work everyday to pay my mortgage. What about my children's education? I've got a car payment. I've got to take care of mine.” Dare to talk about “paradise” and most people will discount you as unrealistic, impractical, possessed with the devil, crazy, off your rocker, bloody mad or all of the above. “What would my parents think? What would my husband think? What would the neighbors think? What would I think?” Worse than life in the prison, which has become acceptable, even fashionable, people are afraid the system will collapse, so they maintain the status quo at all costs. At least life in the prison provides three squares a day and a decent roof over your head. They get up and go to work each day. Like the bumper sticker, “I owe, I owe so off to work I go.” The generalized fear of the system collapsing keeps the system going. The excuses for keeping it going include, “It'll hurt and be painful, people will suffer. There'll be madness in the streets. People will starve.” Yes, all that will happen when the system collapses. All that has happened, is happening now and supposedly the system is working. For billions of people, the system doesn't work, never worked and has already collapsed. For millions more, the stress and strain of maintaining it is killing them. There were one million bankruptcies in the united states of America last year. This kind of “system” is unsustainable by any means. The New World Order cannot and will not succeed in creating a global plantation. There's no way to keep six billion people down on the farm without their consent. It is mathematically impossible to keep the debt-based “money” system going indefinitely. Eventually, a new global structure will be imposed — exactly what the global elite had in mind all along. And most of the people will simply go along with it. Until, they realize the prison they're in and the hopeless lives they lead. When We the People are sick to death of playing out victim mentality, the people will free themselves. Declare enough suffering, enough victim-hood and simply walk out of the corral. Take some responsibility for creating your conditions and crawl out of the hole you've been living in. You'll get more out of your life if you do it now. There are tens of thousands of people who are getting on just fine ignoring the system by creating other realities instead of feeding the status quo. The secret is — act and live as if the system has already collapsed. Learn to live without it. Extract yourself from it. Work independently. Create your own systems and interface with it as seldom as necessary. Create self-reliance and interdependency in everything you do with your family, friends and community. You don’t have to fight the system tooth and nail, just make it obsolete. Stop supporting the huge pyramid scheme by pulling out, walking away, and just say “No!” We'll all be better off supporting each other in our families and communities, feeding each other instead of feeding the system. Stop feeding the system if you choose to be free, to be powerful and to manifest creation in your life. Paradise has no room for cowards. Fear cannot exist therein. We can love the world into a paradise. Paradise is a choice, an attitude away. Most people are terrified of the consequences of getting out of prison.

More and more people are waking up to their own spiritual power and choosing to live on the edge of the new frontier — the possibility of life on earth when the pyramid collapses. You may be one of them — if you can conquer your fears. It's a choice whether to surrender to the fear or not. We are standing on the precipice of a new possibility. Get out of the way or take a stand with us. How do we turn a prison into a paradise? Be who you really are, respect and express your uniqueness — respect others rights to do the same. Do not impose what you believe on others. Stop policing each other into conformity. Follow your heart and be extraordinary. Take the time to smell the roses. Enjoy life. Go for the joy and the gusto. 22 \"We are the power in everyone. We are the dance of the moon and sun. We are the hope that'll never hide. We are the turning of the tide.\" —Traditional Song Restoring Sustainable Economics A lot of lip service has been paid to developing sustainable economic and environmental systems without addressing the fundamental issues and concerns that prevent any sustainability from manifesting. There are hard questions that must be asked before any real “sustainability” can manifest. Sustainability has become a buzzword for the development of global infrastructure for a world government. This is NOT the sustainability I’m referring to. Who is in control of the system? Who is accountable and responsible? Who owns it? Who has rights? What rights do Citizens have? Who decides? Who are the sovereign powers - 269 -"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook behind the system? Are the Citizens the sovereigns? What is sustainable anyway? How can you sustain a dysfunctional economic system? Why would we want to? What are the principles of sustainability? “ Being broke is a state of finance. Being poor is a state of mind.” —Boston T. Party Sustainable economics from the vantage point of the exist - ing Power struct ure, implies retaining it for their exclusive control and use under the New World Order without regard for the environment or property rights. Sustainability means status quo — let’s keep it the way it is. After all, it’s working very well for us. Sustainable economics, from the environmental perspective, implies protecting the land itself for the control and use of the environmentalists through expanded federal and State gov - ernment regulation at the expense of private property owner - ship, local economics and personal freedom. Sustainability means keep the land from being developed and protect what’s left of the wilderness and endangered species. These are noble causes and I concur with their necessity. I dis - agree that the means to this ends is the abolition of individual freedom and private property. Sustainable economics, from the perspective of some private property owner, implies that one can do anything on the land without concern for the environment, for your neighbors, or the long-term viability of the property for future generations. Sustainability means freedom and responsibility to steward and care-take land, property and resources as a good neigh - bor. Don’t pollute the water we all drink. Think about the con - sequences of our actions downstream and how it affects our neighbors as well. The golden rule applies well here. Can we trust individual ini - tiative and ethics better than centralized government control? Yes, I believe we must educate, but not at the expense of free - dom and individual rights. Combining elements of free enterprise capitalism and collec - tive socialism along with sustainable environmental principles might be a workable option if all the people were acting as sovereigns instead of subjects and slaves. Subject and slave mentality (i.e., victim mentality) tends to want to blame others for their condition or lot in life. Master mentality tends to want to control others for security purposes. Status quo means allowing a small, mostly invisible global elite, the old aristocracy and bloodlines, own, control and ma - nipulate the entire system for their personal benefit. This is the danger inherent in the present New World Order system and its plan for the future. In order for global populism to arise, individual responsibility and cross-cultural tolerance must take root as fundamental and universal values. We must root out racism; fundamental - ism, sexism and other divide and conquer mentalities that have forever kept the people divided. What are the principles of individual responsibility? What universal moral or ethical basis must arise for the evolution of a global culture? “ Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other kind.” —John Adams A sustainable economic system must be created backed on the substance of gold/silver, a breadbasket of commodities, local community-based scrips and/or solar energy production. We the People must once again become producers, not mere consumers, of goods and services that are needed and wanted in the community. We must get to know our neighbors, rely on each other instead of the corporate food chains and suppliers, become increasingly interdependent and autonomous from the international lines of supply. This is the backbone of any sustainable economy. Look around. There is plenty of work that needs to be done. There is no lack of “jobs (i.e., Just Over Broke),” just a lack of imagination on how to organize systems to accommodate the production of goods and services that will fulfill all basic human needs. While providing incentives and rewards for producers, not just consumers. Consumers have incentives to buy. Producers need incentives to produce besides the making of so-called, fiat “money.” This has been an empty lure all along. Don’t fall for it anymore! Too many people walk around with an attitude that the world owes them a living. Not so. You earn your own living as you’re able. Instead of government-sponsored government welfare, We the People must take care of our own. In tribal societies, people belonged to families and tribes and were taken care of throughout their life cycle. This is the healthy basis for all sustainable economic systems. This is absolutely essential and must not be pushed aside. Do not wait for the international banking system to collapse before you prepare yourself, your family and community. It will not suffice for restoring the inherent sovereignty of the American people to remain dependent upon the economic and “money” systems that have been installed ultimately to control and bankrupt not only the Americans, but all the peoples of the world. It is insufficient to accumulate vast quantities of Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s), as the debt-currency systems of the world are on the brink of total collapse and are not a viable basis for restoring a sustainable economic system for any nation whatsoever. For those with an accumulation of FRN’s, divest all debt- currency investments and invest in the infrastructure for sovereignty worldwide. These investments include independent solar energy production, independent communications technology, organic and natural food production, alternative medicine and health, home schooling and every other possible form of independent commerce and community infrastructure.

Americans—get off your knees and stand independent of the economic slavery of the international bankers. We the People create economic systems, not the government or the international bankers. Do we have the will? 23 Gold and Silver, Local Scrip, Barter and a Breadbasket of Commodities Reclaiming your rights and being a sovereign “state” Citizen requires the ability to be economically sovereign. Being a sovereign pauper in the modern world probably wouldn’t be any more fun than being a poor or indigent U.S. citizen. Being sovereign means being able to support yourself, your family and your community in a self-reliant, self-sufficient and self-sustaining way without infringing on the freedoms and resources of others. Today this requires economic networking on a community and/or bioregional basis, using barter, trade, local scrips, time-dollars and alternative currency systems as well as transacting in lawful money — gold and silver. “ Without vision, the people perish.” —Old Proverb We’ve already addressed he issue of gold and silver being the foundation for restoring a constitutional money system. We’ve also explored the components of a sustainable economic system and the production of goods and services. That We the People must rebuild a sustainable economic system, both local and global in scope, is essential for establishing our sovereignty and being able to survive, indeed thrive in the process. There are a number of economic tools available and we must utilize all of them in the constitutional republic. For example, in the Northwest, the Bioregional Economic Network (BEN) introduced a bioregional currency system, the Cascadia HOUR, to facilitate community-building, economic networking and the exchange of goods and services. The Cascadia Hour is a “time dollar” based system. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined in 1985 when faced with a growing number of time-dollar based, computer credit systems being operated by senior centers and social service agencies that “time-dollars,” exchanging time for time, were not marketplace transactions, therefore, not taxable. The IRS ruling authenticated the distinction between the marketplace and the community economy of which barter and trade is so integral. Other barter systems such as L.E.T.S. are compatible with the Cascadia Hour. There are a number of local scrip systems starting (45 systems in 1998) around America (e.g. Ithaca Hours, Santa Cruz Monarchs). Barter systems have been under attack from the IRS in recent years and the IRS has determined that for professional services, members of barter organizations must account for the “credits” as income when the credits are posted, not when they are spent. If you are an individual required, then pay the tax. We assert that One Cascadia Hour has an exchange value of $10 (FRN) applied toward part or full payment for goods and/or services. Through networking people, businesses and organiza-tions willing to Accept and spend these Cascadia Hours, we’ve created a viable economic network to supplement the shrinking, cash-poor FRN economy. The Cascadia Hour was launched in the Summer of 1993 from southern Oregon to British Columbia west of the Cascades. The Cascadia Hour is backed by “In Each Other We Trust. Local scrips are nothing new. There were hundreds of local scrips across the united states of America, especially during the Great Depression, backed by wheat, sheepskins and other locally abundant commodities. We the People can create our own local scrips backed by whatever is in abundance in our local economy, then trade and exchange with each other, both locally and globally through establishing communications networks and departments of economic development through our newly consummated provisional governments. An entire breadbasket of commodities—food, shelter, energy, appropriate technology, medicine, information, education, skills, talents and know-how are the backing for this new economy powered by solar energy. “ This note entitles the bearer to receive one free hour of labor or mutually agreed upon discount in goods or services. Please accept it, then spend it! Cascadia Hours stimulate local business by recycling our wealth bio-regionally. Cascadia Hours are backed by real capital; skills, goods and services, our tools, forests, fields and rivers.” Solar Energy Economy Strategic investments in a solar energy infrastructure, whereby megawatts of electricity are produced directly from the sun, and distributed not only through the existing electrical grid, but for decentralized off-the-grid applications as well, is a sound foundation for an alternative economy backed by the sun. Whoever controls the energy production systems also controls the economic system and the currency systems that flow through it. The price indexes are all determined by the cost of energy at every phase of production including resource extraction, manufacturing, packaging and distributing. Alter the cost, control and ownership structures around the production of energy, and a new economy emerges for the next millennium. - 271 -"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook By investing in renewable sources of energy production on a global scale (e.g., Stirling Energy Systems), We the People can also get off the “money grid” and create our own independent economies, with an independent accounting (i.e., currency) system as well. Anyone and everyone who becomes an energy producer becomes a creditor in this equation. You must simply focus the appropriate technology on the sun, collect and distribute it as usable power. With the advent of green power and the deregulation of the energy industry, the consumer will have choice. Harry Braun envisioned in his book, The Phoenix Project a strategic plan for converting the entire planet into renewable energy production within five years by utilizing existing, state- of-theart, solar-hydrogen genset technologies. These technologies exist and are beginning mass production next year. R. Buckminster Fuller envisioned a solar-energy economy and accounting system in his book, Critical Path, when cost- effective, low-cost technology was available for producing electricity directly from the sun and it was Combined with hydrogen as a clean-burning fuel for automotive, aerospace and agricultural use, insures that the next millennium will be an expansion of human potential and creativity. 25 - 272 -"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Chapter Seventeen Gold and Silver, Local Scrip, Barter and a Breadbasket of Commodities Notes and Sources GLOBAL VISIONS & SOLUTIONS 1.

If we are to restore constitutional guarantees and a republic for our children, we must use all lawful means available to us.” —Johnny Liberty We the People are not hopeless or powerless in the light of the truth, substantiated by facts documented in the public record, and illuminated with the intelligence to think for ourselves. Although we often feel that we don’t make a difference, in fact, as individuals, communities and effectively organized grassroots networks, we are more powerful than ever in the communications age. Our access to communications, our ability to send signals, ideas, thoughts and images with global repercussions have never been greater. Let’s learn to use these “tools of liberty,” and utilize every card in the deck on behalf of our true “public interest.” We the People must take back our government, our schools, our media and our lives, and restore the constitutional republic that makes the united states of America worth standing for. Otherwise we’ll lose it forever! We the People must take back our government from corrupt and misinformed public officials who arrogantly presume authority under “color of law,” have co-opted the electoral process through political parties, unlawfully take jurisdiction over sovereign “state” Citizens, routinely deprive Citizens of due process of the law, and bankrupt an entire nation through its monetary policies. Government corporations make huge presumptions and fraudulently coerce us into contracts that have no substance in the Common law or the Constitution for the usA. Government corporations routinely take liberties with our personal freedoms, and violate our rights to “legally” extort revenue, rights and property. “ Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. ..these are the times that try men’s souls.” —Thomas Paine, Common Sense 1 We the People must not tolerate such abuses of power, process or authority. According to the California supreme Courts Annual Review of Lower Courts, government officials, judges, court clerks, police officers, and attorneys routinely violate the constitutional rights of Citizens. There were 286,000 new laws and regulations passed last year at every level of government (municipal, county, State & federal) that you are supposed to obey. If you’re not a “criminal” today, you might be one tomorrow in the eyes of the government corporation. We the People need to restore the accountability and respectability of the American system of law. In truth, the “emperor” wears no clothes. Public officials become personally liable when they violate our constitutional rights as sovereign state Citizens and are then vulnerable to lawful process. 1 We the People must defend our rights wherever and whenever they are violated. We the People must assert ourselves in the workplace and stop the fraudulent withholding scam of the IRS and the fed - eral United States government corporation. Employers act as unpaid federal agents under the “color of law” when they register an Employee Identification Number (EIN), with - hold income taxes on wages and demand a Social Security Number (SSN) from employees as a prerequisite for employ - ment. There is no law requiring them to do so. When they act as federal agents, employers also become personally liable for violations of the unalienable and/or constitutional rights of American Nationals OR sovereign “state” Citizens. 2 “ Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer...our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer... government is the badge of lost innocence.” —Thomas Paine, Common Sense 3 We the People must educate ourselves and our children about the true history of the “united states of America” and not submit to the public “education” that routinely revises history, science and a host of other specialized disciplines to program our children into obedient consumers, taxpayers, economic slaves and robots. Our children, by our example, must learn to think for themselves, question authority, and lawfully challenge the status quo. But first, adults and parents must relearn to “think” for themselves. Education = Social Programming = Indoctrination We the People must free ourselves from religious bigotry and racial prejudice. In a country premised on tolerance for various religious denominations and the guarantees of reli - gious freedom for all, how can we tolerate the persecution of any particular belief structure? How can we tolerate the self- righteous judgments of those who supposedly love their brothers and sisters? We must practice what we preach. Institutionalized church - es have too often stuffed innocent minds with fundamental - ist, obsolete and intolerant cosmologies that have led us down the road to perpetual slavery, the apocalypse and envi - ronmental destruction. We the People, thanks to a soulless science, have been re - duced to mere consumers feeding from the commercial trough of products and services, obediently paying our taxes without actively participating as Citizens in decision-making processes. Instead, we are divested, alienated and uninvited from par - ticipating in the Power structure. When was the last time - 275 -"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook you sincerely felt that the government cared about your point of view? When was the last time the government actu - ally solved a problem, instead of creating bigger ones? We the People, thanks to a spiritless technology, have been reduced to expendable units of production in a factory world dominated by technology that cares little about human rights, self-determination, diversity, or planetary survival. “Consumers,” “taxpayers,” and “voters” are too often encouraged and rewarded for unethical or selfish behavior, trained to be suspicious and distrust each other. Even families have lost their sacred honor, divided by social, economic and personal conflicts. “A wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned —this is the sum of good government.” —Thomas Jefferson As we speed into the next millennium, confronting global environmental destruction, new technologies with vast implications for irreversibly changing the balance of life on earth, and for controlling masses of human beings, with thousands of species including our own facing extinction, we must move swiftly beyond ignorance and denial. We the People must reveal the truth and expose the sovereign Power structure that uses the united states of America as a sacrificial lamb at the altar of “progress” of the New World Order. We the People must demand that officers of the government corporation not compromise the sovereignty of the united states of America, or commit blatant acts of treason either. We must lawfully take back and reestablish our government as a constitutional republic for all the people. These shocking, revolutionary truths will rock the foundations of the Power structure, who can survive only in secrecy, and bring down our naive preconceptions about the design and intent of our present political, economic and legal system. We the People must understand sovereignty, Power structures, history, government, law, economic systems, and the basis of our own Citizenship in order to respond effectively and promptly to the crisis and challenge facing every human being on this planet. To exercise your right as a sovereign “state” Citizen is the ultimate act of patriotism, and the ultimate act of humanity. “ Frequent interchange will establish a common interest with every part of the community, they will mutually and naturally support each other, and on this depends the strength of government, and the happiness of the governed.” —Thomas Paine, Common Sense 4 Challenge Unlawful Activities of the Government American Citizens must challenge all unlawful searches, seizures, forfeitures, and the harassment and intimidation of the American people by the government corporation. Expect no justice in a desperate Power structure bankrupt to its core, financially and morally. If the government corporation disobeys the law, you have tyranny and there is little recourse for the law-abiding Cit- izen whether a U.S. citizen or a sovereign “state” Citizen. Restoring integrity to the justice system will require the participation of every American as a constant reminder to those officials who would willfully and flagrantly violate the law and their office. Practice the American law every chance you get. Initiate lawsuits against all politicians, bureaucrats, IRS agents, judges and police officers who have violated your civil rights in any action. Get it all on videotape. None of these actions ought to be initiated frivolously or without good, solid evidence of wrongdoing. Take your American law seriously. Citizens must challenge NAFTA and GATT as unconstitutional, abrogations of American law and the sovereignty of the American people. These are private, international contracts. Unknown to most people, GATT will eliminate the primary taxing authority of the federal United States (no tariffs or excises on international trading). GATT will set up an international tribunal without due process or representation for the common people. Citizens already have unalienable rights (provided they defend them). The government corporation only has the authority granted to it by the Citizens, and limited by the Constitution. International law is not superior. The United Nations Treaty is also unconstitutional as it surrenders the sovereignty of the United States to foreign powers, and transfers the allegiance of various officers of the federal United States to foreign powers (54 federal legislators recently voted to withdraw). Even the rights of parents are being usurped by the “UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CORC).” Bush and Clinton have already transferred the command of our armed forces to the UN under a Russian commander. Something very fishy is going on here. Our country is being auctioned off a piece at a time to the highest bidder. What price are we willing to pay for our institutionalized ignorance and inaction? So what are we willing to do to restore the republic and be politically sovereign as a nation? 1. Organize sovereign “state” Citizens into communications networks in each republic, linked globally with other sovereignty movements worldwide including indigenous peoples struggles for independence. Educate and encourage U.S. citizens and other freedom-loving people to reclaim their sovereignty. 2. Develop a strategic plan and agenda for restoring republics from the local level to the global level.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff would support a de jure president. Electors are landowners. Voter’s are landless tenants or residents. 4.

In summary, We the People must restore a constitutional republic in the united states of America by reclaiming our own American National and sovereign “state” Citizenship, then exercise our unalienable rights and defend them if necessary. We the People can restructure and reorganize our individual and business affairs to optimize the transitional tools and freedom technologies available to maximize wealth, security and privacy in our lives. We the People must abolish the Federal Reserve Banking System, terminate the Emergency & War Powers Acts, restore private banking and a constitutional money system, build the infrastructure for supporting the re-emergence of sovereignty for all the people worldwide. Sovereignty is awakening once again in the minds, hearts and souls of the people. May it spread like a brushfire throughout the world! Abolish the Federal Reserve System Presently, the Federal Reserve Bank has a legal monopoly as the federal United States government primarily borrows only from them. Even buying U.S. bonds has been discouraged as a bad investment. Only FRN’s are “legal tender” with the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government to back them up. It’ll take all the assets of the country and all the people in it to pay back a Ø15 trillion debt. It’s inconceivable! The Federal Reserve Banking system must be abolished, the federal debt repudiated and the currency deregulated to allow for competition in the marketplace for other “money substitutes.” Let’s get creative America! “ We are completely dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash or credit. If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system.... It is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon. It is so important that our present civilization may collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied very soon.” —Robert H. Hamphill, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank The Federal Reserve Banking system is the largest “counterfeiting” operation in the world. It is privately owned and operated. The federal United States government borrows FRNs from the Federal Reserve Bank because it cannot spend Treasury securities (T-bills) directly. Public investors have lost confidence in them. The FED cannot generate interest on its paper FRNs anymore than the federal government can spend its paper T- bills. So they trade FRNs for T-bills. Both the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and the federal United States government win big while the American taxpayers, consumers, citizens are the big-time losers in this scam. This has been going on for over 80 years without the “informed knowledge” of the American people, without a voice protesting loud enough. U.S. citizens are presumed under the 14th Amendment NOT to question the debt, thus are obliged to pay back this federal debt through an income tax on their labor, their wages, their property and their livelihoods. We the People “rent” a debt-based money system from the central banks at a staggering cost that includes the destruction of American sovereignty, our independence as a nation, and the ultimate bankruptcy of the American people. Wake up America! If you’ve got any unCOMMON SENSE, you’ll quickly conclude that this is an incredibly lucrative profit-making scheme that benefits the Federal Reserve Bank and its foreign principals/creditors immensely. I’d call it the scam of the century, the most lucrative pyramid scheme ever invented, and our best kept secret. - 277 -"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook This is your hard-earned, what ought to be “money,” replaced with worthless currency (Ø), taken directly from your back pocket and placed directly into the trust accounts of the international banking families without your knowledge or consent. Does this sound like usury, exploitation, and economic slavery? That’s exactly what it is! “ The few who understand the system, will either be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.” —Rothschild Brothers of London (1863) The Federal Reserve System was designed, in part, along with an income tax upon the American people in exchange for the federal United States government being able to borrow and spend as much as it could. Even though direct taxes upon individuals had been declared unconstitutional in the past, another direct income tax was imposed in the same year the Federal Reserve Act (1913), an income tax on corporate income that developed into the income tax system we have today. Prior to the Federal Reserve Banking system, warehouse banking provided an honest, effective and stable system of safekeeping your wealth and maintaining privacy. A customer deposited real wealth or substance in the form of gold or silver into a bank, received a warehouse receipt, “claim check” or “certificate of deposit” in return. WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS This redeemable receipt was an actual claim upon the assets of the bank, or as “good as gold.” Warehouse banks did not loan out their depositors’ money for interest (33:1), thus typically charged 2% on deposit and 2% on withdrawal. Notice that the cost of living under this system rose less than 1% from 1792 to 1913. 5 “ The Federal Reserve Banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen. There is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this Nation is run by the International Bankers.” —Congressman Louis T. McFadden The Federal Reserve Act must be declared unconstitutional and dismantled forever. We must repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and all subsequent legislation. The American people can buy out the Federal Reserve Bank whenever they acquire the political will. 6 The Federal Reserve Act clearly states that the federal United States government can buy back the Federal Reserve Bank at par value of the original stock, at any time. This amount would be less than the annual interest on the federal debt! Three States have passed resolutions to repeal the Federal Reserve Act (Alabama, Arizona and Washington). Others are certain to follow. Edward G. Griffin is organizing actions to Repeal the Federal Reserve Act. The federal United States government can direct the U.S. Treasury to issue interest-free loans to state and local governments by printing “U.S. Notes.” A “Sovereignty Resolution” has been circulating in Congress to restore debt- free currency. 7 The 60th Annual U.S. Conference of Mayors met in Houston (June 1992) and has resolved unanimously that the U.S. Congress create money and instruct the U.S. Treasury to issue it as interest-free loans to the states and local tax- supported bodies for the purpose of funding capital projects and for paying off existing debts. 8 The little country of Guernsey has operated since 1816 on this strategy and has a high standard of living, no unemployment, and no public debt . The Isle of Man in the British Isles is also debt-free. The united states of America could operate debt-free! Two U.S. Presidents who understood the basic, unconstitutional and exploitive nature of the central bank and Federal Reserve System were assassinated in office. Abraham Lincoln issued “greenbacks,” which were debt- free. Six months before his assassination (June 4, 1963), John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order #11.110 requiring the U.S. Treasury to begin issuing “U.S. Notes” in $2, $5, and $100 denominations, in defiance of the Federal Reserve System. Even Oliver Stone missed this connection in the popular movie JFK . An unsuccessful attempt was also made on President Andrew Jackson’s life. A “Petition for Redress of Grievances” Against IMF, the Federal Reserve Bank, the IRS and U.S. Congress has been circulated in to all members of Congress, the President of the United States, and the Governors of all 50 States. This 5,000 page report has also been presented to the supreme Court. “The People of the states united, hereby petition the shadow government, International Monetary fund (IMF), U.S. Congress assembled, the Legislative body of each of the several States, the governors of each of the several States, and the President of the United States; 1. repeal of the income tax along with the abolition of the agency known as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); 2. abolition of the War Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemies Act; and the complete dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); 3. repeal of the Federal Reserve Act and all subsequent legislation authorizing or empowering a central bank.” 9 Now it’s easy to grasp why America and its people are fundamentally bankrupt. Why don’t more people own their properties outright? Why are 90% of the American people mortgaged to the hilt and have little or no assets after all debts and liabilities have been paid?

We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the world— no longer a government of free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men.” —President Woodrow Wilson Emergency and War Powers Acts Senate Report 93-459 begins: “Since 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared national emergency...A majority of the people of the United States have lived all their lives under emergency rule. For 40 years, freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have in varying degrees been abridged by laws brought into force by states of national emergency. These proclamations give force to 470 provisions of federal law...delegating to the President extraordinary powers, ordinarily exercised by Congress...” These unnecessary and excessive powers belong to We the People, not to the President of the Federal, United States Corporation. The Constitution shall not be ignored by those with the duty and obligation to its allegiance.

Every elected Congressman and Senator knows that we are in a perpetual state of emergency, yet not one has the courage to speak openly on the record against these War Powers and Declared National Emergencies. Until these acts are repealed, the National Security Police State will thrive at the expense of the American people, their property, rights and liberties. Use the “Non-Statutory Abate - ment” to challenge the improper and fraudulent paperwork of the emergency war powers courts and agencies. 11 The Emergency and War Powers Acts must be lifted to restore the federal United States to a constitutional government. Both the Republican Party of California and Texas have included this provision in their position papers and party platforms. But we cannot depend on the government to do it without the people behind it. If the government fails to perform its duty, then it is the unalienable right of the inherent sovereign American National OR “state” Citizen to reconstruct and consummate a constitutional and lawful government for the united states of America, repatriate such a nation with sovereign Citizens, rebuild a constitutional Common law court system, and restore a sustainable economic system. It is the responsibility of the usurper and the occupying foreign powers to recognize, provide a proper foundation for, and support such efforts of reconciliation with the American people under the Law of Nations and international law. Even if the federal United States recognizes the inherent American sovereign tomorrow and apologizes for its war against the American people, the New World Order is still capable of occupying these united states through political, economic and legal means. The sovereignty of the united states of America has been impaired economically since the first bankruptcy of the federal United States in 1933 which precipitated the Emergency & War Powers Acts. The ultimate objective of the New World Order has always been to destroy the sovereignty of nation states and the people, then occupy and control all of them with the same international structures (e.g., International Monetary Fund, World Bank and United Nations). The tyrannies of our own government and the New World Order must be sent packing. Be aware that the New World Order can play the sovereignty card both ways and still win providing they maintain control over the economic system through the international bankers (e.g., Quebec, Kingdom of Hawai’i are potential examples of how the NWO gang can play the card both ways). To defeat the New World Order and restore constitutional government in the united states of America, a consensus of action must be achieved and a unifying direction taken by the inherent American sovereigns. If the American sovereignty movement cannot set aside its petty squabbles and agree on a strategic plan for action, the window of opportunity may close quickly and the usurpers may win the final battle by default. As with any movement, there are personality and ideological conflicts that detract from its effectiveness. - 279 -"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook It’s time for American patriots to set aside our personal agendas and career ambitions, and unite for the greatest good under the highest principles we can muster. The New World Order has already won a unilateral and unconditional surrender of 90% of the American people through ignorance and fear. Unless we get smarter and wiser than they are, and strategically unite, we may lose this one through entropy and attrition. First Round Defeat for Anti-Emergency Powers Bills California state Senator Don Rogers, a leader in state- sovereignty issues, saw his two latest bills defeated August 7 in the state Senate Judiciary Committee. They dealt with the president's emergency powers. “I was not overly optimistic that the committee would pass these measures going in, but I believe that this is an important issue which needs to be raised and debated,” said Rogers. “The subject of presidential emergency powers is one that is extremely important for the citizens of this nation, but it is also one that is little discussed and about which little is known.” The opening words of his Senate Concurrent Resolutions 57 leave no doubt about the seriousness of the situation: WHEREAS, It has become increasingly clear that members of our federal government, past and present, have acted to destroy the sovereignty of the State of California and to subvert the Constitution of the United States. The bill would have established a commission to report: [w]hether the federal government intends to repeal the emergency powers of the president and reinstate the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land... Citing U.S. Senate Report No. 93-549, Rogers’ Senate Joint Resolution 43 states: It is self-evident, after 61 years of ruling the states under emergency powers, that the federal government has no intention of solving the emergency and returning government to within the limits prescribed by the United States Constitution... This resolution would have “memorialized” (i.e., petitioned) the President and Congress to remedy the stated situations by: [p]roviding a non-interest-bearing and debt-free medium of exchange... [t]erminating all emergency powers permitting the federal government to rule the country without reference to normal Constitutional processes... [and] [o]utlining a plan to restore the American system of economic independence... If they failed to act within 90 days, a proposed meeting of the governors of at least 38 states which had passed similar resolutions would have discharged them and selected “an interim Chief Federal Administrative Officer and cabinet” to oversee government operations until a special election selected new officials. Noted Rogers, “Some of the emergency powers which the president has go back to World War I. With the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War II and the recent Cold War, many more powers have been added. [But] we have no ‘emergency’ before this nation. Our last real emergency ceased at the end of World War II in 1945. Yet these emer- gency powers are still retained. That is very scary, and these two measures place a spotlight on this whole matter.” 12 U.S. Senate Still Does Nothing to Terminate Emergency Powers September. 30, 1973 [Editor’s note: The wheels of responsibility in the U.S. Congress turn slowly. Since 1973, little or nothing has been done to alleviate the perpetual state of national emergency. We are in permanent crisis management modality.] WASHINGTON (UPI) — A special Senate subcommittee, after a painstaking computer search of the statute books, concluded (Sept. 29) the United States since 1933 has been operating under emergency rule, conferring near- authoritarian powers on its presidents. The subcommittee said it discovered 470 major provisions of federal law giving presidents “an enormous, seemingly expanding and never-ending range of emergency powers.” It recommended Congress act promptly to end four proclaimed states of national emergency by U.S. Presidents, which permit the president to invoke powers granted him under any of the 470 laws. Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the panel said, “the president may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.” The study was prepared by the Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency. Since 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested and received unprecedented peacetime powers to deal with the Great Depression, “The United States government has been operating under an unrelieved state of emergency of 40 years duration,” the committee said. “During this period, an enormous body of laws dealing with severe economic crisis and America's response to three wars has been passed by Congress through an almost unnoticed process of gradual accretion,” the committee said. There you have it. Now ponder what mass of additional presidential powers have been put in place during the 23 years since the UPI report. 13 Restoring a Constitutional Money System The bankrupt federal United States government has been reorganized for the benefit of the principal/creditor, not for the American people or any other nation of people in the world. The principal/creditor wants to be certain that you’re loaded with debt, struggles and burden to prevent you from ever asserting your sovereign American National OR “state” Citizenship, and eventually ending the rule by foreign, international bankers. Restoring a constitutional money system and an indepen - dent economy is crucial for asserting and reclaiming our sovereignty. We the People cannot be sovereign paupers, poor, penniless and without means. We must be economi - cally sovereign, as well as legally and politically sovereign. - 280 -"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Chapter Eighteen Restoring a Constitutional Money System To accomplish that we must be spiritually and emotionally sovereign, able to think and act independently and interdependently. With knowledge, courage and wisdom, We the People could repudiate the debt tomorrow, stop paying income taxes, remove ourselves from the system and privately take our business elsewhere and establish “another world order.” Furthermore, we don’t have to fight, go to war or take-on the whole system to make a significant and radical (i.e., root) change. As Buckminister Fuller said so well, “You don’t have to fight the system, just make it obsolete.” We the People need to reclaim our power and sovereignty, do our own thinking for a change, and create solutions to stop bleeding our life-force to death and participating in this economic giveaway. At anytime during our history, had enough people been awake to the truth and asserted their will to be free, this fraud could have, would have stopped dead in its tracks. Have we the courage and the vision to take back our country from the international “banksters,” from unscrupulous political parties, and elected officials? Or will we let America die a slow, painful death, like all other empires in history who failed to take notice? Wake up and smell the flowers! There is hope. The Dark Ages eventually gave way to the Renaissance. The new millennium is just around the corner. Unless We the People give voice to our lawful claim as American Nationals OR sovereign “state” Citizens, there can be little hope for the unborn generations from whom we have irresponsibly borrowed. We must reclaim our sovereignty on all levels. We are reaping what has been sown, and the results of our harvest is a painful bankruptcy, and a foreclosure on American property, precious liberties, and a way of life. Americans will wake up one day, homeless in the land of their forefathers, unless we abolish the Federal Reserve, restore a constitutional money system backed by gold and silver, a breadbasket of commodities and solar energy, the Constitution and the Common law of the land. “ Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness... Concerning all acts of initiative... there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans; that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.” —WH Murray First, We the People must reclaim our own sovereignty as American Nationals, OR “state” Citizens or sui juris freemen/ women by renouncing all our privileges, then we must demand our rights, and be prepared to defend them if necessary. If the national governments have relinquished their sovereignty by becoming mere corporations, then who are the stockholders? We the People are the stockholders! If the national governments have relinquished their sovereignty by debasing the money system and operating from bankruptcy, then who is beholden to the federal or national debt? Not the sovereign people. Only the slaves are subject to the debt. We can relinquish the fraudulent debt. Stop participating in economic activity that is bleeding you to death. Start building new foundations, restructuring your businesses and assets for preservation and wealth generation. Like the pyramid game, where everybody on the top is being supported by everybody on the bottom, when We the People stop blindly supporting the load of those above us, and pull out of the game, the entire pyramid comes crashing down. The entire house of cards comes crashing down and indeed the emperor has no clothes. Once 10% of the people leave the Federal Reserve trust and legislative democracy as “subjects,” and return to the republic as “sovereigns,” the U.S. Congress had better be prepared to perform according to the original constitutional contract. Restore sovereign “state” Citizens to the electoral college and veto the popular insanity of voting politicians instead of statesmen and stateswomen to public office. It’s time for a major housecleaning. Republics are not run by majority rule. The majority has never ruled anything in all of history. 14 Meanwhile We the People must stop paying income taxes and funding our own oppression. We must force our elected representatives, by law, to execute their mandated duties under constitutional Common law courts and venues convened by sovereign “state” Citizens. All the military veterans and members of our Armed Forces who have sworn an oath of allegiance are still under oath to come to the aid of the sovereign “state” Citizens in defense of his/her rights, under the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. If we be an honorable people, then our nation will be restored. “ The best way to control government spending is to take the money away from them.” —Sovereign Citizen The international bankers, transnational corporations, federal government, and other forces of economic occupation must be liened commercially and under the Common law to the full value of their equity in land and property held in the united states of America as restitution for the unlawful occupation and usurpation of these lands and the American people. Restitution must also be made to the indigenous North Americans whose land was stolen and cultures destroyed. Diplomatic relations must be established between all the sovereign people in the sovereign nations. Commercial and Common law liens must be perfected for both negotiable and non-negotiable instruments. Security or militia forces may be required to collect on these liens. The liens, if uncollectible, can be discounted and sold to brokers who can offer them on the international market. - 281 -"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Common law liens will be deposited in a provisional Trea - sury or Sovereign Trust. Commercial liens can be deposited in an Independent Bank chartered by the restored govern - ment of the constitutional republic of the united states of America. American people will be encouraged to deposit their equity into this bank and become it’s primary stock - holders. This will be the basis for economic recovery and a redistribution of wealth. Economic policies will be developed for facilitating the development of a sustainable economic system backed on gold/silver standard (e.g., Taiwan, China, Isle of Man, Guernsey and others are examples of debt-free, independent nations not subject to the IMF and their economic policies). For more than a generation, we’ve anticipated the next great crash, the readjustment of our massive and spiraling debt. America, it’s time to pay your dues, it’s time to pay your debt. America, it’s not too late, yet. America, your lifestyles of mass consumption are over. America, your children will suffer from your ignorance and greed for generations to come. America, take your place in history as yet another fallen civilization. America, you can once again rise from the ashes and become a great nation.” —Johnny Light Police and Military Against the New World Order Not all police officers, military personnel or government officials are complacent and supportive of the New World Order and the abrogation of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. When government agents murdered the Weavers in Idaho, it almost started a war. There are reports that US military veterans were about to take over the National Guard Armory with the intent to use the armored vehicles against the government. All public officials and police officers have taken a solemn oath (as a matter of public record) to uphold the Constitution and defend our country against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. Retired Police Officer Jack McLamb asserts that many police officers are alarmed and opposed to the assault being waged against this nation of free people by un-American interests at home and abroad. The cop on the beat is closer to the reality of what’s happening in America than most people. It’s estimated that over 76% of the people in the armed services refuse to serve under the blue hat Generals (i.e., United Nations). To remain a free country, Americans must join with the Police, Guardsmen and Military along with their countrymen in the private sector. 15 Individuals, organizations or government officials who are delivering us into the hands of a sovereign Power structure through the “legal” overthrow of the lawful, constitutional governments of the United States would be guilty of sedition. Americans of all races, religions and political beliefs must claim the right and responsibility to defend the Republic against all enemies foreign and domestic. 16 It is the responsibility of patriotic, articulate American citizens to educate police officers and other government officials about our legitimate concerns, while avoiding unnecessary police confrontations. Most police officers are trained to operate in “code red” when interacting with a Citizen, because so many police officers are killed each year. It’s important to make the officer feel comfortable. As soon as a police officer steps out of his car, he also steps out of his uniform and becomes a private citizen (i.e., color of uniform). The police officer also becomes personally liable for any constitutional violations of a state Citizen’s rights. 17 If the police arrive at your home or business, they will first secure the premises for their own safety before showing you a warrant or arresting you. They might break down the door and point a dozen guns at your head long before they’ve presented any search warrant. This is standard police procedure. Once they’ve secured the premises, ask to see the search warrant. Do not, under any circumstances, help them with the search. Ask them if you’re under arrest or under investigative detention. If not, then technically you’re free to go. You have a right to an attorney, or to represent yourself. You have a right to remain silent. Resisting arrest is a felony in many places, so cooperate and use lawful means. 18 Federal agents have no jurisdiction over you without the cooperation of the local and State police authorities. If the local or state authorities cooperate with the federal agents who in turn violate your rights or act improperly under the law, the local or state authorities become personally liable. You can file charges or perfect a lien against their property. Americans have a healthy distrust and genuine fear of the police partly because of the Rodney King incident in Los Angeles, and an alarming trend of large-scale, military-style police operations resulting in the deaths of innocent citizens (e.g., Branch Davidian compound outside of Waco, Texas). Many of these operations are being controlled and planned by federal agents and executed by secret, no-insignia national police forces. Remember, the County Sheriff is the chief executive of the County, superior to the Governor, the President of the United States, and superior to the Internal Revenue Service so far as county matters are concerned. The duties of the sheriff are without equal. The oath of the sheriff is to uphold the sovereignty of the state and protect sovereign Citizens. - 282 -"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Chapter Eighteen Police and Military Against the New World Order “ Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American... The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.” —Pennsylvania Gazette (February 20, 1788) Citizens Militia and Non-Violence We the People must maintain a lawful “Citizens Militia” of 10,000,000 Americans unwilling to surrender their weapons through unlawful registration or confiscation. There are 10,000—12,000 active members in Michigan alone, with active militias in about 18 states. This contempo - rary militia movement grew as an offshoot and response to excessive federal actions at Waco and Ruby Ridge. “ A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of the free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. —2nd Amendment Your right to bear arms is an unalienable right providing you’re a sovereign “state” Citizen. The 2nd Amendment preserves your right to bear arms. There are over 250 million weapons in the hands of private civilians in the usA. A recent Gallup poll concluded that 70,000,000 Americans would use their guns to defend themselves against their own government if necessary to preserve their life or liberty. 19 Your right to organize a Citizens Militia as a last resort against government encroachment is also irrefutable in the American law. 20 Be prepared to fight and defend your liberties without jumping the gun. Force is always the last resort and for self-defense only, not your first, gut-reaction. I do not support paramilitary groups that have taken it upon themselves to be the leaders of a revolt, or violent revolution. Support the local Citizens Militia in your state that are willing to defend the Constitution and the sovereignty of the people. Be prepared to organize and utilize nonviolent, civil disobe - dience whenever possible utilizing Gandhian principles. The attributes and effectiveness of boycotts, general strikes, sit-downs, and protests cannot be underestimated when facing a better armed opponent. Be warriors of the heart prepared to love your enemy as Jesus did. Retired Police Officer Jack McLamb is actively educating people in the armed forces, police agencies and national guard. A Marine General commented recently that they understand the threat, can fight and win against the New World Order, but wondered if the American people would stand with them? The Joint Chiefs of Staff would support a de jure president if elected. Support the individuals and regiments within the armed forces, police agencies and national guard willing to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. 21 Resist gun confiscation of both sniper-type and assassin- type weapons. Resist national identity cards, national health cards, smart cards, etc. Find ways around them. Resist expanded surveillance and the continued erosion of privacy rights through computer-fax-phone clipper chips. Develop technological alternatives to ensure privacy rights. Resist the government’s preparations for war against the American people. Be aware that the war on drugs and crime is a mask and justification for the government’s preparations for war against the American people, that the prisons being built are for your neighbors and friends who are no more “criminals” than you are. Expose the existence of and resist the concentration camps, detention, forced labor camp plans for U.S. Citizens. 22 Resist FINCEN, the emerging and well-organized, global gestapo of the New World Order (83,000 presently on their payroll). Resist BATF, the FDA and Waco-style commando raids against all Americans without due process of the law. Support and encourage those who have been the subject of these commando-style raids. American law prohibits the military from being utilized against civilians. Get everything on video. Network it widely. Let the world understand what happens to America, happens also to them. Kitchen Militia Mobilizes The Kitchen Militia is a group of little old ladies, mothers, grandmothers — women armed with information, FAX machines, telephones and stationary. “We educate ourselves, get copies of laws, stay abreast and try to notify people about what's going on,” says Kathy McDaniel, Membership Director of the Louisiana Kitchen Militia. “I have five children from 26 to eight-years-old, so I think I have a real vested interest in what's going on in this country,” she said. The Kitchen Militia began in Louisiana about three months ago and has already spread to ten states. “You know how some women get depressed? Well, this gives the ladies something to do,” Mrs. McDaniel said. “We're not going to storm anybody in fatigues with guns; I've never shot anything but a BB gun, but I'll tell you one thing, they're going to get some lip service.” 23 Militias and Patriots Making People Nervous [Editor’s Note: Beware of the source. Klanwatch is a publication of the Southern Poverty Law Center and has been extremely prejudicial and inflammatory in its treatment of the sovereignty movement.] According to Klanwatch, being quoted in USA Today, there are now at least 809 patriot organizations in the nation. There are 441 militias, 108 common law courts, with the remainder falling in the category of “other patriot groups.” Klanwatch says 138 of these groups have racist philosophies. According to Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan), the less extreme folks have peeled off from the militia movement when they observed the fanaticism therein, “But the remnant is tighter, more fanatical and more dangerous.” - 283 -"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The most extreme members have adopted “leaderless resistance,” a strategy of forming into small, secret groups that operate independently to avoid detection and infiltration. Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano in Michigan says police are monitoring a recent surge of short-wave radio transmissions of racist views and militant calls to arms. “What we're seeing is a real fringe element shakeout, clusters with a more extreme tendency toward violence,” he said. “Nobody wants to sound like an alarmist, but you've got to be concerned.” State officials in Arizona say they've been working with the FBI to gather intelligence on violent splinter groups, and police in Junction City, Kansas were tracking several men who frequently deal survival equipment and guns. Hard-line militants “are growing weary of doing the same old thing, and they're taking steps closer to the edge,” said Joe Roy of Klanwatch. “That's where they are today, literally out there on the edge.” 24 Tri-States Militia on FBI Payroll Testimony at the bombing conspiracy trial of 70-year-old Willie Rae Lampley revealed that John Parsons, of the Tri- State Militia in Burke, South Dakota, has been on the FBI's payroll for seven months. An article in the April 7, 1996 edition of Tulsa World says the FBI was paying $1,775 a month to fund Tri-State's Communication Information Center so “the federal government (could) better understand the workings of the burgeoning movement and possibly prevent tragedies.” FBI Special Agent William Grode, based in Rapid City, South Dakota, said Parsons has become a calming voice for militias across the country, although he does not consider him an informant. Grode said he was told to make contacts in the militia movement after the Oklahoma City bombing. The incident has caused yet another fracture among militia groups. A statement by J.J. Johnson on behalf of the Ohio Unorganized Militia declares they have severed all communications with Tri-State and its supporters. It says in part, “E Pluribus Unum will not tolerate, endorse, or communicate with any so-called Patriots, Militia organizations, or Militia members giving aid and comfort to any federal agency for any reason, whatsoever, period.” The Militia of Montana (MOM) on the other hand said, “Nothing changes. We have been in communication with John Parsons from Tri-States and will continue to be...We believe John Parsons to be sincere in his motives. He believed he was preventing possible acts of terrorism.” 25 Georgia Militia Members Framed on Bombing Charge [Editor’s Note: A number of militia members have been thoroughly framed and entrapped by federal agents and informants. Is there any justice in this system?] On Monday, May 6, 1996, in a larger court room than was used for the bond hearing, the probable cause (preliminary) hearing for Bob Starr and Jimmy McCranie produced yet another packed house. After passing through metal detectors, Dr. Nancy Lord was forced to remove her watch and shoes, was not allowed to use the U.S. court library, and the federal agents even hesitated to let her file her motions (play the government's audio tape) in the clerk's office. Instead, they offered to send a U.S. marshal to receive her documents. J.J. Johnson was virtually molested after passing through the metal detectors. At 2:00 P.M., the government introduced the transcript of the bond hearing. Dr. Nancy Lord, attorney for Bob Starr, demanded and was granted the right to cross-examine the government's lone witness. — BATF Special Agent Steven Gillis. Special thanks go out to Agent Gillis for his contradictions, concessions, and confessions while under oath. In his testimony, he admitted the following: 1. There was no interstate commerce, therefore allowing a challenge to federal jurisdiction (U.S. v Lopez). 2. After 10 days, the chemicals found on Starr's property have yet to be tested by any scientific laboratory. 3. Gillis could not identify a specific agreement between anyone except government agents, therefore... no conspiracy. 4. Jimmy McCranie was not at the meeting to discuss bomb-making, and wanted nothing to do with making bombs. 5. Bob Starr did not want bomb-making material on his property. 6. Bob Starr did not have possession of any bomb- making material. 7. There never were any pipe bombs, and the “bomb- making factory” consisted of two small sandwich bags of legally obtainable chemicals. 8. Gillis was aware that Starr had numerous conversations with federal law enforcement, and he also knew that Starr had been told by an FBI contact about an FBI threat to his life, one day before the warrant for his arrest was issued. 9. The only people who came tobomb-making sessions were government agents. 10. Government informants placed the evidence (bomb- making material) on Starr's property. That's right folks... Special Agent Steven Gillis of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) admitted to all of this in open court. Has it occurred to anyone that the wrong guys are in jail? U.S. District Court Judge Wilbur D. Owens Jr. denied bond for the two men, saying the charges were “serious offenses involving allegations of manufacturing explosive devices which are capable of ... destruction of persons or property.” “This is beyond entrapment,” Lord said. “It is manufactured evidence. The materials were put on Mr. Starr's property without his knowledge.” “The whole evidence upon which this case was based was fraudulent,” she said.

Truman Tennessee Volunteer Militia Defined Editor’s Note: Thanks to the Tennessee Volunteer Militia for this piece. What is important to the militia is what is important to all Americans. We are concerned with the health of this nation. Militia members are a cross section of the American people. Many of us have been active in the political realm to voice our opinion to our elected leaders. Our voice has yet to be heard. The militia is a formation of communities. This is true now as it was throughout the history of this land. We the people have gathered together to form one voice in the hope that we will be heard. Our communities are banding together across this country to form one voice which is getting louder each day. It is not the guns of the militia that our government fears, we have not fired a single shot. The people are uniting together as one, to bring out the truth, justice and liberty that we have entrusted to our government, which it has taken for granted. We the people have seen over the years the erosion of our country and have sought to seek answers and justice. The assassination of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr., the incidence at Ruby Ridge and Waco have all had their Senate hearings and to this day justice has not been served. We the people have been told that these matters are closed. We the people will not accept a lie for the truth. We have seen Americans sacrifice their lives in undeclared wars for the United Nations. Now we are asked to send more Americans into harms way once more. To what end and purpose does this sacrifice serve? Our Constitution is under attack from all sides. We the people will not give up the guaranties that keep us from being ruled by a tyrannical government. These guaranties are called the Bill of Rights. The militia will continue forward to seek the truth and to speak with a loud voice. If you believe in America and its freedoms and if you are concerned about our America's future then you are with us in the militia. We are only Americans! Any other description of us shows only a lack of knowledge and faith in the people of this country. The Tennessee Volunteer Militia exists by law under Amendment II of the United States Constitution, U.S.C. 10chapter. 13- section 311 and the Tennessee State Constitution Article ISections 24 and 26. Our purpose is to uphold the United States and Tennessee State Constitution. Constitutions defend against domestic enemies, execute and safeguard the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasions. We adhere to the literal and original intent of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights as put forth by the Founding Fathers and hold those principles inviolate. We reject any philosophy of supremacy based on race, religion or gender. 27 Posse Comitatus A “posse” is not a vigilante group like the media and government want you to believe, but all men between age 18-45, in good health and not in federal military service. These men comprise the “posse of a county” and are expected to answer a call to arms by their county sheriff. > POSSE— the power or force of the county (i.e., comitatus). The county sheriff is the Chief Executive Officer of the sovereign state. A dutiful sheriff poses a serious threat to those in government who would subvert our basic rights. De jure states are never political subdivisions of a central government. Nor are the counties political subdivisions of the states, but distinct political bodies. 27 Home Rule One-hundred and sixty counties, mostly in the Western states, have instituted local resolutions calling for “home rule” in their Counties with management over the federal lands within the States. This is referred to as the “Sagebrush Rebellion” which has spread like a brushfire throughout the rural counties of the West. County Commissioner Dick Carver of Nye County, Nevada has been the leader of this movement and is pre-sently in federal court in Las Vegas arguing their case. “Home rule” is a road paved with good intentions, similar to the “10th Amendment Resolutions” various States have recently passed, which falls seriously short in their understanding of the nature of sovereignty. They do not seem to realize that Counties and States are impaired in their status as sovereigns. So are the County Commissioners, State Senators and Representatives, as are the U.S. citizens who are passing the resolutions. Furthermore, resolutions are not law, but non- binding recommendations. Ordinances are law and can only be passed while a County is acting in their sovereign capacity. The County of X and the State of X are political subdivisions or Agents of the federal United States government. They are not sovereign counties or states, but branch offices of the federal corporation. X county and X state are sovereign entities that must have inherent sovereign American Nationals OR “state” Citizens within their jurisdiction to exist or to act in their sovereign capacity, and they cannot be bankrupt. - 285 -"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Although the County and States can pass non-binding resolutions as a corporation, they can only pass ordinances or public laws in their sovereign capacity. Thus all this flutter about “home rule” and the 10th Amendment Resolutions by these Agents of the federal corporation, with a few exceptions, amounts to a minor mutiny on a sinking corporate ship of State. These resolutions are not cognizable under the Common law or the Law of Nations because the entities are bankrupt. It must be taken to a deeper level to be politically effective. Restore the sovereignty, then pass real laws that are binding. When the federal United States declared bankruptcy in 1933, the sovereign counties and states were subjected to the debt and could no longer operate in law. When Federal Reserve Notes (FRN’s) were declared legal tender for the payment of debt, sovereignty transferred to the creditors of the government who now direct its affairs. When Counties and States receive one dollar of federal “debt” money, along with the federal mandates, regulations, laws, the Counties and States become the obliges in a commercial contract. Now, they must perform according to the terms of the contract. They cannot breech the contract unless they reclaim their sovereignty and revoke the contract based on fraud, malfeasance, collusion and raise the issue of bankruptcy in the court. They must also argue against the “Emergency & War Powers Acts” and lift the declared state of emergency. Then the door can open once again to reclaiming what is rightfully the local control over resources, land and property rights. Jural Societies and Townships There are more than twenty self-governing “jural societies” in various stages of formation around the nation. A jural society is defined as a group of men and women gathered together for a specific purpose; that is, self-government by contract, charter and bylaws. “These societies sometimes referred to as “townships” are about communities of sovereign people exercising options of self-determination and peaceful coexistence with those outside the scope of their chosen law.” There are two requirements for membership that are fundamental: “One: potential members must be free of legal obligation to any other governing structure; Two: members must be able (from a geographic perspective) to participate and contribute to the process.” John Quade and Randy Lee of the American Jural Society has been setting them up in numerous locations around the usA and also teaching people how to use the non-statutory abatement process. “A township can lawfully be geographic, or common purpose. A geographic township is an area six miles square containing thirty-six square miles of land, surveyed through order of Congress. The free inhabitants of the township are free to organize their own “peer” jural system of township government. A common purpose township is an organized group of people who have pledged to a common purpose.” “Each township is a “little America” all in itself, each having its own local legislative, executive and judicial departments of government.” “The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided for township organizations with a common purpose to seek Law and Truth. The Revolutionary War was fought and won based on the principle that the lands of America should be held in Free and Common Socage, free from the jurisdiction and control of the State. The State will always use our right to contract to regulate and tax anything and anyone it can to increase its revenues.” “The original Homestead Acts did not allow for corporations to own land, except for the railroad which was of great benefit to the People. At that time in our history Congress knew what would happen if the powerful corporations could get their hands on the land. The early statesmen knew the land belonged to the People, not to the bankers who backed the corporations and corporate governments.” Township members, having the proper character to hold land, can remove the presumption of corporate ownership of land and reclaim this country one township at a time. Your township can be established “within and without” a specific county on the land of your state republic (e.g., within and without Maricopa county, not the County of Maricopa, and within and without the country of Arizona, not the State of Arizona). Jeffrey Thayer and Melanie Miller have been instrumental in setting up townships in Arizona and elsewhere. 30 Restoring the Constitutional Republic Restoring the sovereignty of the united states of America and exporting that freedom to the rest of the world is a global top priority for all Americans. America is the only country in the world where the sovereignty is presently vested in We the People. If the light of liberty goes out in America, I grieve for the world’s future as well as our own. We must stop exporting our tyrannical, Socialist-Democratic foreign policy of oppression and economic slavery. Let’s invite the light of freedom to shine at the dawn of a new millennium. Americans must not unconditionally surrender to the tyranny that is creeping, indeed, marching steadfast upon this land. Do not surrender your bodies, hearts or souls to tyranny, injustice, fascists, communists or any other iron fist. Strengthen your resolve. All activities of the New World Order are well coordinated regardless of whether or not you can prove a conspiracy theory. These are irrefutable facts, not conspiracy theories. Get the united states of America out of the United Nations and encourage other countries to do the same, until the people of the world are all sovereigns. Demand that the UN and all globalist organizations be accountable to the people of the world, not the small-minded, elitist Power structure of the New World Order (bankers, corporations and nation-states). Ambassador Allbright has recently commented at the UN that “the people of the usA will have to surrender their sovereignty.” 31 Schoolchildren no longer “pledge allegiance to the republic for which it stands,” or to the American flag. - 286 -"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Chapter Eighteen Restoring the Constitutional Republic Even at sport’s events, you will observe that most people do not cross their heart, nor sing the National Anthem. Notice how rarely, if ever, the concept of sovereignty is mentioned in any media, or in the schools. I never once heard the word in any of my political science education. That’s because sovereignty is a key central concept around which all political, economic and legal system revolve. It a concept that’s been relegated to a small elite for so long, that it is no longer in popular usage. Despite the fact that sovereignty is the source of authority from which all law and governments arise. Recognize and admit that the CIA and our supposed National Security State is not operating in the interests of the American people, but are strongly anti-American in sentiment, philosophy and action (as are most operating agencies of the federal government, transnational corporations, banks and the New World Order). Recognize that a secret war has been waged against the united states of America since the founding of the nation 220 years ago.This war has escalated in intensity through massive brainwashing, programming and other subtle means of control and domination. The object of this secret war is to destroy the sovereignty of the united states of America, the United States and the freeborn American sovereign “state” Citizens. This time around We the People must restore the sovereignty of the state Republics, and the sovereignty of the “state” Citizens for all people regardless of race, creed, color or sex. We must declare that the 14th Amendment was a fraud instituted under martial law during the Civil War, and therefore invalid. That the activities of the U.S. Congress since 1913 have been largely unconstitutional and fraudulent in nature and must be repudiated. That the private banking institutions are unconstitutional, and the federal debt must be repudiated as a fraud as well. That public policy and spin doctors manipulating public opinion are no replacement for the American system of law and governance. This must be restored, reclaimed and respected at all costs. It’s long overdue that we organize a political party, judicial reform, and take legal action as Citizens to restore this constitutional republic. 32 Strategic alliances and diplomatic relationships must be consummated between all the sovereign nations of the world and quite “another world order” created from the ashes of the old, dying internationalist system. The New World Order violates numerous principles of natural law and it has no popular support. Therefore, it will ultimately fail. Another vision for the next millennium must be brought forward and presented to the people. The next millennium will bring forth and recognize 3,000 sovereign nations on this planet established under the Law of Nations, allied economically and diplomatically. We the People will all be sovereigns extending our deepest respect and regard to each other. We will also treat the land and our environment with respect and recognize the sacred nature of life. To destroy our very life support system on this planet would be a terrible sin (i.e., missing the target). We the People will all have unalienable rights derived from the Creator, not equal civil rights as government slaves. We will begin behaving as good sovereign individuals taking responsibility for ourselves, our families and our communities. We the People will demonstrate competence and integrity in our daily lives and work with others to reconstruct, rehabilitate and re-inhabit a republican form of self- government. People will begin to do what they talk about, aligning their thoughts, words and deeds with the natural law. Healthy individual and family systems will be reestablished through communities of trust and various healing modalities.

To act with whatever aid is possible in salvaging their lands and sovereignty. With all prayer, the People of the Republic of Texas shall, where possible, help in fostering world peace and friendship and respect to all cultures and religions as private and sacred to all human beings.\" —Plans & Powers of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas 1 Editor’s Note: Alaska, Hawai’i and Texas are three examples of irregular States. Each is purported to be a state of the Union on equal footing with the other state republics. Texas was an independent nation prior to its voluntary admission into the Union before the Civil War. It has since restored its independence at law distinct from the United States. The Kingdom of Hawai’i was also an independent nation, a republic, prior to its overthrow by the U.S. military in 1893. It has two executive branches and the sovereign lineage of Hawai’i still holds titles to the land there. Both Alaska and Hawai’i entered the Union directly as federal States, not sovereign states of the republic. In that, Alaska and Hawai’i became the precedent for the other forty-eight states of the Union to become federal States also under Article IV territorial jurisdiction of the federal United States. Large segments of the Citizenry of these federal States have recently caught wind of this immense fraud, and are blowing the horn of independence. 2 When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the Posterity and people of Alaska to ensure domestic Tranquility, Justice, Peace, Prosperity, and a Republican form of government for the Alaska territory, and to protect the self-evident truths of our God-given unalienable rights to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness, a decent respect to this present government requires that the Posterity and people of Alaska should declare the causes which impel us to make this Petition for Redress of Grievances. No government can exist without the consent of the governed. When it becomes apparent that government or agents of foreign powers are violating the rights of the people granted to us by our Creator and secured and protected by the organic laws of this nation; and when many of the people of Alaska have individually petitioned this government for redress of grievances, issued freedom of information act requests, requested explanations of government actions and have been repeatedly ignored and treated with contempt; and when the abuse of these rights continues and even escalates, then it is the right, duty and responsibility of the Posterity and people of Alaska to declare openly our indubitable rights, liberties and sovereignty; and to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as to restore the proper relationship of government to its true masters. The rights of the Posterity and people of Alaska have been abridged or usurped by fraud and misrepresentation imposed by various governments and their agencies through the use of statutes, ordinances, regulations, zoning and states of emergency enforced by their courts to displace the Bill of Rights and the Common law. This abuse is an abrogation and derogation of the Common law secured by the Constitution of the “United States Organic Act of 1787” as lawfully amended by qualified electors of the foreign states and by the Northwest Ordinances of 1787. Whereas, for true ownership of lands, it is an ancient Maxim of Law that no title is valid unless the right of possession be joined with the right of property: which right is then denominated a double right, jus duplicatum, or droit droit. Droit droit is also known as allodial title or allodium estate. Right of property and right of possession are not taught in our schools, nor explained by government agencies, lending institutions, lawyers, real estate companies or title insurance companies. > DROIT DROIT— synonymous with allodial title or allodium estate; when the right of property and the right of possession are joined, a double right; signifies a complete title in land. The State of Alaska, Alaska State Legislature, Municipalities, Boroughs and other political subdivisions of the State of Alaska have allowed, participated in and encouraged lending institutions, banks, credit unions, title companies, and real estate companies to replace and represent a true mortgage with a Deed of Trust and Rents document. This Deed of Trust and Rents, via fraud, misrepresentation, concealment and deception, insures that the banks and other lending institutions own the real property through the operative word beneficiary, a euphemism for cestui que trust. > CESTUI QUE TRUST— beneficiary of a trust; estate or property to which the legal title is vested in another. The contempt of our forefathers towards the cestui que trust is clearly shown by the 1843 Bouvier's Law Dictionary, which defines a cestui que trust as “barbarous.” The concerted effort to continue to defraud the people by substitution of the word beneficiary for cestui que trust is clearly demonstrated by the definition of cestui que trust found in Black's Law Dictionaries of 1891 and 1910: “It has been proposed to substitute for this uncouth term the English word 'beneficiary,' and the latter, though still far from universally adopted, has come to be quite frequently used. It is equal in precision to the antiquated and unwieldy Norman phrase, and far better adapted to the genius of our language.” - 291 -"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook The current version of Black's 6th Edition Law Dictionary continues the deception by not defining “beneficiary” as a cestui que trust. We the People unknowingly as the Trustor in the Deed of Trust and Rents donate the real property through the operative word beneficiary to the lending institutions. As the vested owners of the real property, the lending institutions are entitled to profits from their real property by the land occupier or occupier of land (§3 ch 82 SLA 1960), which translates into a politically correct term — land use! This endless tribute of rent from tenants (the people) to the lending institutions manifests itself yearly as property taxes (i.e., trustee compensation fees), which we pay because we do not truly own the real property. This deception continues, since we are led to believe when the debt on the property to the lending institution has been satisfied on the Deed of Trust and Rents, that we own the real property, which is untrue. The State of Alaska reinforces this fraudulent belief of ownership by issuing a document called a Warranty Deed, which conveys to us the status of being the equitable owner. But in reality, the equitable owner has no rights in the real property. The true owners are the legal owners or trustees, which are the lending institutions. In actuality, banks, lending institutions and the government own almost all real property in Alaska. The Legislature of the State of Alaska has intentionally legislated the English feudal tenant status upon the Posterity and people of Alaska, as demonstrated by the Session Laws of 1960 chapter 82 under definitions: “for the purposes of this Act, the term ‘land occupier’ or ‘occupier of land’ means any person, firm or corporation who shall hold title to, or shall be in possession of, three or more acres of land in the State, whether as owner, lessee, renter, tenant, or otherwise.” [Emphasis added] WHEREAS the Legislature of the State of Alaska in 1959 to assure the control of the tenants (the people), created an “Office of the Governor” which is defined in Black’s 4th Law Dictionary: “But a power and duty may exist without immediate grant from government, and may be properly called an ‘office,’ as the office of executor, the office of steward. Here the individual acts towards legatees or towards tenants in performance of a duty, and in exercise of a power not derived from their consent, but devolved on him by an authority which quoad hoc is superior.” Whereas, Alaska has three constitutions consisting of: 1. The “Constitution of the State of Alaska” was voted on by the Posterity and people of Alaska. (Killed by session law in 1963 chapter 1). 2. The “Alaska Constitution” was created by the Legislators of the State of Alaska via several session laws in 1959 and is unknown by the Posterity and people of Alaska. 3. The “Alaska State Constitution,” is the current constitution, an internally modified version of the original Constitution of the State of Alaska. This unlawful de facto Alaska Constitution consists of the following session laws of 1959: 1. Chapter 169 on the land itself,complete with a Preamble. 2. Chapter 143 on administrative procedures for executive, quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative agencies of the State. 3. Chapter 50 on the supreme and superior courts. 4. Chapter 94 on Fish and Game. The Legislature of the State of Alaska now operates as a territorial government known as the “Alaska State Legislature.” This name is used on their letterheads, Legislative Information Office Marquees and other State documentation. These territorial legislators did offer to the registered voters two amendments to the Alaska Constitution that were passed. They are: 1. The first amendment was in 1970: “Proposing amendments to the judiciary article of the Alaska Constitution relating to the office of the chief justice of the supreme court.” 2. The second amendment was: “Proposing an amendment to the Alaska Constitution, establishing an Alaska Permanent Fund for certain proceeds derived from non-renewable resources.” Today, even with the positive documentation of the Alaska Constitution in the session laws of 1959 and two adopted amendments, executive and legislative members staunchly deny the existence of this constitution, and state that the discrepancy of words used is insignificant. Contrary to these official denials, the Lieutenant Governor distributes through the Legislative Information Office a free handout dated April 1995, entitled The Constitution of the State of Alaska. Inside, on page 1, the Lt. Governor refers only to the “Alaska State Constitution,” omitting any reference to the “Constitution of the State of Alaska.” This Alaska Constitution is printed today in the Alaska Statutes in various titles (parts of title 16, title 22, title 44, and title 38) to disguise its existence. How many constitutions for the “State of Alaska,” “Alaska,” “this state,” or “Alaska State” exist, and what is the purpose of each? Why are these constitutions hidden from the Posterity and people of Alaska? By what authority do the legislators and the executive alter this legal instrument, known as the “Constitution of the State of Alaska?” Is this not a flagrant betrayal of the public trust? Whereas, the Posterity and people of Alaska were duped into voting for a constitution which imposed no limits on the power of the legislature. This fact was known and supported by the founders of the “Constitution of the State of Alaska,” as stated by the Daily News Miner of February 6, 1956 on the front page: “ The legislative department is strong because the constitution leaves so much for the future legislators to accomplish, and because the constitution puts no serious restriction on the power of the legislature.” Using this unlimited power, the legislature of the State of Alaska created a Legislative Branch in the Session Laws of - 292 -"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Chapter Nineteen Alaska: An Irregular State 1959 chapter 157 with no limits to its power, except to operate within the people’s perception of a lawful legislature. This legislative chameleon-like transformation from a bicameral republican form of government consisting of a senate and house of representatives, to a territorial government composed of a legislature with two houses is demonstrated by three different stages. The first stage is the “Constitution of the State of Alaska.” The second stage is the Legislative Branch created by the Legislature of the State of Alaska. The third stage is the codified legislature of the Legislative Branch Act in the Alaska Statutes at Title. 24 Whereas, the State of Alaska officials have denied the existence of the Territory of Alaska, as recorded in United States Code Title 16 Section 3201, Definitions (3)(A) “land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved or validly selected under the Alaska Statehood Act and lands which have been confirmed to, validly selected by, or granted to the Territory of Alaska or the State under any other provision of Federal law;” [Emphasis added] This parallel existence of the Territory of Alaska and the State of Alaska is further validated in many parts of the Code of Federal Regulations, such as 50 C.F.R. §100.4, 36 C.F.R. § 242.4, 50 C.F.R. §36.2 and 34 C.F.R. §13.1 (1996), which also states: “Land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved or validly selected under the Alaska Statehood Act (72 Stat. 339) and lands which have been confirmed to, validly selected by, or granted to the Territory of Alaska or the State under any other provision of Federal law. ...” This dual existence is further validated at 22 C.F.R. § 133.1; 43 C.F.R. § 2623.0-8; and 26 C.F.R. § 31.3401(a)(5)-1. The Territory of Alaska latitude and longitude areas are recorded in the Code of Federal Regulations at 14 CFR Sec. 95.17. A picture of the Territory of Alaska in 1962 is recorded in the Federal Register at 27 FR 4356, May 8, 1962. Still, the State of Alaska government officials refuse to acknowledge the existence of the Territory of Alaska — even with the conclusive documentation provided to them. Whereas, the true Common law and equity courts are the law for the sovereign people to maintain control of our government. The State of Alaska government and its officials have concealed from the people of Alaska our true common law courts, as secured by the Seventh Amendment of Bill of Rights of the Constitution for the united states of America. We the Posterity and people of Alaska demand to know the location, the rules of court and the seals of the real Common law court or in the alternative, if they have been suspended and by what authority. Whereas, the State of Alaska government and officials thereof have concealed the identity of public officials of the Territory of Alaska.

We, the Posterity and people of Alaska, demand to know the following regarding the State of Alaska: 1. Who are the public servants and what are their responsibilities? It seems that many of the public servants carry several titles and job responsibilities to more than one governmental agency, entity or corporation? 2.

THEREFORE, the Constitution of the State of Alaska, Alaska Statutes, Alaska Administrative Code and all instrumentalities in one form or another of the State of Alaska have no effect, no jurisdiction and are null and void on the lawful citizens of the United States of America (also known as citizens of the foreign states). 30 Independence for the Hawai’i(an) People Editor’s Note: Similar escapades occurred during the illegal overthrow and annexation of the Kingdom of Hawai’i as a federal State. The Akaka Resolution (P.L. 103-150), otherwise known as the “Apology Bill,” was recently passed by Congress and signed by President William Clinton. It has recognized the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai’i on January 17, 1893, and apologizes to the Native Hawai’i(an)s on behalf of the people of the United States. 4 Internationally renowned Attorney Francis A. Boyle has in - terpreted this action as a window of opportunity for the na - tive Hawai’i(an) sovereignty movement to restore their inde - pendent nation state under the auspices of international law. It’s necessary to launch an educational process in the Kingdom of Hawai’i to teach the people how to govern themselves and move toward unification. A provisional government for the Kingdom of Hawai’i has been initiated. All the titles of the lands have been held in trust for the Hawai’i(an) people since the overthrow in 1893.It’s just a matter of competent and visionary leadership coming forward and agreeing on a process and structure for the unification of 300 or more factions. There must be competent, reliable and integral individuals who can lift themselves into the role of statesmen/women. The Hawai’i(ans) do not need more politicians or self- interested leadership whose only concern is getting re- elected or keeping their piece of the political pie. Hawai’i has been ruled by foreigners for generations, partly because the Hawai’i(an) people have been unwilling to learn how to govern themselves, or too busy competing with each other through tribal/clan rivalries. Petty tyrants and many pretenders to the throne keep the people divided, thus conquered as thoroughly as the global elite can. Better that we all be sovereigns without subjects. (See also the Sovereign Hawai’ian’s Handbook by Johnny Liberty). 5 Short History of the Republic of Texas Editor’s Note: The saga of the valiant effort by individuals in the Republic of Texas to restore their independence from the United States has not been given its due attention. History has been in the making these last three years, yet few Americans noticed. Until the front page news scandalized Ambassador Richard McLaren, accused and convicted him of “kidnapping,” and the philosophical divisions within the Republic of Texas weakened their unified resolve, the possibility of a free and independent republic in America was so close you could taste it. The final word is not in. Blessings to the Republic of Texas. You were the first to step out for independence again. Paralegal, Richard McLaren, was doing legal research in an attempt to free the Davis County Land Commission from the grasp of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), when he discovered the State of Texas had never been properly brought into the union of States. In 1845, Texas, which was a separate and sovereign nation until that year, was annexed to the Union. There is no constitutional provision or federal law allowing the United States to annex a foreign nation. The national legislature got around that inconvenience by issuing a joint resolution. There was not a quorum to vote on the matter, but it was done anyway. The foreign nation of Texas was - 294 -"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Chapter Nineteen Short History of the Republic of Texas illegally annexed to the United States without the requisite number of votes. On December 13th, 1995, the provisional government for the Republic of Texas was re-consummated in ceremonies at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. Texas has always been a special case with regards to its participation in the Union of states. Texas was an independent nation established and recognized under the Law of Nations. There still is an embassy in Paris, France that was establi- shed by Sam Houston on behalf of the Republic of Texas. Upon annexation, the state of Texas retained its public domain and still has its own General Land Office in Austin for issuing land patents (i.e. land scrip), and allodial titles. This provisional government formally dissolves the U.S. military rule which has existed over its soil since 1861. The Davis Mountains Land Commission, by and through the acts of its Citizens, have brought about the reconstitution of the lawful de jure Government of Texas based on the Plans & Powers of the Provisional Gover-nment of Texas of November 13 1835, the Declaration of Independence of March 2, 1836, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas dated March 17, 1836; the Constitution of the Republic of Texas dated December 29, 1845, as amended January 16, 1850, as amended August 29, 1994, January 27, 1995 and June 9, 1995. Historical Timeline Nov 13, 1835 - Republic of Texas established. Mar. 2, 1836 - Texas Declaration of Independence. Jan. 27, 1845 - Republic of Texas annexed by United States. Feb 1, 1861 - Republic of Texas tries to secede from the Union. Military rule instituted. April 12, 1994 - A legal process was commenced by citizens of Jeff Davis county in Texas to perfect regaining the sovereignty of the Soil of Texas. June 9, 1995 - Original Petition of the People of the land territory of the Davis Mountains and Big Bend is signed. The People agree to institute fully operational government for the Republic of Texas. Oct 18, 1995 - The Davis Mountain Land Commission filed an action with evidentiary documents with the Texas Supreme Court (Case # 95-1002 ) and International Court of Justice at the Hague, claiming Texas was unlawfully annexed in 1845. 10 pounds of documents compiled over three years were filed with the action. Nov 13, 1995 - The Texas Supreme Court vacated the case for “want of jurisdiction.” It is the opinion of the filers of the action that since nobody contested the claim, it has been resolved at law that the Republic of Texas is reinstated as a free and independent nation among nations, subject only to treaties authorized by its Constitution. Under the Law of Nations, the Common law has been reinstated in the Republic. Nov 16, 1995 - Legal process of April 2, 1994, finalized (Texas Supreme Court case #95-1002). Dec 13, 1995 - Legal process of April 2, 1994, finalized (by the People). Provisional Transitional Government of Texas instituted, ending military rule in effect since 1861. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas, its agencies and agents adopt and incorporate the plans and powers of the Provisional Government of Texas of Nov 13, 1835; the Declaration of Independence of March 2, 1836; the Constitution of the Republic of Texas of March 17, 1836; the Constitution of the Republic of Texas dated Dec 29, 1845 as amended; Jan 16, 1850, Aug 29, 1994, Jan 27, 1995, and June 9, 1995; and anything in the plans and powers consistent with the Common law. The territories delineated in the 1850 Compromise are affirmed. Dec 18, 1995 - An International Abatement At Law of Previous Appearance by Notice of Intent Perfect Notice to the Security Council of the United Nations is filed at the International Court of Justice, The Hague, along with the Declaration of the Provisional Government and 20 other documents. Dec 27, 1995 - Emergency meeting of General Council of Government of Republic of Texas adopts Resolu- tion/Proclamation of Neutrality under the Law of Nations. Jan 2, 1996 - Legal process of April 2, 1994, finalized (in accordance with Law of Nations) when final documents were received into the archives of the International Court. Jan 5, 1996 - President of the Republic, John C Van Kirk, notified State of Texas Governor George Bush in writing that the legal process of April 2 was complete. There was no attempt made by the de facto administration to discuss the matter. Jan 7, 1996 - Republic of Texas issues Proclamation of the Transitional Plan which lays out procedure to be followed leading up to a constitutional convention no later than Jan 7, 1998. The Plan includes an audit of the de facto government; changing assets and instruments into currency of the Republic to be based only on money of intrinsic value; elimination, privatization, deregulation or reorganization of existing agencies; notification of foreign corporations that they are now under jurisdiction of Republic of Texas; order to all policing authorities to protect the rights of the Citizens of the Republic of Texas; and more. Jan 9, 1996 -The Republic’s Secretary of Defense, Archie H. Lowe, sent a correspondence to the commanders and executive officers of five Texas militias, calling for official unification to establish a Republic militia. Jan 10 1996 - Republic of Texas President, John C. Van Kirk, issues Formal Announcement to “all people living on the soil of Texas who cherish liberty, freedom, law and order,” that the legal process commenced on April 12, 1994, to regain sovereignty of the Soil of Texas had been perfected. Invitation to participate in gathering in front of the Capitol of Texas on Jan 16, 1996. Jan 16, 1996 - The United States ex rel State of Texas (de facto) and its other subdivisions were served a “Writ of Quo Warranto,” challenging authority. The document was served to George King at Governor Bush's office. The Governor was given 30 days to refute the Quo Warranto. (Failure to respond constitutes agreement to the charges under the law). The time expired without a reply on Feb 15, 1996. Feb 2, 1996 - An affidavit was filed with the Chief Magistrate of the Republic of Texas (who is also the president according - 295 -"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook to an 1836 law) by an expatriated Republic of Texas citizen. The affidavit said two US Marshals had detained the citizen without warrant and held him at gun point for questioning. Feb 8, 1996 - Warrants were issued for US Marshals Robert Hartman and David Sligh, US Attorney William Harris, and US Judge Edward C. Prado. They were filed with Sheriff Jack Bremer, Comal County. In response the FBI circulated a story that a militia group threatened to kidnap a judge. Feb 9, 1996 - KMOL television news reports that a federal court in San Antonio was closed down due to a “rumor’ that militia groups had threatened to kidnap a federal judge. Feb 15, 1996 - Time to respond to Republic of Texas Quo Warranto (lawful manner to challenge authority of a corporate or government entity) expired at midnight Feb 17, 1996 - Governor George Bush was deposed via “Tacit Procuration” before a citizens’ Grand Jury. The Grand Jury found the Governor had defaulted and therefore had no lawful authority over the people of Texas. It was announced another Grand Jury would convene on Feb 27, 1996, to hear charges against Federal authorities in reference to drug running, theft and fraud perpetrated by US Attorneys and Federal Judges; as well as three murders of people investigating these alleged crimes. The abuse of the Capital Trust Fund by the Governor's office as a vehicle to rob the elderly of Texas of lifelong investments and funneling of State Lottery monies to foreign accounts not subject to the people were also to be investigated. Feb 22, 1996 - President Van Kirk meets with head of the US Marshal’s Service, Jack Dean. Van Kirk says Dean admitted he didn't care about law or lawful process. He said he had taken two oaths of office and intended to uphold his corporate oath. Marshal Dean added, if any Texas Sheriff’s acted upon the warrants filed by the Republic of Texas on Feb 8, 1996, he would have them busted. Dean asked Van Kirk if he would remove the warrants but the president said they would stand. Feb 26, 1996 - A message was broadcast on the Internet that warned of an assassination order against John C. Van Kirk, President of the Republic of Texas, by a federal office. The code name of the order was “Captain Kirk” and the status was “crash and burn.” March 13. 1996 - President Van Kirk suspends Richard McLaren and others from Council after they attempted to impeach the President for his stance that militias were not valid in Texas at this time, and that they will come under the authority of sheriffs when the Republic of Texas is fully rein - stated. April 4, 1996 - Federal Judge Lucius Bunton rules that Richard McLaren, Upper Limpia Basin Common Law Trust and the Republic of Texas owe Stewart Title $1.8 million for filing liens against the company. In the ruling, Judge Bunton stated that the “Republic of Texas” is not a nation, but that it is an unincorporated business. President Van Kirk agreed, saying as the case was presented, the evidence warranted the decision. He stated: “Texas, as a nation has to be first estab - lished at law, then accepted by a majority of the people. This requires a political process and a convention.” Van Kirk told the Associated Press: “McLaren's agenda seems to 'bounce off the wall' with frivolous filings, creating bogus Common Law Courts, and subverting the truth. I believe his ‘Republic of Texas’ will die a quick death.” 7 May 2, 1996 - Republic of Texas Office of the Treasurer No - tice is hereby given in accordance with the law of nations, by the rule of Postliminium in accordance with a Judgment of Foreclosure in Cause No. 96-000776-CL, styled We the Peo - ple of the Republic of Texas vs Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a foreign agency of final adjudication on April 27, 1996, in the District Court of Milam, Tarrant county of this action eminent domain.

June 17, 1996 - A “Declaration of Independence and Recla - mation of the Republic of Texas” (with cover letter) was served on the United Nations . This declaration places that body on notice of violations of international law and the United Nations charter by one of its member states (the United States), and demands that the other member states compel the US to follow the law and international agree - ments that it has made. (This declaration is not an attempt to join the United Nations.) A Notice has been sent to all na - tions of the world that according to the “Diplomatic Notice of Perfection,” the United States is without authority to rep - resent the Republic of Texas. A “Diplomatic Notice of Per - fection of International Discourse” has been served on vari - ous individuals. A Resolution certifying US District Judge Lucius D. Bunton III as representative from the judicial branch of the United States of America during the transition has been passed. \"If there be a principle that ought not to be questioned within the United States, it is that every man has a right to abolish an old government and establish a new one.

A letter has been sent to US federal district judge Lucius D. Bunton confirming his position as judicial ambassador for the United States during the transitional period. July 3, 1996 - Officials from the Republic of Texas will meet with FBI agents in Dallas this morning to discuss the transition of government from the de facto State to the Republic. Also on the agenda are allegations printed in a local newspaper that the FBI “regularly informs” the local police when the Milam District Court holds court. (Note that there is nothing wrong with police knowing when the meetings are, and in fact they are encouraged to attend, but that is not the spirit in which these “regular informings” were offered.) July 4, 1996 - Notice has been sent to all nations of the world of funds being made available from the Central Dominion Trust to the United Nations through the Republic of Texas treasury. If money talks, this document screams. July 8, 1996 - Copies of three judicial opinions from the Secretary of Judicial Affairs have been posted to the Judicial Affairs area, and a link to that area now appears under the Official Documents section. July 7, 1996- A Call for Volunteers to serve on the Judicial Affairs Committee has been issued by Ray Wanjura, Secretary of Judicial Affairs. Two of a series of articles from the Cleburne Times-Review have been added to the Press Coverage section. July 10, 1996 - Chief Ambassador and Consul General Richard McLaren was heard on one of the largest talk radio shows in Austin on Tuesday after appearing at a press conference. The talk show ran for three hours, and response has been overwhelmingly positive. Meanwhile, de facto State of Texas Attorney General Dan Morales proceeded with a hearing on a civil suit against the Republic of Texas in a State courtroom. Witnesses and attorneys who were present at the hearing described it as “a massive railroad job,” noting that “virtually every rule in the book” concerning evidence and procedure were violated by agents of the de facto State. One witness was heard to comment, “There is no justice system in Texas.” A celebration is planned in observance of Captured Nations Week in Fort Davis July 19-21st. July 11, 1996 - A Criminal Complaint has been filed with US Federal Judge Lucius Bunton about the Texas Department of Public Safety concerning the interference with the right of the People to travel freely. July 18th, 1996 - The First Diplomatic Conference was held today in Pecos, Texas, with Judge Lucius D. Bunton representing the United States judicial branch. I was not able to attend this conference personally, but according to Ambassador McLaren, apparently Judge Bunton has received instruction from his superiors at the Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans “not to stand in the way of this political question.” Judge Bunton has therefore asked that the question be removed from his court and taken up with Congress. The US Congress has already received and presented the notice of establishment of Diplomatic Relations. (See the Congressional Record for April 30, 1996.) October 12, 1996 - The Republic of Texas has filed an injunction against the de facto United States federal government, and its agent, the de facto State of Texas, in the United Nations. With this injunction, the Republic of Texas has also ordered all actions pending against Citizens of the Republic of Texas in de facto courts be dismissed with prejudice. October 23, 1996 - Today Steven Crear, Vice President of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas, extended an invitation to the People of the Washitaw Nation, as well as indigenous People of all nations, to attend this weekend's Council meeting in Houston. Vice President Crear recently visited the Washitaw Nation. “Having discovered that, through my Washitaw heritage, I, too, am an indigenous (meaning ancient or original people of a land) person, I felt honored to have the opportunity to meet with Empress Verdiacee of the Washitaw Nation. I would like to extend an open invitation to the People of the Washitaw Nation as well as all indigenous Peoples to attend our upcoming Council meeting. I welcome them and invite them all in a spirit of love, peace and joy, to join us in this movement of cultural freedom.” Vice President Crear stated. October 23, 1996 - On the day our President Lowe was kidnapped by College Station police, an unauthorized message was faxed to law enforcement in College Station threatening violence on the part of the Republic. Secretary of Defense Ralph Turner states unequivocally that The Republic of Texas is a non-aggressive nation and has no intention of inciting violence at any time. “\"This has been a lawful process of filing the documents necessary in every step of the process in reclaiming our nation, because we intend to make this transition a peaceful one. We've always stressed that we will use force only in defending ourselves from any aggressive, forceful action initiated against us. The type of threats made in the unauthorized message are not in keeping with the posture of the Defense Forces of the Republic of Texas,” Dr. Turner stressed. Editors Note: There is an ongoing controversy between Archie Lowe and Richard McLaren as to which is the legitimate provisional government for the Republic of Texas. These comments were downloaded from Lowe's website. Since McLaren's showdown and arrest in Texas and their website being shut down, I have no reliable information from McLaren's side of the story. October 25, 1996 - Today, Richard McLaren, Chief Ambassador of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas, stated that contempt charges have been filed with the United Nations against Dan Morales and Judge Joseph Hart of the 126th District Court of Travis county. The contempt charges cited consist of: conspiracy and genocide, in violation of United Nations Charter 2(4); intent to execute documents of political extortion; kidnapping of officers of The Republic of Texas while attempting to carry out their rights and duties of political acts which are protected under the Law of Nations; attempting to incite and commit violent acts to achieve these unlawful ends. The charges are contained in an “Amended Petition to Enjoin by Right of Presumption, which was filed with the General Assembly of - 297 -"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook the United Nations,” by and through its Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, today. Mr. McLaren stated, “These acts were committed by agents of Dan Morales on October 21, 1996, through the filing of a Verified Motion for Civil and Criminal Contempt and an Order setting a hearing on the motion which was signed by Joseph Hart. These acts are bogus and unlawful,” McLaren continued, “because they're seeking to incarcerate Republic of Texas officials if they don't sign over the “Cestui Qui Trust,” which no longer rests in the hands of the Provisional Government of The Republic of Texas, but in the hands of the People. The rights of the public trust will be determined at the July 4, 1997, constitutional convention. Further, on November 16, 1995, in case number 95-1002, the Supreme Court of the State of Texas dismissed for want of jurisdiction an action involving the eminent domain question of the soil of Texas and its People.” March 31, 1997 - PUBLIC NOTICE CONCERNING PURPORTED QUO WARRANTO AND MILAM DISTRICT COURT; To: Richard Lance McLaren and Timothy Charles Perkins; Cc: All People and Citizens of the Republic of Texas; From: The General Council of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas April 27, 1997 !! Urgent Notice !! It has come to the attention of the Provisional Govern-ment of the Republic of Texas that a situation has arisen in the Davis Mountains, near Fort Davis. It is with great regret and sadness that the following information is posted: It appears that Richard McLaren and those acting with him have gone completely off the deep end, disregarding the very laws he claims to uphold. According to reports by witnesses in the Davis Mountain Resort (including Mr. McLaren's wife), and further confirmed by our contacts in law enforcement, both state and federal, there have been shots fired between Mr. McLaren’s supporters and law enforcement officials. These actions are another in a long chain of unlawful acts by Mr. McLaren, culminating today in the kidnapping of a Texas Citizen on nothing but hearsay. This morning, a captain in McLaren’s security team left McLaren's property and proceeded out of the Davis Mountains resort. On his way out, it is believed that he stopped by one of the neighbors' houses (the purpose of that stop is unknown at this time). After leaving the neighbor's house, the man proceeded out of the resort. As he left the resort, he was stopped by someone from the Sheriff’s department. The van the man was driving was “loaded” according to witnesses (loaded with what is uncertain), and he was arrested. It is not clear whether shots were fired at this point or not. As word of this arrest made it back to McLaren’s property, apparently the assumption was made that the neighbor must have “set up” the van's driver. Based on nothing more than this supposition and rumor, two men from McLaren’s security detail went to the neighbor’s house and kidnaped the neighbor. It is not known whether shots were fired at this point. This blatantly unlawful act by Mr. McLaren illustrates his contempt for the common law process he claims to love. The neighbor was kidnaped by force of arms based on nothing more than a rumor — no evidence, no grand jury, no indictment, no hearing, no due process of any sort. It is not known at this time whether the neighbor is still being unlawfully held. Area law enforcement officials have responded, and are well within their rights to do so. Citizens and supporters of the Republic of Texas are strongly cautioned and advised to be wary lest they be pulled into this situation. After the impeachment of Mr. McLaren on March 22, he attempted to perpetrate a coup d’etat and install himself as the only member of the General Council. When this failed, he attempted to convene a special election by direct-mailing a small subset of Texas, and using the fifty or so people who cast a ballot as being “proof” that he could not be impeached, and was the sole charge of the question of Texas independence. Mr. McLaren has subsequently decided to declare war against the United States, the State of Texas, and the United Nations. The lawful Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas remains committed to a peaceful solution to Texas independence. We reserve the right to defend ourselves if attacked, but we cannot and will not support unlawful actions such as kidnapping without lawful process. The man who was kidnapped is a Texan and deserves every bit as much respect as any other Texan. It is this blatant disregard for law and due process that has caused the Republic of Texas to seek its independence. We will not condone more unlawful government under a different name, nor will we support the actions of a madman, no matter what his contributions may have been in the past. Again, all Citizens and supporters of the Republic of Texas are strongly cautioned not to involve themselves in this conflict. There is absolutely no justification for placing life and limb in jeopardy over the political ambitions of one man. April 21, 1997 Apparently, former Ambassador Richard McLaren (impeached on March 22), acting in concert with other former Council members, held his so-called “election” on April 19, and has managed to get his newly elected “representatives” to pass a declaration of war against the United Nations, the United States, and the State of Texas . The legitimate provisional government of the Republic of Texas under President Lowe does not support these unlawful acts, nor the declaration of war. The Republic of Texas has always sought a peaceful path to recovery of Texas independence, and we remain committed to that end. While we could defend ourselves if necessary, to date there has been no verified attack against the Republic of Texas, nor even any verifiable cause for the issuance of any Defense Forces Alert by the President or Secretary of Defense. While the same abuses continue that have plagued all Americans in recent years, there is no justification for a declaration of war by a peaceful people who have not been directly and overtly attacked. This action by Mr. McLaren, is not only unlawful, but deceptive, disruptive, divisive, and fraudulent. - 298 -"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Chapter Nineteen Short History of the Republic of Texas May 3, 1997 The standoff in the Davis Mountains is over. Richard McLaren and others with him reached an agreement with de facto officials, laid down their weapons, and surrendered. Two men did not surrender, and slipped away into the hills. President Lowe and other officials of the Republic of Texas have expressed great relief that no lives were lost, and hope that the focus can now return to the issue of Texas independence. 8 “ It is with solemn resolve and respect that the People of the Republic of Texas will vow in their commitment towards their American kindred relations and to all the people of the various states within the Union of the united states of America, to act with whatever aid is possible in salvaging their lands and sovereignty. With all prayer, the People of the Republic of Texas shall, where possible, help in fostering world peace and friendship and respect to all cultures and religions as private and sacred to all human beings.” —Plans & Powers of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas 8 Provisional Governments Established in Kingdom of Hawai’i On April 15th, 1994, an Interim Provisional Government Council was formed by proclamation and decree for the Kingdom of Hawai’i to repatriate the inherent Hawai’ian sovereign. Pursuant to Public Law 103-150 supra, the Hawai’ian people can reform their constitutional republic and resume self-government at will as an independent nation state. In ceremonies at the Iolani Palace in Honolulu on November 23rd, 1995, official relationships have been consummated between the Provisional Government for the Kingdom of Hawai'i and the united states of America. John David Van Hove was appointed General Advocate Liaison and ambassador to the united states of America to replace John Nelson who was initially appointed in 1993. His first duties include perfecting the paperwork for the inherent Hawai'ian sovereign to reclaim their sovereignty and repatriate into the Kingdom of Hawai’i, and for the American sovereign in Hawai’i to get recognition of their inherent American sovereignty. Identity packages and an educational program are also being developed. 9 International Recognition for the American Sovereign It is time for American sovereigns to take our cause to the world community and shed light on what’s happening in American today. I just returned from Hawai’i on a diplomat - ic and bridge-building mission by invitation of the Interim Provisional Government Council (IPGC), a provisional gov - ernment structure for the Kingdom of Hawai’i. The constitutional Kingdom of Hawai’i has just formally rec - ognized the American sovereign during ceremonies on Nov. 23, 1995 at the Iolani Palace in Honolulu. This is a tremen - dous leap of faith and international recognition for the American struggling to reclaim their sovereignty in our homeland. All the people in the world have a common struggle against tyrannical government and the New World Order. The peo - ple in Hawai’i who are informed about our cause are sympa - thetic to our struggle for sovereignty as they are deeply in - volved in restoring home rule and the inherent sovereignty of the Hawai’ian people. The people of New Zealand know more about American sovereignty than most Americans. The people of the world would come to our aid and support if they knew what was happening. It is our duty and respon - sibility to inform them. Many people despise Americans for what our government has done on behalf of so-called “democracy.” They do not make a distinction between the American sovereign and the actions of our United States government. The people of the world must make this distinction, and know that our own government is at war with us as well. The people of the world must be educated and informed as to the nature of oppression within the united states of America. Most people will find common ground with the American sovereign and learn from us how to cast off the shackles of their totalitarian regimes. The beacon of liberty still shines brightly in the principles of our constitutional republic. This is distinct from our present de facto government and must be communicated internationally. Most of the people of the world do not realize there is a war going on in the usA. Many Americans can’t see it either al - though they know something is terribly wrong. There is an economic blockade around the usA which is hard to see until you leave the country. The federal United States has been bankrupted into submission and unconditional surrender. Capital, resources and jobs are leaving the country at a rapid rate while capital, information and news cannot get in. What is happening in America has already been achieved in most of the nations of the world—unconditional surrender under the New World Order internationalist structures. That is why the usA is at the frontline of the New World Or - der’s assault upon our sovereignty. We the People of the usA are the last line of resistance against the New World Order. This is why we must succeed in reclaiming our American sovereignty and reconstructing a constitutional Republic from the bottom-up. 10 In summary, We the People must restore a constitutional re - public in the united states of America by reclaiming our own American National\\ and/or sovereign “state” Citizenship — then exercising our unalienable rights and defending those rights if necessary. We the People can restructure and reorganize our individual and business affairs to optimize the transitional tools and freedom technologies available to maximize wealth, security and privacy in our lives.

We ask not your counsels or your arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.” —Samual Adams We the People are inherently sovereign in the united states of America, and as human beings everywhere in the world. In principle, there is nothing We the People must do to become sovereign, because we already are. But from a legal, economic and political standpoint, there exist presumptions that we are NOT acting or performing as a sovereign would. What is the code of conduct for a sovereign? What is your code of honor? What is your code of ethics? Will you be a generous and benevolent sovereign with the good of the whole aligned with your own good? Effectiveness is the measure of truth. Code Of Honor, Code Of Ethics For Americans, there are presumptions supported by evidence that we are the chattel and property of the federal United States government corporation in a diminished capacity (i.e., U.S. citizen). There are presumptions proving that we are not free. There are adhesion contracts in force with our signature (i.e., property) and seal upon them. We must effectively deal with and eliminate those presumptions to be an effective sovereign. We must stop accepting and receiving benefits from any government corporation and be completely and totally responsible for ourselves, our families, and our communities. Eliminate Presumptions To reclaim inherent American sovereign status is not expatriation, as defined, as that would involve the voluntary act of abandoning one’s country to become a citizen or subject of other. We are not abandoning one’s country, but simply removing the presumptions that we are NOT sovereign. You can identify all the adhesion contracts that are being enforced upon you in the jurisdiction of the democracy, and either revoke, rescind, or deny the existence of the signature on these contracts. This will assist you in getting your papers in order and preparing evidence to support your position and declaration as an inhabitant in the free jurisdiction of the republic. For those of you who choose to remain in the system and NOT revoke, rescind or reclaim your sovereignty, you can still utilize many of the freedom technologies and transitional tools to achieve more prosperity, protection and privacy in your life. Adhesion contracts must be dealt with, handled and eliminated ab initio, such as: • Social Security Numbers (SSN’s) • Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN’s) or Employer Identification Numbers (EIN’s) • Driver’s Licenses • Vehicle Registrations and Certificates of Title • Marriage Licenses • Business Licenses, Incorporation Papers and other Permits • Insurance Contracts Each in our own time, We the People must utilize available and state-of-the-art “freedom technologies” to execute a plan to reclaim our sovereignty. Begin by committing to economic sovereignty by generating wealth and prosperity for yourself and your family. Restructuring your business and financial affairs in legal structures, onshore and offshore, better suited for asset preservation and protection. Get yourself judgment and lien-proof, then declare and reclaim your lawful sovereignty as a human being in the jurisdiction of choice. Declaration Of Sovereignty Make this declaration by “Affidavit” and send “Constructive Legal Notice” and grace to all government corporations or agencies you’ve contracted with by certified mail, return- receipt requested. You may also give notice by publication in a legal newspaper. Common law process requires notice and grace for any actions taken that affect other parties (so said Jerry Henson). If you’re a high profile individual, simply make your declarations privately with two witnesses. Keep copies of these documents with you if needed for evidence of your status. Examples of the “Affidavits” include: 1. Declaration of Domicile (Affidavit 1) 2. Declaration of Citizenship (Affidavit 2) 3. Revocation of Power of Attorney (Affidavit 3) 4. Withdrawal of Participation in Social Security (Affidavit 4) 5. Right To Travel (Affidavit 5) 6. Tax-Exempt Foreign Status (Affidavit 6) 7.

Notice to State Department of Revenue (Notice 18) Adhesion contracts can be revoked or rescinded by “Affidavit” (so said Richard McDonald), although it leaves the presumption of the existence of the contract, and that we knew what we were signing. This must be overcome if challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction. Other adhesion contracts, such as those that Congress has attached our taxpayer I.D. numbers to, have our consent through representation, not by signature. Revocation Of Contract It can also be argued (so said Eric Madsen) that our lawful signature or seal was NOT on the document, as there is no consent without full disclosure when the scribble was placed upon the paper, nor could the parties perform. Deny the existence of the signature. Your Signature Is Not On The Contract > SIGNATURE — the act of writing one’s own name upon a deed, note, contract, or other instrument, either to identify or authenticate it, or to give it validity as one’s own act. > SEAL — a sign, stamp, or mark signifying that the writing preceding it accords with his/her own wishes or intention. You must make a choice. You are either an American national (sovereign in the 48 states), “state” Citizen (with Citizenship in one of the 48 states), sui juris freeman or woman (free of legal disability), or a U.S. citizen (chattel and property of the federal government corporation). The choice is yours! A sovereign is a “state” standing in his/her character with full judicial powers. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot be half-pregnant! No more government handouts and services. American National, Sovereign “State” Citizen, Sui Juris Freeman/Woman Once you’ve made your declarations by affidavit and given notice and grace, “Quiet Titles” are utilized to perfect the process. If you can find a Constitutional Common law Court, then you can perfect your quiet title before a jury of your peers. Declaration Of Quiet Title If you cannot find a Constitutional Common law Court, then you can make your “Declaration of Quiet Title” and publish it in a legal newspaper for 3 consecutive weeks. If there is no challenge to your claim and declaration within 60 days, then you’re status and property is perfected res judicata. Theatrically & Non Violently Challenge Authority Stop filing and paying income taxes that support the war against the people of the world. Stop receiving any income or benefits from within the federal United States linked to your legal name and number. All income is managed via legitimate foreign entities with foreign officers or trustees. Bank privately offshore and onshore with a debit card, checkbook and wire transfer ability until transiting completely out of the international banking system. Being sovereign is as much theater and posture as any lawful and legitimate paperwork. No amount of paperwork alone is going to make your sovereign, if you are not able to walk and talk in your heart and soul. You must be in charge of your life. You must believe you make the rules for your life, and are a self-governing entity. You must embody all seven aspects of sovereignty! It is important to have your papers in order so you can be prepared to face the “authorities” with dignity and strength. Too many American sovereigns have been unprepared in their encounters with the authorities and have created a lot of needless suffering for themselves. Many have been bankrupted. Many are so preoccupied with court litigation and the preparation of paperwork they can no longer work or support their families. Much of this is unnecessary if your papers are in order AND you’ve handled your asset protection in ADVANCE of any encounters with the authorities. - 304 -"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Reclaiming Your Inherent American Sovereignty If you want to take on a piece of the system and make it better, then do so from a position of strength and wisdom. Ultimately, it’s who you are, not what your papers say you are that’s important. It is your presence and presentation that matters most. Freedom Is Global For those of you doing business in jurisdictions foreign to the united states of America, you can utilize these to create a foundation for a republican form of government based on the sovereignty of the people in your country. Any country that was an English colony is a Common law country (e.g., Canada). Every country with a social security insurance system is voluntary. Participation is not required. It will take a “revolution” in consciousness to bring about that change, but it is not impossible to create a bloodless, though not painless, transformation. All governments exist by the consent of the people, regardless of their present form. For those of you wanting to be free, start acting like a sovereign individual and take the same steps American’s must to reclaim our republic. American’s are not much better off since the New World Order is encroaching everywhere, except that we have 230 years of case law to support American sovereignty and a track record of having been historically freer and more prosperous than most countries. Getting Your Papers in Order Once you’ve reclaimed your American National and/or sovereign “state” Citizenship, reestablish a national domicile in one of the 48 sovereign states of the Union by “Affidavit and Legal Notice,” filed at the County Recorder office or published in a legal newspaper. Once you’ve completed the legal sovereignty process, you can stand in your character and truth as a sovereign “state” Citizen. Complete Affidavits And Legal Notices Getting your papers in order involves completing the affidavits and legal notices as described prior and acquiring a complete “Identification Package.” The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the Citizens of the United States herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give said Citizens all lawful aid and protection.” —usA Passport 12 Here’s what you’ll need to get started with the “Identification Package:” 1. usA Passport or passport from your country of origin without a SNN 2. Affidavit of Identification (AID) or Sovereign Citizen Identification Card (SCIC) 3. International Driver’s Permit (IDP) or International Motorist’s Qualification Card (IMQ) or Auto Leasing Identification Card 4. Certificate of Financial Responsibility or Proof of Insurance without a SSN usA Passports It’s a good idea to have a “usA Passport” in case you want to travel overseas. Do not use your SSN or State-issued driver’s license when applying. SSNs and TINs are not required for American Nationals/Citizens when applying for a usA Passport. The issuing of usA Passports is still a legitimate function of the national government, and having one does not compromise your sovereignty. Passports were originally issued to a neutral merchant vessel during the progress of a war as evidence of her nationality. A passport is a license authorizing an individual to remove him/herself or his/her effects from the territory of one country to another without detention or arrest. In modern law, passports are a warrant of protection and the authority to travel, granted by a competent officer to individuals moving from place to place. 11 Customs and immigration officers at the borders are operating in federal enclaves. When asked what Citizenship you are, reply “American Citizen” or “usA National, “ not a U.S. citizen. If you’ve ever wondered why they can strip search you at the border, it’s because the border is a federal enclave. Remember, you’ve got no constitutional rights or due process as a U.S. citizen in the federal zone. Once you are outside the borders of your state, and in another country not one of the several states, you are a Citizen of the United States. The Secretary of State of the various state republics before WWII, at one time issued passports from their office for their respective “state” Citizens. Editor’s Note: See if you can find one of those old passports in the un-catalogued section of the State Archives Once provisional, de jure governments are restored in every state, issuing passports will once again revert to the state republics. Apply For USA Passport Without SSN For American Nationals, first get a usA passport without a SSN (only after you’ve revoked, rescinded or stopped using the SSN). Editor’s Note: This is the best I.D. you can get and is necessary for any offshore banking or international travel. - 305 -"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook You’ll need two photographs (2”x2”) along with your application. If you’ve already got a passport, turn it in and get another one without the SSN. Use the Form DSP-11 for first-time applications. You can use the Form DSP-82 for mail-in renewal applications. Use these as evidence of Citizenship to apply for one: 1) Birth Certificate (i.e., state-issued evidence of a trust and security instrument) 2) Certificate of Live Birth with Certificate of Publication from legal section of newspaper where the announcement was published 2) Hospital or doctors records 4) Affidavits of Parents, Midwives, Witnesses 5) Entries in the Family Bible Passport Application - Form DSP-11 U.S. passports are issued only to U.S. citizens or “nationals.” Second Passports Or Camouflage Passports For additional privacy internationally, you can get a second passports (for a price) from a number of jurisdictions or camouflage passports. Camouflage passports are issued in a country (e.g., British Honduras, Dutch Guiana, British West Indies, Netherlands East Indies, New Hebrides, Eastern Samoa, Burma, Rhodesia, New Grenada, Zanzibar, Spanish Guinea, British Guiana, South Vietnam) that has recently changed it’s name. These are NOT legitimate or legal passports, but only for camouflaging your identity in the case of a terrorist attack. Legitimate second passports from another country or jurisdiction are available for $15,000 and up and may include foreign investment as a requirement (e.g., Costa Rica is $35,000; Panama is $50,000). Legitimate second passports are offered through authorized representatives in national embassies around the world. This is big business for small countries. There are indeed many ways to travel! Identification and Travel Strategies You can issue an “Affidavit of Identification (AID)” or your own “County Recorder I.D.” or a “Sovereign Citizen Identification Card (SCIC).” Use either of these for personal identification when you’d prefer not to use the usa Passport, getting on airplanes (harder to do post-911), receiving mail at the post office, and cashing checks. Caveat: The AID or SCIC will NOT replace a State-issued driver’s license or an IDP or IMQ at a traffic stop. Create Or Purchase Affidavit Of Identification Or Sovereign Citizen Identification Card You can expect to get a citation, arrest or impoundment if you present the AID or SCIC in lieu of a State-issued driver’s license especially if you still show up in their computers as a “resident.” Posture As A Permanent Tourist Or International Businessman Or Woman At a traffic stop, adopt the posture of being a “Permanent Tourist” or being on “International Business” with an offshore domicile in a foreign country (not in the usA). Make this the truth. Change Of Address To Foreign Jurisdiction At DMV And USPS You MUST establish a foreign domicile in a foreign country, get an IDP or IMQ with a foreign address, change your address to the foreign address at the DMV and the USPS, have vehicles registered to a trust or foreign entity NOT in your individual name, and be able to demonstrate financial responsibility or proof of insurance at a traffic stop. Here’s a quick summary of getting all your paperwork in order for a traffic stop: • Prove You are Not a Resident of Any of the Fifty States • Establish a Foreign Domicile in a Foreign Country • Change Address with the DMV to the Foreign Address in a Foreign Country • Present IDP or IMQ as I.D. at a Traffic Stop with Foreign Address • All Vehicles Registered in a Trust or Foreign Entity, with Proper Tags and Safety • Proof of Insurance without a SSN Attached and Trust or Foreign Entity as Additionally Named Insured International Driver’s Permit Or International Motorist’s Qualification Card Under international law and conventions, IDP’s and IMQ’s are only valid OUTSIDE the Country of issue. [Caveat: Do NOT use an IDP or IMQ without all the above steps completed.] Motor Vehicles Must Not Be Registered In Your Individual Name Lease the motor vehicle from a trust or foreign entity, register and insure the vehicles in a trust or foreign entity, and get an “International Driver’s Permit” (IDP) or “International Motorist’s Qualification” (IMQ) card for traveling. This is the best strategy for traveling by right and comes highly recommended. This strategy is required until such time as we can once again travel freely on the highways without the threat of impounding, citations or jail. Motor Vehicles Are Registered In A Trust Or Foreign Entity Purchase a new or used motor vehicle on behalf of a trust or foreign entity. Title the vehicle to the trust or foreign entity and lease back the vehicle from the company. Create or purchase an “Auto Leasing” I.D. Or purchase a new “Place-Travel Device (i.e., motor vehicle)” and travel by right without license, plates or insurance and be prepared for one heck of a ride. This is NOT a recommended strategy at this time. - 306 -"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Papers in Order Certificate Of Financial Responsibility Or Proof Of Insurance Without A SSN Secure a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” or “Proof of Insurance” without a SSN attached for I.D. purposes at a traffic stop. Secure a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” by posting a cash bond, or by setting up an investment account to cover your liabilities in the case of an accident (there are no “accidents”). Some states will accept a bond in lieu of insurance, although the bond deposited with the state (e.g., $85,000 cash bond in the State of Oregon). Caveat: Do not create evidence of “residency” in any of the 50 federal States (or 48 sovereign states). This is critical for all sovereign “state Citizens.” Privacy and Name Changes Revoking or rescinding your SSN and various adhesion contracts is not sufficient to secure complete freedom and privacy. Stop providing voluntary information about yourself to credit reporting agencies, polling agencies, questionnaires and surveys, etc. Tracking Systems Besides the SSN and the credit report, the government corporation tracks you through the 1st 2 digits of your first name; middle initial, the 1st 3 digits of your last name, and your date of birth. JOHNNY DAVID LIBERTY = “JO D LIB” DATE OF BIRTH = July 18th, 1952 DATE OF CONCEPTION = Oct 18th, 1951 Right To Alias You have the “right to alias (AKA)” or a legal name change which you can effectively do by publishing a legal notice for 3 consecutive weeks, providing you’re not doing so fraudu - lently, to avoid your creditors, or running from the law. Be - ware — dual identities can be misconstrued and dangerous. Legal Name Change You may legally change your legal name and date of birth to the “date of conception.” You may elect to change your legal name without going to court by affidavit, then filing it with the County Recorder in the County you are domiciled, and publishing a notice in a legal newspaper. You may also petition a Common law court (if you can find one left standing). Consistent use of a “name” is also sufficient to establish a name change. When women get married and use their husband’s last name either by statute or under the Common law, the consistent use is sufficient to establish a name change. You may also change your legal name and address with a “Change of Address” form from the post office. Fictitious Business Name You may also create a fictitious business name, or DBA and use the same procedure above. There is no requirement to file a DBA with a state-agency providing constructive legal notice was given. Your Name and Signature Are Your Property The federal government corporation and it’s political subdivisions (i.e., State and Municipal corporations) operate solely under the presumption every flesh and blood human being is in federal jurisdiction under their authority until proven otherwise. This presumption is either supported by evidence with your name and signature or rebutted based on the absence of your name and signature To be sui juris, your “name,” which is your property, must be free of any “legal disability” resulting from any adhesion contract or commercial agreement with the government that you did not enter voluntarily. These contracts must be revoked or rescinded by declaration through various “Affidavits” and “Constructive Legal Notices” given to particular corporations, agencies or principals involved. Your signature and seal, and your fingerprints are your property and cannot be taken without your consent (unless you’re a convicted felon). Reservation Of Rights Henceforth to reserve your rights, all signatures on corre - spondence, affidavits, checks, and contracts are henceforth affixed with your signature or official seal, and “ With Ex - plicit Reservation of All My Unalienable Rights, Without Prejudice, pursuant to UCC 1-207.” This Reservation effectively removes your signature from the contract if there are any unseen agreements or adhesions, and invokes the Common law of the land as the chosen venue and jurisdiction. This should be signed on all contracts with the government as a matter of due course including traffic citations you are forced to sign at a traffic stop. We’ve already learned the distinction between a U.S. citizen and a sovereign “state” Citizen. Notice the small “c” on U.S. citizen is a “diminished” capacity. Notice the capital “C” on “state” Citizen is not. > \"c\" — officers or employees of the government in a diminished capacity; 14th Amendment was the first time the “c” was used. > \"C\" — Citizen, sovereign. When you get a legal notice from the IRS, or are served with court papers, your legal “Slave” name will be in all capital letters. Legal Fiction Or Strawman Name “JOHNNY DAVID LIBERTY” This name is also evident on your Birth Certificate, incorporation papers and other trust documents. You can refuse all correspondence to this legal “person” for fraud, as it is not who you are (unless it is intended to serve the fiction), and or argue in a court of competent jurisdiction that they have NOT served the proper party to the action. - 307 -"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Refuse for Draud Advise them of their error, “ Refuse for Fraud” and “Return to Sender.” Your “name” is fundamentally where all adhesion contracts begin, and where all malicious prosecution ends. Titles of Nobility Are Legal Fictions All capital letters signifies a “Title of Nobility,” a legal fiction, a corporation, not a name properly addressing who I am. It is these titles granted by the old monarchy that the founding fathers fought to defeat. The concept of special rights or special interest is anathema to the constitutional republic. 1. a first-born son is an “esquire” (an adjective); an attorney is an “ESQUIRE.” 2. “Mister” or “Mr.” — signifies a husband can spend the dowry from his wife granted by her father (consideration for exchange of property). 3. Mrs., Ms. are also “Title of Nobility.” 4. Honorable... or Your Honor... are also “Title of Nobility.” How you or your family write your name is not that important, so long as you keep your names clean and free of legal disability. Your name is your property. Protect your names sake. Different cultures and languages have followed different forms. In English grammar, all capital letter names do not follow the rules of English grammar for proper nouns. Your name on record where you were born in the hospital with an attending physician is spelled: Sovereign or Christian Name “Johnny David Liberty” Your lawful, proper “Christian” name, or “appellation” is spelled out in full with both large and small letters (e.g., Johnny David Liberty). Designate your proper legal name for all communications, not a “Title of Nobility” or legal fiction. There are a number of patriots using various punctuations (e.g., :, ; ,) between their first, middle and last names. But there is nowhere we could find in history where they were written that way. I assert it is patriot mythology. If you can demonstrate otherwise, let me know. Various Punctuations “Johnny David, Liberty” “Johnny David: Liberty” “Johnny David; Liberty” Residents, Domicile and Mailing Addresses If you’re seriously concerned about your privacy, then change your domicile and mailing address or location. Know the distinctions between being a “resident,” being “domiciled” and what is a “domestic” and what is a “nondomestic” mailing location. You are domiciled in a Non-Domestic State Republic Remove yourself from federal jurisdiction back to the state republic c/o a “non-domestic” mailing location. You may use c/o General Delivery c/o “Any Post Office” for personal mail OR a Private-Mail Box (PMB) for business. You are not a resident Caveat: Do not create evidence of “residency” in any of the 50 federal States (or 48 sovereign states). This is critical for all sovereign “state Citizens.” Receive no mail at home Do NOT receive ANY mail or bills where you live or are domiciled in your personal name. • POSTAL ADDRESSES utilizing zip codes and two-digit abbreviations for the State are private contracts for federal government employees. Having a using a “zip code” supports the presumption that you are indeed a federal “employee” subject to the income tax and the Form 1040. Domestic mail is “within” the federal United States. Non- domestic is “without” the federal United States, between the sovereign “state” Citizens and the state (intrastate). Designate an “address” that doesn’t support any presumptions of residing in a federal area, working in a federal office or federal U.S. citizenship. Designate an “address” that rebuts any presumptions of “residency.” Address Properly You’ll have to train your friends, family and clients to address you properly. You’ll have to address the County, State and federal government corporations properly, if you want to keep them out of your business. Domestic Mail The standard postal address with two-digit State abbreviation (e.g., CA) and a zip code (e.g., 95000) is an adhesion contract addressing your fictitious “name,” your “person” or your business, within one of ten federal areas. No Two-Digit State Abbreviation No Zip Code Without Brackets Public Law 89-136 established ten federal regions. This is the way people have been taught to address an envelope: Your address is designating you as an officer or employee of a government corporation. When did you start working for the government? Every time you use a zip code. Editor’s Note: Social Security, FEMA or Zip Codes all designate various federal areas within the states. Domestic Address Johnny Liberty P.O. Box 0000 Ignorant City, OR. 97400 - 308 -"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Papers in Order Having an “address” within the federal United States supports the “presumption” with evidence of U.S. citizenship and federal jurisdiction over your person. To the untrained eye, it may seem insignificant, but it’s crucial to your legal sovereignty process. The standard postal address (domestic mail) is considered interoffice mail of the federal United States, thus you are therefore presumed to be a federal employee working for a government corporation. Domestic = Federal Non-Domestic = State Republic The use of the zip code supports the presumption that the individual is engaged in commercial activity. There is no law requiring you to use a zip code. The use of the zip code is voluntary. Your mail will get there just as fast if you don’t use it. The federal government has made it a crime to discriminate against anyone for the non-use of a zip code. 4 Zip Code Is Voluntary So how do you address mail? In the ongoing debate about “Postal Code” vs. “Postal Zone,” we have concurred that “Postal Zone,” spelled out in full, is probably the best designation as “zone” is not listed is any edition of the standard law dictionaries and has not yet been corrupted. Code means a “book of the civil law” thus is inappropriate for sovereign “state” Citizens. Zip Exempt “Zip Exempt” can also be used in lieu of a zip code or Postal Zone. You can also put the “Postal Zone” in brackets. You can also not use the zip code, and send your mail “Non- Domestic.” Try any of these formats: Postal Zone: [95000] Zip Exempt Non Domestic If you are intimidated by a postal worker to use a zip code and are uncomfortable asserting your rights, place “ tdc” after the zip. This implies you did so under “ threat, duress and coercion,” not by consent.” 5 Review your post office box contract (if you have one) and place “ Without Prejudice, UCC 1-207” below your signature. You can also get your mail c/o “General Delivery.” Pick up forms for “certified -mail, return-receipt requested” from any post office, and notice they are for “domestic” use. Cross out “domestic” on the forms and replace with “non- domestic.” If you receive any “certified-mail, return-receipt requested” mail cross out “domestic” and replace with “nondomestic” before signing and receiving the mail. [Editor’s Note: ALL Return Receipts sent from the U.S.P.S. must be corrected to be sent “Non-Domestic.”] Non-Domestic, Not Domestic Mail You can also use a “Private Mail Box (PMB)” service as an alternative, although they are regulated subcontractors with the U.S. Postal Service and must abide by federal postal standards. This is recommended for business mail with an authorized representative or agent opening the box. No zip code is required for first class mail. You can cite the postal regulation “Zip Exempt per DMM 122.32” on the envelope. The U.S.P.S. is a private corporation, not part of the government. Non-Domestic Mail The cost for “Non-Domestic,” intrastate, ordinary mail is limited by law to $0.03 per 1/2 ounce. The U.S. Congress just took the time recently to raise the rates from $0.02 to $0.03. This is only for sovereign “state” Citizens communicating between sovereign entities outside the federal United States. This is NOT a recommended strategy at this time. Some people have gotten into trouble with the postal authorities for incorrectly applying the non-domestic rates to first-class, federal mail. Be prepared to take the postal authorities to task on this one if you intend on using it. 6 Use one of the formats below for receiving and sending mail, to and from your “domicile.” Non-Domestic Addresses Johnny Liberty c/o P.O.

Become an elector instead. Electors are not bound to a contract or a political party. Electors are sovereign “state” Citizen’s with allodial property in any state. As sovereign “state” Citizens, it is our power of “appointment” in our judicial capacity that wields the real power of lawful process against the abuse of government power, not voting. We the People must restore the electors of each respective state, and veto the popular vote. Remember, it is the electors, not the voters, who have the true political power of the state. • VOTER’S REGISTRATION is an unrevealed, private “contract” obligating the “voter” or “resident” to pay municipal, county and State bonds via the property tax (i.e., trustee fees) and a State income tax; voters have also unknowingly given their Power of Attorney to the State. Electors are not bound to a contract or a political party. Electors are sovereign “state” Citizen’s with allodial property in any state republic. Cancel your voter registration (which is for U.S. citizens only) by phoning your County Elections Department, or going in and requesting being removed from the list. If Voting Made Any Difference It Would Have Been Made Illegal A Long Time Ago Voter registration is an adhesion contract and unrevealed commercial agreement which constitutes a lien on property for County and/or Municipal bonds which is satisfied by the individual registered through payments of property tax. This is another way a U.S. citizen officially “volunteers” to be a “taxpayer.” Voter registration also transfers Power of Attorney to the government corporation. Voting is an issue many people do not understand, as it does not have the power that most people believe it does. In our purported representative government operating as a constitutional democracy, very few of us are truly represented. Our vote is purely advisory and makes little difference in the power structure or the laws passed by our purported representatives. In the republic, there was not only an electoral college comprised of sovereign individuals, but a Great Book listing the electors or allodial property owners of each state, county by county. These were the qualified electors with the judicial power to elect county, state or federal officials. There were two records kept at each election, one for the electors and the other for the popular vote. The electoral college, comprised of electors, or sovereign “state” Citizens had direct veto power over the popular vote for the President and other officers. This is an appropriate and necessary check and balance by the sovereign “state” Citizens against the tyranny of the residents and foreigners who were given the privilege of voting. Only the House of Representatives was directly elected, the U.S. Senate was appointed by the state legislatures and ratified by the governor. Most of the Executive branch and all the federal judges are appointed, not elected. Restore a Sovereign Electoral Process See if you can find any voter registration forms for “state” Citizens. They don’t exist. The ballots for the electors are listed at the county recorder’s office in the “Great Book.” This is a list of the allodial title and land patent owners of property in the state qualified to be an elector. 10 If voting really made that much difference, it would have been made illegal a long time ago. Marriage Licenses and Divorce So what could possibly be illegal about getting married? If you believe you must have a marriage license to get married, then you grant the power and authority to join spiritually in a sacred bond with your beloved to the State. You place the State above God, above your spouse, above her father, above the family and thousands of years of your bloodline and lineage. Do you really love the government corporation that much? No Marriage License Do not admit to your signature on the marriage license unless you want the State to be a third party to your marriage. Send it back to them. Get a formal divorce from that contract. It’s enough to have the government encroach on every other area of our lives, but to be in bed with us as well? We must draw the line somewhere. > LICENSE — permission to do what would otherwise be illegal. The marriage license gives the Department of Social Services the authority to take away your children at their discretion (i.e., human resources). They consider your children the human resources of the State at their discretion for management. • A MARRIAGE LICENSE is an unrevealed, private “contract” with the State which is a legal third party to your marriage wherein they have control over the product (i.e., children) or the disbursement of community property (via a divorce). The State gets the power to take away your children if they deem it necessary for any reason. Do you want the government in your bed telling you how to raise your children? The doctrine of parens patria gives the State supremacy over parental rights. Parents rights are being rapidly eroded via UN treaties for “children’s rights” at the expense of “parents rights.” When did the State get the idea that they can raise children more competently than most parents? As bad as some parents may be, the State doesn’t have a good track record in this department. - 310 -"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Papers in Order Divorce The State Not Your Beloved! Most people don’t realize that all assets derived from the marriage are the property of the State, therefore they can tax or lien that property. This includes the children which are chatteled as property to the State until they reach legal age. Traditionally, the intermarrying between races was not permitted under the Common law (i.e., corruption of blood). Mixed marriages were prohibited until the State created the statutory “Marriage License” to supercede the Common law. This may be an area where the Common law fell short, but remember that the blood lineage of families was also the lineage of property rights and inheritance. You can get a “Marriage Certificate” instead of a marriage license, or cohabitation for seven years constitutes a Common law marriage. A Common law marriage is also a basis for a foreigner born in another country to immigrate directly into sovereign “state” Citizenship, providing the spouse is also sovereign. A spiritual marriage between two parties requires a church- issued certificate of a bonified “minister” (i.e., ministerial powers) under the Common law, and/or the consent of the father. Divorce under Common law requires Common law jury of twelve peers to agree. 14 Selective Service Registration If you’re son is turning eighteen, as my son is this year, I’m encouraging him to become sovereign and not participate in the selective service registration. I participated in the lottery system during the Vietnam war and scored high enough not to be called into military service. I did not understand then that compulsory draft registration is for U.S. citizens only. Once you reclaim your lawful sovereign “state” Citizenship, you can rescind your selective service registration. You can get sample forms at any post office. • SELECTIVE SERVICE registration is for U.S. citizens only. If you place your signature on that private contract, you are bound, body and soul to it. The government corporation owns you completely. They decide whether or not your teeth need pulling, not you. You have no choice once in military service. The draft is voluntary servitude. The Union of states lost their independent military in 1947 when the UN charter placed the military under federal jurisdiction. All military personnel were discharged and reenlisted in 1947. It was not coincidental that the National Security Act was also passed in 1947. Now, the United States military is under the command of the UN. Have you ever wondered why we haven't won a war since 1947? Congress only has the power to declare war if “state” Citizens are involved. 13 Getting Your Affidavits in Order Declaration of Domicile (Affidavit 1) Declare your permanent home or domicile, not as a federal postal address, by including it on your “Sovereign Citizen Identification Card (SCIC).” Create your own positive ID and get an identifying number either from the County Recorders office, or from the Common law court. Passport photos or arcade photos are inexpensive and commonly available. You can make color xerox copies and size them accordingly. Laminate the ID or put it in a clear baseball card holder. You can have many residences and addresses, but only one domicile. A “Declaration of Domicile” has similar legal effect to a “Declaration of Homestead” for a sovereign “state” Citizen. This is your lawful “address” or location. We the People are not hiding from the government, although we demand that our privacy be respected, so we make our “address” a matter of the public record and easy to find. It is important to keep a legitimate “address” for receiving legal notices and other correspondence. Declaration Of Domicile You could get a picture, State ID (not a drivers license) from the Department of Motor Vehicles, although I don’t recommend it. Who knows what hidden adhesion is behind that State ID? Some check guarantee cards also offer photograph identification as well. For four years, I had no trouble using the “Sovereign Citizen Identification Card (SCIC)” instead of a drivers license for cashing checks at banks and stores, getting on airplanes and identifying myself to a police officer at a traffic stop. Your SCIC facilitates dealing with a police officer at a traffic stop, although it won’t prevent you from getting a citation (if you can’t talk yourself out of one), or perhaps getting arrested (if you’re in a State gone renegade) or having your private conveyance (i.e. vehicle) impounded. In California, they now arrest you if you refuse to show ID and will impound your vehicle if its not registered or you don’t have a valid driver’s license. If this is a major concern of yours then you best get an “International Driver’s Permit (IDP)” or “International Motorists’ Qualification (IMQ)” card. By offering your SCIC which declares that you are a Common law Citizen of one of the several states, the police officer ought to know that you are not a “person” required to have a driver’s license or vehicle registration if the vehicle is your duly conveyed private property. Police officers must be educated, and training policies changed to be consistent with the law. You must NOT be traveling in a State owned, State-licensed and registered motor vehicle to be able to travel freely by right. File Affidavit (1) with the County Recorder’s Office. Use the Recorder’s Number as an I.D. Number on your SCIC. This lawfully establishes your domicile. - 311 -"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook File All Affidavits With The County Recorder Certificate of Citizenship (Affidavit 2) You must tell the government who you are.

This evidence must be entered into the public record by Affidavit, and Constructive Legal Notice sent to all those with whom it may concern. It is not necessary to get recognition for your declaration, and don’t be holding your breathe for the government corporation to acknowledge you. You are certifying and declaring yourself. Find Registries Of “State” Citizens In some states there are registries of “state” Citizens maintained by the Secretary of State (e.g., Washington), although this may very well be for political purposes. The present Attorney General of the State of Washington has decreed, off the record, that there are no “state” Citizens in Washington. In other states the Governor has declared an annual (e.g., California) Citizenship day. Find out what the Secretary of State in your state knows about sovereign “state” Citizenship. 9 Certificate Of Citizenship With the advent of the Common law courts sprouting up around the united states of America in the last three years, there are now remedies and recourse available in these venues. You can perfect your sovereign “state” Citizenship and asseverate your status by petitioning the Common law court for “Quiet Title” of both your status and property. This is an important addition to the Affidavit process as it is a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and Constructive Legal Notice to all other statutory Article 1 legislative courts.

Restore Your Power Of Attorney Government corporations and agencies cannot lawfully proceed in a legal action against you without your “Power of Attorney.” Without your “Power of Attorney,” the court cannot lawfully enter a plea on the defendant’s behalf if the defendant refuses to enter their jurisdiction and plea. You must revoke their Power of Attorney and give them Constructive Legal Notice. This is an important Affidavit to restore your own Power of Attorney. Then you can learn to master the art of lawful process and defend your sovereignty and rights. If you make an appearance, the Article 1 courts will often proceed against you, a defendant, despite having been given notice of their lack of Power of Attorney. You must be a natural-born individual with full Power of Attorney over your affairs, not a legal “person.” You must take them to task. This is a violation of due process. This is also grounds for dismissal or reversal at a higher court level. All Affidavits are either filed with the County Recorder in the County of your domicile, or with the Bureau of Records of your county or state Common law court. Print and mail copies of the Affidavits and give Constructive Legal Notice to all those to whom it may concern. File On Demand If the County Recorder won’t file your papers “on demand,” give then Constructive Legal notice and file a complaint against the government employee. Many County Recorders are now refusing to file commonplace paperwork because of the escalation of Citizen filings at the local level. You can also publish your Affidavits and Constructive Legal Notices in a legal newspaper for 3 consecutive weeks. This satisfies lawful notice. At every step in the process where a hurdle is thrown in front of you, you must pause for reflection and take the government official to task. This may be a slow and cumbersome process at first, but it will pave the way for others to follow. Be persistent!

Revocation of Participation in Social Security & Notice Denial of Existence of Signature on the SS-5 (Affidavit 4) Most people have tacitly agreed with the social security contract by accepting government benefits when they came of legal age. This contract or trust instrument was initiated when the SS-5 was signed on your behalf by your custodians when you were a minor. Even without your hand-written signature, it is an adhesion upon your sovereign character. More than likely your parents entered into this contract or trust instrument without your knowledge and consent. Your signature was sealed when you first received benefits from the governments including social security, workman’s compensation, welfare, food stamps, or medical care. - 312 -"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Affidavits in Order Social Security Is An Adhesion Contract Until you refuse those benefits, revoke your social security number OR deny the existence of your signature upon the SS5, you will be treated like a slave (i.e., U.S. citizen). 1) revoke your social security number 2) deny the existence of your signature on the SS-5 3) stop accepting any government benefits If you want a refund of all past Social Security taxes paid, send $50 to the SSA and ask for a “certified audit” of your account.

I found it interesting enough to put it in this edition to challenge all patriot mythologies around the use of the SSN. What is it really?] Governor Eric Madsen (Colorado) asserts that nowhere in the Social Security Act does the SSN attach to a natural-born individual. Instead he asserts, it’s a “Constructive Trust” account number established in the Trustee “name” you’re given at birth, except that it’s fictionalized in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (e.g., like on your birth certificate). TRUST NAME = JOHNNY LIBERTY TRUSTEE = Johnny Liberty First, assume that the Social Security Administration is the Creators of the “Constructive Trust.” That the legal fiction created in your name with a “Birth Certificate” is the Trustee. And that the Beneficiary is unknown (except it could very well be the U.S. government corporation or the principals/creditors of such) SSN = CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST I.D. # 1) Creator is the Social Security Administration. 2) Legal Fiction created in your name with a “Birth Certificate” is the Trustee. 3) Beneficiaries are unknown (except it could very well be the U.S. government corporation or the principals/creditors). > CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST — raised by inference or implication of law whenever the circumstances of a transaction are such that the person who takes the legal estate cannot also enjoy the beneficial interest without violating some established principle of equity. So what would Mr. Madsen have us do, but acknowledge there is such a “Constructive Trust,” and it is NOT who you are. You are indeed presumed a sovereign “state” Citizen, distinct from that “Constructive Trust” and nobody can take that away from you (except through trickery and deceit). There need be no confusion that you are distinct from this creature, and now you’ll have evidence to prove it. Here’s what you’ll need to do. 1) create a “SS Trust” nunc pro tunc to the “Date of Birth” on your “Birth Certificate” (as SSA did when you got the SSN) 2) send the SSA a copy of trust with a constructive legal notice stating what you assert to be true 3) if they ignore your notice, they accept by default 4) send them a notice of default with their tacit admission of the truth of your assertions 5) now, record the “SS Trust” with a fictitious business name at your Secretary of State 6) keep the original of the “SS Trust” to prove without a shadow of doubt in a statutory court, that “JOHNNY DAVID LIBERTY” is a legal fiction, registered in the corporate State of...; clearly, they have served the wrong party. 7) apply the rules of grammar , give judicial notice and provide evidence of the “SS Trust,” “That's not me!” 8) demand the court serve the proper party to the action (i.e., the “SS Trust”) which is NOT you. 9) now when you apply for a driver license, put Trustee on your signature on the drivers license application 10) as a private individual, you cannot be held accountable for the actions of the trust or any citations received henceforth. - 313 -"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook Therefore, Form 1041 would be the appropriate tax form for those Americans who volunteer as taxpayers, not the Form 1040 as we’re told. This is a very interesting theory and Mr. Madsen has been effectively testing it for a number of years. Notice to the Department of Commerce of the Existence of a Constructive Trust (i.e., Birth Certificate) in YOUR NAME Editor’s Note: We still advise not getting State-issued “Birth Certificates” from the State when your children are born. For all newborn children, prepare an “Affidavit of Live Birth” noting the “Day of Birth,” not the ”Birth Date.” Get both parents, the doctors, midwives or other witnesses in attendance to swear under penalties of perjury that the child was indeed born. Then file these as legal documents at a County Recorder’s office and notarize an entry in your family Bible. These documents will be useful when the child applies for a usA Passport, or needs to verify American Citizenship. Madsen’s assertion about the social security “Constructive Trust” sheds another light on the “Birth Certificate.” We know that the “Birth Certificate” was the first unrevealed “Trust” instrument to put you in commerce with the federal United States government corporation. It was instituted after the Civil War to “register” the children of the newly freed slaves. It is filed in the District of Columbia in the Department of Commerce via the County Recorder, Department of Health, Office of State Registrar, Secretary of State, and/or Bureau of the Census. 15 The “Birth Certificate,” like the “SS Trust,” also has the elements of an “Constructive Trust.” The “Date of Birth” indicates the birth of the Trust as a legal “person,” not the natural-born person. The “Date of Birth” on driver’s licenses and other legal documents is presumptive evidence of a linkage to the Trust instrument while the “Day of Birth” indicates the birth of the natural-born person. The “Birth Certificate” may be the foundation of all adhesion contracts. Curiously, under Maritime procedures administered under an Admiralty jurisdiction, the “Birth Certificate” supports the presumption that you are a “vessel” of the United States, duly registered with a Title (YOUR NAME CAPITALIZED), with a certificate of a “date of birth” (launching). Thus the creditors of the federal United States can act against your property (vessel or vassal) by arresting, seizing or making claims against you. YOUR NAME CAPITALIZED may be the prize. 16 The authority of the federal United States is based on its ability to tax and regulate commerce, thus the “Birth Certificate” is the foundation of all claims to jurisdiction, as virtually every American citizen has been placed into commerce via a “Birth Certificate.” Interestingly enough, the federal United States government corporation is named as a “Beneficiary” of the “Trust” which you operate on their behalf as “Trustee.” Thus your life, liberty, productivity, labor have been transferred to the foreign principals/creditors and sovereign Power structure, and you are indebted for life quite literally as chattel property. Editor’s Note: I read, but cannot prove, that you were enrolled into the “Joint Stock Trust” of the Federal Reserve Banking System as a “beneficiary” via your “Birth Certifi- cate. How can this be so, if the Federal Reserve is a corpo- ration with shareholders, not beneficial interest holders? It could very well be that neither of these “Constructive Trusts” (SS Trust and Birth Certificate), interfere with the sovereign character of the individual that they adhere ONLY to the corporate and commercial side of the legal fiction. Perhaps, they have a foundational relationship to the same, “Constructive Trust.” Therefore, neither would have to be revoked or expunged, but simply acknowledged for what they are distinct legal fictions from who you really are in your sovereign capacity. Getting Your Business in Order We’re going to look at banking options and transiting away from sole proprietorships, self-employment situations, and corporations as the primary legal structures for operating a business, or holding assets and property. Do this after you’ve already set-up the statutory/domestic, non-domestic, or foreign entities through which revenue, income, investments and property are channeled. Take your time, don’t be in a hurry, choose your service providers wisely, get your papers and business in order to make this transition to prosperity, protection and privacy. We’re going to look at ways to enhance protection and privacy regarding your money matters. Start out with a clean slate and close your existing individual and business accounts at your present bank. Banking Onshore Your Foreign Estate As you probably already know by now, all your individual or dba (i.e., doing business as) bank accounts are all linked to a SSN, TIN or EIN Number. Getting non-domestic, W-8 accounts are not that difficult if you’re working through an entity, but attempting to open them as a free sovereign individual is almost futile in the United States. We haven’t though, given up doing banking in the United States (e.g., American Savings & Loan). Attempt to reopen an account as a sovereign “state” Citizen or sui juris freeman/woman at a bank willing to recognize your tax-exempt, foreign status and not require a SSN, TIN or EIN (e.g., Washington Mutual). This is increasingly difficult, but not impossible. You may have to shop around for a bank in your area. Admittedly, they’re not easy to come by. This is getting increasingly difficult to do for Americans living and working in the continental united states of America. The Federal Reserve Banking System is a global cartel and they don’t appreciate anyone slipping through the cracks. In this scenario your assets are considered a “Foreign Estate,” foreign to the federal United States. - 314 -"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Business in Order Sometimes, you can open up an individual or business account without your Social Security Number, TIN or EIN (use 999-99-9999 or another 999 prefix if they demand a number; 999 prefixes are not issued for social security purposes. A non-resident alien, OR tax-exempt individual or sovereign “state” Citizen doesn’t need a SSN. At one time the IRS issued Non-Resident Identification Numbers (NRIN) with an 888 prefix. 17 Give the bank copies of your Affidavit: Tax-Exempt Foreign Status, a substitute W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status, and/or “Fictitious Business Name” if you are operating a business account. On all checks deposited stamp “For Deposit Only as part of my Foreign Estate per 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(31),” and over your signature stamp “ With Explicit Reservation of All My Unalienable Rights and Without Prejudice pursuant to the UCC 1-207.” Get two rubber stamps made. Use cash or postal money orders whenever possible instead of a bank. These give you more privacy and are harder to track than checks. Banking Onshore Your Trust Account After you’ve set up a non-domestic Common law or Pure Trust organization, you can open a “non-interest bearing passive account,” or “fiduciary account” in the name of the foreign entity or Trust at a bank that offers that service (e.g., U.S. Bank). These are also called W-8 accounts. Editor’s Note: Bank of America recently closed all their W-8 accounts. Non-Interest Bearing Passive Account Or Fudiciary Account If the bank requests it, give them copies of the Trust documents or bylaws that are part of the public record and pertinent to banking activities. Do not give them the entire document, as it is your private business. Here’s how to open the account. 1. posture yourself in a position of strength. 2. ask for “non-interest bearing passive account” (not trust account). 3. ask who opens new accounts at the bank? 4. ask what the assets of this bank are and the current ratio of losses? look over the prospectus seriously and read it. 5. introduce yourself as an officer of a lucrative trust or foreign entity. 6. you fill out their paperwork, don’t let them do it for you. 7. go with trust documentation and trust officer or foreign entity I.D. 8. do not offer them a tax I.D. # of any kind. 9. go with IRS documents to support the W-8. 10. if they ask about your SSN, tell them “I don't need a social security number because I'm financially independent.” Have an associate or authorized representative open the Trust Account(s). Have them bring the signature card back to you to sign. Do not under any circumstances commingle your signature, SSN, or TIN, with the Trust or foreign entity Account(s). If they demand them for identification purposes only, either refuse, find another bank, or get them to sign an agreement not to co-mingle your accounts with the Trust Account. If you’ve decided to get an EIN for a statutory Trust, you can offer them that. Sign the signature card(s) and checks with “Trustee” or “Business Manager” only. 18 Debit Cards Offshore For Entities Now, regarding banking in an offshore jurisdiction foreign to the federal United States government corporation. Remember a debit card is simply an accounting procedure for extracting your money, or FRN’s, from an account over which you have control. You can get debit cards in a number of offshore jurisdictions foreign to the federal United States government corporation and the Federal Reserve Banking System. Foreign to the United States would include: • Republic of Panama • Isle of Man • Switzerland • Belize • Costa Rica • Cayman Islands • Bahamas • Turks and Caikos Islands • St/ Vincent and Grenadines • British Virgin Islands • Antiqua • Kingdom of Hawai’i • Indian Reservations • or Other Sovereign Nations These debit cards are generally attached to a foreign entity, applied for by an officer of the Trust, IBC or S.A. Funds can be deposited offshore via a cashiers check, courier, money orders or other negotiable instruments into the account. The debit card can then access the funds through any bank machine around the world. There is often a minimum deposit required, and an annual maintenance fee for these accounts. They can also be linked to an investment account to earn passive income while sitting in the bank. Offshore Debit Cards By law, U.S. citizens, cannot import or export more than $10,000 in cash, or other negotiable instruments, without reporting to the IRS or other federal customs authorities. As a beneficiary of a foreign entity though, a U.S. citizen can bring money into the country tax-free. These laws also do not apply to sovereign “state” Citizens, but you don’t want to be caught and snagged regardless of your Citizenship. You cannot trust the government corporation to honor this distinction. - 315 -"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook These banks are outside the jurisdiction of the federal government and have strict banking privacy laws. If there is no paper trail, no 1099 reporting, no cancelled checks from a SSN, TIN, EIN linked account, and no bank reporting — your business is for your eyes only! Remember, total liquidity is total financial freedom to go where you want, when you want. Credit Cards Onshore Individual Or Trust Credit cards are a completely different animal, even though they look the same as a debit card. Credit cards are a debt- creating, bankruptcy-making addiction to borrowed money and borrowed time. Instead of being reliant on credit cards, FRN’s or other negotiable instruments of debt in the exchange of products, goods and services — utilize gold/silver coin, warehouse receipts, or local scrips whenever possible. Use cash, postal money orders, or checks only when necessary. We the People must learn to get along without an addiction to bank credit created unlawfully by the banks from nothing with interest added to the insult. Borrowed money is always borrowed time until the debt either is discharged or repudiated. Bankruptcy is always the ultimate consequence for the debt-addicted consumer. Borrowed Money = Borrowed Time Sever your links ASAP with bank credit. Become a creditor yourself instead of a debtor. The bankers are desperate to loan you money, as it’s the only way they can expand the economy. But ultimately you pay the price with your freedom. Credit cards support the presumption that you are a debtor, not a creditor in the system — and only creditors can be sovereign. Give Yourself Some Credit If you are not ready to tear up your credit cards, allow your present credit cards to expire. Then apply for a new card, if you must, in your name, or in the name of your Trust Account if credit has been established. Do not associate your signature or SSN, TIN or EIN with the Credit Card if at all possible. If you apply for a credit card and must use an SSN, then be certain to specify it’s use is “For Information Only.” 19 Be prepared to repudiate these cards at anytime, and be careful not to abuse them. These are evidence of debt, and a “voluntary,” although increasingly necessary contract to participate in the National Public Credit System. If these credit cards are ever used as a presumption to negate your sovereign “state” Citizenship, you must be prepared to expose the banker’s fraud in the court. It is against the law for banks to create “money” and that’s exactly what they do when they issue you a credit card. Business Licenses Most business licenses are totally unnecessary especially if you’ve organized and restructured outside the jurisdiction of the democracy. Cancel unnecessary “Business Licenses” or “Fictitious Business Names (i.e., dba’s). Keep them if necessary ONLY if they’re NOT associated with your SSN, TIN, signature or corporation. A Trust Organization doesn’t need a Fictitious Business Name. You must though, provide certain parts of the Trust document to authenticate the organization (e.g., opening a bank account). In some professions, it would be a hardship to operate without certain professional licenses (e.g., general contractor, medical doctor). These licenses could be secured in another name, or in a company not associated with you as a sovereign Citizen. If they must be in your name, then declare and file an Affidavit rescinding your signature on the contract under threat, duress and coercion. In Oregon, a SSN is not associated with the DBA. You can also file your own DBA with the County Recorders office or with the Common law court. Reapply in the name of your Trust Account(s). • BUSINESS LICENSES negate your Common law “right to work” in the profession and skill of your choice or talent. Do you need permission from the government to go to the bathroom too? Free yourself from “permission” to contract when you have the unalienable “right to contract.” Incorporation Papers and Common Law Contracts As far as doing business as a sole proprietorship, using a dba (i.e., doing business as) company, a self-employment situation, or a corporation, we suggest you dissolve or disassociate from these structures. Avoid these and other statutory “legal fictions” as your primary mode of doing business. These can still be useful as a part of a complex business organization. Instead, investigate general and limited partnerships, limit - ed liability companies, Common law and foreign trusts, in - ternational business corporations, society anonymous, and corporation soles for preserving wealth, protecting assets, holding real estate, holding private, place-travel devices, or for operating a business — domestic, non-domestic, and/or offshore. There are a multitude of options available. Dissolve existing corporations, profit or non-profit, after you’ve designed a plan of action to transfer your business into other foreign entities. • INCORPORATION for your for-profit or non-profit business with the limited liability for the payment of debt is a BENEFIT from the government, which costs the private individual 100% ownership and control over the corporation. Corporations are creations of and chartered by the State. You are now working for a government- protected enterprise, and subject to all the rules and regulations thereof. When the churches incorporated recently they lost not only their sovereignty and independence, but their 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion as well. Don’t make the same mistake. Consider other legal structures that preserve Common law rights. • NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS are owned and controlled lock, stock and barrel by the IRS and it’s foreign principals/creditors. If you’re working in the - 316 -"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Getting Your Business in Order non-profit sector, the Federal Reserve and its principals/creditors are your bosses. They don’t give grants and funding away without receiving control over the agendas of these organizations, some of which is well meaning. Merge the Common law into your standard legal forms and statutory contracts. Include something comparable to the following in all contracts. “ All parties agree that this ‘Contract’ shall be under the jurisdiction of Common law right of contract as provided for under the Constitutions of the sovereign states of America, including the Oregon Republic (1859) and the Constitution for the united states of America (1787).” “No party shall reveal any records or contracts concerning the other party without written authorization of the other party concerned, or a duly issued court order. Neither party is required to report any information to any federal, state, county or local government agency.” 20 Right To Travel As an American National or sovereign “state” Citizen, you have a constitutionally secured right to travel without getting permission from the government, unless you “drive” commercially for hire. Driver’s licenses, vehicle registration, license plates or insurance are required for commercial persons, operating commercial enterprises upon the highways in vehicles they do not own. By accepting a driver’s license, vehicle registration, license plates and insurance, you must comply with the provisions of those contracts. If you have NOT established a contractual nexus within any of the fifty federal States, then you are NOT a person required to acquire the above permissions and licenses. If you do NOT own the vehicles you are operating in allodium and hold the true title (i.e., MSO), then the State has the right to license the use of their property. Although, your right to travel has been seriously encroached upon by the de facto government, they have neither repealed the Constitution, nor have they crossed the line and legislated away your right to travel. We the People have simply misunderstood these distinctions at-law, between an unalienable sovereign right, and a government-granted license, permission or benefit. Attorneys and legislators have twisted and confused the statutes, but they have NOT yet abrogated the Common law of the land. “ Even the legislature has no power to deny to a citizen the right to travel upon the highway and transport his/her property in the ordinary course of his business or pleasure, though this right may be regulated in accordance with the public interest and convenience.” —Chicago Motor Coach vs. Chicago, 169 NE 22 It has taken a lot of effort and research to get this unalienable right acknowledged by the courts. Now with the Common law courts being consummated across the united states of America, our right to travel can be adjudicated in these courts instead. To exercise this right takes a brave and courageous Citizen willing to risk arrest, impoundment and inconvenience. The traffic stop is where the police state begins. It must be stopped here. “ The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his/her property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a common right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” —Thompson vs. Smith, 154 SE 579 Most Americans do not realize they do not own their “vehicle,” “private conveyance,” or “place-travel device,” even if it’s paid in full with FRN’s. The State has the true title and you are licensing the use of a government-owned vehicle which you must register, license the use of, and insure. When you purchase an automobile or truck from a dealer, the “Manufacturers Statement of Origin (MSO)” is sent to the State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), microfilmed, then destroyed. The MSO is the true title to the automobile or truck, and the State acquires it from the dealer directly when first purchased. You do not see it. You were not told that the State had a secured a financial interest, and is the trustee of the property. You purchased it with FRN’s, not lawful money of the realm, thus you do not own it. The State records the true title on a State inventory of property and issues you an equitable “Certificate of Title,” not to convey title, but to certify that there is a title, and the State has ownership and control of it. “ ...a state may not constitutionally require a Federal employee to secure a driver’s permit as a prerequisite to the operation of a motor vehicle in the course of his federal employment.” —supreme Court Justice Holmes, Johnston vs. Maryland, 254 U.S. 51(1920) For a free sovereign individual interested in securing true title to their private automobile, truck or motorcycle, they must purchase them with at least $21 silver and the balance in FRN’s, along with a “Bill of Sale.” Only the brave and courageous need apply. In summary, the issues regarding your unalienable right to travel include: 1. driver’s license — are you a free sovereign individual exercising your right to travel, OR are you a commercial person engaged in a commercial activity? 2. ownership, registration and licensing — have you secured the allodial ownership of your property, OR does the State have trusteeship or legal ownership of the property? - 317 -"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook 3. financial responsibility — are you economically sovereign and financially responsible to cover damages incurred due to your actions on the highway, OR must you accept insurance to meet your liabilities? “ The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the 5th Amendment.” —Kent vs. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 125 Posturing Yourself at a Traffic Stop If a police officer stops you for an alleged traffic violation, you have many different “postures” to offer. A “posture” is a stand, a place of power from which you must relate to remain free of their jurisdiction, and committed to your own. We must become practiced and conscious of these postures, and arrange our paperwork to support our posture of choice. A posture is more powerful if it’s indeed lawful and true, not just an act. If you’re posturing yourself in a foreign jurisdiction, then you must be able to demonstrate or prove it with your paperwork, and mostly to be able to stand there in your character. Think these through in advance, decide which posture to use and have your papers in order. 1) PURE SOVEREIGNTY in a NEW CONVEYANCE: The police officer will ask for a State-issued “driver’s license, registration and proof of insurance” regardless of which posture you choose. Posture yourself as a sovereign “state” Citizen and offer your “Sovereign Citizen Identification Card.” As a sovereign “state” Citizen you won’t have a State-issued “drivers license.” In fact by law, you’re prohibited from having one. If you’re fortunate to have successfully purchased a new “Place-Travel Device” or private conveyance with the MSO then offer the MSO in lieu of registration and the Bill of Sale. You won’t have State-issued license plates either. Keep it a brand new conveyance preparing for export to another jurisdiction or country (which is absolutely the truth). Offer your “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” or a bond in lieu of insurance, or exercise a self-insurance option. If you have any luck, you’ll be on your way. A State-issued driver’s license is required on State-licensed, registered and insured “motor vehicles” only. But beware of what information to volunteer to the police officer. If he asks you if you’re a “resident” and you say yes, you’re done for. Refuse to answer on the grounds that it will incriminate you. After all, the police officer is a private Citizen, a professional witness for the State. Do not incriminate yourself. Do not offer information about yourself freely or gab. Loose lips sink ships! Be prepared for possible citations, even impoundment at the officer’s discretion. 2) PURE SOVEREIGNTY in a USED CONVEYANCE: Posture yourself as a sovereign “state” Citizen and offer your “Positive Identification” and “Sovereign Citizen I.D.” You cannot secure true and lawful title to a used conveyance, but you can revoke the State’s trusteeship over your private property. Send the State-issued plates, registration and “Certificate of Title” back to the State. Keep a record of your revocations and the State defaults. Do not put your home-made plates on the conveyance. Prepare the conveyance for export to another jurisdiction or country (which is absolutely the truth). Offer your “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” or a bond in lieu of insurance, or exercise a self-insurance option. Be prepared for possible citations, even impoundment at the officer’s discretion. 3) GLOBAL SOVEREIGNTY in a NEW CONVEYANCE in a FOREIGN ENTITY not REGISTERED in the STATE: Posture yourself as a permanent tourist with a foreign domicile and offer your “International Motorist’s Qualification Card” or “International Driver’s Permit (IDP)” as an American National, U.S. citizen, or citizen of another country. The IDP is only good outside the country of issue, therefore you must be domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction to the forty-eight states (e.g., Belize, Costa Rica, Bahamas or any of 200+ countries). If you’re fortunate to have purchased a new “place-travel device” with the MSO then offer that in lieu of registration. You won’t have State-issued license plates either. In this scenario, offer your “Certificate of Financial Responsibility,” or a bond in lieu of insurance, or exercise a self-insurance option (e.g., Peugot Sound). If they realize they’ve got no jurisdiction, then you’re on your way. They certainly don’t, over YOU, but they may suspect the MSO as evidence of title. Be prepared to stand. 4) GLOBAL SOVEREIGNTY in a USED CONVEYANCE in a FOREIGN ENTITY REGISTERED in the STATE: Posture yourself as a permanent tourist with a foreign domicile and offer your “International Motorist’s Qualification Card” or “International Driver’s Permit (IDP)” as an American National, U.S. citizen, or citizen of another country. Register, re-title and get State-issued plates for the “motor vehicle” in the name of a foreign entity, trust or IBC. Offer your “Certificate of Financial Responsibility,” or a bond in lieu of insurance, or exercise a self-insurance option. They’ve got jurisdiction over the “motor vehicle” because they’re State-issued plates and registration, but YOU are not in their jurisdiction. Remember, you’re NOT a “resident” even though you may very well be an American National (not “state” Citizen in this posture). You’re on your way. - 318 -"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Securing Your Right to Travel Securing Your Right to Travel Right to Travel (Affidavit5) Editor’s Note: I used Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) as an example for the definition of terms. You must convert the cites into your own Motor Vehicle Code. In summary, the issues regarding your unalienable right to travel include: 1. driver’s license — are you a free sovereign individual exercising your right to travel, OR are you a commercial person engaged in a commercial activity like “driving a motor vehicle.” 2. ownership, registration and licensing of the vehicle — have you secured the allodial ownership of your “Place- Travel Device,” OR does the State have trusteeship or legal ownership of the vehicle? 3. are you economically sovereign enough to be financially responsible to cover damages incurred due to your actions on the road, OR must you accept insurance to meet your liabilities? Dealing with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) can be more difficult at times than dealing with the IRS. This is the bottom line of the police (i.e. policy, political) state. It begins at a traffic stop. This is probably why the government persists in turning a deaf ear to the pleas of most sovereign “state” Citizens, and the courts have continued to enforce the revenue collecting, bureaucratic scam of the government instead of enforcing the clear intent of the law regarding your right to travel. Revenue Collecting, Bureaucratic Scam To enforce the law would cost these State corporations billions in lost revenue that they rightly fear would not be replaced, so they continue to pretend to enforce the law, when in fact they are enforcing a complete fraud and violating your rights and due process as well. Notify the DMV who you are and assert your sovereign right to travel. You must get evidence into the public record regarding your status by Affidavit, and give them Constructive Legal Notice. This is the first step towards reclaiming your right to travel. 21 Certified Mail - Return Receipt this Affidavit & Constructive Legal Notice to: 1) Your State, Department of Motor Vehicles Constructive Legal Notices: Right to Travel Have legal notices and educational information on hand in your vehicle to give the police officers at a traffic stop to inform them of their individual liabilities should they proceed to violate your rights. As with many other areas of our lives, police officers routinely ignore these “Constructive Legal Notices”, and have no sense of their individual liabilities because rarely have they been taken them to task. They’re beginning to get the message. They must receive this message from many sovereign “state” Citizens, and be educated as to their responsibilities. The legislators have made the police officer liable to collateral attack because they are unwittingly engaged in unlawful process. The public policies, procedures and revenue-collecting acti- vities of the various government agencies must be changed. The police officer on the street needs to demonstrate better discretion in determining who is required to have a drivers license and vehicle registration, by asking the appropriate questions, such as, “Are you a U.S. citizen subject to my jurisdiction?” How can they be relied upon as a State witness if they don’t even know what constitutes a crime? Legal Determinations & Rulings You will need to “Request a Legal Determination & Ruling” from the DMV, regarding your right to travel. If they fail to respond to your request, their denial becomes admissable evidence in a court of law. I would also suggest petitioning the Common law court for the same. You may “Request a Record Change” from the DMV at the same time you file your Affidavit. Their refusal to do so also can be admitted as evidence in either a court proceeding or an administrative hearing. You must exhaust all your administrative remedies before proceeding with an Aricle 1 court case. Get all your evidence into the proceeding through the administrative hearing before ever showing up in court. The rules of evidence and civil procedure apply in all administrative hearing processes, 90% of your case ought to be set into motion here. You will also need to demand that the courts respond to your “Request for Admissions & Stipulations.” These will box the court into admitting or denying basic, fundamental principles of law regarding your right to travel, which can be used for identifying reversible error at a higher court level. 23 Freeman/Woman’s Traffic Complaint & Citation Process If your rights as a sovereign “state” Citizen are violated, and most certainly they will be, you can give a “Notice to Appear Cross-Complaint” to the police officer at a traffic stop. Ask him/her for his badge number, bond number and if you are under arrest. Or file any Cross-Complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction. You can get a copy of this citation book from Citizens for Sovereignty. 22 File “Non-Statutory Abatements” against the police officers who initiated the action against you and demand that he/she correct the process before reserving it to you in your proper name, to your proper address. If they persist in violating due process and your unalienable right to travel, you can sue them for civil rights violations under Title 42, §1983.

This section is in addition to any exemptions from the vehicle code under ORS 801.026. The following persons are granted the described driving privileges: (1) A person who is not a resident of this state may operate a motor vehicle without an Oregon license or driver permit if the person holds a current out-of-state license issued to the person by the person’s home jurisdiction.

Driver License Send the “driver license” back to them along with an Affidavit: Right to Travel and Constructive Legal Notice, and order them to delete it from the records through a “Request for Record Change.” If you’re willing to defend your right to travel, then you can either: 1. revoke the driver’s license. 2. do not renew your driver’s license. 3. get a commercial license instead for commercial use. 4. get a driver’s license in the name of your SS Trust Account. 5. posture yourself with an offshore International Driver’s Permit (IDP). 6. posture yourself with a foreign entity I.D. card and lease. It’s also advisable to “Request a Legal Determination & Ruling” from them with the appropriate “Admissions & Stipulations” so that you can demonstrate that you have exhausted all administrative remedies before proceeding with lawful action to defend your right to travel. More than likely the DMV will ignore your requests and default on your Affidavits and Constructive Legal Notices. This driver license attaches to you. ORS 801.245 “Driver license” or “license” may have any or all of the meanings provided for the terms under this section as required or appropriate under the section referring to the term. The term “driver license” may be used interchangeably with “license” and either term may be used in any or all of the following ways: 1. It may refer to a document issued by this state or any other jurisdiction as evidence of a grant of driving privileges. 2. It may refer to general driving privileges granted by this state or another jurisdiction. If you revoke the driver license or don’t renew it, then get your papers in order to either weather a citation, impound - ment situation, or posture yourself in a foreign domicile. Use your “Sovereign Citizen Identification Card (SCIC)” for a traffic stop instead of a drivers license. This will not prevent you from getting a citation or finding yourself in an impoundment situation. You must be prepared to fight the process. If you posture yourself with an “International Driver’s Permit (IDP)” your paperwork will be in order at a traffic stop. International Driver’s Permit (IDP) 1. only good outside the country of issue 2. not regulated by UN 3. use in country where passport is not required for entry/exit (or get entry/exit stamps in your passport) 4. use to validate non-residence/nonsales tax 5. also get an entity driver’s license for private conveyances leased from a foreign entity The third scenario relates to the SSN as a trust I.D. #. Thus apply for the driver license in the name of the trust with the trust I.D. # associated. Sign the driver license with your name and “Trustee.” If you wish to maintain your present driver license, place “Without Prejudice, UCC 1-207” under your signature on the driver license, obey all traffic laws and be prepared to pay your tickets as usual. You could also get a commercial license, for commercial use only as a chauffeur. It would only kick in for commercial use, or at a traffic stop. ORS 801.360 “Motor vehicle.” “Motor vehicle” means a vehicle that is self- propelled or designed for self-propulsion. “Operating” or “driving “a “motor vehicle” is defined by the various legislatures as a “commercial activity”, and is not applicable to individual use. You must reference the statutes and the legislative intent of the public laws in your State which define those who are “eligible or required.” Vehicle Registration, License Plate, Certificate of Title, OR Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin If you’re not ready to defend your right to travel, then continue with your present vehicle registration — rubber stamp “Without Prejudice, UCC 1-207” over both the renewal and the certified copy (if you can get away with it). This will compromise your sovereign “state” Citizenship as a presumption will stand that you have exchanged rights for privileges. Registration, license plates and insurance attach to you if it’s in your name. Otherwise it attaches to the entity it’s registered, licensed and insured to. If you do NOT register the State-owned vehicle, you must surrender the plates to the DMV. Do not put your own license plates on the vehicle. After seven years, if a vehicle is not registered, the records for the vehicles are destroyed. The State Owns Your Property Registration begins with the “Title” to the vehicle. There is no law requiring you to register or license anything unless you don’t own it. You can only register or license someone else’s property, in this case automobiles, motorcycles and trucks. We call them “Place-Travel Devices” or private “Convey- ances.” If you can secure “Title” to your property, then there is no law binding you to registration, plates and insurance. - 320 -"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Securing Your Right to Travel ORS 801.526 “Title” means an ownership interest in a vehicle that is evidenced by a record of the Department of Transportation or of some other jurisdiction. The record may be in the form of a certificate of title or it may be in another form, including but not necessarily limited to electronic or machine-readable form... Secure The Title To Your Property If you can, get a copy of the original “Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin (MSO)” from the Manufacturer for your present vehicle(s). Few have found success in getting these documents or even locating their whereabouts especially for used conveyances. The “MSO” is apparently on microfilm in the federal State from which the vehicle was originally purchased from the Dealer, although it’s difficult to track them. The State will not admit to having any evidence of title other than the “Certificate of Title,” except in their own Code. Manufacturer’s Statement Of Origin ORS 801.185 “Certificate of title” means a paper document issued by any jurisdiction specifically as evidence of vehicle ownership. A certificate of title is not necessarily the only evidence of vehicle ownership issued by a jurisdiction. Notice the “For Official Government Use Only” sticker on the back of your new stickers from the State. Notice the words “VOID” in the watermark of your “Certificate of Title” in several places. Still don’t believe the State owns your vehicle? Certificate of Title 1. indicates “beneficial holder” as part of a trust relationship 2. State is the trustee 3. registration, license and insurance required by owner 4. only an owner can license 5. revoke State trusteeship over “vehicle” after clearing yourself of adhesion contracts To hold true or allodial title to automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, or as we call them, “place-travel devices,” requires a process of either securing the MSO, or revoking the State’s trusteeship over the motor vehicle and exporting it into the jurisdiction of the free republic. This will not only purchase the vehicle, but also transfer the allodial title to you. You must pay for the vehicle with $21 silver with the balance in FRN’s. Do not register the vehicle with the State. Leave the plates vacant, looking like a new car from a dealer (even if it’s an old klunker). So here is a summary of the steps necessary to purchase a used conveyance, and revoking the State’s trusteeship over the motor vehicle and securing true title: Buying a Used Car 1. likely, you cannot get the MSO, because it’s been destroyed or microfilmed by the State, therefore you must revoke the States trusteeship over the motor vehicle 2. purchase it with a Bill of Sale including a Bill of Conveyance along with $21 silver and the balance in FRN’s to transfer allodial title 3. return the “Certificate of Title,” registration and plates to the DMV 4. dismantle, salvage or export to a foreign jurisdiction OR register it in a company or Trust organization 5. travel by right freely in your private property OR lease the vehicle from a company or Trust organization. If the “Certificate of Title” is presently in your name, you must notify the State of your allodial ownership via a Bill of Conveyance or the MSO if can locate it. Revoke the State trusteeship over the “vehicle.” You could also transfer the equitable interest of the automobile or truck into a Common law Trust and isolate your liabilities there. Go ahead and transfer the title into your name, or directly into a trust or foreign entity. So here are the steps necessary to purchase a brand new “Place-Travel Device” from the dealer and securing the true title: Buying a New Car 1. do not negotiate with a salesman, sales manager or owner — deal with the business manager directly 2. don't let your emotions rule, or cave in to pressure to conform to their paperwork — use your own contract and bill of sale 3. demand the MSO (Manufacturer's Statement of Origin), keys, and warranty as a condition of the sale 4. make sure the MSO has only the dealer's name and information 5. purchase with $21 silver + the balance in FRN's 6. use a bill of sale purchased for export to a foreign jurisdiction — purchase as an individual not an entity 7. don't get a State-inspection sticker 8. don’t register, put self-made OR State-issued plates on 9. in the alternative, you can purchase in a foreign jurisdiction offshore and ship to the continental United States; BUT if you buy overseas and import, there’s a customs tax AND they’ll demand registration and license to bring into the country. If you choose to remain in the system and are not ready or able to purchase a new “Place-Travel Device,” debt-free, then you can have a Trust Organization, IBC, or SA purchase, register, license and Certificate of Title the motor vehicle in the State DMV. As an individual, you can lease the vehicle from the company, or as an officer of the company, you can be permitted to use company property for business purposes. - 321 -"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook After a year and a half traveling without plates, I’ve had enough grist for the mill, and am involved in enough court cases to defend my right to travel. I will now make a “Motion for Change of Venue” to the Common law court and have all my cases adjudicated there. Traveling can be hazardous to your health, peace-of-mind, and your pocketbook, especially in States that routinely impound your vehicle for failure to have plates, registration or driver’s licenses (e.g. California). Insurance, Bond or Certificate of Financial Responsibility In the case of financial responsibility, the individual would be responsible to either secure a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility,” a bond in lieu of insurance, or insurance in the individuals name with the company named as an additionally named insured on the policy. Be aware that there are riders in most, if not all, insurance policies that invalidate the coverage if you fail to have a State-issued drivers license or vehicle registration. There are offshore insurance policies available outside the United States jurisdiction if you have a foreign domicile. Had I invested everything paid out in insurance policies in my life, I would be a millionaire. Trouble is, We the People didn’t know any better. Take your average monthly premium, invest it and collateralize the returns. A minimum of $100,000 in trust meets the financial responsibility requirements of most States. The trust then issues a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” in lieu of insurance or a bond. Even if you are sovereign, and out of the jurisdiction, each of us must demonstrate financial responsibility to be a good sovereign. There are no free lunches, and we must take responsibility for the consequences of our actions. If we damage or injure another, then we must meet our liabilities. Insurance has been defined as goods for interstate commerce, thus it is an adhesion contract. It’s preferable to get an individual bond in lieu of insurance for the minimum required in your State (e.g., California requires $35,000 minimum bond). Insurance is not an investment, but a wager and comes under the gambling laws of the United States Code (U.S.C.). For those with no assets striving for economic sovereignty, isolating your liabilities by placing your vehicles in a non- domestic Trust organization, may be your best insurance policy yet. Your liability would be isolated to the assets of the Trust, whatever was still in your name and nothing more. This is purely a transitional tool, and not the ultimate. Restructuring Tax Liabilities Did the government ever come to you and say directly, “Pay your taxes”? Did you ever do your own thinking and look into the law yourself? Are you an individual or a “person” required under the Internal Revenue Code? Or do you file every year simply because other people (i.e., family, friends, employers) said, “You have to.” The IRS intimidates employers into withholding, and in turn the employer intimidates employees. Are your sick and tired of volunteering 1/3 - 1/2 of your annual income? Stop supporting the presumption that you are in their jurisdiction. Stop filing and signing your income tax returns unless you’re a “person” required. So how do you restructure your tax liabilities? Stop triggering tax liabilities in the first place. If you are a “person” required, tax liability triggers when “value” changes, not because of “income.” If you are NOT a “person” required, then the IRC is IRRELEVANT! It doesn’t apply to you as an American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen unless you have sourced income from “within” the federal U.S. government corporation. If that’s the case, you’d file a Form 2555. If you’re a government employee or officer of the government, you’d file Form 1040. If you’re operating as a statutory trust with a SSN, TIN or EIN, you’d file Form 1041. If you’re an American National OR sovereign “state” Citizen, you wouldn’t be liable to file at all.

If you’ve been a loyal slave, filing and paying your income taxes, then before “de-taxing” yourself be certain that your business and financial affairs are in order. You want to disappear from the system gradually and deliberately. Get judgment-proof, lien-proof, levy-proof and restructured for minimizing your taxes or becoming tax- exempt. Deal with the IRS before they attach liens or levies. Don’t become one of the 3,000 properties the IRS attaches to each month. Become Judgement And Lien Proof Dealing with the IRS (pre-lien, pre-levy) 1) get judgment-proof (civil & criminal), lien-proof 2) demand delegations of authority and enabling regulations 3) legal determinations and rulings 4) FOIA & PA request for information (FOIA #1) a) Individual Master File transcript complete b) Document 6209 Decoding Book c) Form 5546 - excise activity codes d) Form 668W - notice of levy service & treasury authorization e) Form 2039 - summons 5) decode and evaluate your IMF, BMF with Document 6209 6) refuse all correspondence and notices for fraud If you have a profitable business operation or lucrative investments, then place part or all of your assets into a complex business organization comprised of statutory and foreign entities. There are Common law, pure Trust organizations, International Business Corporations (IBC’s), and Society Anonymous (SA’s). Restructure All Income In Foreign Entities Complex Business Organizations 1. Common Law Trusts (CLT) a) one non-domestic or foreign trust for your private conveyance or “place-travel device” b) one non-domestic or foreign trust for property and real estate c) one non-domestic or foreign trust for operating a business 2.

Partnerships a) one for professionals b) one for holding property in the united states of America If you have few assets and nothing linked to your name, then you have little concern about the IRS attaching garnishments, liens or levies to your assets except with regards to bank accounts or real property. Find a safe place to stash your cash, gold or silver and other tangible assets. Bury it in the back yard if necessary. If the IRS should ever activate a collection, audit or lien against you, you’ll have prima facie evidence in your favor. If they come head on, be prepared for a fight. The law may be on the side of the sovereign state Citizen or sui juris freeman/woman, but these “colorable” courts provide few remedies and recourses. Dealing with IRS (post-lien, post-levy) 1) sue for refusal to comply with FOIA request 2) challenge assessment in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 3) pay debt with gold/silver; redemption strategy, illegal for them to accept 4) letter regarding Title 42 against agents 5) letter regarding Title 18 against agents 6) commercial affidavit against withholding agent (e.g., insurance company, bank, employer) 7) ten years is the maximum for a statutory lien; if they cannot collect after ten years, it goes away. There are a few workable strategies for defeating the IRS in the Article 1 courts, but they’re limited, time-consuming and expensive. There is also LaMar Hardy’s “Reliance Defense” in bankruptcy court, or David Myrland’s “Chapter 83 Offense” in federal or tax court. Getting Your Taxes in Order Tax-Exempt Foreign Status (Affidavit 6) Your “Affidavit: Tax-Exempt Foreign Status” gives “Constructive Legal Notice” to the IRS which they must, by law, respond to. If they do not respond, and it’s likely they won’t, then the IRS has defaulted and in essence has agreed with your Affidavit. This can be used of prima facie evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction. The only court where the burden of proof is on the IRS is the United States Bankruptcy Court.

If you’re working for the federal U.S. government corpora- tion or a government-funded corpora-tion (county or State), you must file and the employer must withhold taxes. Until you inform your private-sector employer of your American national, sovereign “state” Citizen, the IRS will presume you are an “employee” making “wages” under IRC §3401, and direct your employer to withhold taxes under IRC §3101(a). 25 There are numerous Article 1 court cases attesting to our conclusion that a SSN is voluntary for employment purposes including the famous Taco Bell case brought by an attorney on behalf of his son who was denied employment because he failed to provide a SSN. He was rehired with full back pay and Taco Bell now makes a SSN optional for employment. Another case brought forth by the federal government’s own Equal Employment Opportunity Commission won a judgment regarding an employee’s religious objection to providing a SSN. He was reinstated with full back pay and damages. If your employer is unwilling to honor your evidence of tax- exempt foreign status, you can file a criminal complaint and civil suit. This is not the most comfortable relationship to have with your employer, yet it is necessary to assure that your rights will be respected. A smart employer will “fire” all his/her employees and contract with them for services needed as sovereign state Citizens. Your employer would not have to pay their usual share of the withholding tax either, and would benefit financially from this arrangement. 27 Certified Mail - Return Receipt this Letter and Notice to: 1) Your Employer, or 2) Any Company required to do government reporting (Form 1099) or withholding.

Tony Gold calls this your “right to entity” clause in the Constitution. You can chose to organize your individual and/or business affairs in a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other “foreign” entity. Any entity foreign to the jurisdiction of the federal United States government corporation is “foreign” by definition. “ No State shall...pass any... Law impairing the obligation of contracts...” —Constitution for the usA [1:10] These include domestic, non-domestic and foreign trusts, international business corporations (e.g., society anonymous), and corporation soles. A complex business organization utilizes a number of these foreign entities along with statutory corporations and partnerships to weave a tight web of impenetrable wealth preservation and asset protection for the sophisticated individual. 1) domestic or statutory trusts 2) non-domestic and foreign trusts 3) international business organizations 4) sociedad anonimie 5) corporation soles 6) complex business organizations What are the risks? Yes, you need someone you can “trust.” The nature of third party contracts is that you need to be able to play ball with other people you can trust. You must appoint competent officers, and trustees to handle thee business affairs of the trust, and/or company, and step forward and defend the foreign entity if attacked. Here’s how to utilize a foreign organization: 1) sells products 2) collects funds 3) deposits funds 4) delivers the product 5) foreign to a state 6) no jurisdiction Domestic or Statutory Trusts Statutory, parliamentary or living Trusts are usually formed by attorneys, thus are creatures regulated by the federal U.S. government corporation. They are “Domestic Trusts.” Those associated with SSN’s or TIN’s are “revocable,” Grantor-type trusts where the trustee is simply the alter-ego of the Grantor or Creator. They are treated as such, and every precaution must be made to handle them according to the IRC rules and regulations. These “Statutory Trusts” are easy to pierce, and we don’t recommend them except as components in a complex business organization. Domestic = Statutory They can be utilized in a complex business organization as the frontline organization for 1099 reporting requirements of an employer or broker that cannot be restructured otherwise, or for doing business with the government or other corporations. A “Domestic” or “Statutory Trust” would require an Employer Identification Number (EIN) granted by the IRS. When you apply for an EIN with Form SS-4 as a Trust, they will request your principle officer supply their SSN. Obviously, if you do not have one, or have revoked yours, then you cannot provide it. You could use another individual with a SSN as the soon-to-beretired “Authorized Agent” empowered only to apply for the EIN. Be certain to document this in the Trust Minutes as you don’t want this individual to come under attack for any reason. Some of the features are: 1) Apply for and receive EIN Number from the IRS with Form SS-4 2) Settlor is U.S. citizen or “foreign entity.” 3) Trustee is U.S. citizen or “foreign entity” 4) Officers and Directors are U.S. citizens 5) Signer on bank account is U.S. citizen 6) Beneficiaries are U.S. citizens and 'foreign persons' 7) 95% capitalized by non-domestic “foreign entity.” 8) keep books and records 9) annual filing of Form 1041, K-1’s 10) all 1099 reporting attributed to this Trust 11) GOAL: <5% net, reportable, taxable income Keep the Trust organization on the up and up, account, report and demonstrate no taxable income at the end of each year. Any net income not distributed to the beneficiaries is taxed at 37.5%, or whatever the current rate is. Make certain there is as little net income (<5%) as possible that is not distributed to the beneficiaries. You could leave a bone for the IRS of 5% taxable net income to appease them. The Trust would be required to provide K-1’s reporting all distributions to beneficiaries. Make the beneficiaries tax- exempt foreign entities, not U.S. persons (i.e., U.S. citizens), otherwise U.S. citizens would be required to pay tax on the K-1 distributions. - 325 -"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook This “Statutory Trust” could also be capitalized 95% by a foreign entity (e.g., non-domestic trust), thus expensing 95% of all income to service the loan by a foreign entity. For sovereign-minded people, the better strategy is — no “Statutory Trusts,” no statutory accounts, no reporting, no tracking. You’re home free and tax free! Non-Domestic & Foreign, Offshore Trusts A pure, “Non-Domestic” or “Foreign Trust” must be “irrevocable.” They can be domiciled in any of the state republics or offshore in a foreign country and jurisdiction. “Non-Domestic” Common law Trusts do not need to be filed or registered with any government agency. They are NOT registered within the D.C. jurisdiction. They can be authenticated with two witnesses or a Common law notary. Florida state is one state that recognizes the Common law Trust by statute as well. 40 Non-Domestic = Foreign A trust relationship is the contractual act of one party giving or exchanging property or assets to the control of a second party for the benefit of yet another third party. The Trustee has the authority to appoint officers and/or hire business managers, property managers, production managers, or a managing director. The Trustee has powers like an attorney, powers to do something (i.e., resolution of empowerment; deed of settlement). The Trustee has the power to rent, lease, purchase, subscribe, and/or contract with utilities in name of the trust. These Trusts must demonstrate at least an arms length between the three parties to the contract to be impenetrable or unassailable by any powers that might attack the entity. It is preferable for the initial individual with the assets to exchange into the trust to become an officer, not the Settlor, Trustee or Beneficiary. Checks should be deposited in non-interest bearing fudiciary accounts. Any accounts opened must not be linked to the SSN, TIN, EIN of any officer, or any Statutory Trust/Association. The Trustee, business manager or other authorized agent(s) will be the signer on all checks. We advise that accounting and records be kept in case this Trust comes under attack for any reason by government authorities. After all, these accounts are still physically in the continental united states of America, even though lawfully it may be foreign to the federal U.S. government corporation. Some of the features are: 1. Settlor is foreign to the federal United States or a “foreign entity” (i.e., American National or sovereign “state” Citizen 2. Trustee is foreign to the federal United States or a “foreign entity.” 3. Officers and Directors are foreign to the federal United States 4. Signer on bank account is authorized agent (U.S. citizen OR American National or sovereign “state” Citizen 5. Beneficiaries are U.S.citizens, American Nationals or sovereign “state” Citizens and “foreign entities.” 6. 95% capitalized by offshore “foreign entity.” 7. GOAL: <5% net, non-reportable income. “Non-Domestic” or Common law pure trusts have recently come under considerable scrutiny and attack by the IRS. There is a wave of people utilizing these Trusts, some poorly, and it’s gotten the attention of the IRS. The IRS calls these “abusive trusts.” As if a piece of paper can abuse anyone. I’ve got the feeling the IRS is being battered by the rising use of these instruments. More power to We the People. Should a Trust come under attack, the Trust bears the burden of expense. The Trustee bears the burden of respon- sibility to defend the Trust. The Settlor or Exchangor(s) bear the burden of heat if the trust is pierced or broken. Editor’s Note: In Tony Gold and Wealth Builders International’s trusts, the signature of Governor of the Cayman Islands is included with all trust documents as validation. “Foreign Trusts” are the same Common law instrument fundamentally as the “Non-Domestic” Trust, except that they are domiciled in a country physically as well as jurisdictionally foreign to the United States. The Settlors, Trustees and the Officers and Directors are “foreign” persons. This could mean “foreign” as Citizens of the united states of America, or Citizens of another country (e.g., Costa Rica). They are similar to “Non-Domestic Trusts” in all ways except: 1) Settlor is a foreign “person”(entity, American National or sovereign “state” Citizen, individual from another jurisdiction) 2) Officers and Directors are U.S. citizens OR foreign “persons” 3) Signer on bank account is U.S. citizen OR foreign “person” 4) Beneficiaries are U.S.citizens, American Nationals or sovereign “state” Citizens and “foreign entities.” 5) income is foreign-sourced 6) Entity was created before U.S. person involved 7) Entity is source of capitalization 8) GOAL: 100% non-reportable, liquid income accessible from any cash machine. In the scenario of a series of “Foreign Trusts” capitalizing a Statutory Trust or Partnership, 95% of the gross income from the “Statutory Trust” is paid to a “Non-Domestic Trust,” then 95% of the gross income from “Non-Domestic Trust” is paid to a “Foreign Trust” for capitalization costs. A similar result could be achieved using foreign entities as beneficiaries, and distributing 95% of the net income each year after expenses. The capitalization scenario looks like: 1) statutory trust or partnership is 95% capitalized by a non-domestic trust 2) non-domestic trust is 95% capitalized by a foreign trust 3) foreign trust distributes 95% of its net income to a U.S. beneficiary (tax-free) or other foreign entity. - 326 -"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Restructuring in Foreign Entities Keith Anderson and Anderson Ark Associate’s (AAA) strategy for foreign entities involves appointing the individual with the assets to exchange, or a W-2 wage-earner (U.S. citizen) as an agent of a foreign trust. The individual contracts with AAA as an employment agency (which provides a Schedule A deduction for those still filing). The individual provides management services in exchange for salary and perks (occupation). Some of the features are: 1) employment contract arrangement w/U.S. citizen. This strategy removes the U.S. citizen from being associated with the foreign entity. There is a tax penalty to all U.S. citizens who capitalize a foreign trust. But a foreign entity can capitalize another foreign entity without a penalty. Since the IRS has declared war on all foreign jurisdictions, every precaution must be taken. There is a huge exodus of funds due to oppressive government in the United States. Foreign Trusts Explained There are over 145 different kinds of Trust Organizations. When someone talks about “Trusts,” they can imply all kinds of different functions and utilizations of these instruments. We’ll be discussing simple or complex “Common law,“ “Pure Trusts,” “Business Trusts,” and/or “Foreign Trusts.” These can be domiciled onshore in the continental united states of America in any of the state republics, or offshore in Common law countries where English law once reigned (and still does). Onshore Or Offshore There is a lot of confusion about Trusts, what kind to choose, and which ones offer the most wealth generation and asset protection. Be aware, you must be discerning about who to trust with the responsibility for managing your property and directing your affairs. A trust is a three-party contract and involves distinct individuals or entities besides yourself. A “Domestic” Trust is statutory by nature, subject to the rules and regulations of the federal United States government corporation. Examples of these are any Trust organizations with IRS assigned EIN numbers, or the “living trust” created by attorneys. Domestic, Non-Domestic Or Foreign A “Non-Domestic” or “Foreign” Trust is Common law by nature, NOT subject to the jurisdiction of the federal United States, or any of its political subdivisions. It is based on your unalienable “right to contract.” Attorneys and the government corporation discourage these unregulated Trusts as they are outside their venue and taxing authority. “Foreign” Trusts can be domiciled onshore in any of the state republics of the united states of America, OR offshore in a foreign jurisdiction to the United States. Onshore Or Offshore Trusts are valuable tools to restore our rights and freedom today. They have been utilized by the sovereign Power structure for centuries to structure their affairs outside the jurisdiction of nation states. These, along with complex business organizations, are how the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet manage their business and financial affairs. They have managed to accumulate vast, unreported and mostly invisible portfolios of assets beyond all taxing authorities. They operate on the high seas of international law. These freedom technologies and transitional tools are now available for the sophisticated individual and entrepreneur with the motivation and desire to succeed, but not compromise their property and assets into the hands of the hungry, welfare-minded State that feeds off the productivity of the hardest working, most brilliant individuals in our society. We can break the back of the welfare State mentality by ending the taxation of our wealth and productivity. These freedom technologies and transitional tools are our best friends. Use them wisely, and study them well. Besides utilizing foreign entities and banking offshore, being sovereign-minded, is the most important step you can take to restore your liberties. It will take time, effort, and many courageous individuals to establish respect for sovereign “state” Citizens once again. Having a Trust isn’t the final remedy if your life, liberty and unalienable rights have all been surrendered to a tyrannical government. You must become knowledgeable enough about Trusts and other foreign entities to ask intelligent questions, bypass the probate and inheritance taxes that the U.S. Congress has passed, and to convey substantially appreciated property to your heirs and assigns without penalties. How is a Trust Created? A “Trust” is a three-party contract involving a Grantor / Creator, Trustees, and Beneficiaries. A Trust is a form of property ownership in which one person agrees to hold property for the benefit of another. The person holding the property is called the “Trustee,” and the person who benefits is called the “Beneficiary.” The Trustee must hold the property in Trust and is the fiduciary agent for the Beneficiary. The Trustee is the legal owner of the property. 33 Trusts exist in Great Britain, the united states of America, and other countries whose legal systems are derived from British Common law, although many other countries recognize the Trust. Trustees have the responsibility to act on behalf of the Beneficiary and in their best interest. The Trust contract spells out these responsibilities, and if they do not fulfill their obligation, the Equity courts can step in and offer equitable ownership on behalf of the Beneficiary. Nothing in the Trust contract may be construed in such a manner as to evade any State or federal law. Pure Business Trusts are not subject to legislative control. Most Trusts formed by attorneys are statutory, not Common Law Trusts. - 327 -"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook > TRUST— a three-party contract in which the Settlor (Creator, Trustor or Grantor) transfers property (real, personal or both) to one or more Trustees to be held and/or managed for one or more Beneficiaries. The Settlor (i.e., Grantor, Creator, Trustor) grants into the Trust real and personal, tangible and intangible property which is owned by the Trustees. The Settlor has utilized the authority of sovereignty, which is protected by the constitutional rights of an individual. A Settlor may convert him/herself into a Trustee, although this may trigger the Grantor Rule causing the Trust to be a “Grantor Trust” which offers little or no protection. 34 The Trust is a legal fiction which requires one or two real, live Trustees to accept the granted items and to follow the instructions established by the Trust contract. Trustees must operate in agreement and do not have the power to act independently. They hold their authority in joint tenancy, the property is owned in Trust in Fee Simple Absolute on behalf of the Beneficiaries. They manage, hold title and increase the Trust in value through administration, buying and selling and sound investments. Their powers are broad, yet confined to furthering the financial well being of the Trust. The initial granting to the Trustees is for $21.00 in gold or silver, lawful consideration. Once the properties are conveyed, no one can rescind or challenge the conveyances. The Trustees have both absolute and equitable ownership, and all evidence of ownership must reside in the Trustee. There can never be a claim against these properties in the event of a claim against the Settlor. The Trustees must defend against claims against the Trust. They are to keep minutes and document the proceedings, and make periodic business reports. If a Trustee resigns or is removed from office, a Resolution should be written concer- ning the vacated seat, and the appointment of a successor. During the lifetime of the Trust the Beneficiaries have no voice, control or vote in the Trust, nor any control whatsoever over the Trustees. The Trustees may at their discretion, or by virtue of the Trust contract make periodic distributions from the proceeds and income of the Trust proportionately to the shares of Beneficial interest each holds. Simple Trusts are required to pass all income to the Beneficiaries every year who, if a U.S. person (NOT a sovereign “state” Citizen or foreign entity), must declare as taxable, income on their own personal returns (IRC §651). Complex Trusts are not subject to the corporate tax on dividends, and can treat the income as a deduction. A U.S. Beneficiary who receives income as a K1 distribution rather than as W-2 wages will realize a tax savings on self- employment tax. Simple Or Complex Trusts Initially, 100 Trust Certificate Units (TCU’s) are issued to the Settlor in fair trade exchange for the properties which he conveyed into the Trust. To establish further Beneficiaries, the Settlor must first cancel his units or surrender them to the Trust. Units of Beneficial Interest (UBI’s) or Certificates are non-assessable, nontaxable, non-negotiable, and transferable only to the Trust upon death. Trust contracts are executed for 25 years, or until the corpus of the Trust is liquidated, or transferred to another Trust by unanimous decree of the Trustees. Trust records are not available to the public. Anyone lending or paying money to the Trustees does not have the privilege of seeing the records, nor seeing the application for the funds. Trusts are fundamentally distinct from a Corporation which is chartered and regulated by the State. The State owns the corporation and you are franchising it from them. Unlike a Trust, the State may come in and order the corporate records produced. Trustees must pay themselves something. It is not necessary for the Trustees to go to court for permission to do anything within the Trust. They are acting solely under the auspices of the constitutional rights they possess. The liability of the Trustees is limited to the assets or property of the Trust. Settlement of any debt, tort, damage, judgment, or decree for any indebtedness is payable only from the corpus of the Trust. Trustees are not personally liable in any way. Trustees cannot be forced to make disbursements because of the demands of any creditor against a Beneficiary. Claims against the Trust are not enforceable. No one can become a Certificate holder by bequest, gift or seizure of an estate for indebtedness including any form of bankruptcy, sheriff’s sale, or IRS action. Divesting Corporations Into Trusts All sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self- employed individuals, and corporations could be candidates for a Business Trust. People operating through corporations could divest themselves of their real estate by selling the property to a Business Trust in exchange for Beneficial Units, and then leasing the property back from the Trust. The corporation could also divest itself of all business equipment and other assets by placing them into separate Business Trusts. The corporation would continue to operate as usual, but would own few assets passing on profits to the Unit holders. Avoiding Corporate Attributes A Trust must avoid attributes that would cause it to be treated and taxed like a corporation. If a Trust possesses any three of these attributes it will be treated and taxed like a corporation. When corporations learned to create monopolies by having competing firms controlled by the same Trustees, it led to the passage of the anti-trust laws. The four corporate attributes are: 1. centralized management 2. continuity of life 3. limited personal liability of the Trustees 4. easy transferability of Beneficial Interest in the Trust. - 328 -"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Foreign Trusts Explained Do Not Restructure to Avoid Creditors or Court Judgments If you are presently being sued, then granting your property or assets into a Trust or foreign entity to avoid your creditors or a judgment against you requires three conditions: 1) the Declaration of Trust occurred prior to the date of formal court judgment 2) the conveyance is not for the express purpose of avoiding liability 3) that the judgment is of a civil not criminal nature. Be certain that the Trust is being managed professionally, and that accurate records are being kept. Exchanging, Acquiring or Gifting Property Editor’s Note: It is always advisable when conveying, trans - ferring, exchanging, gifting or selling property, that you consult with professionals with a track record of accom - plishing these transactions lawfully and legally. You don’t want to be stuck defending an accusation of “fraudulent con - veyance.” There are lots of traps and sticky distinctions. An entire estate may be reorganized by restructuring it into a Trust or other foreign entities. Restructuring your affairs before a bankruptcy, lien judgment or attack by a creditor is better done sooner not later. Liability insurance can be minimized through the organization of foreign entities. Never tell anyone that you have restructured to protect YOUR assets. They won’t be YOURS anymore. You are divesting yourself of ownership in exchange for freedom, protection and privacy. Your control is executed through the wisdom and intelligence of your restructuring efforts. Don’t rely on anyone to do your thinking for you. Ask intelligent questions and work with people of integrity. Restructuring = Freedom, Protection, Privacy When conveying real estate into a Trust or foreign entity, don’t call the lenders and say that ownership has changed. The loans are NOT to be re-titled. If you fail to do this, the lenders could call the loan due in full and cancel the mortgage. A sale did NOT occur, only a transfer, exchange or gift of equity occurred. If the Trust or foreign entity needs a loan, request it in the name of the entity. If property is conveyed into a Trust in exchange for Benefi- cial Units and sold within two years, a tax is imposed on the Trust equal to the tax that would have been paid had the sale been included in the income of the exchanger (IRC§ 644). If the conveyance is made to a foreign-domiciled Trust or foreign entity, the two year limit DOES NOT apply. You can exchange real property for real property of equal value and not trigger a gain. An exchange of stock for real property is NOT allowed by the IRC. Do not “exchange” do- mestic property (held by a U.S. person) into a foreign entity. This will activate the top tax rate on that U.S. person. When real or personal property is conveyed by a U.S. person to a non-U.S. person, a 35% excise tax is imposed on the amount of appreciation (IRC §1491). 35 Acquire property by purchasing it via a foreign entity (IBC. S.A. or Trust). The foreign entity capitalizes the purchase of the property. It can be “owned” by a partnership or non-domestic Trust. Build a home on it if you wish. Sell shares of the corporation (if an IBC), instead of subdividing the property. Updating the land patent is yet another issue for the sovereign “state” Citizen. If you gift a $100,000 property to a foreign entity, and there is NO value change (no gain), then there is — NO tax liability. Do not “transfer” property, then show up as an officer of the entity. Be aware of any linkages between you and the foreign entities. You can hold or invest property. There is NO tax until the capital is distributed or liquidated. Types of Trusts > TESTAMENTARY TRUST— a Trust created in a simple “Will” which is most commonly used for families with small estates; doesn’t offer any of the benefits, privacy or protection from liabilities that a Common Law Trust offers. > INTER VIVOS TRUST— a Trust created between the living, otherwise known as the “Living Trust”; the Grantor retains the right to revoke the Trust at any time; “revocable Trust” is a conditional gift; does not offer protection from estate taxes; is used when the separation of management and control of assets and property is desirable. > INDENTURED FAMILY TRUST— this Trust, like the InterVivos Trust, is set up during the Settlor’s lifetime; it’s an “irrevocable Trust”; because the Settlor has no legal interest, these properties aren’t part of the estate; taxes are paid when the property is received by U.S. Beneficiaries. > COMMON LAW TRUST— in the name of a “natural- born” individual, not necessarily terminating at death; John Hancock Life Insurance Co. is an example of a Common Law Trust which is now considered rare in the United States’ these are also “irrevocable Trusts.” > PARLIAMENTARY TRUST— name of a “person” who continues beyond the life of the Settlor, but must terminate at some designated time; common “Statutory Trust” in the United States, most often promoted by attorneys and advo - cates of statutory or parliamentary law; 36 different vari - eties, including the “Living Trust” and the “Massachusetts Trust.” > STATUTORY TRUST — common name for any “Trust” with a SSN, TIN or EIN Number assigned by the IRS; these are subject to the jurisdiction of the federal United States government corporation; 1,336,000 fiduciary tax returns (Form 1041) were filed in 1987. > JOINT STOCK TRUST— a close cousin to the corporation except that it is legally existent forever; this trust was banned to “U.S. citizens and residents” in 1873 by an act of Congress; the Federal Reserve System was set up as a “Joint Stock Trust” which was grandfathered (1870 before 1873); the fundamental difference between a “Joint Stock Trust” and a “Corporation” is that the stock of the “Joint Stock Trust” is exempt from securities regulation while the stock of a “Corporation” is not. - 329 -"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook > JOINT STOCK TRUST / NOT FOR PROFIT— the form of a charitable foundation; they have no securities or right to print currency or issue bank charters as “Joint Stock Trusts” can. > SOVEREIGN TRUST— largely service the immediate needs of royal families; some represent the entire wealth of a nation; have the power and authority to print currency, issue bank charters, debt instruments, corporate charters and securities, land patents, letters of patent and copyright and licensing of chattel, professions, guilds and services; the Queen of England and other monarchs use Sovereign Trusts. > ULTRA-SOVEREIGN CANON LAW TRUST— served as the model and basis for most democratic and parliamen - tary government formed in the New World, including the sovereign states, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution for the united states of America; manifests all the strengths of the “Sovereign Trust”; holds all the powers of portfolio that any “Joint Stock Trust” might hold; the Vat - ican is an example of an “Ultra-Sovereign Canon Law Trust”; parliamentary laws are inferior to the Canon laws and will not provide the same amount of trust protection. 36 “ Failure to uphold the Ultra Sovereign Canon Law trust provisions is ‘treason in the United States’ subject to all the penalties that go with that act.” —Capital Parish of the Oversoul. > LAND TRUST— commonly referred to as an Illinois Land Trust for houses, property, or other real estate, or notes and mortgages secured by real estate. > OFFSHORE TRUST— established in a Common law country (e.g., Belize, Costa Rica, Cayman Islands, Bahamas) that doesn’t have a strict tax treaty with the federal United States; you can achieve privacy, protection and be able to operate financially without an SSN or tax reporting liabilities through various foreign entities; Supreme Court of Belize (January 20, 1995) recently upheld the country’s confidenti- ality laws by revoking a previous court order set in motion by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting confidential bank documents of the Swiss Trade & Commerce Trust. 38 > PURE, BUSINESS TRUST— an estate adapted to business or commercial activities; an Unincorporated Business Organization (UBO); created under the Common law of contracts and do not depend upon any statute or authority other than the Settlor; formed by contract and executed by third parties; your name never appears on the document; adaptable for both personal and business use; all assets can be exchanged into a Trust with a minimum of effort and with no need of an attorney; legal in every State and in countries recognizing the Common law; same sovereign constitutional rights as an individual; brought into being through a Declaration of Trust; Pure Trust is synonymous with a Business Trust; the North American Land Company founded by Patrick Henry in 1765 is the oldest Pure Trust of record and it’s still in operation today; American Express, one of the largest travel/financial concerns in the world is a Business Trust; Fidelity Magel-lan Fund, the largest mutual fund in America was reorga-nized as a Pure Business Trust on October 1, 1984. 39 Allodial Titles and Land Patents We the People have the unalienable right in a free republic of American Nationals and/or sovereign “state” Citizens to acquire, utilize and “own” property. We the People have the unalienable right to have and hold that property free and clear of government liens and encumbrances. These rights have NOT been abridged, although they have come under attack by the government and the principles/creditors controlling it. But We the People must understand not only our rights, but how to acquire, utilize and “own” property as it was intended by our founding fathers and guaranteed in the united states of America. We the People must understand not only the nature of money, but the political, economic and legal systems to be able to claim our rights to acquire and “own” land. You cannot trust the government, the corporations, the media or the educational system to educate you, even to fully disclose and provide honest information about your property rights. One of the major motivators of the first American Revolution was the issue of allodial rights to land, free and clear of the liens and encumbrances of the King of England. The American people desired to acquire, utilize and “own” their own land without interference from any government, including the government of the united states of America. As a result of generations of constructive fraud perpetuated against the American people, and the peoples of the world, we’ve been conned into believing we are “owning” property, when in fact, and by law, we’re only in ”possession” of property utilizing it as a renter or tenant would. So long as we pay our rent (i.e., mortgages), get the licenses, pay the fees, have it insured, regulated, zoned and permitted, we can still remain in “possession.” But as soon as we exercise what we believe is our sovereign right to do as we please with our private property, providing we don’t damage or insure another or their property, we often get slam-dunked by a fine, eviction or foreclosure. We must learn about allodial titles, land patents, deeds and conveyances to reassert our sovereign right to private property. An allodial title was bestowed, by law, upon the land with unalienability forever. No government, agency, bank or other sovereign power could place any lien, attachment or encumbrance on land held in an allodial state. An allodial title is derived from the original, federal land patent. “Land Patents” are still today the highest evidence of title and have never been refuted by any court of competent jurisdiction. 42 All federal “Land Patents” flow from the treaty (e.g. The Oregon Treaty, 9 Stat. 869, 6/15/1846), therefore no state, private banking corporation or other federal agency can effectively challenge the superiority of title to land holders who have “perfected” their land patent. With an updated land patent brought forward in “Your Name” you can hold the rights and title to land as a sovereign, “state” Citizen. Be very clear that this is distinct from the equitable interest, title and deed. 43 - 330 -"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Allodial Titles and Land Patents Property tax attaches to the equitable title and interest in the property and real estate through a hidden federal lien. If the property and real estate is recorded with a deed (i.e., Trust Deed, Warranty Deed, Quit Claim Deed) at the County Recorders office, then it’s trust property executed and managed by the legal owners — the County, State and federal United States government corporation, and it’s principals/creditors. Thus they are the legal owners of the recorded property and real estate, and they can require you (i.e., the tenant) to get building permits, abide by zoning restrictions and other statutory regulations including environmental laws because it’s NOT your property or real estate. Most Americans are simply glorified “tenants” on what they erroneously believe is “their” property and real estate. Wake up America! The original “letters of patent” were from the King of England. There is a record of these “Land Patents” in the state archives and county courthouses. Under English land law all realty (i.e., real estate) was owned by the sovereign, and from the crown all titles (both lawful and equitable) flow. \"All federal land patents flow from treaty rights and hold superior title to land.\" —Constitutional Law Research Trust After the Declaration of Independence (1776), the American Revolution, and the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain (1783), the American people became complete, sovereign freeholders in the land with the same prerogative as the King. The King had no further claim to the land and could not tax or otherwise encumber it. 41 The “Land Patent” is the only evidence of title to land. Land Patents are derived from the treaties and enabling acts of congress under the signature of the president of the United States when each state entered the Union. Land Patents are stare decisis (i.e., res judicata). It is already well settled law and decided. Editor’s Note: See Suma Corp. supra ; Wine Vs. Gastrell, 54 Fed 819; U.S. Appeal 581 For example, railroad land granted and patented in the late 1800’s is still “sovereign” today. Building codes and local zoning ordinances do not apply to railroad property.44 Railroad patents were also issued by a special act of congress (Railroad Grant Acts) granting alternating sections of land in each township. They are still the largest land owner in America. Unappropriated Lands = Lands Not Patented During the times of the Articles of Confederation, the sovereign state republics wouldn’t appropriate any lands to the federal government. They didn’t want to relinguish any of their sovereignty to the new government. Finally, the states relented and unappropriated lands were given to the federal government to distribute to the people on the condition that they would grant full allodial title. A “Land Patent Office” was established to distribute these un- appropriated land by grant to the people. State Has No Authority Over The Land; Right And Title Held By The United States All right and title to the un-appropriated land was held to the disposition of the United States government to be granted (not sold) to the people. This is how land comes to the people. In the enabling acts, each state republic agreed and declared they would give up all right and title to land. The state has no authority over the land. Except for Texas, which never gave up its lands (State Patent Office) or military (i.e., Texas Rangers) to the federal government. It’s still a free and independent sovereign state. The federal United States government became the trustees with a power of attorney over the disbursement of land to the people. “ Land Patents are issued (and theoretically passed) between sovereigns. Deeds are executed by ‘persons’ and private corporations without these sovereign powers.” —Leading Fighter vs. County of Gregory, 230 N.W.2d.114.116(1975) Through various acts of congress, land was made available for granting (not selling), and the American people became the recipients of those land grants. Land Patents are the first conveyance of title ownership to land. One of the earliest laws for granting Land Patents was passed by Congress on April 24, 1820. It was also how the American people qualified to become sovereign “state” Citizens and electors in their respective state republics. Landowners are the only authority in the united states of America with the power to elect public officers of the government at every level, county, state and federal. This whole system of granting land worked well until the western state republics entering the post-Civil War Union surrendered un-appropriated lands to the federal United States government that did not get distributed to the people. Large portions of the west were not distributed to the people, but held as “federal land” or distributed to the states. This was a flagrant violation of the principles upon which America was founded. So who has all the land in America? If the state doesn’t have any authority over land, and the federal United States government corporation can’t own land, then who has the land? We the People still have all the land in America! The land is still ours. It hasn’t gone anywhere. The rights and titles haven’t been bought or sold. They are not for sale. By the law of the land, We the People are still holding the right and titles to every square inch of land in the united states of America. We the People must reclaim what is ours (and let’s return the better half of it back to the native Americans). Land Is Granted, Not Bought And Sold What has been bought and sold is the “real estate,” the equitable interest to property — to the buildings, improvements, equipment that occupies the space above the land, not the land itself. This is evidenced in the land patent itself, even in the deeds and title insurance contracts. Title insurance excludes coverage for the Land Patent. - 331 -"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook They cannot and will not insure you against a claim for the right and title to the land itself. The warranty deed grants (not sells) the land, and sells the property or real estate. The United States government corporation may not own any land, but it does have equitable interest in lots of “real estate.” Real Estate vs. Land You cannot buy land. You cannot sell land. As a sovereign “state” Citizen it’s yours, inherent since the original thirteen colonies formed the united states of America, and each additional state republic entered the Union. Full payment is already made in the Land Patent and all subsequent assignments. The registration and fees in the securing of a Land Patent were paid to the Surveyor General ($1.25 acre or $2.25 acre for a mining claim). This was NOT the purchase of land. The land patent speaks plainly, “...to give and grant (not sell) unto “Your Name” and his heirs and assigns forever.” To grant is to give freely, not to purchase. Right And Title Is Conveyed By Assignment Or Grant All right and title to land is conveyed by assignment, gift or grant directly from a Land Patent. Land Patent rights flow from the treaty and enabling acts via power of attorney to an individual landholder who in turn gives, grants and assigns the land patents to his/her heirs. Freehold (i.e., allodial) land is beholden to no one. Possession is still 9/10th of the law. Caveat emptor — buyer beware. You have seven years to perfect a claim against land. If notice is duly given and no one contests your claim, it’s yours after seven years. That’s the “fistful of dirt” doctrine. Permission to grow your own crops as a tenant is in effect an assignment by the landowner, if you claim it. Hereditament = Inheritance = Heir Apparent > APPURTANANCES — that which belongs to something else, an adjunct or appendage; that which passes as inciden - ta, as a right of way or other easement to land. We’ve been selling property, real estate and equitable interest for generations and abandoning the rights and title to land. Rights and title to land is well established in law. All you need to do in law is to prove that “Your Name” is a heir or assign to the original Land Patent. The original Land Patent Office is now the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) which consisted of government land officers. Records of the original Land Patents are kept there. Perfecting an allodial title requires updating the original land patent and rewriting the legal description for the land in metes and bounds — the measurements of the original Surveyor General. Research the abstracts of title, make a claim, and bring the title forward minus any exclusions (i.e., easements). Update and record your Land Patent in the “Great Book” at the County Recorder’s office. Because bringing forth the true title is pursuant to the Common law, you must be a sovereign “state” Citizen to claim the rights and title to land.This is distinct from any actions relating to the equitable title, and any liens or encumbrances attached thereof. 1. update the original Land Patent with the legal description for your parcel in metes and bounds 2. research the abstract of titles, make a claim as a heir or assign, and bring the title forward minus any exclusions 3. re-record the updated Land Patent at the County Recorder’s office in the “Great Book.” Update The Land Patent As A Heir Or Assign Federal Liens and Property Taxes In the de jure united states of America and under the Common law, the land patent is the highest evidence of title for the sovereign American “state” Citizen, evidence of allodial title and true ownership. But in a bankrupt and de facto federal United States inhabited by U.S. citizens and directed by its creditors under Admiralty law, the Land Patent is collateral hypothecated against the debt which has been fraudulently transferred to the international bankers. There is a hidden federal lien on all property and real estate in the federal United States because of the federal debt to the International Monetary Fund. This federal lien is NOT attached to the land, but to the property and real estate situated above the land. It is assessed and collected through the property tax. Editor’s Note: Eric Madsen asserts the “real estate” of the united states of America was quit claim deeded to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by the last sitting U.S. Supreme Court in 1944 as their last action. The rights and title to land still belongs with We the People. Release The Liens On Equitable Title Discover how much federal debt is attached to your property and real estate by writing the Department of the Interior and requesting an accounting of what portion of the federal debt is attached to your property. To motivate them, tell them you want to pay off the debt in full. Borrow the FRN’s if necessary to discharge the debt in full, OR offer to “pay” the debt in full with gold/silver (they will refuse to accept). Now, you can sue the title insurance company for treble damages for not revealing the hidden federal lien when you purchased the property and real estate in the first place. They failed to perform on their end of the contract. They will likely settle out of court. This lien must be satisfied, paid or released to own equitable title to your property and real estate free and clear, as well as any outstanding bank mortgages. Then notify the County Tax Assessor that the taxes (i.e., liens) have been satisfied in full, so please take us off the tax rolls forever. 1) there’s a federal lien on all property and real estate 2) discover how much debt is attached to your property - 332 -"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Allodial Titles and Land Patents 3) borrow the FRN’s if necessary to discharge the debt in full, OR “pay” the debt in full with gold/silver (they will refuse to accept) 4) sue the title insurance company for treble damages for not revealing the federal lien when you purchased the property and real estate in the first place 5) notify the County Tax Assessor that the property tax has been paid in full - send no more bills. Deed Is A Trust Instrument Deeds and Conveyances The deed is a sales (i.e., trust) instrument. If a deed is recorded at the County Recorder’s office, then the property or real estate is the trust property of the State. The land, property and real estate must be re-conveyed out of the County Recorder’s office with a “Quit Claim Deed” from equity to the Common law. Note that NO rights convey or are warranted with a Quit Claim Deed. A “Warranty Deed” does grant the land, admits valuable consideration, bargain, sells and conveys the appurtenances and warrants the performance of the contract. Note the elements of a “Warranty Deed:” 1) admits valuable consideration a) a thought process b) must have full disclosure c) $21 of real “money” is evidence of consideration grant rights and title a) land is not bought or sold -it’s free b) those who do not update the patent have abandoned the right c) must be brought up in your sovereign name 2) bargain, sold and conveyed a) equity is fairness b) chattel and other appurtenances c) stuff and improvements on the land is bought 3) assignment is responsibility a) must be accepted or admitted 4) warrants performance a) will defend this title ifcontested 5) exclusions a) such as easements, right of ways, assessments, water, minerals. These cannot convey and cannot be warranted. Reconvey Equitable Title To Foreign Entity Economic Sovereignty and Lawful Money Regarding a Land Patent, you must be a sovereign “state” Citizen free of all legal disabilities to hold title to any land in the united states of America. Furthermore, get yourself out of indebtedness and become economically sovereign as quickly as possible. Then individually, you won't need the loan from a bank. As a sovereign “state” Citizen, you will not qualify for any loan from any bank, but foreign entities through which the property or real estate is purchased can. Getting a “loan” is not paying for it either because the bank hasn't loaned you any “money.” You can purchase the property or real estate even with a purported “loan” providing the loan is not in your name (let a foreign entity or trust purchase the property directly and qualify for the loan). Rights and title to land does not convey without the tendering of real “money” or “consideration.” Consideration is a thought process, and the “money” is evidence of it. If you haven’t tendered at least $21 of gold/silver in the “purchase” of the property or real estate, then it hasn’t been bought. Do not place the land in escrow. Do not get title insurance, or use the land as collateral or security against any debt. These are adhesion contracts and remove any true title from the land as a condition of the contract. There are no rights or title conveyed on the improvements or buildings on the land, only equitable title and interest. Remember, if the property and real estate is recorded at the County Recorder, then it’s a trust property of the State and you simply have the equitable title. A Trust or foreign entity can hold equitable title though, while a sovereign individual makes a claim to the true title. The property and real estate must be re-conveyed to a Trust or foreign entity when purchased with a Bill of Sale, but not re-recorded with the County Recorder. In matters of deeds and conveyances, you must be educated and know exactly what you're doing. Allodial Title, Equitable Title Protection From Foreclosures You protect the land from foreclosure actions by banks, unlawful seizures and forfeitures by the government, and prevent foreclosure by the international bankers when the federal, United States government is officially declared. > ALLODIAL— owned freely; not subject to the restriction on alienation that existed in feudal law; land held absolutely in one’s own right, and not of any lord or superior; land not subject to feudal duties or burdens 45 > MORTGAGE—means on death terms. “A ‘mortgage’ is a commercial lien and doesn’t convey an estate or title...A bank has to prove it has title to the land in order to take it over...A title company insures absolutely nothing except the land.” Allodial titles only apply to the land, not the improvements upon the land which can still be attached by a commercial lien, although your creditors cannot walk across the land to seize the improvements without a trespass on the land. Today, most American people do not “own” their land, not even after they’ve paid off the “mortgage” and satisfied the bank note. This comes as a surprise, perhaps a shock, to most people. Instead of sovereign, allodial ownership of property as the founding fathers intended, most people have only temporary possession and minimal control over a particular piece of land for so long as they pay the bank note, pay the taxes, submit to building codes and regulations, and the government doesn’t condemn or take the land for public use, with or without compensation. Americans have not yet figured out that they have so little control over what they do on “their” land because they do not own it. The federal United States government main- - 333 -"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Johnny Liberty—Global Sovereign’s Handbook tains the true title in the original land patent which it has pledged as collateral against the un-payable federal debt. If you had the true title, the government couldn’t utilize your land as a security against the unpayable federal debt. Your government and the international bankers via the Federal Reserve Bank has been using your land for it’s own purposes, without your knowledge or consent. Getting a mortgage, and paying a bank note is nothing more than glorified “renting”, a qualified and diminished “ownership,” and a return to a feudal relationship with the land that the serfs and slaves endured for hundreds of years. Qualified ownership means that the ownership of land is shared (with the government), while absolute ownership is not. The underlying reason the American Revolution was fought and won was over the right for the sovereign, state Citizens to own land absolutely, without government encroachment of any kind. The founding fathers abhorred the idea of feudal land and owing allegiance to any foreign, sovereign power. The American people have unwittingly surrendered their allodial titles and sovereign rights as a condition of every bank contract or mortgage involving the purchase of land or property, or the use of land and property as collateral, and bought with debt currency, money substitutes, checks or other negotiable instruments. You can only “discharge” debt with negotiable instruments. Since you never actually pay for it with lawful money, unless it’s with gold or silver, you cannot “own” your land or property either. You are “renting” property with a “rented” debt currency system. All land not held in allodial title has been hypothecated to the Federal Reserve Bank, as collateral against an un- payable federal debt. As legal “persons,” U.S. citizens have no right to “own” land, anymore than corporations or trusts could prior to the 14th Amendment. By defining U.S. citizens as legal persons, a doorway opened for legal “persons” such as corporations and trusts to gain control over land, and take it from the people. U.S. citizens have entered adhesion contracts with the federal United States government under the 14th Amendment whereby their unalienable rights to own land absolutely in an allodial state, have been reduced to a qualified ownership and “color of title” under the Negotiable Instruments law. In the twentieth century, America has returned to the dark ages of feudalism, its former “state” Citizens having been reduced to tenants and renters once again, not the sovereign owners of their land. Having an allodial title will not eliminate any debt or mortgage if any is presently attached to your land or property. The allodial title will prevent the creditor from going after your land to collect on the debt if you cannot make a payment for any reason. After having received proper notice, your creditors have 60 days to challenge your “Declaration of Land Patent.” If they don’t the land reverts to its allodial title. If they do, they must take you to court, and you must demonstrate the superiority of your allodial title. The law is on the side of the sovereign “state” Citizen regarding allodial titles. If for some reason, you cannot pay your mortgage or default on the loan, instead of a bank foreclosure whereby you lose everything, a land trust might be created whereby you and the bank become “partners” in the property until it’s paid. With an allodial title, debts or claims will remain, but the land itself will be forever removed from assets upon which creditors can attach. Allodial land cannot be foreclosed upon or liened. Debts or claims could be made though on the ”improvements,” although no “person” could access your property to seize the improvements without trespassing. Land and improvements are still separate and distinctly assessed and liened. That’s why banks primarily finance improvements not land, because they cannot attach liens or foreclose upon the land if it is ever declared allodial. Are Land Patents Valid? Regarding the validity of allodial titles and Land Patents. It depends on who you ask. If you ask an attorney, they’ll snort and say it has no validity in the courts. If you ask the title insurance company, they’ll hiss and snort and turn red in the face from embarrassment. If you ask a clerk at the Bureau of Land Management, they’ll roll their eyes and say that land patents are worthless. If you ask fellow sovereign “state” Citizens who've successfully kept the State or the banks from foreclosing on their property due to a land patent clouding the equitable title, then you would say it has validity. I assert there are hundreds of people who have successfully staved off government intervention through the use of land patents. How long that will last depends on the judicial and political activism of the American people. Still, there is no better way to cloud an equitable title than to update the land patent in “Your Name.” Land Patents Cloud Equitable Titles There haven’t been any great victories in the courts lately, but then again we haven’t had a justice system for several generations. The issue of Land Patents has already been decided, res judicata. It also depends on the political strength of the Constitution and how diligent the courts are in upholding the law of the land. People want problems solved without taking any responsibility for creating them in the first place through ignorance, neglect and fear. It also depends on the political strength of the sovereign people. Are you willing to stand for your rights and property or NOT? Land Patents were upheld and respected for generations until the American people went to sleep. Suddenly, they’re waking up and realizing they’ve been had by their own government Be prepared to defend your Land Patent in an Equity / Ami - ralty / Maritime court which has no jurisdiction to rule on the Land Patent. These patents are being upheld 50% of the time by local law enforcement and government officials, more of - ten in rural areas than urban areas of the West. - 334 -"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty Allodial Titles and Land Patents Tax Assessor • An alternate method to notice the other parties would be to publish a “Notice of DLP” in a legal publication in your county (once a week for 3 weeks, or for the full 60 days) • Post “NOTICE and DLP” at the 4 corners of your property and leave them posted for 60 days (witnessed) • They have 60 days to challenge your claim to the allodial title, or forever keep their silence. An allodial title is the highest title to property. 46 Rediscovering America Sovereignty has been asleep in the hearts and minds of the American people since the Civil War and has continued until recently. But this sleeping giant is now awakening to the political, economic and legal consequences of having taken such a long nap—that We the People are losing our liberties, our property, and our country. There are many nations and traditional indigenous cultures in the world living nearer to the roots of their sovereignty than Americans today (e.g. Hawai’i, Texas, Quebec, Republic of Georgia). We the People must remember who we really are otherwise Americans will wake up homeless in the land of their forefa - thers as Thomas Jefferson had warned. Sovereignty in America today has been severely compromised. Sovereignty is the primary issue of our time. In the united states of America lives a great sovereign Amer - ican Citizen who established a republican form of govern - ment by the people and for the people, that was a model for constitutional governments around the world. Our republican form of government was based on the sove- reignty of the individual not of Kings, Queens or the Pope. This sovereign American Citizen, now an impaired U.S. citi - zen, has had their rights, property and country taken through the political, economic and legal occupation of a foreign power, in a manner similar to the ways the British occupied the colonies and the early Americans stole the land and destroyed the cultures of the indigenous North Ameri - can people. This is perfect justice as the cycles of history are always re - peating themselves for those too ignorant or nearsighted to see the larger patterns of events. Very few Americans know what sovereignty is and how it re - lates to them. Most Americans presume it has something to do with indigenous North Americans, or the Hawai’ians, not them. Today, more and more people are beginning to grasp this virtually extinct concept of “sovereignty” that is: 1) the foundation for all political, economic and legal sys - tems; 2) the source of authority for all laws and governments; 3) the intersecting point between the political and the spiritual; 4) all wars and conflicts are found around the issue of sovereignty—who is in charge, who is in control, who is at the helm of the power structure. Sovereignty is at the heart and soul of every human being. Every child born in this world is a natural-born sovereign in - dividual with the innate will to freedom. Every child is a nat - ural-born revolutionary who questions authority and chal - lenges convention. Every child is also actively suppressed by the existing authorities and power structures —parents, schools, churches and government. We are programmed by the media and our educational sys - tems to surrender our freedom and sovereign rights for the illusion of security and the comfort of belonging to some es - tablished order. Thus the child learns very early to give up their sovereignty and rights to the purported authorities. Initially dependent upon the mother and the father, then upon a democratic/so - cialist State, a child grows into the adulthood of their fullest sovereign potential in the maturity and wisdom of age by re - claiming what was lost in their childhood. As adults, most of us have forgotten who we are. We the People must cast off the mental chains of our social and educational programming. We are controlled by powers that profit immensely through systematic manipulation. This is the entire nature of advertising. They seek to limit our visions and dreams by harnessing our desires and will for their benefit. Those political, economic and legal power structures must be brought to task and exposed for what they really are — a massive legal fiction of thieves and pirates, organized crime on the high seas plundering the Common law nations of sovereigns. Their only real power comes from the massive ignorance, consent and unconditional surrender of the people world - wide who have chosen to avoid their duties and responsibili - ties as sovereign individuals.

original series of PDF documents made available by Johnny Liberty on his website. After merging them, I used Adobe Acrobat to mass-extract largely unedited text and images. After this, I took to Open Office to recreate an original document again. Using that free office-suite's PDF-export function, a new comprehensive document was created. This document is made in a user-defined pagesize that is limited to the lowest common denominator of the US Letter and european A4 format limitations, making it easy to print on either, for example on Lulu.com. I reiterate Johnny's remark, that the document is placed in the public domain, in whatever form to help the cause. I did all this work of reworking the Global Sovereign’s Handbook because Mr. Liberty and many like him meet with foul play by the powers that still be, every day. There is a profound change going on though, and this seminal work must remain available. It took tremendous time and effort to locate and convert all the components of the book, as almost no traces were to be found on the internet. I have always been strongly independent, and free-thinking, but at some point you realise that you need more than the thoughts alone. You want to get to the root of what’s holding you back. As I have been on a quest for finding more information about liberty for some time now, the time has come to start participating and educate people. Already aware of the work of David Icke, I started to look for anything that would further my understanding. I found some sources on the internet, like works by Murray Rothbard, Ludwig von Mises, Walter Block, Hans-Hermann Hoppe et al. scattered all over the internet, which I eagerly retrieved. At this time, I started to get any work I could get hold of, into Open Office, so I could change the look and feel of the works, and print them myself. I wanted to read all of it, everywhere. Paper still beats a notebook. I discovered the Sovereignty doucments in somewhere in 2004 I believe, and then my quest really took off. Like it was meant to be, I started to find more and more works, websites, keynotes. A pivotal moment came with the discovery of Constitution Class by Michael Badnarik, presidential candidate for President of The United States of America. It opened my eyes to the links between Europe and America (I am a Dutch citizen, or rather, subject). The fact that a good deal of the values originally developed in Europe had migrated to America (and were lost there). The mechanisms became clear through this excellent scolar. I bought his book ‘It’s good to be king’, and started to buy books from stores all over America, like Laisser-Faire books and the Ludwig von Mises institute. But by discovering this profound work of Love and Liberty that the Gobal Sovereigns' Handbook really is, I had found a new basis. It just clicked into place. Here was the treasure trove to get both a deeper understanding of how the process of enslavement had come to be, and how to actually peacefully work against it, just as Icke would do in his later performances. From there, I moved on to read other works like The Creature from Jeckyll Island by G. Edward Griffin about the creation of the Federal Reserve. Works by Rothbard (whom I had seen as only a economic writer at that point), also about the gold standard and the IRS. Already convinced of the blessings of very limited government, I had now moved on from considering myself a minarchist to a full fledged libertarian. After reading more and more works by these scholars, and having listened to hours and hours of americanradioshow.us by Dave Champion, I started to understand the link between what Rothbard used to call The Old Right (european: classical liberalism), the Enlightenment and the various religious groups. The religious right may have been on the oppressive side during the sixties, working against the modernisations of that era, but they have gradually come to be more aligned with the libertarians and their moral views, just as they have become more conservative. The oppressive nature of the marxists or corporatists or whatever they may guise themselves as today, has made some few strange bedfellows! Seeing youtube and other videocast sites on the internet grow as an outlet that's not easily stopped, I regain some trust for a more free future. Films like Loose Change 2 nd edition, Aaron Russo's America-Freedom To Fascism or Alex Jones' Terrorstorm and all the information about 9/11 that is getting through to more people every day, will counterbalance a lot of indoctrination, and possibly awaken people. The final push came when I dicovered the strong, moral motivation and out-of-the-box thinking as presented by one of the finest proponents of anarcho-capitalism I had yet found. Sure, I had read Anthony de Jasay on game theory about politics ('Against politics'), or George Reismann's work ('Capitalism'). Most libertarians or minarchists will try to convince by reason alone. Most find some role for the state or obscure their utter disapproval in the acceptable academia-treatises no newspaper editor will ever read or comprehend. Few, however, reason with morality strongly aligned with their arguments. ...Until I found freedomainradio.com by Stefan Molyneux. Entirely abrogating the very concept of state, he did what the founding fathers were not able to do: conceptualize liberty in terms of property and freedom itself without any superior organisation. Different in style and substance, I can say that my quest for liberty became finally solidly founded by Msrrs. Liberty, Rothbard and Molyneux. F. Naaijkens (2004, 2007).

A departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for a second, that second for a third, and so on till the bulk of the society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering... And the fore-horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression.” —Thomas Jefferson - 345 -"}]
