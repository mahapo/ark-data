It became clear , however, that there were some who had managed to stay clear of the influence of all these lies and understood that something was wrong in contemporary society. These people found answers to their questions in \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\". They had already surmised that a malicious power was behind the process of destruction, which affe cts us all, but they needed more facts. People in different countries ha ve read \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\" and have become curiou s about the background of inter- national freemasonry. But they knew too little about the frightening history and essence of this secret society. This showed the need for a comprehensive book about the dark history, ideology and activities of freemasonry, which would act as a complement to \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\". Thus there was a demand, which led to that this new book about free masonry was written. During many years, I have gath ered large amounts of important facts, documents and ra re source material, wh ich have never been published in ordinary (that is, officially sanctioned) history books. With the help of these facts, a co mpletely different picture of major world events emerges. Without de tails about the true history of freemasonry, it is very difficult to orientate oneself in today's world. For this reason, I chose to collect all the \"forgotte n\" and concealed "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"information and thereby re-create th e true history that our masonic leaders have st olen from us. Our civilization has failed in many crucial areas. These failures have been aggravated by the fact that those who have understood the reason for our troubl es refuse to speak out. Others have failed to realize the obvious - that hidden economic forces have acted behind the carefully painted scenes and, virtually unopposed, manipulated us towards our present desperate situation. We have been frightened and weakened, and for this reason the enemie s of humanity have succeeded with their treacherous conspiracy. The hidden forces were unable to act freely without first removing important facts from our history. By referring to this concealed information, it has been possible to clearly identify the masonic forces, which have done everything in their po wer to transform our world into Hell on Earth. We have been damaged mentally, physically and genetically. We have begun to prefer darkness to li ght. Most of us have chosen to believe in the illusory myths of the freemasons and assisted in the fight against those who have attempte d to reveal the true facts. Far too many of us choose to defend these dark forces. The evil forces are close to victory. Th ose who defend these for ces must also share the responsibility for their crimes against humanity. Many of us have become victims of the freem asons and our personal greed. This book attempts to gi ve an overall picture of the circumstances that have led to the distressing setbacks, which have afflicted us, especially during the last 300 years. In order to orientate ourselves, we must finally dare to call those events and these persons by their r eal names, despite the fact that those responsible have b ecome stronger than ever and officially deny their involvement in all these seri ous and unforgivable crimes against humanity. The freemasons' internal sources, however, do not deny these crimes. I will present such concealed facts to make it possible to draw some amazing conclusions and to reveal to ever y seeker of truth who 10"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"our tormentors really are. Not bein g aware of these facts is in itself an evil, because ignorance serves evil. It is for this reason that our rulers want us to believe that a lack of historical knowledge and ignorance about the secrets of nature constitutes true knowledge. Those who do not examine the different aspects of the conspiracy will remain incapable of understanding the world. To them every- thing appears dim and mysterious. Even the ancient Romans said: \"Magna est veritas et praevalebit.\" (\"The truth is great and it will triumph.\") The freemasons have always been enamoured with large social structures and superstates. They have called the violent social upheavals, which were actually br ought about by their grand lodges under the leadership of masonic grand masters, \"great popular revo- lutions\". The Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung stated: \"The larger the organizations, the more inevitable are their immorality and blind stupidity.\" (Carl G. Jung, \"Die Beziehungen zwischen dem Ich und dem Unbewussten\", Darmst adt, 1928) We also have clues about what will happen within the European Union - the freemasons' latest creation. Jung stated in the same boo k: \"The larger a society or confederacy, the greater the amalgamation of collective factors - which is typical of every large organizati on - will rest upon conservative prejudices to the detriment of the i ndividual, the more aggravated the moral and spiritual degeneration of the individual.\" Apparently different ideologies have been forced upon us. In actual fact, we have all the time b een dealing with different aspects of one and the same ideology - illuminism, propagated by inter- national freemasonry. Only insecur e individuals and weak ideologies and religions need to resort to vi olence in order to assert themselves - Judaism, Islam, communism, national socialism, and others. The hylozoists, who follow the teachings of Pythagoras, have never resorted to violence, nor have the Buddhists. This fact alone shows the value of their philosophical teac hings, which can help those souls who seek the truth. For this re ason, the freemasons despise the teachings that represent goodness and spiritual development. 11"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The socialists (the fr eemasons' most effectiv e servants) are parti- cularly prone to using violence in th eir attempts to murder the soul. They consider it more effective and beneficial to murder the soul rather than the body. The comm unists got nowhere by destroying people's bodies. Under the symbol of the Illuminati and freemasonry - the red rose - the socialists are after our souls. The French author Romain Rolland stated: \"The murder ers of the soul are the worst.\" The socialists are well aware that their falsification of history leads to a society without history. The Russian-Jewish socialist Alexander Herzen stated in the 1850s: \"There is nothing more repugnant than a falsification of history on the orders of those in power.\" Marx put his finger on the most important method of the Illuminati: \"If you can cut people off from their history, they can be easily persuaded.\" While we may ascertain that our leaders conceal facts with the assistance of corrupt \"historians\", we must realize that this falsifi- cation of history is part of the conspiracy, since those who control our history also control our futu re, according to the British author George Orwell. And those who cont rol our present also control our past. All these \"isms\" are just useful tools for the dark masonic forces that often use various shady ideolo gies to fill the gaps in their attempted construction of \"a better world for us all\". This is why the freemasons wish to destroy everyt hing connected wi th \"the old\", that is traditions and common sense. I have visited many powerful lodges all over the world in order to become acquainted with the freem asons' own material and works. Original sources are the most reliable. It is my opinion that the freemasons, with their unnatural organi- zation, stand on the brink of a va st catastrophe. This book shows how and above all why. Juri Lina Stockholm, October 2004 12"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CONSENSUS TRANCE Malta yok is Turkish, a well-known expression among historians, and means \"Malta does not exist\". In 1565, the Turkish armada disco- vered enemy ships near Malta. The admirals became so shocked by this that they sent the following message to the Sultan in Istanbul: \"Malta yok.\" Today independent-minded historians use this expression when they come across previously inaccessi ble facts or sens itive historical data, which those in pow er deny or conceal. Th ere are so many lies mixed with the truth th at people get confused. But there is an alternative to the official truth, since things are often not what they seem to be. In our world, which is controlled by freemason ry, one rule surely applies: if something has happened but is not reported by the mass media, then it has si mply not occurred. But if something has not even taken place and yet is report ed in the media, then it has nonetheless happened. We must lear n to question the official truth! Professor Daniel Boorstin, Librar ian of Congress from 1975 to 1987, once stated: \"Americans live in a world of pseudofacts, which is created for them by their own media.\" People want to see wh at does not exist and wi sh to ignore reality. Life is therefore a matte r of deception and self-deception. It is diffi- cult to make any progress in this maze of myths. And we certainly live in a labyrinth of lies. It is di fficult for many pe ople to orientate themselves since they have not de veloped their powers of discrimi- nation, that is the ability to distinguish good from evil. This is the reason why the freemasons have been so effective in deluding us with their so-called social ideo logies. These lies are dutifully amplified by the megaphones of the mass media, whic h also attempt 13."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"to silence, with-hold, or as a last resort mock all information and ideas that do not comply with their propaganda - whether it con- cerns the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, the sub- marine incursions into Swedish terr itorial waters by the Soviet Union, the \"Estonia\" disaster (we now know by means of me tallurgic ana- lysis that this ferry was sunk th rough explosion), the writing of modern history or the freemasons' activities. Charles T. Tart, professor of psycho logy at University of California, called this ideological blunting of our intellect 'consensus trance' (\"Waking Up: Overcoming the Obstacles to Human Pote ntial\", Boston, 1987). Consensus means general agreement or understanding. Con- sensus trance thus implies the fact that we have accepted false conception of reality, not through logical processing of facts but through intensive manipulation (brainwashing) by the global elite. Too many of us have been aff ected by consensus trance, which thus is a common belief in these myths. The method s of suggestion that the freemasons and others mani pulators have used in order to make us believe in their lies without second thought, have success- fully turned most of us into vict ims of this audacious manipulation. For this reason, we instinctively sh y away from uncomfortable facts, which threaten to demolish the false view of the world the free- masons have created and thereby aw aken us from the trance. Many of us have been affect ed by mental paralysis. But belief is a desire not to know, as the freemason and philo- sopher Friedrich Nietzsch e stated. This is why it is important to expose the most danger ous propaganda myths. The mental anaesthe- tization of the Western World has been a great success. Most people have become victims of the type of blind faith called \"political correctness\" and pref er to live in th eir illusory world. The authorities have invented or exploited certain myths, which serve their pur poses and work against us. These fantasies apply to history, health, culture, politics and other important subjects. One must have both faith and trust in oneself to find the strength to face the reality that is pr esented in this book. 14"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Waking up from the trance is a difficult and laborious process. Certain key facts are necessary in order to achieve this, facts which the reader, despite all the lies, can recognize and has a possibility to verify. Here is a classic exam ple from Darwin's journals. The Patagonians (a tribal people in South Argentin a) could not see Darwin's ship, \"The Beagle\", conceptually or even optically, since no large ships had hitherto been a part of their experience. Only the shaman of the tribe could see the ship. When the shaman began to describe the ship with the aid of objects known to the Patagonians, the ship became visible to all. They had a consen sus reality, which applied to small boats, but lacked a similar conception of large ships. Many journalists lack the critical judgement to crush the consensus reality applying to the real course of events during the M/V \"Estonia\" disaster - they have not even managed to understand that the Joint Accident Investigation Commission is obviously lying about key issues. Many of us lack critic al judgement concerning our social, political and practical environment, since we blindly trust the myths that masonic sources feed us with through the mass media every day. Most of us who prefer blindly to trust different political, social and scientific fabrications and deny any suggestion about hidden control behind the scenes, do not want to see that the most important political, economic and soci al events in the worl d are not haphazard, but planned by non-democratic gr oups who hide behind the name \"freemasons\". The inferior and de grading conditions , which we see everywhere in different countries, did not just happe n to turn out that way. If we accept this expl anation, we immediately begin to understand everything that is happen ing and all the pieces of the jigsaw fall into place. Otherwise we will grope in darkness and understand nothing. The masonic mythomaniacs are enemies of the spiritual freedom of mankind. Several powerful and ruthle ss masonic lodges consisting of self-appointed elites dur ing the last two centuries have been steering our society towards certain ruin. If we refuse to see this reality, it 15"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"means that we accept living in a world without sense, an absurd world, which without any sensible reason has been transformed into a surreal, Kafkaesque lunatic asylum. These powerful lodges are, among other things, working towards creating a superstate in Europe - the European Union - and a world government under their power by means of psychological warfare against us, the non-masons. These groups undermine the most important dimension in our lives - the spiritual dimension. They have caused the greatest spiritual crisis through the ages. The society the freemasons have formed has lost sight of the true purpose of life. Many people can no longer understand spiritual values. They do not even know what the word 'spiritual' means. The freemasons are ever more intensive in their propagation of unnatural ideas such as globalism (n ew internationalism) or mondia- lism, ostensibly for the reason of promoting the spiritual develop- ment of humanity and to build a New World Order. This is an unparalleled deception. In fact, th e freemasons intend to build a New Temple of Solomon for us. Why should we live in a world, which allegorically could be regarded as an Israelite temple, where certain people are chosen to rule and others are their slaves who will be sacrificed like animals? The temple that Solomon had built was a slaughterhouse, where many animals were sacrificed dail y to appease the hunger of Yahweh. The priests were actually butch ers who became rich through their gruesome work. According to the Russian professor Lev Gumilev, Yahweh is a terrible fire-demon (L ev Gumilev, \"The Ethnosphere\", Moscow, 1993, p. 480). In the Soviet Union, masonic terms typical of the communist movement were used constantly. They wanted to \"build a new society\" and a \"better and brighter future\" or they wanted to rebuild the old (perestroika). Professor of Literature Jiro Imai at the University of Tokyo in the 1920s wrote in his book \"On the World-Wide Secret Society\" that \"freemasonry is the most dangerous and subversive secret society\". 16"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Swedish Association Save the Individual (FRI), which combats sects and \"saves\" people from author itarian organizations, has listed the criteria that define a destructive movement: • False declaration of intention and misleading description when recruiting members. • Manipulation by psychological methods (mind control) is used during recruitment and indoctrination. • An all-powerful leader who dema nds total subjection and claims to have special knowledge and powers. • The ideology must not be questioned, doubt is something evil, which must be fought. • The image of reality is black and white: the members are the chosen (good), everything outside of the movement is evil and must be opposed. • There is a lot of money involved, which sometimes emanates from crime. International freemasonry complies with all these criteria of a destructive sect, but FRI refuses to criticise freemasonry and instead slanders those who expose politica l freemasonry. On 15 April 2000, the association in Stockholm invited Hakan Blomqvist from Norr- koping to give a public lecture. Blomqvist, who is a professional liar, \"humanist\" and \"Nazi-hunter\", re fused several times during his lecture to answer the question whether freemasonry was a destruc- tive sect or not. The reader might be able to guess whose interests this man serves. The most dangerous sect of th em all - freemasonry - has not detached itself from society, but intervenes in its development in a very negative way. Presumably the freemasons have succeeded in their indoctrination of society, since they are no longer regarded as a serious threat. The masons are in control of the mass media. \"If one controls radio, press, scho ol, church, art, science, film - one can transform each truth into a lie, each unreason into reason.\" (Alf Ahlberg, \"Idealen and deras skuggbilder\" / 'The Ideals and Their 17"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Shadows\", Stockholm, 1936, p. 135) Th e masses have always believed in those gods that propagate themselves most dramatically. \"The power to control the news flow is the same thing as the power to control how people think. We boast about free press in the United States. But how free is it really when we receive the same news from all the big media conglomerates and when alternative opinions never reach the majority of Americans? The power to report and describe reality is now in the hands of a few. And the interest of these few powerful people is in opposition to the interest of the people, the general interest. It makes no difference that these media congl omerates have different names and appearances, since they all share the same values, which is a guarantee that we receive cloned information.\" (The American newspaper The Nation, reported by Aftonbladet, 31 October 1997) The few who control the flow of information belong to inter- national freemasonry. Thes e forces do not care about the interests of the people. Noam Chomsky wrote: \"Propaganda works more effectively if one manages to maintain the illusion that the mass media are non-partial observers. Tough debates within in visible boundaries will actually have the effect of strengthening the system.\" It is not possible to control maso nic lodges or other elite struc- tures. We know that a group, wh ich cannot be controlled, im- mediately begins to manipulate the press and believes that it stands above the law. The free masons use myths as th e base of their power in their war against mankind. Myths as a Base of Power For centuries the whole of Europe believed in witches. Huge books written by learned men, such as the infamous \"M alleus maleficarum \" (\"The Witch Hammer\") by Heinrich Institoris and Jakob Sprenger, published in 1486 and printed in a further 30 editions until 1669, stigmatised the nefarious practices of witches. This was reason 18"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"enough for the Church to consider itself justified in executing thou- sands of innocent women. Would not all of us still believe in witches today, if we had been brought up with horror stories about witches from their earliest childhood and if the mass media reported their heinous crimes day after day? More and more myths have begun to erode recently. They do not stand up to close scrutiny. The children of Israel were never slaves in Egypt. Neither did they roam through the desert of Sinai for forty years nor conquer the land of Canaan by force. This was reveal ed by Zeev Herzog, professor of archaeology at the Univ ersity of Tel Aviv. \"The biblical epoch has never o ccurred. After 70 years of exca- vations, the archaeologists have reac hed a frightening conclusion: it is simply not true,\" Herzog wr ote in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. Most Israeli archaeologists agree on the fact that the biblical Exo- dus from Egypt does not correspond to historical fact s. Experts have also accepted that Joshua did not conquer the town of Jericho in a single battle and that the town walls did not fall at the blast of trumpets. The archaeologist Adam Zertel at the University of Haifa also knows that the wandering in the desert is a myth. According to Herzog, David and Solomon never ruled over a mighty empire, it was just a little tribal kingdom without any power. Jerusa- lem, which was captured by King David, was just a feudal estate. It is generally believed that th e Vandals were uncivilised bar- barians who destroyed everything in their path. This is a deliberate lie. The blond and blue-eyed Vandal s were a Nordic people and were no less civilised than any other people. They originated in North Jutland, in southern Scandinavia. The Catholic Church opposed the religious beliefs of the Vandals, called Aryanism, which denied the divine nature of Jesus Christ and interpreted all events in the light of the theory of reincarnation. Because of this, the Vandals were a threat to the generally accepted myths. 19"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In 534, Byzantium managed to destroy the kingdom of the Vandals with its rich culture and capture th eir capital city, Carthage. The con- querors killed the aged and children ; the men were forced to become soldiers and the women were married to men from other races. After just one generation, the Vandals and their religion had been erased from the face of the Earth. And history is written by the victors! Not long ago, the Swiss believed that the storming of the Habsburg castles occurred after the taking of oaths in Riitli in 1291. Exca- vations have shown that the cas tles were abandoned without a struggle long before, respectively long after 1291. The storming of the castles never happened (Werner Meyer, \"1291 - Die Geschichte \"). The British astrophysicist Sir Fred Hoyle reached the conclusion that the universe is governed by a greater intelligence. In 1978, Hoyle described the conspirator Charles Darwin's theory of evolution as wrong and claimed that the belief that the first living cell was created in the \"sea of life\" was ju st as erroneous. In his book \"Evo- lution from Space\" (1982), he distanced himself completely from Dar- winism. He stated that \"natural selection\" could not explain evo- lution. Hoyle asked in his book \"The Intelligent Universe\" (1983): \"Life as we know it is, among other things, dependent on at least 2000 different enzymes. How could the blind forces of the primal sea manage to put together the correct chemical elements to build enzymes?\" According to his calculations, th e likelihood of this happening is only one in 10 to the 40 000 power (1 followed by 40 000 zeros). That is about the same chance as throwing 50 000 sixes in a row with a die. Or as Hoyle describes it: \"The chance that higher l i f e forms might have emerged in this way is compar able with the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein... I am at a loss to understand biologists' widespread compulsion to deny what seems to me to be obvious.\" (\"Hoyle on Evolution\", Nature, Vol. 294, 12 November 1981, p. 105) The odds are only for enzymes if all other relevant molecules for life are also taken account of in our calculation, the situation for 20"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"conventional biology becomes intrin sically insuperable. The unique qualities of man (conscience, morals and religion) do not correspond at all to the evolutionary thesis of \"the survival of the fittest\". A martyr chooses death rather than forsaking his beliefs. Hoyle stressed that science must on ce again accept that there is a greater intelligence in the univer se. Sir Fred Hoyle believes that Darwin's evolutionary theory is a damaging myth. He stated: \"We must adjust ourselves to this in our scientific research programs.\" The theory of evolution was worked out by the Lunar Society, founded on the initiative of the high-ranking freemason Benjamin Franklin in Birmingham, England in 1765. He later emigrated to America. The members gathered once a month at the full moon. The society was a revolutionary masoni c organization that supported the overthrow of monarchies and undermi ning the belief in God (Ian T. Taylor, \"In the Minds of Men: Da rwin and the New World Order\", Minneapolis, 1984, p. 55). An important member of the Lunar Society was Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802). He became the grandfat her of Charles Robert Darwin and between 1794-96 wrote the book \"Zoo-nomia, or the Laws of Organic Life\", the conclusion of which was the same as that of \"On the Origin of Species\", which his grandson wrote in 1859. In this way, the freemasons managed to spread misinformation about how we only live one life on Ea rth and that we are alone in the universe, which created itself out of nothing. According to huma- nists, all human development ends with physical death. Darwin's \"The Origin of the Species\" is a fraud. The word \"evolution\" first appeared in the sixth edition, pr inted in 1872, the same year the author died. In his book \"In the Minds of Men: Darwin and the New World Order\", the scientist Ian T. Taylor revealed how the Lunar Society and other masonic organizations have led many intellectuals astray with their manipulations and with the aid of \"modern\" science. Both Erasmus Darwin and his friend James Watt in the Lunar Society were freemasons. The older Darwin was initiated into St. 21"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"David's Lodge No. 36 in Edinburgh in 1754. He later also became a member of Canongate Kilwinning Lodge No. 2 (Freemasonry Today, autumn 1999). Scientists now admit that the Neanderthals were not our forebears, since the DNA analysis of the mitochondria shows that they belonged to another species altogether. Svante Paabo, professor of biology at Munich University, proved that they were not our ancestors (Natur & Vetenskap, No. 9, 1997, p. 11). Charles Darwin later developed an ideology, called humanism, which international freemasonry began to utilise as a weapon against people with spiritual beliefs. Charles Darwin was just an errand boy for the masonic elite. With the help of \"humanistic\" organizations, the freemasons have spread athe ism and other false doctrines. The British quantum physicist Paul Davies, however, postulates in his interesting book \"God and the New Physics\" (1983) that \"a ruling universal consciousness utilises the la ws of nature for a determined purpose\". In his opinion, quantum physics is the surest way to find God today. Paul Davies writes in an article: \"The very fact that the universe is in the process of creatio n and that its laws have allowed complex structures to come into ex istence and develop into conscious life, is for me a strong testimony that something is happening behind the scenes. I find it impossible to deny the impression that everything is planned...\" (Svenska Dagbladet, 3 March 1989, p. 14) Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis was just a huge bluff. This was revealed by, among others, Daniel Stern, an American pro- fessor of psychiatry in Geneva. Freud's so-called regressive model is not true, Stern claims. If it were true, it would be possible to use it to predict people's problems or to show a connection between early disturbances and problems later in life. But this has not been successful (Svenska Dagbladet, 1 June 1990). Freud belonged to the Jewish m asonic organization B'nai B'rith (Peter Gay, \"Freud\", Stockholm, 1990, p. 158). During the period when Freud was working on his theory of psychoanalysis (1880- 1890), he used cocaine daily. Cocaine is a powerful sexual stimulant. 22"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"He praised the drug and handed it out to friends and acquaintances. He even wrote \"songs of praise\" in its honour. Freud introduced cocaine to the Western world. Information about effective political alternatives is concealed from us. The official history is that life was more difficult in the past. But well-functioning political systems have existed, which have not been advertised. Pharaoh Amenophis IV, who rule d between 1353 and 1335 B.C., was a wise and kind-hearted ruler who seriously tried to reform Egyptian society. He abolished blood sacrifices and converted to the cult of the Sun by only worshipping one god - Aton. He took the name Akhenaton (He who is useful to Aton). He enjoyed philosophy and detested war. He passed a law in which he declared that religion stood for goodness and love. He stressed: \"The name of our god is Aton, who is the Sun, the great giver of life. Let all people be equal in life as in death.\" He moved the capital from Thebes to Tell-Amarna, 300 km to the north, and renamed it Akhet-Aton, confiscated the property of the priesthood, which had led them to detest the people and to create a state within the state. He divided up the land of the priests among farmers and slaves. He made it illeg al to become rich without wor- king. He took all the gold from the temples and gave it to the poor. He regarded poverty as a sign of inefficiency. He released all slaves and person ally lived in a modest and frugal way. He made it illegal to slaughter animals by means that led to unnecessary suffering. The pharaoh st opped all wars and released a large part of the army. Syria, which had become infamous for bringing prostitution and other sins into Egypt, was the first colony to receive independence. Akhenaton was the victim of a conspiracy. His own doctor poi- soned him. His last words were: \"The eterna l kingdom has no place on Earth. Everything returns to its original form. Fear, hatred and injustice rule the world again and the people will slave and suffer again as they did 23"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"in past times. It would have b een better if I had never been born than that I should live to see evil triumph over good.\" Tutankhamun, who took over the throne, returned everything to the old ways (Otto Neubert, \"Tutankhamun and the Valley of the Kings\", Manchester, 1954 , p. 151-174). Akhenaton's name was erased from all inscriptions and his royal city was levelled to the ground. A system based on spirituality can be very successful. This was proved by the Greek mathematicia n and philosopher Pythagoras (580 - 500 B. C), who was from the island of Samos. After his explorative expeditions, he founded the society of Kroton (now Crotone), and the esoteric hylozoist Brotherhood (the association of Pythagoreans) and school in Syracuse on Sicily. He implemented a just law. The Pythagoreans were the spiritual ar istocracy. Besides philosophy and geometry, they seek a numerical b asis for the universe. Pythagoras developed an esoteric school of thought, which still exists today. Pythagoras astonished everyone with his great knowledge of magic. His influence on the development of southern Italy during more than 30 years was extensive. The Pythagoreans reformed society by ethical means. Their government was called the 'aristo- cracy' (the rule of the best or the most knowledgeable). A city-state polis was founded at Kroton, which was ruled by 300 aristocrats who were celibate to avoid nepotism. The economy flourished and the cultural life was rich. There w as freedom of speech. The central principle was honesty. The women in this system were equal to the men and were permitted to reach high positions in society, as Dio- genes Laertios has related. In Russia, criminal masonic groups seized power in 1917 and foun- ded the opposite of aristocracy - a c acistocracy, the rule of the worst and most ignorant. Pythagoras' most famous disciple, Plato, developed his theory of the ideal republic from experiences in Crotona. It has been claimed that this theory was the prototype for communism. This is a typical case of misinformation. It was quite the opposite! Plato called for the rule of the philosophers (the wise), not a tyranny of the ignorant. 24"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A rich, jealous and amoral potent ate called Kylon organized a plot against the freethinking aristocrat s in Crotona, which led to the execution of many leading philosophers. Pythagoras was forced to flee. Despite this, the influence of the Pythagoreans became even greater after these events. Later, a more extensive revolt was brought about when many political leaders were killed and ma ny of the schools of the Brother- hood were destroyed (including those in Crotona and Syracuse). The Brotherhood moved from southern Italy to Athens. Information about this golden period of enlightenment has been ignored in modern history. It was Pythagoras, who began to use the term 'philosophy', and called himself a philosopher, or friend of wisdom. Pythagoras also developed an esoteric system called hylozoism. He claimed that all matter possesses consciousness or a so ul. All the worlds are spiritual entities. Even the planets are living beings. The universe is also conscious. Hylozoism in Greek mean s 'the doctrine of living matter' ('hyle' means matter and 'zoe' life). The spiritual principle seeks to attain more knowledge and less faith. For this reason the Buddhists be lieve that the greatest sin is ignorance, because it leads to crime. No great leaps occur during norma l evolution. Revolutions are damaging, especially those brought a bout to arrest development. This is a serious crime against nature. The greatest damage has been caused by all sorts of myths about communism and its executioners. The former Swedish Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting wrote in Folkets Dagblad: \"Lenin's great deed will always remain as one of the most meaningful in these troubled times, meaningful in its straightforwardness and its reckless love for the social revolution.\" (Hjalmar Branting, \"T al och skrifter\", Stockholm, 1930, XI, p. 231) For many years, we were fed with the Soviet myth about Katyn. The Germans supposedly murdered several thousand Polish officers in the Katyn forest. This lie has now been exposed. 25"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Many treacherous myths are spread in many areas - about the safety of vaccination, that we are biologically identical, that the arti- ficial sweetener aspartame is not dangerous, that vitamin C is dama- ging. Gagarin Was Never in Space A Soviet propaganda hoax has been revealed in the former com- munist countries (for example Hungar y, Estonia and Poland). It was a myth that everyone had really belie ved in, that the Soviet Air Force officer Yuri Gagarin had made a space-flight. Many Western govern- ments were aware of this Soviet bl uff but did not want to reveal the truth. It was not intended for the people to know that the Soviet Union was a backward state. One interesting books about this is \"Gagarin: A Cosmic Lie\" (\"Gagarin - kozmikus hazugsag\", Budapest, 1990) by the Hungarian journalist Istvan Nemere. Not one wo rd about the contradictions sur- rounding Gagarin's \"jou rney into space\" have been published in Sweden, where the Soviet Union is still regarded with a great deal of respect. Such a revelation w ould be far too embarrassing. Until 1961, the United States had managed to send up 42 satel- lites, the Soviet Union only 12. Th e United States al so informed the world that Alan Shepard would make a space journey in the space- craft Freedom 7 on 5 May 1961. The Soviet Union was forced to do something to save face. For this reason a Soviet cosmonaut, Vladimir Ilyushin, was sent up into space on 7 April 1961. The Americans intercepted several radio communi- cations between him and the space centre in the Soviet Union. Ilyu- shin's landing failed and he was se riously injured. He could not be shown to the public. It was claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He was sent to China to receive better medical treatment. The Russian TV documentary \"Cosmonaut Cover-Up\" (2001) also claims that on 7 April 1961, Vladimir Ilyushin left for space, got into 26"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"trouble during the first orbit, and crash-landed in China during the third orbit. Ilyushin was badly injure d. He was returned to the Soviet Union a year later. Ilyushin was kill ed in an engineered car accident in 1961. The Soviet Union did not have a spare capsule at that time and in Moscow it was decided to orchestrate a huge bluff, a cosmic lie. Radio Moscow claimed that a Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, had been sent up into space on the morning of 12 April 1961 with the space-rocket Vostok. According to the official announcement, he had already landed and was in fine hea lth. The whole world believed this except for the Western intelligence services. They had not managed to register any radio communication between Gagarin and the space centre. This hoax was sloppily orchestrated. Polish newspapers announced already on the morning of 12 April th at a Soviet cosmonaut had been in space. Newspapers in other countries did not report Gagarin's flight until 13 April. In a book written for the West, Sovi et propagandist s claimed that simple peasants recognized Yuri Gagarin soon after he landed in a field and enthusiastically shouted : \"Gagarin, Gagarin!\" But nothing about his \"space journey\" had been reported at that time, no pictures of him had been published and his name had not been mentioned. The message from radio and TV wa s sent out 35 minutes after the alleged journey. Were the peasants psychic? The newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya claimed that Gagarin was wea- ring a blue flightsuit when he landed. In his memoirs, Gagarin him- self claimed he was dresse d in an orange flightsuit. At his press conference, Gagarin re ad from notes when he \"related\" his journey. During the press conf erence, he made several crucial mistakes. Gagarin stated that wei ghtlessness was no problem. Every- thing seemed just normal. We now know that this is not the case. The cosmonaut German Titov, for example, had difficulties with his balance and had heart problems. American astronauts experienced similar symptoms. 27"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gagarin then made his most serious mistake, despite the fact that he was constantly assisted by expe rts, who often spoke about disco- veries in space. He said: \"Then I saw South America.\" This is impossible. At that time it was night in South America, which meant that it could not be seen at all. According to the official reports, Gagarin began his \"space journey\" at 9:07 Moscow time. He was supposed to have flown over So uth America at 9:22 Moscow time. In Chile, the time would have been 2:22, in Brazil 3:22. He could never have reached South America in 15 minutes. For other cosmo- nauts it took 45 minutes. Foreign journalists wondered: \"W hen will the photographs that Gagarin took in space be published? \" Gagarin was silent, thought for a moment and answered: \"I didn't have a camera with me!\" Even unmanned Soviet space prob es had photographic equipment onboard. It would have been an important propaganda triumph to publish Gagarin's pictures from sp ace. The Soviet Union would never have missed an opportunity like that . Shepard's pictures were cabled out immediately. Parts of his flight were also shown on TV. At the press conference, it was never explained whether Gagarin landed in his capsule or was ejected. If he had used the catapult seat, he would have become several centimetres shorter. This could easily have been ascertained. All pilots who have catapulted have become somewhat shorter as a result of spinal deformation. When Gagarin wanted to travel in space for real in 1968, he was disposed of, according to Istvin Ne mere. His plane exploded on 27 March the same year. The official re port concerning this event con- tained many contradictions. The report was classified during the communist period. It claimed that there was not much left of Gagarin's body after the crash. In that case, how did his flightsuit come to land in the top of a tree? There are far too many questions surrounding Gagarin's space- flight in April 1961. A British t eam of researchers who questions the propaganda surrounding manned journe ys to the moon also confirms this information. When will th e truth be admitted officially? 28"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"On 12 April 2001, the Russian senior engineer Mikhail Rudenko, at the Experimental Design Office 456, in Khimki in the Moscow region, admitted in Pravda that three cosmonauts had died in space before Gagarin was sent up, namely Alexei Ledovskikh (1957), Serenti Zhaborin (February 1958), and Andrei Mitkov (flight attempt January 1959). The Russian journalist and cosmonaut candidate (June 1965) Yaroslav Golovanov (1932-2003) wrote in his book \"Cosmonaut One\" that on 10 November 1960, another cosmonaut, Byelokonyev, also died onboard a space-ship in orbit. Several sources reveal that 7-11 cosmonauts have died in orbit before Gagarin. The CIA knew about the Gagarin bluff but said nothing. Instead they have come up with more and more ridiculous lies themselves. It is claimed that those astronauts who were freemasons performed magic rituals in space. In the Gr and Lodge of Dallas, there is a painting of American astronauts on the moon performing certain secret masonic rituals. According to official information, the Ameri- can astronaut and freemason Edwin Aldrin left the banner of the Knights Templar on the surface of th e moon. It was also claimed that two gold rings were left on the moon, the purpose of which has not been clarified. Information was later \"leaked\" that the freemasons attempted to contact the demons on the moon with the aid of these gold rings. Kenneth Kleinknecht, a department head at NASA, as well as a high-ranking freemason and a member of the secretariat within the Scottish Rite supposedly issued the orders for these rituals (Michael A. Hoffman II, \"Secrets of Masonic Mind Control\", Dresden, NY, 1989, p. 40). The masonic lead ers have a very strange perception of reality. The documentary by the famous photographer David S. Percy, \"What Happened on the Moon?\" show s that we have every reason to doubt the authenticity of the manned Apollo flights. The film shows in detail how the pictures \"from the moon\" in conjunction with the first flight on 20 July 1969 ( Apollo 11) were falsified. Shadows fall in different directions, which suggests artificial lighting (which has 29"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"been officially denied). In pictur es taken from different places the astronauts were not in darkness even when they were in the shade, the same background was used and the same hill appeared twice during two different land ings. Despite the clea r view, no stars were visible in the sk y, no crater formed under the lunar landing module where the rocket thrusters had braked, no dust had settled on the landing module and its struts, the fl ag waved despite the fact that there is no atmosphere on the moon, the sound of engines (150 decibels) was missing in the NASA f ilm, in which it was possible to hear the astronauts' voices. A \"moon rock\" with a 'G marked on it could be seen (as if it was a ma rked prop). A Coca -Cola bottle was visible on the TV screen (perhaps they sell them on the moon?), the TV signal did not come from th e moon, but from Au stralia, and the Earth was visible from the window s on both sides of the space capsule. It was technically impossible at th at time to perform a lunar lan- ding. (Bill Kaysing, a technician at the company who built the Apollo rockets, claimed that the chance of reaching the moon and returning safely was around 0.017 per cent.) Upon leaving th e moon, no flames were seen coming from the rocket's engine, as if wires had pulled up the rocket. A few months before the alleged trip to the moon, a prototype of the landing module was tested. Neil Armstrong lost control of the module at a height of 90 metres, but managed to eject himself. How is it that the lunar landing went perfectly? Astronauts cannot travel to the moon because of the radiation in the Van Allen belts, innerbelt is approximately 2400-5600 km distant from the Earth a nd 3200 kilometres wide , outer belt is 12 000 -19 000 km distant from the Earth. This radiation was discovered with the aid of satellite sensors in 1958. Charged particles, protons and electrons, which have been caught in the Earth's magnetic field, move about rapidly in these belts. These particles have been created within the Earth's atmosphere by cosmic radiation and sun-winds (corpuscular radiation). They move simultaneously in three different 30"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"patterns: in spirals around the ma gnetic line, back and forth along the magnetic line and in orbit ar ound the Earth; electrons move from west to east, protons from east to west. The most dangerous particles, wh ich contain most energy, have collected in the inner parts of the belts, an area which astronauts absolutely must avoid. If an astronaut passed through these belts, he would become seriously ill or die from the radiation shortly after exposure. The photographs that were taken would likewise have been destroyed. During magnetic sun storms, the radiation increases. On such occasions it can be a thousand times stronger than usual. The Apollo 16 mission coincided with the most intensive sun storm ever. A two- metre layer of lead would have been necessary to protect the astronauts, according to the physicist Ralph Rene. (We are protected by lead when x-rays of our teeth are taken.) The space capsule had a thin shell of aluminium. Due to the radiation, the Russians never attempted to send anyone to the moon. Bill Kaysing believed that the ast ronauts circled the Earth for eight days and that NASA showed fake pictures of the moon in the meantime. The pictures were taken in the Nevada desert at a secret military base called Area 51, wh ere there is crater-covered ground, which look similar to the moon. If NASA's moon film is shown at double normal speed, the astronaut s appear to be running in the Earth's gravitational field. The statistics from the unmanned flights allowed too small a margin for successful flights, wherea s the manned flights were nearly exclusively successful. Despite the fact that the electrical system of Apollo 12 was critically damaged by lightning, it successfully mana- ged to \"land on the moon\" using just the reserve system. Only a child could believe in such a fairy tale. When a real attempt was made in 1970 with Apollo 13, everything went wrong. The question is, what is true and what is bluff? At least 25 % of Americans believe man has never landed on the moon. The Apollo hoax cost the American tax-payers 40 billion dollars. We will never know what the 31"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"cost would have been if the US gove rnment had really tried to put a man on the moon. One thing is certain - it is no longer possibl e to trust our autho- rities. They are no torious liars and al so quite careless. The freemasons expose us to a palimpsest or codex rescriptus by destroying and concealing the ancient spiritual culture and replacing it with a worthless mass-culture, the goal of which is to strengthen the effect of consen sus trance. During the Middle Ages, expensive vellum was processed for re-use by erasing a part or all of the original text with a pumice stone. Priceless texts from the ancient world were destroyed and replaced by theological drivel. As early as the 18th century, it became possible to expose the original texts with the aid of chemicals. In this way Cicero's great work \"De re publica\" was re-created. Unfortunately, the Swedish people are particularly susceptible to the practice of the palimpsest syndrome - the poisonous and false ideas of the freemasons. In Sweden as in the Soviet Union, all opponents of the socialis t injustices and brainwashing as well as other ideological disside nts are called racists and Nazis. Politically correct agitators are indoctrinated individuals and s hould be regarded as political illiterates, since they are totally ignorant of the hidden reality that controls our lives. Goethe wrote: \"Nothing is more terrifying than extreme igno- rance.\" In today's world information is re garded as \"credible\" if it coin- cides with the opinions of the gov ernment. Unoffici al information from other sources is completely ig nored.

Th ere is, however, certain infor- mation that the order was actually founded four years earlier (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, \"The Temple and the Lodge\", Lon- don, 1998, p. 72). In 1114, the bi shop of Chartres mentioned \"la Milice du Christ\" in a letter, the name by which the order was originally known. The bishop could hardly have got the year wrong, since he died the following year. Hugues de Payens became the first grand master of the order. The freemasons Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas claim that there were originally eleven Knights Temp lar, who attempted to secure safe passage between the port of Jaffa and Jerusalem (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messi ah: Templars, The Turin Shroud & The Great Secret of Freemasonry\", London, 1998, p. 111). They called themselves the Poor Knights of Solomon's Temple, where they were first based. Jerusalem was liberated from Muslim rule 19 years earlier (1099), but the Christian armies who occupied the city and the surrounding area were under constant threat from enemy Arabs. For this reason the Church was grateful for the services of de Payens and his knights. A secret Jewish order was behind these men, the Order of Zion (l'Ordre de Sion), founded in the monastery of Notre-Dame du Mont de Sion, on mount Zion, just south of Jerusalem, in June 1099 by the 39 year-old Godfroi de Bouillon, duke of Lorraine - a descendant of Guillem de Gellone, who was of the seed and tribe of David. The first 33"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"grand master of the order was Hu gues de Payens, who later founded the Knights Templar. Another member was Andre de Montbard. The original name was Chevaliers de l'Ordre de Notre-Dame de Sion. There is information that suggests that the Order of Zion may have been founded already in 1090 (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\", p 111). The elite of the Order of Zion has consisted of 13 leaders. The order's main goal was always to reinstate the Merovingian dynasty (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, \"The Messian ic Legacy\", Lo ndon, 1987, p 381). When Jerusalem was conquered du ring the Crusades in 1100, a Merovingian, Baldwin I - the younger brother of Godfrey of Bouillon, was the first king of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. This secret movement also founded the Knights Templar and constituted its ruling core. The Order of Zion was the invisible head organization and the Knights Templa r its military and administrative branch. Up to 1188, these two orders had the same grand master. The Knights Templar saluted each other w ith: \"Hail, Zion!\" or \"Zion be praised!\" Bertrand de Blanchefort, a grand master of the Knights Templar between 1156-69, was also grand master of the Order of Zion (1153- 1188). He is said to have been a Cathar. Originally, all grand masters were Cathars. The castle of Blanchef ort is situated in the area of the Mediterranean coast west of the Rhone which was then called Septimania and which was principally populated by Jews. Septimania was also known as Gothia (Gotie). As early as A. D. 391, the area was inhabited by the Goths, who foun ded a kingdom in southern Gaul around A. D. 418, the capital of which was Toulouse. Many Jewish Merovingians were later counted as Visigoths. For this reason they were often called 'G oths'. Intermarriage had been common. In 768, a Jewish kingdom was founded in Septimania. The king- dom was practically independent an d Mosaic law was enforced. Tou- louse and Narbonne were the most important centres for the Jews. Many Jews had Christian slaves. 34"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"One of the kings was Guillem de Gellone, who was nick-named Hook-Nose. He was also the duke of Toulouse. The town of Gellone became a centre for Jewish studies and had a Jewish academy. Guillem died in 812. The Jewish kingdom of Septimania ceased to exist in the year 900. The Khazar Jews by the Volga pla nned a coup in France around 970 together with their Gothic tribal brothers and Berber mercenaries. In this way they sought to take c ontrol of the whole country, but according to the Russian archaeologist and historian Lev Gumilev, the Prince of Kiev crushed the Jewish reign of terror by the Volga in 965 (Gumilev, \"The Ethnosphe re\", Moscow, 1993, p. 423). There was an inner struggle between the Order of Zion and the Knights Templar, at the same ti me as these organizations worked towards a common goal - control of Catholic Europe. When the Knights Templar lost Jer usalem to the Saracens in 1188, the Order of Zion and the Knights Templar went their separate ways. The last bastion fell into the hands of the Saracens on 18 May 1291. In 1188, the Order of Zion gained a new name the Prieure de Sion and their own Grand Master - Jean de Gisors. At the same time a second name Ormus was taken, whic h was used until 1306. According to the freemasons, Ormus was an Egyptian magician. The order had another subtitle in reserve, which c ould be used at need - L'Ordre de la Rose-Croix Veritas (Order of th e True Rosy Cross), according to Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. In 1616, the Order of Zion and the Knights Templar were founded anew in the town of Gisors in northern France. In conjunction with this, the red cross of the Knights Templar also became the symbol of the Prieure de Sion. This cross has arms with split points and is known as a Maltese cross. In 1619, the Prieure de Sion becam e virtually invisible. In 1627, another secret organization, Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement, began to act on behalf of the Prieure de Sion. The author Jean Delaude wrote the following in a document be- longing to the Prieure de Sion in 1977: \"Since the separation of the 35"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"two institutions (the Knights Templar and the Order of Zion) in 1188, the Prieure de Sion has counted twenty-seven grand masters to the present day.\" The most recent were: Charles Nordier (1801-1844), the famous author Victor Hugo (1844- 1885), who was succeeded by the composer Cl aude Debussy (1885- 1918), after whom came Jean Cocteau (1918-1963). Other famous grand masters of th e Prieure de Sion were: Nicolas Flamel (1398-1418), Leonardo da Vinci (1510-1519), Robert Fludd (1595-1637), Johann Valentin Andreae (1637-1654), Isaac Newton (1691-1727), Charles Radclyffe (1727-1746) and Charles de Lorraine (1746-1780), according to Michael Ba igent, Richard Leigh, Henry Lincoln (\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" (New York, 1983, p. 131). As early as 1614, the mystic Robert Fludd (grand master of the Order of Zion) started the secret Ro sicrucian movement in England. After him came Thomas Vaughan and Elias Ashmole. The Rosicrucians intended to take over the lodges of the freemasons. The Prieure de Sion was the secret organization that created the Scottish Rite within freemasonry in the 1700s. Johann Valentin Andreae wrote th e original manifesto of the Rosicrucians under the name of Christian Rosenkreutz (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, \"The Temple and the Lodge\", London, 1998, p. 201). Charles Nordier was grand master of the Prieure de Sion between 1801 and 1844. The Prieure de Sion also conspired against Napoleon at this time. According to a Prieur e de Sion document, the number of members was 1093, divided into a hierarchy with nine degrees, as well as eight or ni ne thousand novices. Charles Nordier later wrote: \"There are a great many secret societies in operation. But there is one that takes precedence over all others. This supreme secret society is called the Philadelphes.\" He wrote of \"the oath, which binds me to the Philalephes and which forbids me to make them known under their social name this society by its true name\" (Charles Nordier, \"A History of Secret Societies in the Army under Napoleon\", p. 105). 36"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The name Prieure de Sion did not appear in the public conscious- ness until on 25 June 1956.

The head office was located in Annemasse, Haute Savoie, France. The order once more became secret in 1984. Today the Prieure de Sion co-operates with the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina in Lausanne (founded in 1844, with 3700 members in 75 smaller lodges), and the Grand Orient of France. The Prieure de Sion, the right hand of the Illuminati, stand behind the modern and infiltrated Rosicrucians and all of the more powerful masonic lodges. The Temple of Solomon was destroyed and plundered by the Baby- lonian King Nebuchadnezzar II about 586 B. C. It was later rebuilt by Herod the Great and once more razed by Roman troops in A. D. 70 during the revolt in Judea (Flavius Josephus, \"Historie der Joden\", Amsterdam, 1895). The freemasons intend to rebuild the temple a third time. The temple of Solomon plays a central role in the Mosaic religion. The Knights Templar moved into the remaining parts of the temple and allowed no-one else to enter. During nearly ten years, nine to eleven Knights Templar (the only existing members) were busy with secret activities. Officially, they were guarding the pilgrim routes, but there is no evidence of this. And how could just eleven knights protect the routes, which covered hund reds of miles, where more and more pilgrims sought passage? They were called the Militia of Christ (Militiae Christi). It is possible that these knights found part of the treasure which neither Nebuchadnezzar II nor the Romans managed to unearth. In the Dead Sea scrolls, it is mentioned that the treasure in the Temple of Solomon consisted of 65 tons of silver and 26 tons of gold. Some sources, including the co ntemporary historian Flavius Josephus, also claim that certain Je wish relics (including the ark of the covenant) were hidden in the secret passages beneath the temple. 37"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Origin of the Knights Templar Several of the nine (actually elev en) original Knights Templar be- longed to a family that could be traced to the Merovingian King Dagobert II, who was murdered on 23 December 679. Catholic histo- rians up to the middle of the 17th century denied the existence of Dagobert II. Another member of this family was the man who travelled to the \"Holy Land\" together with the Kn ights Templar and became the first king of Jerusalem after the reconquest - Baldwin I (younger brother of Godfroi de Bouillon, the first grand master of the Order of Zion). During Easter 1118, his cousin Baldwin II took over power and created a base for the Knights Templar in his palace. Some of the riches of Jerusalem (including the Holy Grail) as well as secret documents were probably transported to southern France in A. D. 410, when Rome was plundered by the Visigoths. At the end of the fifth century, the Merovingians conquered large parts of what is today France and united it into one nation. The Merovingians became the first roya l dynasty of France, and despite all claims to the contrary, the dynasty continued. Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln wrote about this in their book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" (New York, 1983). They assume that the Knights Templar already had deta iled knowledge of the Temple of Solomon, when they first travelled to Jerusalem. There is a connection between the Merovingians and the Jewish tribe of Benjamin. Southern France became the residence of many Jewish tribes. Jews principally populated an area from the Pyrenees to the estuary of the Rhone, especially the area around Narbonne. This area was earlier controlled by the Arabs. In 1128, the first group of temple brothers returned home, where they met Pope Honorius II and Bernard of Clairvaux, the leader of a then impoverished order. He was rela ted to at least one of the nine temple brothers. The Knights Templar were recognized by religious leaders, who held council in Troyes in France the same year, despite 38"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"that they knew the knights were go dless villains, heinous plunderers, murderers, perjurers and adulterers. Bernard became their guardian and in time, he became a very rich man. He built and paid for 90 monasteries and 80 cathedrals. He was very enthusiastic about the Knights Templar and wrote a handbook for the order in 1135. In 1134, work on the largest Goth ic cathedral in the world was begun in Chartres on Bernard's orde rs. Gothic architecture seemed to appear from nowhere and took the world by surprise. It was sus- pected that the original Knights Templar had found documents concerning the architecture upon which the temple of Solomon was based. The freemasons are constantly referring to the building of the temple and the mythical architect Hiram Abiff. The Church had earlier excommunicated many of those who were recruited. The grand master calle d the Knights Templar the legal executors of Christ and the Church gave them the right to bear arms. The pope exempted the temple brothers from the sin of killing. The order punished a member very severely if he broke even the smallest of the temple rules. The emblem of the Knights Templar was a horse with two riders on its back, a symbol of poverty and brotherhood. But one of the sym- bols of the Knights Templar was a skull and crossbones. Was this really a testimony to their harmlessness? The Knights Templar worshipped th e cult of Mitras and attempted to take power in Europe. Secret signs were used as a part of their conspiracy. The Vast Influence of the Knights Templar In 1139, Pope Innocent II made the Knights Templar completely independent of all kings, princes and prelates. They answered to the pope alone. Bernard de Tromelai became the order's fourth grand master in 1149. 39"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Order of the Knights Templar expanded massively and became very powerful in southern Europe. The organization owned land in France, England, Scotland (16 properties), Spain, Portugal, Italy, Flanders, Hungary, and elsewhere. They could do as they pleased. They were experts in medicine and the use of herbs. They invented banking and were the first to use cheques. The Knights Templar were effective usurers. They became extr emely proficient bankers for large parts of Europe. The Knights Temp lar lent huge sums to poor monarchs against high interest and organized the transfer of money to travelling salesmen through th eir connections around Europe. The kings of many countries owed them enormous sums of money. All this paved the way for capitalism and the banking system. They had also taken care of the French King Philip IV's business interests. He became king in 1285 when he was 17 years old, and immediately understood that he could not pay inte rest to the Knights Templar for the loans his father and grandfather had taken. The poor knights beca me extremely wealthy. They were also exempt from taxes, built a mighty fl eet and were permitted to build their own churches, which were w onders of geometric design, for example Iglesia de la Vera Cruz in Segovia, which was built in 1208. The interiors of the prevalent octa gonal structure of the Templars' buildings, were based upon a six-poin ted star (the seal of Solomon or the Star of David), and a pyramid. The Star of David is a cabba listic symbol. Professor Gershom Scholem proves in his book \"The Messianic Idea in Judaism\" that hexagrams (the six-poin ted star) were used by those Jews who were involved with black magic. As early as the 13 th century, there were seven thousand knights, squires, servants and priests in nearly all the countries of Europe (Malcolm Barber, \"The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple\", Cambridge University Press, 1994). In the 13 th and 14 th centuries, the order built 870 castles and chapter houses. A grand master headed this order with strict hierarchy. Beneath him, there was a grand prior.

Their wh ite-and-black chequered banner is called a beaseant, which was also their battle cry. Knights became the \"servants and slaves\" of the temple. The American masonic leader Albe rt Pike (1809-1891) wrote the following about the Knights Templar in his book \"Morals and Dogma\" (Charleston, 1871): \"Like all secret societies, the Knights Templar had two different doctrines, one secret and exclusively for the leaders, the other public.\" In 1252, the Grand Master Raynard de Vichiers challenged King Henry III of England (1216-1272) by claiming that the Order of the Knights Templar had acquired the power to dethrone certain undesirable kings. In Lyon in 1296, a suggestion was made that the Order of the Knights Templar and the Order of St. John should be united. The Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, opposed this suggestion. Philip IV Strikes Back The Knights Templar, who were a rrogant and had a military force superior to his own, irritated Philip IV, also known as Philip the Fair (1285-1304). Neither the pope nor he himself had any control over them. Philip owed them a lot of money. He also wanted to be admitted as a member of the order but was rejected. After this, he wished to dispose of the Knights Templar. His predecessor Louis VII (1137-1180) had, however, been a member of the order. In 1303, Philip arranged for Pope Boniface VIII to be kidnapped and killed. After this, Pope Benedict XI was poisoned. In 1305, Philip managed to arrange the election of his own candidate, Bernard de Goth, Archbishop of Bordeaux, to the papal seat. The new pope took the name Clement V. He moved from Rome to Avignon and thereby caused a schism in the Catholic Church for the next 68 years. 41"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"In 1306, Philip the Fair had the Jews in France arrested, their assets confiscated and they were banished \"forever\". The reason behind this action was to cut off the Knights Templar's secret money transfers. He also wished to clamp down on the Jewish money- lenders in the Lombardy. The bani shment was revoked in the year following his death (1315), but the royal family was to bitterly regret this action. The creditors once mo re made themselves an impossible nuisance with their usury and a few years later they were expelled again. There followed a history of unpl easant experiences. In 1187, the twenty-two year old Philip August (1180-1223), who had assumed power in 1180, when he was just 15 years old, decided to banish the Jews from France, confiscate part of their wealth and cancel the debts of their loan-takers. But a few decades later, there were once again Jews all over the country. During the summer of 1307, a group of leading Knights Templar were on an important mission in southern France near Rennes-le- Chateau by the old pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela. They avoided the local populace, which was very unusual. The Knights Templar had an important stronghol d in Bezu, not far from Rennes- le-Chateau, and two castles situat ed on top of two mountains. The castle at Gisors was the headquar ters of the Knights Templar in France. The headquarters of the Prie ure de Sion was later, in the 17 th century, situated in Rennes-le-Chateau. During the spring of 1307, a prisoner who was condemned to death wished to give the king some crucial information, which he had come across when he had shared a cell with a Knight Templar. The condemned man sought a pardon in exchange for the information. He was permitted to see the king. The king considered the prisoner's information about the atrocities committed by the Knights Templar so serious that the man was pardoned. The king had been told of how a figurine representing him had been stabbed repeatedly during the black magic rites of the Knights Te mplar. Sexual perversion had also been in evident. The Knights Te mplar had sacrificed children and 42"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"taught women how to perform abor tions (M.

Two former Knights Templar, S quin Flexian and Noffo Dei, who were arrested for different crimes in 1307 in France, confirmed these facts. In order to save themselves, they gave the king a considerable amount of information about the ac tivities of the Knights Templar. Squin Flexian had been a prior at Montfaucon. Philip IV of France was also given this information. The rest of the investigation confirmed the truth of these testimonies. The new pope was entirely depend ent on Philip the Fair. The energetic king had his spies infilt rate the order. He immediately understood that the Knights Templar had managed to become far too powerful by making extensive plans for conspiracy. The king under- stood that his life was in danger. He was expecting a visit from the grand master of Cyprus and ma de preparations for a counter- operation. On 22 September 1307, he gave orders to arrest the Knights Templar. The orders were given in sealed envelopes to all governors and official s of the crown around the country. The envelopes were not to be opened until the evening of 13 October 1307. This order was also sent to foreign rulers. The order was carried out at dawn on Friday, 13 October 1307, but only 620 of 3200 Knights Templar were arrested (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, \"The Temple and the Lodge\", London, 1998, p 101). In Paris alone, 140 Knights Templar we re arrested, including the Grand Master of the order Jacques Bernar d de Molay. In the document collection of the powerful masonic lo dge the Grand Orient, there is a manuscript, No. 631, (\"Reception au sublime grade de Kadosh\"), which states that Jacques de Molay's real name was Bourguignon.

The property of the Knights 43"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Templar was confiscate d - nine thousand castles (including their palace in Paris) and estates. The king took control of Cyprus. This was the official end of the most powerful secret society in history. But Philip the Fair made a serious mistake. He failed to destroy the heart of the Knights Templar, the Prieure de Sion. And so the conspiracy continued. The Knights Templar in Bezu were left in peace, however, since they enjoyed special immunity in their headquarters. The people of Lorraine refused to obey the pope. Th e Knights Templar were also left alone in Germany and in England. Edward II initially ignored the papal bull, but on 6 October 1309, he ordered all Knights Templar in England and Scotland to be arrested. Only two were actually arrested, one of these was the Master of Scot land, Walter de Clifton. They were released later, however. The official history claims that the Knights Templar became the victims of Philip the Fair's greed, since he wanted to take control of their possessions. But the property of the Knights Templar was transferred to the Brothers of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem or the Hospitallers, not the French crown, according to the papal bull Ad providam on 2 May 1312. But not all the extensive proper ty of the Knights Templar was found, since they had managed to transfer a large portion of their wealth abroad. Only sm aller assets were found. The Knights Templar were also ac cused of taking part in homo- sexual orgies and blasph emous activities. Among other things, they were believed to have spat on a black raven. A brother in service admitted to having had a homosexu al relationship with Jacques de Molay (Malcolm Barber, \"The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple\", Cambridge University Press, 1994). They worshipped the evil being Baphomet, an androgynous and lustful idol. The Dead Sea scrolls indicate that, according to Jewish code, the word Baphomet means Sophia (wisdom) in Greek (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messi ah: Templars, The Turin Shroud & The Great Secret of Freemasonry\", London, 1998, p. 117). Baphomet 44"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"needed new blood sacrifices. This was the reason why the Knights Templar had sacrificed children.

According to Islamic trad ition, blood is a very dangerous substance. It must not be ingested and it attracts evil spirits (William Rowles, \"The Heathens\", London, 1948). To the Knights Templar, Baphomet of Mendes (Asmodeus) wa s the guardian of Solomon's treasure. In the holy book of the Jews, the Talmud, Asmodeus is regarded as the chief of demons. The ancient Israelites symbolically sacrificed the billy goat Azazel, symbolized by the pentagram, which conceals the name 'head of the goat'. 45"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"On 13 August 1308, two trials against the Knights Templar began begun. The prosecution heard about a hundred charges. During these trials against the Knights Templar, mention was made of Baphomet, which was identified with spiritual baptism. The same being, but with a different name, has also been found in Egypt, where it marked the 15 th column in the holy temple at Helio- polis and symbolized deceit and injustice. One Knight Templar described Jacques de Molay as \"uncommonly evil\". Another claimed that the grand master had acted deceitfully and manipulated the election in order to become grand master. According to the indictment, the Knights Templar used a jewel- studded cranium mounted upon a wooden phallus. It is clear from Riidiger Siinners documentary \"S chwarze Sonne\" (1997) that the Knights Templar also tried to crossbreed different races and even animals with humans. It was suspected that many leading Knights Templar were actually concealed Muslims, others concealed Jews, since Hebrew was used as a working language within the Knights Templar. There had been some co-operation with the Assassi ns. There was yet another Muslim connection: The English Knight Te mplar Robert of St. Albans had publicly converted to Isla m and led a Muslim army. 46"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"According to modern historians, all accusations against the Knights Templar were fabricated a nd the Knights were totally inno- cent. Within a couple of days of the arrests, 36 knights had died as a result of torture. The Knights Temp lar's lawyers delayed the course of justice. Three years later, in 1310 , the first 54 Knights Templar were burned at the stake. Pope Clement V dissolved the Poor Knights of the Temple in the bull Vox in excelso on 22 March 1312. Some of the Knights Templar escaped to Scotland, where the bull was not valid and others to Portugal. Those who fled to Scotland began an attempt to infiltrate the lodges of the freem asons. In Portugal, the name of the order was changed to the Order of Christ and King Dinis II gave them asylum in 1319. Philip IV's fear was well-founded. He discovered that the Knights Templar had conspired against th e monarchs of Europe and the Church (William T. Still, \"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies\", Lafayett e, Louisiana, 1990, p 113). When the headquarters of the Knights Templar was moved from Jerusalem to Kolossi Castle, 14 km west of Limassol on the south coast of Cyprys, in 1291, the Gr and Master Thibault Gaudin began a conspiracy directed against Henry, king of Cyprus. Jacques de Molay helped the king's younger brother Amaury into power (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, p 178). The Knights Templar had conquered Cyprus in 1191 and founded the Kingdom of Cyprus. According to the historian Mattheus Paris' investigations, the Knights Templar had attempted to undermine the policies of the Germano-Roman Emperor Frederic II (1220-1250). In 1293, Jacques de Molay was elected grand master. In 1306, he began to visit France frequently and lived there during extended periods. The Knights Templar utilized the energy lines (ley lines) in the basement of their headquarters in Kolossi Castle. They used this grid to spread and stabilize their secret influence throughout the world. This phenomenon, which affects the entire world, had the same 47"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"negative frequency as the latter symbol of the Illuminati, the pyra- mid and the all-seeing eye. The historian Harry L. Haywood wrote the following about the Knights Templar: \"The Knights Te mplar dreamed of a world state where they themselves would play a leading role...\" Only an extremely evil secret society can dream of such a goal. The leaders of the Knights Temp lar made a joint resolution: \"Europe must be transformed into a single state. Europe will become the kind of state where all the nations w ith their kings and leaders will be included as member states, l i k e a uni on of states.\" (Pekka Ervast, \"Temppeliherrain unelma\" / \"The Dream of the Knights Templar\", Helsinki, 1927, p. 16) Ordinary Knights Templar had no idea about the vile plans that their psychopathic masters made. Philip the Fair immediately understood this threat and made a crucial decision. One of the goals of the Knights Templars was to unite Europe under a centralised power. Step by step, they managed to strengthen their financial power during a period of 200 years. They sought to gain complete control over financia l transactions and banking, the- reby making the nations dependent on the extensive power of the Knights Templar. With the aid of an international bank, the Knights Templar endeavoured to become financially more powerful than the national governments. The primary goal of the Knights Templar was to create a power base. For this reason, the Order of the Knights Templar made plans to found an independent state for the order in a Jewish area in Languedoc, in southern Fran ce at the end of the 13 th century. But strong national governments with considerable public support appeared everywhere in Europe and this medieval attempt at \"globalisation\" ended up on the scrap-heap of history. 48"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Curse of the Grand Master The last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was born into a family of converted Jewish minor nobles in 1244. Christopher Knight and Robert Lo mas, both freemasons of the 4 th degree, claim that de Molay had bl ood-ties that could be traced back to Jesus Christ. He became a Knight Templar at the age of 21. He was 49 years old when he was elected as the 23rd grand master of the Knights Templar. Jacques de Molay was sentenced to life imprisonment following his confession, but he claimed that his order was innocent. Because of this he was burned at the stake on Ile St. Louis in the Seine near Notre Dame on the evening of 18 March 1314. As the flames surrounded him, he cursed both the pope and the king. The pope would die within 40 days, the king within a year. Both died within the period de Molay had predicte d. The pope died on 20 April 1314 after a painful stomach disease. Philip was officially killed by a wild boar while hunting on 29 November 1314. These events laid the foundation of the myth. It was actually a case of murder. It was an agent of the Knights Templar, Angerand de Maringi, who organized the murder of the king during the hunt. In April 1313, the king's Chancellor (Prime Minister) Guillaume de Nogaret, a professor of law who had begun the trial against the Knights Templar, was also murdered. This was proved during the trial of Maringi in 1315. The conspi- rator was sentenced to death and hanged (Grigori Bostunich, \"Free- masonry and the French Revolution\", Moscow, 1995, p. 34). Assis- tance was needed for the \"curse\" to come true. Also those who informed the authorities about th e Knights Templar were killed. Louis XVI was forced to lie down under the guillotine on 20 January 1794. He was brought th ere from the same tower, where Jacques de Molay had been tortured.

In 1315, France and most of Europe were stricken by the first of a ser ies of years of bad harvests. It rained constantly during the years 1315-1318. Anyone could see that something was not right. The Black Death was waiting around the corner. And then came the wars. From 1346 to 1352, the Black Death ravaged the whole of Europe. The bubonic plague claimed an estimated 24 million lives, a third of Europe's population. Rats and the fleas on the rats spread the disease. Beforehand, certain powers in the Church had made sure that cats were diabolised and persecuted. The cats were therefore unable to limit the number of ra ts. Robbers and plunderers were everywhere. A rumour claimed that the Jews were behind this unparalleled catastrophe and thous ands of Jews were killed. The Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Beaujeu, a predecessor of Jacques de Molay, visited de Mo lay during his imprisonment. At de Molay's request, he was to open th e grave of de Molay's uncle and bring out a chest containing the documents of the Knights Templar. These were transported to Scotland (Lennings, \"Encyklopaedie der Freimaurerei\", Leipzig, 1863). The Swedish freemasons still keep some property left behind by the Knights Templar (Henning Melan- der, \"Frimurarnas hemlighet\" / \"The Secret of the Freemasons\", Stockholm, 1916, p. 20). On 24 June 1314, the Scots won the battle against the English at Bannockburn near Stirling due to th e unexpected intervention of the Knights Templar (who were regarded as \"unknown warriors\"). Scot- land subsequently became independent and remained so for 289 years. Among the warriors was Sir William St. Clair (later Sinclair) of Roslyn. The American masonic leader Albert Pike wrote in his book \"Morals and Dogma\": \"The Order lived on, under different names and headed by unknown masters, and revealed its existence only to those who, by 50"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"passing through a series of degrees, had proved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the dangerous secret.\" It was for this reason that the in filtrators from the Knights Temp- lar wished to found the Grand Lodge of Europe for the freemasons on 24 June 1717. This date marked the victory of the Knights Templar and would bring luck in the freemasons' secret and magic war against traditional civilization. The day of the Hunter, 24 June, is a holy day for the freemasons. It was also an important day for the Knights Templar. After Jacques de Molay, the leader ship passed on to Jean-Marc Larmenius, who was initiated into the secrets of the order by de Molay while the grand master was in prison. Larmenius, who came from \"the Holy Land\", saved himself by leaving France. In 1324, Thomas Theobald was chosen as the new underground grand master. The last grand master known to us was Bernard Raymond Fabre- Palaprat (1804-1838), who was also a freemason of the Scottish Rite. All this is according to a secret doc ument, \"Larmenius Charta\", which became available in 1804 (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, \"The Temple and the Lodge\", London, 1998, p 114). In this year, Napoleon legalized the Order of the Knights Templar. The freemasons themselves have actually admitted that de Molay had time to pass on his secrets to his successor before he was burned and that the successor managed to found secret lodges in Paris and Stockholm (Peter Partner, \"The Murdered Magicians: The Templars and their Myth\", Oxford, 1982, pp. 110-114). The Discovery at Rennes-le-Chateau In 1891, the priest Berenger Saunier e found four hand-written parch- ments in a hollow altar-column in his 13 th century church in Rennes- le-Chateau, in southwestern France. The parchments were hidden in a wooden tube.

(To Dagobert II King and to Zion belongs this treasure and he is there dead.) Another coded concept was REX MUNDI, which means 'king of the world' in Latin. The village priest was summoned to Paris to present the parch- ments to the leaders of the Church . Saunicre soon became incredibly rich. The Vatican supported him despite the fact that he neglected his responsibilities as a priest and the congregation wanted him replaced. Until his death in 1917, he spent millions of francs on paintings, antiques and fine porcelain. He built a castle and a tower, Tour Magdala, as well as a large luxury home. He decorated the entrance to his church with the remarkable text: TERRIBILIS EST LOCUS ISTE. (This place is terrible.) He had a statue of Baphomet placed by the entrance of his church. He spent a lot of time in Paris and associated with, among others, the composer Claude Debussy, who was then the grand master of the Prieure de Sion. The primary aim of modern freemasonry is to build the New World Order, a spiritual Temple of Solomon where non-members are nothing but slaves. These slaves are referred to the periphery and are treated according to the crudest racism of ancient ways of thinking. The new temple would also become a slaughterhouse where even human beings would be sacrificed to Yahweh . There is an instruction in the Talmud, the cruelty of which reminds us of the ancient worshippers of Moloch: \"He who sheds the blood of a goy, offers a sacrifice to the Lord.\" (Yalkut Simeoni, ad Pent at., fol. 245, col. 3. Midderach Bamidbar rabba, p. 21) According to the French historian Gerard de Sede, the Jewish astrologer Michel de Nostrada me, called Nostradamus (1503-1566), was an agent for an international network of emissaries.

As court astrologer, Nostradamus was in itiated into all kinds of secrets, which he used to their full advantage. Many of his prophecies were not prophecies at all but cryptic messages, codes, plans, timetables, instructions and concepts for ac tions within the secret society. Nostradamus hinted that future rulers would originate from Languedoc (from the Order of the Knights Templar). He happened to see a book on magic in a monastery in Orval, in present-day Belgium. Godfroi de Bouillons stepmother had donated the book. It was in Orval, where the Priory of Sion had begun their activities. It was also in Orval that Nostradamus' books were published during the masonic coup in 1789 and under Napoleon. According to the Italian historian Pier Carpi, Nostradamus was an active member of the Priory of Si on. But he was much more than that. Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair (Merovingian) was elected grand master in Blois in the Loire valley on 17 January 1981. Two days later, he met Licio Gelli, the grand master of P2, at Cafe La Tipia on rue de Rome in Paris. Plantard was a friend of Charles de Gaulle (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, Henry Lincoln, \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\", New York, 1983, p. 222). In a letter, de Gaulle thanked Plan- tard for his services by means of which he was elected president. During the Second World War, the Gestapo had imprisoned Plantard from October 1943 up to the end of 1944. In 1983, Pierre Plantard de Saint-Cl air, grand master of the Prieure de Sion during the years 1981-1984, published an arti cle, where he wrote the following: \"It was in Turin, in 1556, that Nostradamus was initiated into the great secret of the future... But it was not until 1557, when he became the grand master of the Order that he was allowed to partake of the great secret...

Buildings should be placed in accordance with the energy flow of the universe and nature in order to guarantee the well-bei ng of their inhabitants. Through knowledge of geomancy, such a building becomes a soundingboard, which amplifies the positive energies of nature. Being inside a geomantically constructed buildin g should be a positive experience. Those architects who followed the laws of geomancy were able to come into contact with nature's underlying magic order. By utilising knowledge of geomancy it was possible to attain har- mony. By creating a magically correct architecture, the freemasons could put those who frequented these buildings under the influence of the impulses of nature. At that period architecture was a magically charged form of art, a case of interplay with nature since the con- ditions in these geometric structures reflected the laws of nature. How shapes are placed in relation to each other is important, even crucial, in geomantic architecture. Magic geometry is used to balance buildings in accordance with earth radiation from energy lines (Nigel Pennick, \"Sacred Geometry\", San Fran cisco, 1980). Calculations were used together with the geometry in order to create magical building methods. Heraclitus from Efesos in Asia Minor discovered a molecular structural code in nature. Today it is possible to perceive these molecular structures with the aid of a microscope. But the ancient Greeks nonetheless had knowledge of these perfect forms. Geomantic principles are built into our ge netic code, the DNA double helix, as well as the solar system and the spiral galaxy. The freemasons knew about the ancient Greeks' ability to heighten the level of human consciousness by the use of perfect forms. They 55"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"believed that all buildings should be built to stimulate spirituality. The key to the successful and aesthetic system of the operative free- masons included the golden section. Even today, the arch of the golden section is used for masonic lodges. There is an independent, natural form of aesthetics, a form that is based on beauty and inner harmon y. Everything that expresses the proportions of the golden mean becomes timeless whether it is a question of architecture, art, music, literature, or film. In music, the golden section is created by the ba lance between a beautiful melody and its harmonious construction. An intensively elevating and uplifting high-frequency musical tonality is thus created. Such harmonious and beautiful music has the power to ennoble the soul. The Italian ma thematician Leonardo Fibonacci (known as Leonardo of Pisa, circa 1170-1240), demonstrated that there was a scientific explanation for the golden section. The golden mean promotes our spiritual development, dis- harmonious art blocks it and damages us and even makes us ill. Even mentioning the golden section is avoided today. Whether it applies to buildings, clothes, music, or th e appearance of everyday articles - most things have become uglier and less harmonious. Today we seldom see balanced items of clothing, such as were worn in medieval times, when clothes were balanced with the aid of the golden mean and colours - for example with one blue trouser leg and one green. This combination balanced the ener gies, affecting various organs in the body positively with light of different harmonious wavelengths or frequencies. It also made the clot hes beautiful. Colour is a flow of light, which affects the mind in an inexplicable way. The more pure the colours, or the more balan ced the combination of different shades, the more positive their effect upon us. Experiments in Russia have show n that infrared light increases muscular tension and that ultravio let light decreases it, despite the fact that both of these frequencies are invisible to the human eye. The Puritans introduced dark clothes and abolished popular traditions. This became very obvious in Estonia in 1583, when the 56"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"country was divided between the Catholics in the south and the Protestants in the north. In the Swedish, Protestant, part of Estonia, traditional costumes were burned. (They were regarded as too colour- ful.) Musical instruments, beautiful paintings and books were destroyed. In the southern. Catholic part of Estonia, the people kept their harmonious colour-scale. Today it is more apparent than ever that forms are constantly deteriorating and becoming destabilised. The golden mean affects us in a very positive way since it is aesthetically attractive and spiritua lly uplifting, which explains why the splendid beauty of buildings such as the Parthenon makes a great impression upon us. The golden secti on is a fixed numerical relations, where a is to b what b is to a + b. The quotient is usually denoted (phi), which is approximately 1:1.618, an irrational number, like pi. It has peculiar properties. This number has been discovered in the proportions of the human body and also in crop circles. This means that the golden section is magically charged. If we draw two circles from the same point, one 1.618 times larger than the other, and draw lines between the two, we can create magic forms of the golden mean (Nigel Pennick, \"Sacred Geometry: Symbo- lism and Purpose in Religious Struct ures\", San Francisco, 1980, pp. 27-28). The golden section is a mathematical ratio usually discerned by the painter as the larger side of a re ctangle how relates to the shorter. Derived by the ancient Greeks it can be constructed geometrically or expressed as a simple ratio. Even the ancient Egyptians used the golden mean, when they designed their buildings and monuments. The Ainu people of northern Japan use the double helix as a sacred symbol of the link between life an d the material world. It is a logarithmic helix with the proportions of the golden mean. Scientists at Johns Hopkins University discovered that a favou- rable environment, good design and beautiful paintings may give us better health. A good design (close to the golden mean) can lead to a quicker recovery from illness. It is not only good for the soul, it even lowers blood-pressure.

Modern architects under the control of the political freemasons are seldom permitted to use mentally enhancing geomancy. They design buildings which have a destructive effect upon the human psyche, i.e. the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, the new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao or the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. These buildings for instance proportions are far from the golden mean. Modern political freemasonry has grown out of medieval guilds of craftsmen, who moved from place to place as they built palaces, castles and churches. These guilds worked in the manner of local trade unions and brotherhoods for stone masons. Initiated builders also wished to make their hard lives a little easier and to spread their secret geomantic knowledge. Other cr aftsmen were usually statio- nary. At the building sites, the workers had a lodge, where tools were kept and where they could rest and eat. It was in these lodges that apprentices and journeymen were initiated into the secrets of the craft, which were not disclosed to outsiders; for example how to calculate strength and vault pressure as well as secret knowledge about the significance of energy lines. They were also taught valuable rules of life. The purpos e of the guilds was to maintain a monopoly of a particular craft especially against outsiders. In 5th century Spain, an association of masons was mentioned for the first time, the so-called comancini. Their leader was appointed by the king. Masons joined their local guild, the lodge, chiefly for the purposes of protection, education and training. The freemasons founded their first lodge in York in northern England as early as A. D. 926, with the Roman collegia fabrorum as prototype. In the lodges of the freemasons, journeymen were instructed in the complicated secre ts of geomantic architecture. In 1375, a document, which was later found in the London City Archives described the freemasons as craftsmen, whose movements were not 58"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"restricted by the feudal lords. Instea d they were free to travel around the country and even around the con tinent. In contrast to other craftsmen, smiths or tanners, the masons joined together in large groups to work on vast and magnif icent structures. The associations had so-called letters of proposal, which grante d them many privileges from popes, princes, citie s, and monasteries. Th us they were allowed to leave finished palaces and cathedrals and travel to other areas or even other countries in order to plan and buil d their next project, and to seek work through other lodges in different parts of Europe. One of these exceptional guilds was the Company of Freemasons, founded in 1376. Freemasons with pe rmanent residence were only permitted to seek work within a limited area. These builders belonged to the gu ild of masons, which was divided into three stages: apprentice, jour neyman and master. Novices were required to undergo a seven-year pe riod of training and instruction before they were recognized as full members (journeymen). The master mason, who was the most re spected, had a deep knowledge of the secrets of nature, knew how to use the positive and avoid the negative energy-lines of the earth's fi eld of radiation. He also knew how to design a town so that the inhabitants were protected from the wind. The streets of modern citi es create a constant draught; the wind blows freely and affects the inhabitants negatively. These natural methods are still used in China. In the 1980s, some knowledgeable Swedish vis itors to an area near Shanghai used a set- square and a compass to examine if the houses were built with their walls aligned along the Curry-lines. The ground beneath every bed was to be free from damaging ley-lines. The houses in question were built in 1958, not during the Middle Ages. Earth radiation is still an important matter in the building of hotels and banks in Hong Kong and Singapore. This system, which works in accordance with the rules of nature, is called feng-shui and was violently opposed by the Communist regime in China. A Chinese encyclopaedia states that the architectural principles of feng-shui are: \"To create well-being, happiness and wealth for the pe ople living in the house.\" 59"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The master mason was responsibl e for the building project. The masons had their own laws, regulations and ceremonies. These asso- ciations (called 'Bauhiitten' in Ge rman) acted under th e leadership of 'a master of the chair', an expr ession, which much later was taken over by political freemasons (Field Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was a French master of the chair whom the Swedish government chose in 1810 as successor to Charl es XIII, the head of the free- masons). The grand master instructed the journeymen and these, in turn instructed the a pprentices in the art of geomantic architecture. The grand masters also divided up the work and paid out the wages. The master of the chair was chosen for a year at a time. Meetings were held each month. These dealt with matters of the guild - con- flicts were settled, new members were accepted, and apprentices were promoted to journeymen. Everything took place, according to ordained ceremonies. Fines were levied if laws were broken. In England, all freemasons were regarded as craftsmen. In Ger- many, they had a much higher status. After the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th cen turies, the activities of the freemasons de- creased in Germany, but remained vital in England. Masonic lodges kept constant international contact in order to make it easier for the masons to find work. The Grand Lodge of Strassburg was at the head of all lodges in Europe. It had introduced secret greeting signs, handshakes and passwords, so members of different lodges might recognize ea ch other. This was a necessary precaution since the freemasons guar ded the secrets and standards of their order jealously. They made sure that everyone who claimed to master the art of building had received proper instruction. These precautions were justified, since the itinerant masons often found themselves among strangers who so metimes falsely claimed to be members of the guild in order to ex tract secrets from the real mem- bers. The masons invented a steadily increasing number of pass- words and phrases, signs of recognition and special handshakes in order to ward off these impostors. They asked questions in a parti- cular manner. The righ t answer confirmed th at the newcomer was 60"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"qualified to take part in the work. Much of this was later taken over and expanded upon by speculative or \"passive\" political freemasons. The only sign that is common to all current grades and lodges is the sign of distress. In Swedish freemasonry, this sign is learned upon admission to the third degree. In an emergency, the freemason in need makes an equilateral triangle by placing his joined hands upon his forehead with the palms fa cing forward and shouts: \"A moi, a l'enfant de la veuve de Naphtal i!\" (\"Help me, help the child of Naphtali's widow!\") Upon seeing this sign, all brothers must immediately come to the rescue of the freemason in need - ev en if it is contrary to common law and the interests of the nation. They must lend aid, whatever the need. They must ignore their allegiance to the laws of the country. Many freemasons saved their skins in this manner during the First and Second World Wars. The American officer John McKinstry was captured by Mohawk Indians, which were on the side of the British during the Revo- lutionary War between 1775 and 1781. McKinstry was tied to a tree and was about to be burned to death, when he made the masonic sign of distress. To his surprise, one of the Indians stepped forward and halted the execution. 61"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"His saviour was Joseph Brant, a Mohawk chief who had been educated in Europe and had been initiated into the fraternity in London. Brant had returned to his tribe, but remained partly loyal to the organization. He handed McKins try over to British freemasons, who in turn escorted him to one of the revolutionary out-posts. This example proves that loyalty within freemasonry is stronger than the bond to one's own country or tribe. The freemasons were principally stonecutters, masons and pain- ters, which we may compare to modern-day architects, engineers and sculptors. Thus they were highly skilled. Many of the finest buildings of the Middle Ages (the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, built between 1163 and 1320, and St. Paul's Cathedral in London, which was com- pleted in 1663) were built by the freemasons. They built incredible palaces, monumental fortresses, b eautiful town halls, churches and many other buildings. Their knowledge was regarded as a royal art form. The expression 'frozen music', denoting architecture, began to be used. The buildings were cert ainly harmonious and pleasant to behold, and they were not built on arbitrary sites. With the aid of the divining rod, sites were found where the earth radiation would be most beneficial for the inha bitants' mental well-being. After the breakdown of society due to the Black Death, the guilds once again tried to assert their rights. The English parliament banned the activities of the guilds in 1425. In 1534, Henry VIII of England broke with the Catholic Church in Rome, confiscated its property and closed its monasteries (officially for the reason that the pope had denied him the right to divorce, but according to unofficial infor- mation, he had a secret pact wi th Venetian bankers). Henry VIII stopped all building projects and many masons became unemployed. Later, he confiscated the rest of the guilds' assets. Henry VIII wanted war and the Jewish bankers in Ve nice gave him this opportunity. Most guilds ceased to exist. Their archives were lost and thereby their true history. The few weaken ed lodges that remained, despite the royal plundering in southern England, attempted to recover by welcoming non-masons as member s and charging them high entrance 62"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"fees to enter the lodges. This was exactly the opportu nity that cer- tain shady and wealthy forces had been waiting for. They needed a functioning political network with s ecret codes in order to implement their plan to gain control over the \"structuring of society\". The Infiltration Begins After the execution of Grand Master Jacques de Molay on 18 March 1314, many Knights Templar fled to Scotland, where they preserved the secrets of their order and in filtrated the existing guilds. As early as 1420 the banned Knights Templar founded a lodge in Scotland, where they established their international headquarters. The most important symbols of the Knights Templar were a stone cube and a stone sphere. The Kni ghts Templar bided their moment until it was time to found the so -called Scottish freemasonry. In 1446, William St. Clair began building Rosslyn Chapel in Roslyn, a village south of Edinburgh, whic h eventually became a real masonic lodge, named Lodge No. 1 (Mary's Chapel). It was actually the head- quarters of the Knights Templar, al so called the Temple of Yahweh. In 1480, the chapel was completed under the direction of Oliver Sinclair (St. Clair). In due time, th e Scottish family Sinclair created a masonic system of its own, to which the Hamilton, Stuart, Mac- Gomery clans and others belonged. The Sinclair family, originally from France and called St. Clair, were descendants of the Mero- vingians (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messiah\", London 1998, pp. 131-132). Sir W illiam Sinclair became the first grand master of Scotland in 1736. Sinclair naturally had connections to the secret Order Prieure de Sion. In 1601, James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary Stuart, became a freemason at the Lodge of Perth and Scoon. He became the supreme patron of freemasonry. James VI ha d blood ties to the Merovingian family of Guise, since Mary Stuart's maternal grandmother was Marie de Guise (Michael Baigent, Rich ard Leigh, \"The Temple and the 63"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Lodge\", London, 1998, p. 200). In 1603, he was named James I of England. Thus the Merovingians came to power in England through the Stuart family. Their coat of arms depicted, among other things, a trowel and a sword, which symbolize freemasonry and the Order of the Knights Templar. He was the firs t English head of state to be a freemason. The Knights Templar that remained in France pretending to be Christians. The Knights Hospitaller of St. John (now known as the Knights of Malta) accepted the remnants of the abolished, like- minded and pseudo-Christian Knights Templar in 1312. Bearing in mind the plans of the Knights Templar to take control of the craft guilds, the members of the Order of Hospitaller St. John impudently enough began to call themselves 'freemasons' in 1440. The Knights of Malta grew out of this section of the Order of the Knights Templar. On 9 January 1599, some Knights Templar founded the lodge Atkinson Have in Scotland. On July 31 of the same year, another lodge was founded in Edinburgh. Th e fact, that a large number of Knights Templar fled to Scotland is confirmed by James Steven Curl in his book \"The Art and Architecture of Freemasonry\" (London, 1991, p. 46). It is also evident (p p. 48-50) that these Templars in 1714 erected obelisks at Mount Stua rt, Leven and Tongue, in Suther- land in the northernmost part of Scotland. The infiltration of the lodges of the operative freemasons thus began relatively early. In the be ginning of the 1540s, English craft guilds began for economic reasons to accept \"passive\" members that lacked a builder's background, such as bankers, merchants, land- owners, magicians and scientists. These people greatly desired to belong to a masonic lodge despite th e fact that they lacked a work- man's background. They wished to exploit some of the freemasons' secrets. In this manner, an exce llent opportunity presented itself to certain dark political forces that wished to utilise a well-functioning international network. The first documented eviden ce of this un- natural expansion of the lodges stems from 1598. 64"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"At the beginning of the 17th centu ry, when the nu mber and im- portance of the masons grew notably, most of the lodges were already accepting \"honorary member s\" who were not stone masons, in order to collect their membership fees. These newcomers were crafty political specul ators and cam ouflaged Knight s Templar who had waited for the chance to in filtrate the perfectly functioning system of freemasonry to hide their true nature. Passive masons were called accepted masons or speculative masons. For this reason, all modern freemasons are accepted masons. The passive members of many guilds were required to pay an exorbitant membership fee, which meant that only very wealthy individuals could afford to be accepted into a masonic lodge. In ad dition, they were required to pay for the acceptance banquet. To be accepted into a lodge, two sponsors that were active masons were required. The proposed memb er had to be a male of inde- pendent means, at least 24 year s of age and who had undergone higher education. The son of a ma ster mason could, however, be accepted at 18 years of age. Other exceptions were not uncommon, if money entered the picture. These regulations were later kept by the political freemasons. Today there are also women freemas ons, although there are none in Scandinavia. One of those who became an accep ted freemason was the philo- sopher and politician Francis Bacon (1561-1626). He was a member of the Rosicrucian Order and belonged to a secret society called the Order of the Helmet (Christopher Kn ight, Robert Loma s, \"The Second Messiah: Templars, the Turin Shroud & The Great Secret of Free- masonry\", London, 1998, p. 292). Bacon's fable \"The New Atlantis\" describes the New World where power is wielded by a secret soci ety called Solomon's House, which consists of a privileged elite and ac ts as a hidden government. This society decides exactly ho w much and what the public is to know. Bacon proposed an invisible government, which would also control science. The freemasons seem to appreciate this book. 65"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Francis Bacon was supposedly the illegitimate son of Queen Eliza- beth and her lover Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Francis Bacon who was highly educated, well-read and had travelled a great deal, must also be regarded as the true author of the illiterate William Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. Th is has been shown through secret codes, which Bacon used in all his works, including, those published under the name of William Shakesp eare, as described in the works of the freemason Manly P. Hall. In 1641, the chemist, mathematician and General Robert Moray be- came a freemason in the Edenroth Lodge in Newcas tle. He was the first well-known scholar to be accept ed as a member of a craft guild, according to the remaining document ation. The alchem ist, astrologer and occultist Elias Ashmole became a freemason in Wa rrington on 16 October 1646, as did the cabbalist Robert Boyle (1627-1691), who performed research in chemistry and physics. Elias Ashmole belonged to the Association of Astrologers. Many members of this association became freemasons. Robert Boyle was grand master of the secret Prieure de Sion between 1654 and 1691. Sir Christopher Wren (1632- 1723), the astronomer and architect, who designed St. Paul's Cathe- dral and drew the plans for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666, was initiated into Lodg e Original No. 1 in London on 18 May 1691 (Bernard E. Jones, \"Fr eemasons' Guide and Compendium\", London, 1950, p. 111). He became the last grand master from the ranks of active freemasons that act ually were builders and craftsmen. The aforementioned individuals fo unded The Invisible College on 28 November 1660. The Royal Society of London grew out of this movement in 1662. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was named their \"patron saint\". Christopher Wren became president of the Royal Society in 1680. Isaac Newton (1642-1727), who was greatly inte- rested in astrology and alchemy, became a freemason in 1672 despite the fact that he was not a builde r but was instead regarded as a scientist, and in 1703 was elected pr esident of the Royal Society. The most important reason was that he was grand master of the Prieure de Sion (1691-1727), which did everything in its power to infiltrate 66"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the masonic lodges and exploit them for political reasons. Robert Boyle had earlier also been grand master of the Prieure de Sion. Among the founders of this societ y was John Byrom, who belonged to the Cabbala Club, also known as the Sun Club. All these masonic gentlemen bega n to manipulate science. They wanted to create a new, material istic or \"humanist\" science that denied the existence of the soul. This masonic tradition is carried on today by so called humanistic organizations. These deny the exis- tence of God, claim that the univer se originated by itself and that death constitutes the definitive end of experience. Isaac Newton's \"Philosophiaea naturalis principia mathematica\" (1687) was a disgraceful attempt to undermine traditional science. Newton proved himself to be the enemy of science. To him, the universe was dead matter in which substance in the form of solid spheres raced about without aim or significance. A malicious political network stood behind Newton. The tr ue Rosicrucian Gottfried Wil- helm Leibniz (1646-1716). authored a document to counter Newton's \"Principia\", which he called \"A Treatise on the Causes of the Move- ments of the Planets\" . Leibniz understood that the universe by nature is negentropic (self-developi ng). This all-embracing tendency forms all physical laws. Leibniz refu sed to believe th at chance could explain the occurrence or the non-occ urrence of an event. He proved that space was relative and not absolute. Leibniz claimed that the planetary orbit must follow the dy namics of flow, which prove that whirling motions must occur, since all planets are on the same orbital level and turn in the same direc tion. If this was not the case, the whole planetary system would collapse. Robert Hooke corrected Newton's basic errors. Newton had believed that a body falling through the Earth to its centre would describe a whirling motion and not an elliptical trajectory. Newton's \"Principia\" was completely re-written by Robert Coats, who was assigned to correct the hundreds of mistakes that filled the first edition. This showed that Newton was completely lost when dealing with science, according to Carol White, editor of the American scientific magazine 67"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Fusion. But Newton is still praised as a great scientist. Even his main defender, C. Truesdale, was forced to admit in 1960 that \"Newton's flow theories are, however, largely erroneous\". In 1619, the London Mason's Company founded a parallel lodge for accepted masons called The Acception. These were men who had no knowledge of stonemasonry, but we re happy to pay double entrance fee in order eventually to take over the organization, which was a perfect cover for their criminal activities and also served well in their efforts to ideologically poison the surroundings. In 1670, the infiltration had reach ed the point wher e only 10 of the 49 members of the Aberdeen l odge were operative (active) ma- sons (Martin Short, \"Inside the Brotherhood\", London, 1997, p. 49). The accepted masons had effectively forced out the true free- masons. The fateful conversion of the freemasons from a craftsmen's guild to a powerful organization of social conspiracy had begun. In 1703, the lodges bega n to officially accept non-masons. As early as 1714, the accepted masons founded their own Grand Lodge of York in England. False Rosicrucians he lped to take over the masonic lodges. Political impostors from the hibernating ranks of the Knights Templar and Jewish occultists managed to infiltrate the freemasons' network to use it for their own shady ends. They began an unpre- cedented reorganization. Scottish lo dges were even given the right to possess arms in 1684. The original organization of the freemasons was completely destroyed and conv erted into an effective conspi- ratorial movement in which the Kn ights Templar used black magic to gain control of the world. Secret Societies Take Ov er the Craftmen's Guilds Secret societies ag itated the Scots to rise against the crown in 1715. The uprising was crushed and the leaders were executed in February 1716. During the summer or autumn of 1716, the freemasons decided 68"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"to found a Grand Lodge in London (Fred L. Pick and G. Norman Knight, \"The Pocket History of Freemasonry\", fourth edition, 1963, pp. 68-69). They wanted to have mo re control over political develop- ments. In February 1717, the foundations were laid for a global organi- zation and an invisible empire. Several well-dressed gentlemen, among them Jean Theophile Desaguliers, professor of law at Oxford University and James Anderson, a protestant minister and the Prince of Wales' court priest, met in The Apple Tree Tavern to discuss a merger of four lodges into one grand lodge (Karl Milton Hartveit, \"De skjulte br0dre\" / \"The Hidden Brothers\", Oslo, 1993, p. 70). Modern conspiratorial freemasonry began in Westminster in central London on 24 June 1717, when the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) was created by the merger of four smaller lodges. June 24 is the holy day of John the Baptist. This took place at The Goose and Gridiron, in the garden by St. Paul's Cathedral. London thereafter became the headquarters of a secret power, which grew ever faster. Manipulating freemasonry had begun its advance. The Grand Lodge in London became the Mother Lodge of the world. Many masonic brothers were also members of the Hellfire Club, where Satan was worshipped and rites of black magic and homo- sexuality were performed (for exampl e David's love for Jonathan, see II Samuel 1:26). The brothers sought exclusive erotic experiences. Naturally, freemasonry was affected by this. Sir John Wharton foun- ded the Hellfire Club in 1719. He was chairman of the club, which met in The Greyhound Pub, near St. James' Park in London. In 1721, the authorities closed this infamous club for a short period. John Wharton was later grand master of the Grand Lodge of England from 1722 to 1723. The most famous members of the Hellfire Club were Sir Francis Dashwood, John Dee, and Benjamin Franklin (a member 1724- 1726), before returning to America, where he became grand master of the freemasons in Pennsylvania. The secret Hellfire Club was reopened at the estate of Medmenham in 1755 under the name the Monks of Medmenham (they met in the 69"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ruins of Medmenham Abbey). The mo tto by Francois Rabelais above the door read in French: \"Fay ce que voudras\" (Do as you please!) Ritual orgies and sexual perversions of various kinds upon children and lower-class women who had come in to the clutches of the aristo- cratic freemasons were practised within this organization, which existed for over 50 years. Dashwood, one of the founders of the Hellfire Club, was chancellor of the exchequer and a friend of Franklin's. Franklin was also grand master of the French lodge The Ni ne Sisters. The Lodges San Juan, The Nine Sisters (the Grand Orient ), Amis Reunis and the Illuminati brought about a coup d'etat in France in July 1789. The Illuminati groups the Jacobins and the Frankist s were also involved in the French Revolution. In 1723, there were already 52 l odges in London, and at the end of the 1720s, 115 lodges had been established there. The freemasons claim that the order only had a sym bolic content from then on. The geomantic principles were lost. Only the history and symbolism remained from the time of the stone masons. Everything was rep- laced by pseudo-science and philosophies that represent a threat to nature and to humanity. The public was initially misled by the election of the builder Ant hony Sayer as grand master. Fairly soon the builders were excluded entirely. The old guilds ceased to exist. A system of corporate freemasonry was set up in their stead. The next Gr and Master was Jean Theophile Desaguliers, who was appointed to the post in 1719. During the next years a new grand master was elected each year. The new accepted freemasons were not gifted men capable of creating anything lasting. For this reason only one field of activity remained open to them - that of destruction. The freemasons have effectively destroyed everything beautiful and pleasant in their way, including harmonious architecture. They have started revolutions, wars and other calamities. They have prevented the spiritual develop- ment of humanity. And they have also managed to destroy the true history of freemasonry before 24 June 1717, in order to make it a 70"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"more effective disguise. The freemasons Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas admitted that the masonic leadership keeps many sec- rets even from ordinary freemasons (\"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, p. 90). On 24 June 1945, the Soviet leaders arranged the victory parade of the Red Army in the Red Square in Moscow, precisely 228 years after the founding of the masonic mother lodge in London. This was no coincidence, according to masonic sources. Thus, in 1717 the secret societies became partially visible. In 1723 a new constitution was adopted, written by the theologian James Anderson and the lawyer Jean The ophile Desaguliers. This consti- tution is largely the basis for all modern freemasonry, which seeks to transform society, especially the most important part of the consti- tution \"The Ancient Charges\". Geomantic architecture ceased to be the aim of freemasonry, even officially. The order was then nearly completely infiltrated by de- structive forces, which claimed th at freemasonry sought to promote mankind's development of spiritual consciousness. They stated that they wished to develop their spirituality and at the same time build a better world for humanity. The ai m of freemasonry became to trans- form the entire world according to the freemasons' magic perspective. It is clear from the history of political freemasonry that they have only managed to make the world a much worse place to live in. Already during the second half of the 18th century, freemasonry had become an international power that affected the politics and ideology of various countries (\"The Estonian Encyclopaedia\", Tallinn, 1998, Vol. 10, p. 125). This revolutionary organization builds its activity upon destructive myths and a hotchpotch of ideas that stem from Egyptian (black) magic, Sufi mysticism, Jewish cabbala and the continued conspiracy and rites of the Knights Templar. The most important prototype for the structure of political freemasonry is a negative version of the system and rites, which the Malamati Sufi Order were based upon (Idries Shah, \"Sufis\", Moscow, 1999, p. 439). 71"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Malamati means 'those who should be blamed'. Members of this religious movement consciously perfo rmed acts, which were generally repudiated by the public. They sought to become outcasts to prove that the opinion of the people had no lasting value. In this manner, negative qualities such as conceit and self-importance were lost through training. A Sufi master coul d gain knowledge of the past and the future of mankind and could move to the left and right in time, something which we cannot even imagine. The scheming freemasons distorted the contents of the Sufist Malamati Order's spiritual rites a nd created an unnatural and per- verted system of their own. 'Pervertus' in Latin means 'turned away'. Freemasons did not have to belong to a certain religion. They could have any religion they wished or preferably none at all. The well- known atheist Voltaire was accepted into a lodge in London in the 1720s. Modern freemasonr y propagates a lack of spirituality and its philosophy is soulless materialism (Robert Lomas, \"Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Scie nce\", Glouscester, 2003). These world-improvers have not achieved any positive results, their efforts are based on cunning and deception. The members must unconditionally obey the orders of the master. This chain of com- mand was taken directly from the original lodges. Thus political freemasonry was born in 1717 in England. The mother lodge of freemasonry is situat ed in Covent Garden in London. When I first visited the Freemason s' Hall there on 17 August 1998, I saw the freemasons' Latin motto for their power over the world above the main entrance: \"AVDI, VIDE, TACE \" / \"Hearken, gain insight, be tacit.\" This means that the brothers who obey and remain silent about the secret plans of the grand masters gain insight into what is really happening in the world. Another in scription, now in Hebrew, above the main entrance reveals the id eological prototype: \"Kadosh le Adonai\" (\"Holy for Yahweh\"). This text was originally written on the mitre of the Chief Rabbi. In the Torah, this mitre is called 'nezer ha-kodesch', which means 'The 72"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Holy Crown'. The cabbalist numerological value of this phrase is 666. Nezer (diadem or crown) has the value 257 and ha-kodesch (holy) has the value 409 (257 + 409 = 666). The word 'cabbala' means 'tradition ' in Hebrew. The cabbala is an extremely complicated, secretive and shadowy doctrine depicting how all things are parts of an orga nized whole. There are connections between all things. According to the cabbala, there are secret laws governing the universe and hidden connections between things that do not seem to belong together; numbers and letters are significant keys to the pattern of the universe. The Freemasons' Hall on Great Queen Street in Covent Garden in London is the central meeting place for the 8600 masonic lodges in the UK. In- side there are around 20 temples toge ther with the Grand Temple, with mosaic ceiling, stained glass windows and carved doors. Photo: Juri Lina 73"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The cabbala originated from the fact that the Israelites had no system of numerical positions and no sign for zero. Advanced mathe- matics offered insurmou ntable difficulties. A ddition and subtraction worked fine, but multiplication, division and using fractions became impossible. The Israelites therefore used numbers in magical and religious circumstances, rather than to solve practical problems. They became adept at numerology and gematria. Words were associated with different numbers to simplify prophecy. Worldly science was for- bidden along with certain foods, including pork. The ancient principle of gematria states that each letter also stands for a number. The numerical value of a word is equivalent to a geometrical measure such a line, a surface, or as space. The cabbalists on the other hand in terpret the number as another word or phrase, which reveals the hidden meaning of the original word. The 13th century cabbalist Abraham Abulaphia was convinced that the cabbala was a very effective magical tool and warned against it. The freemasons Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas admitted that every grand master is a priest of Yahweh (\"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, p. 290). Today the freemasons claim that fr eemasonry was founded by King Solomon, who was the first grand master. It is true, however, that the modern masonic lodges are connect ed to the Order of the Knights Templar. In the year 2000, the freemasons had a large celebration since, according to their cabbalis t conception of things, freemasonry then had its 6000th anniversary. Ther e is no proof of this assumption in the original texts of the freemasons. As he rises through the ranks, th e freemason is informed of the code word Mac Benac (M. B.), which means, \"the flesh has fallen off the bones\". This was uttered when the body of the builder Hiram Abiff was dug up. He was also regarded as a son of the widow. An important legend within free masonry concerns this Hiram Abiff, the builder of King Solomon' s temple. Abiff, called Huram Abiff in II Chronicles, was murdered by his apprentices and cemented into 74"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the temple wall. He is still praised and some masonic sources are having a lively discussion about wh ether Hiram Abiff actually was Jesus Christ. The murder of Hiram is re-enacted at the initiation into the third degree. Apparently murder does not constitute murder to the freemasons, but a shedding of ol d conceptions of the world and rebirth on a higher level. Archaeologists have found no evidence of Hiram at their exca- vation sites and the many versions of the story do not correspond to each other. The coast was clear for political adventurers whose goal was in- visible power over the world. The most important demand of free- masonry eventually became strict observance, beca use otherwise it would be impossible to bring about a revolution. Above all the French and Italian freemasons began to use the organization as a cover for their political activity. Political messages were concealed by cryptic terminology. The first lodge (St. Thomas) in France was founded in 1725, in 1726 freemasonry appeared in Aust ria, 1728 in Spain (Madrid), 1733 in Italy (the first grand lodge was founded in 1750), 1735 in Sweden, 1736 in Switzerland, 1737 in Germany, 1739 in Poland, 1740 in Russia. At the end of the 1730s there were also lodges in Belgium. The first lodge in Denmark was founded in 1745 and the first in Norway in 1749. Freemasonry reached India in 173 0, when the first lodge was founded in Calcutta; China in 1767 and Australia in 1863. The Knights Templar reappeared in France in 1743 and many new members were accepted. Their activities began to increase in 1754. Freemasonry spread with incredible speed. Ten years after the first lodge in Paris was founded, there were five lodges in that city, and in 1742 there were 22 registered lodges. In July 1789, just before the masonic coup d'etat in France, there were 100 000 freemasons in the country. Among these were supporters of the king and the political establishment during the coup.

Bu t they had not reached the higher degrees and had no idea about the true nature of the order. The reality behind the scenes reveal s itself to be completely diffe- rent as one rises through the degr ees. In Christian countries, free- masonry is portrayed as Christian, but in Islamic c ountries it wears a Muslim face. In reality, the order worships an other being, the Great Architect of the Universe, Jahbulon, whose nature bears a strong resemblance to that of Lucifer. The freemasons are compelled to believe in TGATU (the Great Architect of the Universe). According to the freemasons, Jahbulon is the Cr eative Being. The Thrice Grand Master Builder, the Nameless Spirit with a Hundred Names. In 1724, the Old Lodge of York na med itself a grand lodge, next year declared to be 'The Grand Lodge of All England held at York'. It became dormant in 1740, was revi ved in 1761 and di sappeared 1792. The Supreme Council of the British freemasons was established in 1819. 16 princes were members of the English order between 1737 and 1907. Four of thes e later became kings. In the middle of the 18th century , the Scottish freemasons intro- duced one or several rounds of golf before the lodge meetings and the lodge banquets, so that they co uld exercise themselves in magic figures. This was when the magically charged rules of the game were written. The notion of club life came into being and the number of golfers rose from 500 to 5000. Today golf is regarded as the most important game within freemasonry. The freemasons have been allowed to spread over the world with hardly any resistance and they have managed to build an ingenious organization. Outsiders have absolute ly no clue to what really goes on. Oaths and death rituals bind the members together. It is an extremely powerful networ k of decision-makers, moulders of opinion, politicians, businessmen, economists, bishops, famous authors, and others. Its purposes, goals, rituals and beliefs have been concealed from the public, which has been deceived by ostensibly respectable behaviour, polished public ideals, charity and general religiousness. 76"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The masonic movement seemed like an innocuous Christian asso- ciation from the outside. In reality it remained a subversive conspi- racy movement under Jewish leadership, which kept its goals, cere- monies and the old guilds' secret signs, rituals, blind obedience to authority and a terrifying oath. In 1780, two completely Jewish lodges were founded in Frankfurt am Main (Friedrich Wichtl, \"Welt freimaurerei, Weltrevolution, Welt- republik\", Wobbenbiill, 1981, p. 82 ). The French masonic periodical Akacia then began to call for: \"N ot one lodge without Jews!\" The extremist Jews were involve d in shaping modern freemasonry in England as early as the beginning of the 18th century (Jacob Katz, \"Jews and Freemasons in Europe 1723-1939\", Cambridge, Mass. 1970). The first reference to a Jewish freem ason, Daniel Delvalle, a master of the Cheapside lodge in London, dates from 1732. The same year a Jew, Edward Rose, became a maso n in London. The Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Sir Israel Brodie, was a high-ranking freemason (John Hamill, Robert Gilbert, \"Freemasonry: A Celebr ation of the Craft\", London, 1998, p. 86). Later significant numbers of Jews joined English freemasonry, where they were welcomed. Many believe that freemasons seek to live in peace with us and that only the preconceptions of ot hers make this impossible for them. But the nature of freemasonr y is not human. The freemasons desire to be something different from us. They hate to associate with non-masons. Those Jews that are not members of masonic lodges and do not wish to aid the destructive activities of the masonic Jews, can meet an even worse fate. They ar e regarded as renegades. The high- ranking freemason destroys everything good and has a surprising amount of sympathy for the lowest forms of humanity and criminals. The cruel and unusual crimes of the communists and socialists often receive the \"understanding\", if not the outright praise of the media under the control of the freemasons. 77"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Development of the Masonic System In the beginning there were onl y two degrees, apprentices and journeymen, that elected a master of the chair, which later became a third degree. Only in 1725 did the title of \"master\" come into use within political freemasonry. The Grand Lodge was called the Lodge of St. John in honour of the stonemasons' patron saint, John the Baptist. The founding of freemasonry is celebrated on 24 June each year. Since 1725 cabbalists have been allowed to join various masonic lodges in England. When the cabba list extremist Jews gained ad- mittance to the lodges, they soon took over many of the highest positions within freemasonry. A fourth degree was introduced in Scotland. The few degrees in the lodges of St. John were not enough to be of any use to the forces that wanted to exploit freemasonry politically. It was not possible to make useful tools of the brothers with so few degrees and for this reason a new system with more degr ees was introduced in France, the system of St. Andrew. These highe r degrees were named after St. Andrew, the first disciple of John the Baptist. The St. Andrew deg- rees were permeated by the heretical doctrines of the Illuminati. The St. John brothers had a lower rank th an the brothers of St. Andrew. Charles Radclyffe founded the French-Scottish system in Paris in 1725 in order to create a more ef fective political conspiracy. Rad- clyffe became grand master of the lodge of St. Thomas and one year later he was the leader of all freemasonry in France. In 1727 he was chosen grand master of the Prieure de Sion. In 1754, the descendants of the Merovingians, who through the leadership of Charles de Lorraine controlled freemasonry in France, laid the foundation for the Scottish system of degrees. This system had 25 degrees, and soon gained eight more. The French-Scottish system thereby contains 33 degrees divided into seven classes. There supposedly was a staircase with 33 steps in the Temple of Solomon. This is the reason why the masonic pyramid on the American one- 78"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"dollar bill is built of 33 stones. This is the most widely spread system in the world today. The Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of France was the poet Michael Andrew Ramsay, who came from Scotland. Ramsay admitted the following to newly initiated freemasons in Paris on 21 March 1737: \"The whole world is nothing but a great republic, of which each nation forms a family and each indivi dual a child. The Masonic Order is an association of those who have unde rstood this truth and seek to make it real.\" (Harry Lenhammar, \"Med murslev och svard\" / \"With Trowel and Sword\", Delsbo, 1985, pp. 45-46) Ramsay claimed that the Knights Templar had been guided by the same ideals and had joined forces to realize it. He believed that the Scottish system descended from the Order of the Knights Templar. That is why he re-created the same system where the secret password came from the passwords of the watch guard in military camps. This system became known as the Scottish Rite with 33 degrees. He explained all this in his book \"Oration\" (1737). The aforementioned lecture became as crucial to freemasonry as Anderson's Constitution. Ramsay's alias within freemasonry was Chevalier. He was a close friend of Isaac Newton and Jean Theophile Desaguliers. Maximilien Robespierre' s father belonged to the lodge Ramsey founded. Ramsay was execut ed in Great Britain in 1746 for taking part in a rebellion in the interest of the masonic Stuart family. The system was further developed primarily by the Jewish leaders, among them Estienne (Stephe n) Morin. He became the leader of all the orders and in 1761 was given the assignment of spreading freemasonry throughout America, wh ere he made public appearances as a Huguenot. Morin was a freemason of the highest degree. He introduced his new system of freemasonry into the American colonies on 27 August 1761. On 31 May 1801, Morin founded the Supreme Council together with John Mitchell, Abraham Alexander, Israel Mitchell, Emmanuel de la Motta and other high-ranking masonic Jews within the Scottish Rite 79"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"in Charleston, South Carolina (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, p. 85). The Supreme Council of the 33rd Degree became the magic headquarters of the freemasons. Charleston is located on the 33rd parallel, a matter of great im- portance to the freemasons, and this council is considered to be the mother Supreme Council of all masonic lodges in the world. In 1875, the Supreme Council moved to closer to the centre of power, Washington, D.C. It has th ereafter been regarded as the Supreme Council of World Freemasonry and has affected every important political event since. The high-ranking Scottish freemaso n John Robison stated that in the step, called the Chevalier du Soleil (Knight of the Sun), it is Reason that has been destroyed an d entombed, and the master of this degree, the Sublime Philosophe, occasions the discovery of the place where the body is hidden (John Robison, \"Proofs of a Conspi- racy\", Belmont, 1967, p. 88). Freem asons learn that lower degrees, which concern morals and the Christian religion, are mere clouds that have now been dissipated by the light of reason. This particular degree in the French freemasonry is the first step of the freemason forwards «enlightenment». Robis on became a freemason in May 1770. Freemasonry became a Jewish-Cabbalist conspiracy, the aim of which was to subjugate the civilised Jewry and to enslave the rest of humanity. In 1869, a Jew was grand master of the Scottish Rite in Paris (Henry W. Coil, \"Coil's Ma sonic Encyclopaedia\", Macoy Pub- lishing, Richmond, Virginia, 1996, p. 260). The Grand Orient admitted Jews without restrictions. Morin's mission was to make all gentile freemasons function as extremist Jews or as their henchmen. In any case, they serve in the interest of Zionism. The masonic leaders appear to follow the doctrine of the Talmud, which states that if there were no Jews, the earth would not be any blessing, neither sunshine nor ra in nor humanity would exist (Jebammoth, fol. 98 a). Pretence is therefore common within free- masonry since this is also condoned by the Talmud. In the same 80"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"collection of teachings, rabbi Bechai states: \"Pretence is permitted as long as the Jew shows politeness to the unclean gentile, that he shows the gentile respect and says to him: I love you.\" But rabbi Bechai explains that this rule applies, only if the Jew needs the gentile or if there is reason to believe that the gentile could harm him. In all other cases, this (showing respect for a gentile) becomes a sin (Gittin, fol. 61 a). British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli spoke in 1852 to the House of Commons, referring to the events of 1848: \"The natural equality of men and the abolition of property are proclaimed by the secret societies, which form the pr ovisional governments; and men of the Jewish race are at the head of each of them.\" The rabbi Isaac Wise (1819-1900), chai rman of B'nai B'rith's sub- organization in Cincinnati, Ohio, explained that \"freemasonry is a Jewish establishment, whose history, grades, official appointments, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from beginning to end\" ( Israelite of America, 3 August 1866). He also stated: \"Freemasonry is the executive political organ of the Jewish financial elite.\" He meant that freemasonry is the political action group of the extremist Jews. The Jewish Tribune (New York) wrote on 28 October 1927: \"Masonry is based on Judaism. Eliminate the teachings of Judaism from the Masonic Ritual and what is left?\" The Jewish Guardian admitted openly on 12 April 1922: \"Free- masonry is born out of Israel.\" The following could be read in the French masonic magazine Le Symbolisme (July 1928): \"The most important duty of freemasonry must be to glorify the Jews, which has preserved the unchanged divine stan- dard of wisdom.\" The high-ranking freemason Dr Rudolp h Klein stated: \"Our rite is Jewish from beginning to end, the public should conclude from this that we have actual connections with Jewry.\" (Latomia, No. 7-8, 1928) A speech at the B'nai B'rith convention in Paris, published shortly afterwards in The Catholic Gazette (London) in February 1936 and in 81"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Le reveil du peuple (Paris) a little later, stated: \"We have founded many secret associations, which all work for our purpose, under our or- ders and our direction.

Ye t it remains our secret that those Gentiles who betray their own and most precious interests, by joining us in our plot, should never know that those associations are of our creation, and that they serve our purpose... One of the many triumphs of our freemasonry is that those Gentiles who become members of our Lodges, should never suspect that we are using them to build their own jails, upon whose terraces we shall erect the throne of our Universal King of the Jews; and should never know that we are commanding them to forge the chains of their own servility to our future King of the World...\" The honorary president of the B'nai B'rith Lodge, the rabbi Dr Leo Baeck, at the inauguration of the district Grand Lodge Kontinental Europa XIX in Basel on 14 September 1955, said: \"The mission of the lodges in Europe is to be the conscience of the Jews and to make sure that the conscience of the Jews does not wither away in the various countries.\" ( Judische Allgemeine Zeitung, 27 January 1956) The Zionist leader Theodor Herzl wrote in his \"Tagebucher\" (p. 92): \"In the present nations, freemasonry is only of benefit to the Jews, but it shall be abolished later.\" \"Each Lodge is and must be a symbol of the Jewish Temple; each Master of the Chair, a representativ e of the Jewish king; and every Mason a personification of the Jewish workman.\" (\"An Encyclopaedia of European Freemasonry\", Philadelphia, 1906) The rabbi Georg Salomon in Hamburg asked the following illumi- nating question in his booklet \"Voices from the East\": \"Why is there no trace of the Christian Church in the entire ritual of freemasonry? Why is the name of Christ not mentioned once, either in the oath or in the prayer, which is uttered at the opening of a new lodge or at the district lodge? Why do the freemasons not count time from the birth of Christ, but instead, like the Jews, from the Creation?\" (pp. 106-107). 82"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"This is also the reason why cabbalist names are used in the degrees of the various systems of freema sonry: Commander of the Lighting Triangle, Doctor of the Holy Fire, Prince of Jerusale m (16th degree), Knight of Rose Croix (18th), Gra nd Pontiff (19th), Knight Commander of the Temple (27th), Scottish Kni ght of Saint Andrew (29th), Grand Knight Elect of Kadosh (30th). The latter degree is also called Knights of the Black and White Eagle. The members of this degree must aim dagger thrusts at a royal crown. They shall ceaselessly avenge the death of Grand Master Jacques de Molay on 18 March 1314 in Paris. Remember this date! This is why freemasons of the 30 th degree are called The Avengers. Thirteen candles are used upon init iation into this degree. At the initiation ceremony, the following colours are used: black, white, blue and red. Albert Pike believed that the 30th degree was the mo st important, since this is when the active str uggle against other beliefs and other religions begins. At this point the members are taught the cabbala, which is supposedly the key to the temple. This is also when the members begin to work activel y with the magic of Osiris. Every year, freemasons of the hi ghest degrees \"kill\" a doll that wears 14th century clothes and symb olizes Philip the Fair. Either the head is cut off (red wine runs down to symbolize his blood) or the whole doll is burned. Pope Clement V is also \"killed\" each year. The Knights of Kadosh must then trample on the royal crown and the pope's tiara. This form of magic was practised already in ancient Egypt. The Harris papyrus describes how Hui, the pharaoh's cattle handler crea- ted wax effigies, which were later smuggled into the palace. The dolls symbolized the pharaoh and his family and were to be placed near a fire, so that they melted slowly while the pharaoh suffered and died. The plot was discovered, however , and Hui and the other conspi- rators were sentenced to commit su icide, one of Egypt's harshest penalties (Lewis Spence, \"Myths and Legends of Ancient Egypt\", London, 1915, p. 263). 83"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The names of certain degrees vary in different countries. The 22nd degree is called the Knight Royal Ax e in England, while it is called Furst von Libanon (Prince of Lebanon) in Germany. These 33 degrees are divided into seven categories. The fifth cate- gory, for example, contains the Knight degrees (19, 20, 23, 27, 28 and 29), which stem from th e Order of Knights Templar. The fourth category has two sub sections. The first contains the Israelite degrees (4th and 8th degr ees). The seventh category con- tains only the highest degrees (31-33). Upon achieving the 18th degree, perm ission is required from the masonic elite in orde r to advance further. The few freemasons who reach the 28th degree are suddenly informed that everything they ha ve learned previously was false. Only then will the truth be told. This is done intentionally to test how reliable these freemasons are. They are not permitted to tell the public about their activities. In his novel \"The Glass Bead Game\" (1943), Hermann Hesse de- scribes the nature of man as gener ous and noble when it follows the path of truth. As soon as truth is betrayed, as soon as human nature ceases to honour truth, as soon as it sells out its ideals, it becomes intensely satanic. This is also the case regarding masonic nature. Freemasons have performed many acts of vengeance. The Republic or Commune of Mainz was declared on 18 March 1793 in Germany with the aid of French \"revolutionary\" troops. Thanks to the Prussian Army, this nest of vipers was liqui dated four months later on 23 July 1793. The 18th of March became a special day. It was on this day in 1848 that rebellions were incited in Venice, Milan, and in Stockholm. A revolution took place in Berlin on the same day. The leaders of the revolution in Berlin were all Jewish freemasons, including Jacob Venedy and Johann Jacoby. This was also true of the other cities. The actions were even set to happen at the same time on this Saturday in Milan, Berlin and Stockholm. 84"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Acts of vengeance were staged once again precisely 23 years later, on 18 March 1871, when the Paris Commune was declared. In the Soviet Union, 18 March was celebrated as the day of the Red Aid. Freemasons murdered Georgios, the king of Greece, on 18 March 1913. The actual basis of freemasonry was a ruthless meritocracy, a class of society, which is only achieved with the help of merits and docu- ments. This implies subversiveness in all static societies based on a traditional hierarchy, according to the American historian James H. Billington. During the early 18th century, lodge meetings were usually held in private chambers in inns or tave rns, where the members gathered around a long table. It became obvious that the new form of freemasonry posed a political threat to traditional order. The lodge meetings in the Netherlands were banned in 1735, since information had come to light that the masonic brothers we re secretly involved in political activity. In 1738, Pope Clement XII banned the activities of the freemasons in all Cathol ic countries, including France and Poland. It was a heinous crime to belong to the freemasons, according to the papal bull In Eminenti. The Empress of Austria, Maria Th eresia, closed all the lodges in 1742, including the one her husband Franz I was a member of. But it was already too late, because freemasonry had by then reached a position where it could no longer be controlled. Its members were too many and they were far too influential. Rich extremist Jews who were members of different lodges and supported their activities had access to enormous funds, which the worldly powers could not ignore. Certain freemasons could not cope with the evil that the rituals bring out and have left the order. An former grand master, also a lea- ding financier in London, gave Mar tin Short this frightening testi- mony, which is recounted in his book \"Inside the Brotherhood: Further Secrets of the Freemasons\" (London, 1990, pp. 124-126): 85"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"\"I became a freemason in 1970, but even as I was through the first degree ritual I had misgivings. It felt odd swearing that horrific oath on the Bible while a sharp compass point was thrust hard against my naked left breast. It felt odder still to be told to seal that oath by kissing the Bible, and then have my face thrust into the compass and square as they lay cradled on its open pages. It was only later that I realized the com- passes and square were arranged in the shape of the vesica piscis and the whole ceremony had sexual overtones. Despite my unease I passed through the three Craft degrees in just three meetings. During the third degree ritual the Deacons laid me on the floor and wrapped me in a shroud: a black sheet with white skulls and crossbones embr oidered on it. They told me to stay as still as if I was dead, until they lifted me to my feet and the Lodge Master applied the Master Mason's grip. As I lay there I suddenly felt the overpowering presence of evil. I had never consciously thought about evil before, let alone felt it, but now my brain was pounding. I felt a piercing pain in my skull, like the worst headache you can ever imagine. Even so, I went through with the cere- mony and became a Master Mason. The stabbing headache kept coming back - not only on Lodge nights but every night for more than ten years. I suffered the worst attacks in my bedroom of all places, so I got into the compulsive habit of laying out a pair of socks in the form of a cr oss on the floor beside my bed before I could get to sleep. I don't know if my wife ever noticed this. I suppose I was trying to repel evil, though I never reasoned it out that way at the time. I attended my Masonic Lodge for seven years, and then resigned. Later I realized this period coincided exactly with the years when I was suffering constant illness: glandular fever, chronic pharyngitis, spon- taneous haemorrhaging and malignant skin cancer. I might have induced these conditions myself. I suppose, but the skin cancer went far beyond most people's psychosomatic powers. But now I was constantly swal- lowing Valium and sleeping pills.

Also a dental injection prevents pain, but this was causing it: so much that sometimes I screamed out in agony. By 1980 I was near to suicide. One Sunday, when I was very low in- deed, I went to my parish church and felt compelled to take Com- munion. When I got to the rail I begged for forgiveness and asked to be fed with the Bread of Life. I don't remember taking the sacraments, but when I got home my family says my face was shining. Several months later I realized, that was the very same day I suddenly stopped taking all those pills. It sounds corny, I know, but I had 'found God'. I became a committed Christian and spoke to groups all over the country but I was still in torment, as I realized during a meeting in Peterborough. The Chairman volunteered me to pray for any people present who were in distress. Someone came forward desperate for help, but I had no experience of this kind of work. I tried to ext end my arms in support but my elbows were locked rigid. I felt terrible. I got out of the hall as soon as I could. I knew there was something seriously wrong with me, so I prayed for help. I told a friend who introduced me to a Pentecostal minister. He said he felt I was treasuring some things, which, in the eyes of God, formed a spiritual bondage with an illicit past. He did not identify the objects, but he said the source of the evil was in my bedroom: on top of the wardrobe and in the dressing table. These were the exact places where I kept my Masonic regalia and ritual books. When I got home I took them straight round to my vicar. He said the only thing to do was to destroy them, so we threw them on a bonfire. That night I stopped arranging my socks in the shape of a cross! I knew at last the oppressive curse had been broken. Thinking back to the Masonic ceremony when I had first sensed over-powering evil, I realize I may have been particularly susceptible to such feelings. Perhaps I'm psychic whereas most other freemasons - good men, I'm sure - simply don't respond to such vibrations. Whatever the explanation, I would not wish on anyone the distress which that Masonic rigmarole caused me for so many years.\" 87"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Highest Degrees The 31st degree is called Grand In spector Inquisitor.

Only 75 British freemasons are permitted to reach the 33rd and last degree, Inspector General Honorary or Sovereign Grand Commander. The leader of the Knights Templar had based all this knowledge on powerfully charged magic symbols wi thin the higher degrees. Maso- nic directions state: \"Magic is l i k e mathematics, it is precision without error and the absolute science of nature and its laws.\" The Swedish philosopher Henry Lauren cy explained: \" Magic is the mental direction of etheric energies.\" The three highest degrees are reserved for the leaders of the order. The lower degrees are only a faeade fo r the ignorant. This is the rea- son why most ordinary brothers ha ve no idea of how their role is abused. Many have difficulty in un derstanding that freemasonry is a state within the state and poses a serious threat to every society.

The aim was to adopt the degree system of the Knights Templar instead of the English system with only three degrees. Soon after- wards the reformed Scottish system with five degrees appeared. This system met with little success in the German states, however.

In actual fact a secret lodge (later called the Ri te of Swedenborg) was founded in Stockholm as early as 1721. There is also evidence of an even earlier period. The freemasons of today pref er not to discuss this. The mystic Emanuel Swedenborg became a fr eemason himself in Lund in 1706. The Swedish Rite is descended from the lodge at Kilwinning in Scotland. This small town, not far from Glasgow, is regarded as the cradle of Scottish freemasonry. Sparre accepted eight noblemen into his lodge between 1735 and 1738 and five of these later becam e royal councillors (Harry Len- hammar, \"Med murslev och svard\" / \"With Trowel and Sword\", Delsbo, 1985, p. 57). King Frederic I banned all masonic meetings on 21 October 1738; defiance of the law was punishable by death. The king of France had likewise prohibited the activity of the masonic lodges. Frederic I was petitioned a nd he recalled his prohibition in December of the same year. Frederic I later became a freemason himself, but the order made sure th at he was never informed of any deeper secrets. In the 1750s, the under-secretary Carl Fredric Eckleff of the Swedish Foreign Office created a sy stem, which would later become known as the Swedish Rite. The Grand Swedish National Lodge was founded by Eckleff together with 24 other high-ranking masonic brothers, including Fredric von Ste nhagen and Israel Torpadius, on 25 December 1759 in Stockholm. The Swedish Rite is Christian in appearances. In reality it is even more influenced by syncretic mysticism (a combination of different mystical doctrines), Jewish magic and cabbalism, than British freemasonry, according to the Norweg ian historian Sverre Dag Mog- stad. 91"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The freemasons wore a yellow a nd red hat-cordon. It was im- mediately evident who belonged to the order. Duke Carl, Frederic's brother and masonic gra nd master, sent out a directive 1798 sugges- ting a special dress code for freemasons from the eighth degree and upwards. The letter states that \"this uniform, which the king has given his consent to, shall consist of a French frock-coat of dark blue cloth buttoned with a row of gilded buttons with an embossed cross, with a scarlet lining, a folding collar and lapels of the same colour with braiding or white piping, a white waistcoat, straw-yellow breeches, tall riding boots with spurs, a three-corner hat decorated with a red and white cockade and stamen of white feathers, a white leather baldric and a gilded sword\" (Harry Lenhammar, \"Med murslev och svard\" / \"With Trowel a nd Sword\", Delsbo, 1985, p. 81). The intention was that the freemason would be seen as a knight of charity. On 9 March 1803, the police began to follow the activities of all secret societies. But this surveillance did not extend to freemasonry, which was under the protection of the king. In 1818, the new king Charles XIV became the supreme patron of Swedish freemasonry. This information comes from the masonic register of 1826. There were ten degrees in the Swedish system, and two more degrees, which were regarded as secr et. Not long ago, the register also began to list those who had attained the eleventh degree. The 11th degree is called Most Enlightened Brother, Knight Commander of the Red Cross. The three first degrees are called the St. John's degrees or the blue freemasonry. The minimum age is 21 years. The St. Andrew's (Scottish red degrees) encompass the fourth to sixth degrees, and finally there are the chapter degrees from the seventh to eleventh (the eleventh is called the honorary degree, but there is also a secret twelfth degree) . The former Minister of Defence Anders Bjorck is a freema son of the 10th degree. According to the secret 37-page book containing the foundation regulations and ritual descriptions of Svenska Frimurare Orden (the 92"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Swedish Order of Freemasons), you can become an accepted mason of the first degree (Apprentice of St. John) in the following manner: With the point of a sword aimed at his breast, the applicant is lead to the lodge door. After some questio ns, he is admitted to the hall of the first degree with the sword-point at his breast and a blindfold over his eyes. There he swears an oath of silence where he agrees to have his throat cut. The master asks the applicant: \"Are you prepared to give yourself completely and utterly into our hands and be made a freemason according to the laws and practices that we follow...\" The applicant is also asked if he is prepared to accept the faith of the freemasons and to abandon his own. This question is repeated once. The master then explains that the candidate must be \"useful to our purposes\" but above all he must have \"an unswerving sub- mission to our orders\". With a cleverly composed question, the master wishes to know if the initiate is prepared to obey the Masonic Order even when it comes to illegal acts. At the end of the initiation, all the brothers aim their swords at the breast of the applicant after the blindfold is removed. The chairman states that if anyone dares to reveal to the public the rituals, which have been performed, that person will be regarded as an enemy and a traitor. The applicant is given a leather apr on, a pair of white ladies gloves and a sword. The title of the masonic book \"With Trowel and Sword\" / \"Med murslev och svard: Svenska Frimurarorden under 250 ar\" by the freemason and Professor Harry Lenhammar (Delsbo, 1985) proves that the sword has an important role within freemasonry. The ceremonies include astrology, cabbalism and Egyptian magic. Blood rituals are mentioned several times in the ritual handbooks, which are secret and very hard to get hold of. The second degree is called the Fellow Craft degree. At the initiation into the third degree, the following gruesome ceremony is performed. The freemason is led backwards into the lodge room, which contains all kinds of symbols of death. The lights 93"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"are dim. With a human skull by his side, the chairman hits the candi- date three times on the head with a hammer. The candidate is then made to lie down in a coffin and th e lid is put in place. After a while of being \"dead\", a leading freemas on says: \"The corpse has already decomposed, the nails are falling of f from the fingers , but with my and Cleopatra's help, we shall ma ke him come alive again.\" Other freemasons knock on the coffin lid. The ceremony ends with the words: \"It has been completed.\" The coffin symbolizes the Is raelite ark of the covenant. A noose is used during the initiation to the fourth and fifth deg- rees. A rope is placed around the neck of the candidate and tighte- ned four times. This is supposed to help the candida te to become a better human being (!?). So how do you become a better human being? On 24 March 1980, a masonic master called Gibson from Southgate (a suburb of London) and two other freemasons robbed a vehicle containing silver worth of 3.4 million pounds in Barking, Essex, in England. Despite the fact that many policemen were members of Gibson's lodge , none of them seemed to know that Gibson wa s on a list of London's 100 most wanted criminals. In the initiation to the sixth degree, a masked brother leads the candidate to a dark cellar passage, called the Acacia Path and leaves him there. With a lantern in his hand, the candidate has to pass coffins, human skulls, bones and ot her gruesome items, until he finds the sprig of acacia, which officially symbolizes hope. In the seventh degree, the freemason is initiated into the masonic faith, dressed in a white-hooded robe with a red cross on the back. Those who are accepted into the ei ghth degree, are given the free- masons' symbolic ring, which affects the aura of the bearer nega- tively, making it shrink. The code question asked of thos e who have attained the ninth degree is: \"Rabbi, ubi habitas?\" (Rabbi, wher e dost thou live?) The password is: \"Venite visum.\" (Come a nd see.) After this, a battle-cry called baptista is used. 94"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"These sick patterns of behaviour should be a warning to all well- balanced people. According to the Swedish masonic magazine Frimuraren (No. 3, 2000, p. 13), it takes 17 years to reach the 10th degree. The Norwegian researcher of fr eemasonry Sverre Dag Mogstad, claims that there is a secret degree in Norwegian freemasonry called 10:2, in which blood-ri tes (mixing of blood) take place (Tom Lipkin, \"Finns det en hemlig 10:2-grad i fi nlandskt frimureri?\" / \"Is There a Secret 10:2 Degree in Finnish Freemasonry\", Vasabladet, 16 April 1993). The highest degree is occupied by the masonic grand master, who bears the title Wisest Vicarius of Solomon (the wisest among brothers) and Supreme Leader. Beneath the grand master are ten ministers. Brothers of a higher degree must be obeyed. But above this Vicarius is another, secret person, whose name and address is unknown to all but the Wisest Vi carius of Solomon (N. Eggis - actually Sigfrid Nilsson - \"Frimureriet\", Helsingborg, Sweden, 1933, p. 17). So there is yet another secret degree in the Swedish Rite - the thirteenth. The highest-ranking brothers were called 'illuminated' as early as in the 19th century. In September 2001, the Physics Pr ofessor Anders Fahlman (11°) became grand master. The order is lead by the Supreme Council, which includes all of the chief offices as procurator of the grand master, and chancellor of the Order, and also the provincial masters as representatives of the seven secti ons of the country. Provincial Grand Lodge of Finland is referred to as Grand Chapter. Jews who are accepted into the Swedish lodges must be baptised. The Baatska castle in Stockholm was adapted for the purposes of the freemasons in the 1870s. There ar e twelve columns with Corin- thian chapters in two rows outsi de the palace.

If this was the case, they would not be imple- menting five-point program of th e Illuminati.

Duke Carl received the title Duke of Sodermanland after having taken part in the so-called revolution of 1772. The Illuminati Gustaf Bjornram, Gustaf Ulfvenclou, and Carl Bohe- man were responsible for actively co nfusing Prince Charles with their theories of magic. Carl Boheman, the son of a coppersmith from Jon- koping, was the most dangerous of these impostors. He had studied at the University of Lund for a brief period but ran away because of a debt and ended up in Amsterdam where he began to work in a merchant house and was initiated into the freemasonry. Boheman became acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, called Stephens, who belonged to a secret order. Bohe man accompanied Stephens to Lon- don, where he became engaged to the latter's sister. She died before the couple were married, but Boheman was allowed to keep 10 000 pounds, which should have become his in connection with the wedding. In 1794 he turned up in Copenhagen as a rich man and became a Danish citizen (C. Georg Starback, \"Berattelser ur svenska historien\" / \"Tales from Swedish History\", Stockholm, 1880, p. 122). Boheman was married in Sweden and during his visits to his home country he became acquainted with Duke Carl at the time of his regency. Boheman claimed to be a high-ranking freemason, posses- sing a great knowledge of magic. Pr ince Charles had great influence and made Boheman a court secretary. He always received a warm reception from the prince. He was present at all masonic meetings and personally organized several ri tual and secret meetings at the prince's palace. One room in the Royal Palace in Stockholm was con- verted into an Illuminati temple at the beginning of 1803, where meetings of the Order were held under the leadership of Boheman. Boheman made propaganda for the or der. Prince Charles had given him the highest degree within Swed ish freemasonry: Master of the Secret Wisdom. During magic ceremonies before the altar in the Illuminati temple, Boheman used very ominous symbols. 96"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"At this time, King Gustavus IV Adolphus, who had succeeded his father Gustavus III, received info rmation that the Illuminati had set themselves up in his palace. Boheman was revealed as a political agent, who had used the nobility for subversive ends. Boheman was arrested in February 1803 and e xpelled from the realm (0. H. Dumrath, \"Det XIX arhundrade\" / \"The 19 th Century\", part II, Stock- holm, 1900, p. 82). In February 1803, the king ordered the arrest of Carl Boheman. His papers were investigated and his correspondence with Duke Carl von Hessen was confiscated. The trial against Boheman was held behind closed doors. On 18 March 1803, he was expelled to Denmark. The Danish authorities sent him on to Hamburg at the request of the Swedish government. In 1814, Boheman re- turned to Stockholm, where Prince Charles had become King Charles XIII. But he was no longer welcome. He died in poverty in Wandsbeck near Hamburg in April 1831. On Monday, 13 March 1809, a coup d'etat took place at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Gustavus IV was arrested by several high- ranking masonic officers led by Colonel Carl Johan Adlercreutz. The king called for help. The Royal Guard broke down the door, but the conspirators explained that everyt hing was in order. The king then attempted to make his way to the main guard, where a loyal German regiment was stationed. But the conspirators caught up with him and the king was dragged back. He was taken to the palace of Drottning- holm, where he was placed under house arrest. He was deposed on 10 May. The masonic conspirators he lped Prince Carl (his uncle and grand master) to power, and on 6 J une 1809, he was proclaimed the new king (Charles XIII), despite the fact that he was completely senile. Gustavus IV Adolphus wa s expelled from the realm in December 1809. He died in Switzerland on 7 February 1837. Thus the royal line of Vasa came to an end (C. Georg Starback, \"Berattelser ur svenska historien\", Stockholm, 1880, pp. 290-291). Sweden fell upon hard times and th e way was cleared for socialism. During the years 1860-1930 more than 1.4 million Swedes emigrated to America because of poverty and famine. 97"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Jewish Memphis Misraim system was founded in Italy in 1780. Misraim means 'Egypt' in Hebrew. The magic rites of the system descend from Egypt and were revised by 'Count' Alessandro Cagliostro (actually a Sicilian swindler by the name of Giuseppe Balsamo), who concealed his Jewish origin. This sy stem grew out of Cagliostro's ideas of black magic. Cagliostro practised Satanism and conspired against the crown. His system, Krata Repoa, which he created in Bordeaux in 1783, contained 97 degr ees. Cagliostro called himself the Grand Copt (Kophta). In 1776, at the age of 33, he turned up in London. As early as April of the same year, he was init iated into the Esperance Lodge No. 289 in London. Cagliostro was later initiated into the Rosicrucian Order in Malta, the Lodge of Hope in England, The Indissoluble Lodge in Holland, The Perfect Union in Naples, the Temple Order La Stricte Observance, and into Cohen's Chosen in Lyon. Later Cagliostro himself opened lodges in Holland, Germany and Russia (St. Petersburg). He took part in a Masonic Conv ention in Paris on 15 February 1785. The Danish extremist Jew Kolmer, known as Altotas in Italy, was Cagliostro's master and worked hard to popu- larise the magic of Osiris. Kolmer ha d close contact with the leader of the Illuminati Adam Weishaupt in Ingolstadt, Bavaria. Cagliostro joi- ned the Illuminati in 1783 in Frankf urt. He was expelled from France in 1786 in connection with \"the necklace affair\", which was orga- nized by the Illuminati. Cagliostro had ordered a precious diamond necklace in the name of Marie Antoinette to create jealousy among the poor. Before this, he had pred icted that the Bastille would fall three years later. In 1789, Cagliost ro was arrested in Rome for at- tempting to found a new Egyptian masonic lodge, and was senten- ced to death and then life impris onment. He died on 26 August 1795. Cagliostro was also a member of the Knights Templar, whose inten- tion was to build the \"eternal temp le\", according to Albert Pike's statement from 1871. Building a temple came thereafter to mean building a new society, which immediately leads an organization of this kind into politics. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"In 1809, two separate ma gic systems were developed within the Misraim system. This was modernised in France by the extremist Jew Michel Bedarride. In this system, th ere were 99 (95 + 4) degrees. The two systems were united in 1867. The new Egyptian freemasonry took over the 33 degrees of the Scottish system. One of the most famous Grand Masters of Misraim freemasonry was the anthro- posophist Rudolf Steiner, who was in contact with both Lenin and Hitler. He founded the anthroposophic movement in 1912. The Egyptian Rite is strongly influenced by Jewish cabbalists. Certain words, such as Yahweh, were so powerful that they were not to be written down or spoken out al oud. Cagliostro had claimed that the Egyptian Rite could regenera te its members both physically and morally, and finally lead them to perfection. Both men and women were accepted into the Misraim lodges. This was unusual within freemasonry. The Symbols \"Signs and symbols control the worl d, not phrases a nd laws,\" accor- ding to the Chinese philosopher C onfucius (551-479 BC). Thus sym- bols are magic tools to control people. The symbolism of political freemaso nry is based on architectural implements. The desire was to symbolically build a New World (the invisible temple) for non-masons. At the same time, the freemasons used cabbalistic magic and undermined the morals of society. Their own motto began to be spread: Do what you please! (Francois Rabelais, 1494-1553). Those who become freemasons are forced to \"admit\" that they were in darkness before, but that the light is within freemasonry. Freemasons are enlightened just like the Illuminati claim to be. The magic experiences of the freemasons are heightened by the use of secrets and surprises. At the initiation ceremony the candidate is made to stand bare-breasted and blindfolded. The blindfold is 99"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"removed after the initiation and the freemason has then entered into the light. After the blindfold is removed, the following question is asked: \"What do you see?\" The initiate is expected to answer: \"I can see the sun, the moon and the grand master!\" (Platonov, \"The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 2000, Vol. I, p. 529) This implies that the sun shines during the da y and the moon during the night, while the grand master illumina tes the lodge with his advice. The one who is to be initiated also wears a noose around his neck. The brothers thereafter explain that they hold the new brother in place with a firm noose. The noose was also symbolized by the rope, which the Knights Templar had on their capes (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998). The modern necktie (noose) is a masonic symbol that blocks the flow of energy from the throat chakra, which affects our free will. Those Knights Templar who fled to Scotland as early as 1450 performed these ceremonies. A free mason who is initiated is not allowed to have money or metal objects in his pockets during the initiation. This symbolizes that he is accepted into the lodge as a poor man (Bernard E. Jones, \"Fre emasons' Guide and Compendium\", London, 1950, p. 267). The head of the candidate is covered with a bloody cloth. Blood is used as a particularly charged s ubstance and as a channel for more subtle energies in all the more effective forms of black magic. The German freemason Johannes Friedrich Merzdorf stated that the blood of the initiated is spilled into a glass of wine, which is then drunk by the brothers (Bauhutte, yearbook 1879, p. 13). This is a magic form of cannibalism. The red and white banner of the Knights Templar is found among the symbols of many lodges, since they consider themselves to have a spiritual connection to the medi eval Knights Templar. Also the torch of the Knights Templar has b een taken over by the freemasons, as well as magic torchlight processi ons. Torchlight processions have been used by communists, socialists and the national socialists. The symbol of the British Conservative Party is a blue torch. 100"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The newly initiated is made to swear that he will serve the order and keep its secrets under the threat of being killed in a horrible ritual. Ceremonies and oaths such as this bring forth exceedingly negative energies. Freemasons who are accep ted into the lodge must swear the blood- curdling oath, in which the novice promises never to discuss any of the aims or activities of the orde r with outsiders. Neither is he allowed to visit other lodges without permission. In addition to this, he accepts that his throat will be cut, his heart removed, his tongue and entrails torn out and thrown into the sea, his body burned and the ashes spread in the wind, so that nothing of his substance remain among men and master masons, if he tells anyone what he has learned about the plans of th e freemasons. \"I confirm this, my oath, honestly and truthfully, so he lp me God to life and soul.\" (Sverre Dag Mogstad, \"Frimureri - mysterier, fellesskap, personlig- hetsdannelse\" / \"Freemasonry - My steries, Brotherhood, Personal Development\", Oslo, 1994, p. 281). The Finnish freemasons must agree to have their right ear and right hand cut off, if they reveal the secrets of the order (the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti, 8 August 1994, p. 10). This was made public by the journalist Pertti Jotuni, a Finnish freemason who had had enough of the order and left after 23 years. Among the operative masons, the punishment for revealing any of the craft secrets was exclusion from the lodge. They did not murder people and they certainly di d not burn their intestines. Cabbalistic magic is included in the masonic dogma, as well as ancient Egyptian and alchemical doc trines, Babylonian astrology and various magically charged symbols, many of which have been taken from the original freemasons. The most powerful masonic lodges still use cabbalistic magic to control and damage their surroundings more effectively. In London different masonic lodges rent a large Egyptian-style temple in the Great Eastern Hotel on Liverpool Street for their magic rituals. 101"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The compass was the tool of the apprentice, the journeyman used the set-square and the master the hammer. The trowel, set-square, compass, plumb, water level, the ruler measure, chisel and hammer were no longer tools of work as they had been for the builders. In- stead they became magic tools in the bizarre rites designed to achieve political ends. These tools officially symbolize spiritual development and the building of a New World (the Temple of Solo- mon). Now even the name 'freemas on' only has a symbolic meaning. According to the myth there were seven steps leading up to the Temple of Solomon. These steps re present seven virtues in today's freemasonry. One of these virtues is the love of death. The most dangerous aspect of death-worship is a loss of respect for life. In this way the spiritual struggle - the meaning of life, love of nature, art - consideration and the transitory in that case becomes meaningless. He who loses himself in the mystery of death, will reach his goal and thereby damage his soul. His spiritual development will be arrested. Symbolically enough, this specially built staircase in Loyal Lodge No. 251, in Barnstaple, England, leads nowhere. 102"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The compass gave the freemason a frame in his relationship to humanity. It defines the limits of g ood and evil. At the same time it is a symbol of caution. The set-square now symbolized the integrity and morals of the freemason. The plumb functions as a symbol of justice. The water- level symbolizes equality. But these concepts do not exist outside the freemasons' area of activity. Equality only applies within the order. People outside the organization ar e called 'dogs', according to \"Dun- can's Masonic Ritual and Monitor\" (p . 13) by Malcolm C. Duncan. Offi- cially they are termed 'profanes'. This illusion of superiority comes from Judaism. Rabbi Moses ben Nachman, rabbi Raschi, rabbi Abra- vanel, rabbi Jalkut and others co mpare gentiles sometimes to dogs, sometimes to donkeys or swine (Commentary on Hosea IV, fol. 230, col. 4). Jesus himself is supposed to have called Jews children and heathens (gentiles) dogs (Matthew 15:26). Only brothers should be favoured and be taken care of. They should be defended even if they are guilty of theft or murder. The master mason's trowel was a symbol of (masonic) brotherly love. It is used to magically forge together different individuals into a brotherhood. \"Higher\" personal accolades stand for greater magic secrets as world-builders. The hammer as the club of the grand master became a symbol of power. It is reminiscent of a phallus. The apron of lamb's skin symbolized the freemason's purity, whatever he did. The apron was used by various Jewish sects (including the Pharisees and the Essenes). The Essenes were given an apron upon initiation, which they used to cover their nakedness and keep their minds from impure thoughts during the sect's many baptisms (Christian D. Ginsburg, \"The Essenes\", London, 1955, p. 41; Baby- lonian Becharoth 30, 6).

The la tter represents the freemason's knowledge. The sword symbolized the avenging law (execution of traitors). The skull and bones symbolized lost truth, the secret pass- word that was lost when the mythi cal master builder Hiram Abiff was murdered. The freemasons have taken over another important symbol from the Temple of Solomon: the two pi llars Jachin and Boaz, which cor- respond to Osiris and Isis (Nigel Pennick, \"Sacred Geometry\", San Francisco, 1980, p. 62). These are re presented by two upright lines in the dollar sign. To the freemasons, the pillar symbolizes the uphol- ding of their \"truth\" and \"justice\". These twin pillars represent Strength and Establishment. Within the Sufi tradition, which the freemasons took over, the pillar stands for 'man' (Idries Shah, \"Sufis\", Moscow, 1999, p. 439). Jacob's ladder and an intact column officially stand for strength and wisdom. The broken pillar, which stands by the altar with the in- scription 'adhuc stat' (still it st ands) and represents the demise of the Knights Templar, has a very sp ecial significance within masonry. According to one of the rituals of the 33 degrees (Royal Arch), the remains of Enoch's Pillar (in thr ee parts) was brought back by the Knights Templar who had found it under Mount Moriah in Jerusalem (Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas, \"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, pp. 282-286). Enoch was the architect of the Great Pyramid. He was first intro- duced to freemasonry as one of the founders of geometry and masonry by the freemason James Anderson in his 1723 Constitutions. Enoch lived 365 years, a sacred number in early history. 104"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The British structural engineer David Davidson, who in 1924 pub- lished his monumental work, \"The Great Pyramid\", mentioned that ancient writers called the Great Pyramid 'The Pillar of Enoch'.

The G stands for the God of the freemasons, Jahbulon. This is a compound of the names of three gods: Yahweh of Israel, Baal of Canaan (or Bel of Babylon) and the Egyptian On (another name for the god of death Osiris ). The last two are also called upon at black magic and Satanist ceremonies. The G officially stands for Geometry. On ly upon attaining a high degree is the freemason informed that the Great Architect of the Universe is called Jahbulon. In the degree called the Holy Royal Arch (13th), the appearance of the masonic god Jahbulon is reveal ed. He has a spider's body and three heads - that of a cat, a toad, and a human head. In this way the father god, the god of the heavens and the god of death were united. In Louis Breton's and J. Collin de Plancy's \"Dictionnaire Infernal\" (Paris, 1863), Jahbulon is shown as the demon Bael. The freemasons worship a horrible monster. 105"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The English researcher Stephen Knight interviewed 57 freemasons who had been \"elevated to the Holy Royal Arch\", that is had as master masons gone through the r ite where they were taught the secret of Jahbulon, god of freemasons. These high-ranking free- masons were happy to answer Kn ight's critical questions until he asked: \"What about Jahbulon?\" Then the situation suddenly became tense. They wanted to change the subject, stop the interview or told embarrassing lies (Stephen Knight, \"The Brotherhood: The Secret World of the freemasons\", London, 1983, pp. 237-240). This is under- standable. Jahbulon is hardly a god, which one openly wishes to admit to worshipping. It is very strange that none of these symbols is used to benefit the development of goodness. One crucia l concept is lacking in free- masonry, that is nobleness. Masonic lodges have a black and white chequered floor, supposedly symbolising the relationship between good and evil (the Manichean system), the all-important struggle between positive and negative (from the freemasons' point of view). Everything that benefits free- masonry is good and all that might di sfavour the order is evil. This kind of floor is a Jewish tradition; Hebrew kings had chequered floors in their throne-rooms and two broken pillars by the throne (Flavius Josephus, \"History of the Jews\"). Such a floor symbolized the righteous power. Among the freem asons, this magically charged pattern activates other kinds of parapsychical experiences. The ban- ner of the Knights Templar also consisted of black and white squares, symbolising the struggle between good and evil, or coming from darkness into the light. Police officers in England (also in Australia and sometimes in the United States) have chequered bands on their caps, which means that the long arm of the law is also controlled by the freemasons. In terms of energy, and also psychologically, this kind of pattern affects people extremely negatively. In his study \"Concepts and Mechanisms of Perceptions\" (L ondon, 1974), Professor Richard L. Gregory refers to psychological te sts made in connection with black 106"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"and white chequered patt erns.

People start to feel sick. The chequered floo r in the Swedish parlia ment (which was then situated in the Cultural Centre) irritated many parliamentarians during the 1970s. The compass and the set-square ar e placed in a particular way on the applicable holy book during masonic cere monies. Usually the freemasons \"Grand Book of Laws\" lies on the altar. It is a source of light to them. Without this book, th ere is darkness in the masonic workshop and they are unable to work. And of course they work according to the plan, which the Gr eat Master Builder has laid out. The masonic compass and set-square formed a vesica piscis (blad- der of fish), which is reminiscent of the female genitalia. Life must be regulated by the water level and the measure. Vesica piscis and a T-cross form a so-called ankh (looped cross) - the sceptre of the god of death, the key to the realm of the dead. These magically char ged symbols connect the freemason to the reality, which the symbol represen ts. The symbols bring out a magic participation, opening the mind to the spiritual reality behind the conveyed idea. This reality can be either good or evil. The symbol can also open the door to spiritual e xperience. Symbols conceal, but speak clearly to those that unde rstand them, to t hose who compre- hend the code. Symbols can be channels of nega tive forces or positive events. Thus it can be danger ous to wear strange symbols without knowing their origin or how they affect the body. The freemasons are con- vinced that their magic symbol s with powerfully charged low frequencies affect the environment. The infl uence is not positive. Obelisks, square upwardly tapering monoliths, were erected in an- cient Egypt 3500 years ago as symbols of the highest divinities, especially the sun. There was ofte n a small pyramid on top of the obelisk, sometimes cove red in gold and silver. There are also 107"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"cylindrical obelisks. Two obelisks were erected at the entrance to a temple. The Babylonians and Assyrian s also erected obelisks. Obelisks were raised over the dead in Euro pe during the Renaissance and after the two world wars. There was a logical network of obelisks across Egypt, because these were placed in a mathematically calculated relationship to the ener- gies of the Earth and the orbit of the sun or moon. They worked as tools to determine the planetary or bits and the passing of time. The Egyptians had a carefully calculated calendar. It was important to the pharaohs to erect giant obelisks, since this was a way to control people's ideas and to bring about static points of view (consensus trance). In this way the obelisks helped the pha- raoh to retain power over the Egyp tian people. The subjects of the pharaoh treated the obelis ks with awe, as befits a symbol of power. The masonic obelisk thus originates in ancient Egypt, where it symbolized the sun god. The obelisk was the primary symbol of the Osiris cult, which stood for male energy - the pha llus. Phallus- worship is an extremely important part of freemasonry (obelisks across the world prove this). Osiris was the most worshipped of Egypt's deities. As king Osiris raised the Egyptians out of their natu- ral state, gave them laws and taught them to cultivate crops. Osiris prohibited cannibalism. He advocated piety, health and well-fare. Isis taught the Egyptians to cultivate grain, flax and silk, and to spin, weave and sew their own clothes. She taught her subjects to use herbs to cure illnesses. Osiris' brother Seth (called Typhon by the Greeks), god of the desert, formed a conspiracy against him together with 72 others. The vulture-like Seth lured Osiris into a coffin, closed the lid over him, nailed it down, sealed it with molten lead and threw it into the Nile. This occurred when the sun was in the sign of Scorpio. Isis later gave birth to a son, Horus, out in the marshes. For this reason the freemasons call themselves 'the children of the widow'. Buto, the goddess of the North, tried to protect the boy, but one day a scorpion stung him. Isis then ask ed Ra, the sun god, for help. The 108"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"god listened to her and sent Thoth to teach her an incantation, which would bring her son back to life. Meanwhile, the coffin containing Osiris' body had floated down the river and into the sea. It eventually ran ashore at Byblos on the coast of Syria. A beautiful tree grew up around the coffin. The king of the land liked the tree and had it made into a pillar, which he placed in his house, but he did not know that the coffin of Osiris was inside the tree. Isis was informed of th is, however. She asked for the pillar and the coffin was extracted. Isis opened it, then laid it aside and went to see her son Horus, who had been brought to Buto's city. Seth found the coffin, recognized the body and tore it into fourteen pieces, which he spread across the lands. Isis sailed back and forth across the marshes in a boat of papyrus and searched for the pieces of Osiris. She buried each piece where she found it. She also buried a picture of him in each city, so that the true grave of Osiris might never be found. But Osiris' genitals had been eaten by fish. In their place, Isis made a picture and this picture was used by the Egyptians at their celebrations. The jackal-headed god Anubis, Isis, Nephtis, Thoth and Horus put together the torn body of the god and brought him back to life, and thereafter he ruled as king of the dead in the other world (Sir James G. Frazer, professor of social anthropology at Cambridge, \"The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion\", London, 1890, reprinted 1981). This is the reason why the freemasons worship the number 13 - the number of parts of Osiris' body that were found. They intend to spiritually cut up humanity in the same manner. The obelisk symbolizes Osiris' phallus, which was lost. Obelisks seem to have been associated with sacrifice from the very beginning, for example by the sun temple of Niusseras in Abu Sir, where an altar was found next to the obelisk itself, with grooves in the stone for the blood of the sacrifices (Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, \"The Pyramids of Ancient Egypt\", London, 1947, p. 134). 109"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"It has been a tradition in many c ountries to sacrifice humans or animals in order to lay them under the foundations of houses and monuments. King Mindon built the royal palace in Mandalay, Burma, in 1857 upon the bones of the dead. More than 50 men and women were sacrificed and buried beneat h the palace. Four were buried beneath the throne. In Galam, what is now Ghana in West Africa, a boy and a girl were buried in the 19th century before the city gates to make it im- penetrable. Foundation sacrifices have also been used in Europe. In 1844 a woman was cemented into the wall in the castle of Nieder-Mander- scheid in Prussia (Bernard E. Jones, \"The Freemasons' Guide and Compendium\", London, 1950). There is a pillar called the Apprentice Pillar in Rosslyn Chapel. According to the legend, an apprentice was walled in alive there. The masonic explanation is simple. Of course, the apprentice died as an apprentice when the work was done, since he was made a master. The cathedral in Gloucester has an apprentice niche, the cathedral in Rouen has an apprentice window. The mosque in Damietta has an apprentice tower (Bernard E. Jones, \"The Freemasons' Guide and Com- pendium\", London, 1950, pp. 303-322). The communists in the Soviet Union inherited the freemasons' magic and obelisk cult. The communists who managed to gain power temporarily in Latvia in 1919 organized a demonstration in Riga on 1 May, where they built a number of obelisks and a pyramid from which the communist leaders looked out upon the masses of people who had been ordered to show up and march among the obelisks. The communists used to erect obelisks over mass-graves. An obelisk was raised in 1960 over the bodies of Estonian and German enemy soldiers in Tallinn, the capital of Soviet-occupied Estonia, in the churchyard of Maarjamae, which was destroyed. In the 19th century, the freemasons began to raise obelisks in ho- nour of Baphomet. The freemasons have always planned their worst crimes for the period when the sun is in the sign of Scorpio. 110"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Naturally they began to use the all-seeing eye, which was sup- posed to represent the god Osiris, the creator. Albert Pike confirms this in \"Morals and Dogma of th e Ancient and Accepted Rite of Scottish Freemasonry\". Th e eye is therefore also called the 'Eye of Osiris'. This is the most important symbol of the freemasons and Illuminati, and it looks li ke the eye of a snake. Within the Rite of St. John, th e foundation of all freemasonry, coffins, skulls and bones are used in different cer emonies. The pur- pose of these symbolic properties is to illuminate the transience of man. The coffin is regarded as a ma gic symbol of rebirth into a new (masonic) life, as if the candidate had been living dead before he entered the lodge and on ly comes to life at his initiation. Thus the freemasons opposition to the world outside, that is all who are uninitiated, is underlined. When a freemason is accepted into the third degree, he must lie in a coffin and take part in a dramatization of death and rebirth. This is why the third degree is called the degree of death. A destructive pact with death is thus formed.

Naturally this sect also uses sk ulls as cult objects. The rites also include drinking blood and the worship of live snakes. The voodoo demon Danbalah is called the Great Architect of the Universe (Milo Giraud, \"Secrets of Vo odoo\", San Francisco 1985, p. 14, p. 17). In the United States voodoo is practised in the regions around Charleston, New Orleans and Galveston. In the Caribbean (Cuba for example) santeria voodoo is practise d, which uses human sacrifice. The most important magic ceremonies and symbols in freemasonry can thus be seen to originate from the most primitive form of black magic - voodoo. Millions of human beings have been sacrificed to the masonic demons. Freemasonry is only a slightly more sophisticated form of voodoo demonism and functions as the magic of the elite. At the same time, the lowest-ranking freemasons are mere zombies under the influence of consensus trance. The modern Witch Movement (Wicca) has a three-degree system and was founded in the 1950s by the freemason Sir Gerald Brusseau Gardner, a disciple of Alister Crowley. Gardner published the maga- zine Witchcraft Today. To experience symbols of death the witch apprentices had to lie in an open grave. Many other rituals also resemble those of the freemasonry. Professor Lars-Erik Bottiger has reached the eleventh degree in Swedish freemasonry (Knight ) and holds the second highest office in the order. He claims that the coffin is also taken out and displayed in Masonic Hall during the masonic ce remony feast on 18 March every year (Nacka-Varmdo-Posten, 11 November 1997, p. 12). This feast is very ancient according to him. Many generations of freemasons have celebrated the order's great feast in memory of the death of Jacques de Molay, grand master of the Knights Templar, in 1314. Bottiger stated \"that stuff about the coffin\" was difficult to explain to people. \"It probably seems quite ghastly whatever you tell them.\" 112"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"During initiation into the 4th de gree, the candidate must pass through the \"walk of death\", a passage full of bones and skulls. The newcomers are not told that it is damaging to be among symbols of death, which are charged with powerful negative energy. The number three plays a central role in modern freemasonry - in handshakes, greetings and symbols. We also see the number three in the magic numbers 12 and 13. Osiris had twelve helpers (12 + 1). Israel consisted of twelve tribes . Twelve star signs make up the zodiac. The EU symbol is a fairy ri ng composed of twelve stars. The figure 13 symbolizes the passage of the moon through the zodiac. Lunar magic is crucial to freemasonry. The Bilderberg group has an ex ecutive committee of 39 members (13 x 3). The numbers 5 and 7 are also important within free- masonry. Naturally, the number 33 plays an important role within free- masonry. By the way, the code numb er of the masonic leader Francis Bacon was 33. The symbol of the grand master is the sun, which symbolizes wisdom. Thus the grand master always sits to the east of the lodge assembly. The most ancient symbol of sun-worship is the triangle set on top of a rectangle. This represents form and space. Three- dimensionally this becomes a pyrami d on top of a column, that is an obelisk. The rectangle represents the freemasons' truth and justice. The eagle originates from the symb ols of the Rothschild family. The eagle was originally a representation of the Phoenix, which according to the legend lives for 50 0 years, whereupon it burns itself to ashes in order to finally resu rrect itself from the ashes and live another 500 years. The two heads of the eagle symbolize good and evil, which counterbalance each othe r. In American freemasonry the Phoenix had 13 feathers on each wing until 1841. The symbol of the eagle was originally taken from the Roman Empire. The double-headed eagle symbolizes Baphomet as an anagram. Upon reading Baphomet backwards, the result is: tem-oph-ab, which can be interpreted as tern = duplex (double), oph = avis (bird), ab = 113"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"generatio (progeny), that is the progeny of the double bird (Margiotta, \"Le culte de la natu re dans la franc-maeonnerie Uni- verselle\" / \"The Cult of Nature in World Freemasonry\", Grenoble, 1897, p. 215). But it can also mean Templi omnium hominum pads abbas (father of the temple of peace of all men). The symbol of the Khazar Jews was the red shield. This was the reason why the banker Mayer Amschel assumed the name of Roth- schild. This symbol also began to play a secret part in the activities of the high-ranking freemasons. Th e banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777-1836) became a member of the Emulation Lodge No. 12 in London on 24 October 1802. Toda y there are also Rothschild lodges. At meetings, the leading freemasons sing hymns to Satan. Only the highest degrees use the cross of Baphomet. Aleister Crowley, who practised black magic, used the cros s of Baphomet in his signature. Baphomet was an evil spirit, a monstrous entity that the medieval Knights Templar worshipped and th at is associated with Lucifer. Several defectors have revealed that the masonic leaders worship Baphomet. Albert Pike called Baphomet \"the primary element of the great work (Freemasonry)\". Two magical messages are wr itten on the monster's arms. Solve on the right arm and Coagula on the left. This means, \"let dissolve and coagulate\". These are the two main principles of alchemy. According to an esoteric interpretation, fr eemasonry seeks to dissolve or de- stroy everything positive in our so ciety and keeps everything nega- tive in order to subjugate humanity. The intention is to prevent the spiritual development of mankind. Another explanation is that the freemasons wish to dissolve the current order and allow the New World Order to magically solidify. The Swedish esoteric philosopher Henry T. Laurency gave an excellent description of the nature of the freemasons in his book \"De vises sten\" / \"The Philosophers' Stone\" (Skovde, 1995, p. 319): \"They seek... to prevent development in all ways possible. They see their real enemies in everyone that strives towards higher aims, who serve the cause of development. According to circumstances, they work to preserve 114"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"dogma or disorienting ideas, revolutions and wars. Everywhere they strive to bring about chaos.\" Laurency called all members of secret societies controlled by the black lodge \"wolves in sheep's clothing\". Passwords and sacred words have been taken from Hebrew. The grand master wears the robe of a rabbi, with symbolic colours. The apron covered with mystic symbols also became a magically charged item of clothing. The masonic leather apron is the apron of the Israelite high priests. The Knights Templar also wore white aprons under their mantles. Many of these masoni c secrets were revealed by an anonymous defector in the book \"Sarsena\". The Old Testament is the basis of the masonic rituals. The Ameri- can masonic cabbalist Albert Pike stated: \"All real masonic lodges owe their secrets and symbols to the Cabbala. Only the Cabbala confirms the union between the common and the heavenly world. It is the key to the present, the past, and the coming.\" As the leader of world freemasonry Pike knew what he was talking about. Masonic rituals include sitting in a dark room, wearing sexually arousing aprons, getting shoved in the back, getting hit on the forehead, being threatened with a sword, lying in a coffin, allowing a noose to be put around one's neck and being hung up. The colour of the lodges of St. John remained blue, while lodges of St. Andrew used red. Black is the se cret colour of the highest degrees (31-33). Some lodges also use green. Freemasons of the lower deg- rees are also called \"Servants of Saint John\". They are simple \"wor- kers\". Red is regarded as the colour of slavery. Political movements created by the freemasons use red in their symbolism and seek to enforce slavery under the control of freemasonry. According to Albert Pike, the five-pointed star symbolizes \"intelli- gence\". This symbol is also connec ted with Sirius, the second closest and the brightest star. Light from Sirius reaches us in nine years. Magically the five-pointed star also stands for bisexuality. 115"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The true meaning of the five-pointed star is: \"We are approaching our goal!\" According to Karl Steinh auser, the pentagram also symbo- lizes the supremacy of freemasonry. The five-pointed star is inter- preted as the union of five points of contact. The red five-pointed star was the talisman of the exec utioner during the Middle Ages (executioners were astrologically un der the influence of Mars). Only an executioner was permitted to wear this symbol. If one is exposed to the red five-pointed star (\"the devil's footprint\"), one's aura immediately shrinks. This can be ve rified with a di vining rod. The five-pointed star is thus the sign of evil and black magic. It was originally a holy symbol of the go lden mean in Sumeria. The black magicians of Chaldea charged the five-pointed with negative energy. On 15 January 2001, Swedish Tele vision (SVT) began using their new logotype. It is a five-pointed red star. Does that mean that they thereby wish to show that they are loyal servants of freemasonry, propagating their red ideologi es still more intensively? After the freemasons Vladimir Lenin, Lev Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, Jakov Sverdlov, Grigori Zinoviev and other conspirators acting as bolshevik leaders had taken power in Russia, they killed millions of people under the red five-pointed star. Masonic leaders have often brought in rabbis to correctly interpret the symbols of freemasonry and cabbalist mysticism in order to initiate the higher-ranking brothers in an elitist religious doctrine. The pelican and the unicorn are secret symbols in freemasonry. Hermes is also often depicted. The Greek Hermes, Mercury to the Romans, was the god of messengers and thieves in classical antiquity. Before the political impostors t ook over the lodges, things meant what they were intended to mean. A hammer was a hammer, a set- square was a set-square. This fee ling of naturalism was also evident in art and can be found in today's rare philosophical art. The great Russian film director Andrei Tarkovs ky in his film \"The Mirror\" (1974) shows how a boy refuses to fire a shot at the shooting range during the Second World War. He then walks up a hill and stops at the top. Suddenly a bird lands on the boy's head. 116"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Tarkovsky visited Stockholm when \"The Mirror\" was shown there in 1983. After the film, a woman asked him: \"What was the meaning of the bird that landed on the boy's head?\" I stood next to Tarkovsky when he answered: \"The bird meant nothing!\" - \"What do you mean?\" the woman asked dissatisfied, used as she was to the free- masons' unnatural way of thinking. \"W asn't it a very unusual bird?\" Tarkovsky riposted: \"No, it was an ordinary bird!\" The woman could not understand: \"But something was unusual?\" Tarkovsky: \"Of course. The boy was unusual!\" The woman: \"What do you mean?\" Tarkovsky: \"The boy was good-hearte d! An ordinary bird would only land on a good-hearted boy's head!\" In this scene, Tarkovsky displayed the boy's level of spiritual development. This boy refused to injure other people. Such indi- viduals are very rare in our world, which is often reminiscent of a lunatic asylum. Tarkovsky had been influenced by the Japanese haiku, where everything means only what it appears to mean. The woman's uncomprehending questions show how the freemasons have destroyed our natural way of thinki ng, where things have a natural meaning and quasi-symbolism is not hing more than black-magic rubbish. Henry T. Laurency calls the quasi-symbolism of the freemasons \"parodical attempts to pretend ownership of the secret symbols of higher knowledge\" (\"De vises sten\" / \"The Philosophers Stone\", Skovde, 1995, p. 88). The Masonic descriptions of rituals state that all masonic symbols have a double meaning, one natural and one magic. Masonic symbo- lism is all around us (on the Swedish 20 crown note for example), in underground stations (Kungstradgard en in Stockholm), on cigarette packets, on clothes, and in architecture. 117"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Masonic Magic The freemasons whole-heartedly be lieve that certain magic pheno- mena help them to manipulate humanity. If freemasons did not blindly believe this, they would never be permitted to rise in the ranks. This is odd, considering that the freemasons claim to be ratio- nalists whose highest ideal is reason. The American masonic leader Albert Pike, who was elevated to Sovereign Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, explains his view of the basic world- view of the Scottish Rite in his book \"Morals and Dogma of the An cient and Accepted Rite of Scottish Freemasonry\": \"Magic is the Science of the ancient magis... Magic unites in one and the same sc ience, whatsoever Philosophy can posses that is most certain, and Religion of the Infallible and the Eternal. It perfectly... reconciles these two te rms... faith and reason... those who accept (magic) as a rule may give their will a sovereign power that will make them the masters of all interior beings and of all errant spirits; that is to say, will make them the Arbiters and Kings of the world...\" The black magician and freemason Aleister Crowley claimed: \"Magick is the Sience and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will. Each welcome change can be evoked, if one uses the right force in the right way, by using the right medium on the right object.\" (Aleister Crowley, \"The Book of High Magick Art\", Paris, 1930) Magic is the art and science of using will-power to change our consciousness and to reshape certain things or to achieve meta- morphoses. Magic is also the art and science of applying a certain force or power during the change or to experience a powerful energy during the metamorphosis. If we desire to achieve positive metamorphoses, we are dealing with white magic. If we seek to damage other living beings, the methods used come from the arsenal of the black magicians. Power is emitted from all psycholo gical noumena (living beings), although in varying degrees, concentration and extension. The potential power of psychic objects is increased with its positive 118"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"associations (white magic) and decreased with its negative asso- ciations (black magic) to another psychic noumenon, to a degree, which depends both on the potential power of the second noumenon and the intensity of the association. Magic has a powerful effect on our environment indeed. Magic affects biological proces ses. It is possible to achieve carezza, a long- lasting sexual ecstasy, with the aid of magic. The founder of the art of psychosom atic healing, Rolf Alexander, was able to affect the shape of cl ouds, or even disintegrate them, with his concentrated energy, even if the cloud was ten miles away, like in Mexico City in summer 1951. This process took him 12 minutes. This magic phenomenon is called psychokinesis in para- psychology (Rolf Alexander, \"Crea tive Realism\", New York, 1954, pp. 240-241). Homeopathy is also pure magic. Magic comes into being when the inner world starts to affect the outer reality, when energies are manipulated. An examination of the world around us gives us a clear idea of the freemasons' confused inner world. At the same time, we gain an unpleasant insight into our own future by reading their rancorous, spiritually deficient ideologies and visions. Magical mani pulation by a spiritually misled and confused practitioner is ther efore particularly dangerous. St. Thomas Aquinas wisely stated th at \"all physical things are mere metaphors, embodied spiritual th ings\". The advance of freemasonry proves how sick our. society really is. Certain objects, clothes and sym bols have a strong magic charge, such as writing implements, ink, ma gic wands (symbolising the magi- cian's phallus), candles, incense, hair, capes and overalls. Other pro- tective items with a weaker magic charge, such as stones or other chargeable items, are called amulets. Objects with a very powerful magic charge are called talismans. The most powerful of these are th e Abramelin talismans, magically charged aphoristic squares with a designated purpose, which bring about great changes in the envir onment in a relatively short time. Abramelin talismans are arrangements of letters representing and 119"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"eventually fulfilling the innermost wishes of the magician. Power- fully charged words and names of Hebrew angels are often used. For example Alampis, which can make the practitioner invisible, or Catan, which can destroy marriages. The magical system of Abramelin the mage is an individual form of magic based on \"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, as Delivered by Abraham the Jew unto his son Lamech\" (Lon- don, 1900), written in 1458 by Abraham the Jew. This book inspired the magician Eliphas Levi. Aleister Crowley, who claimed to be the reincarnation of Levi, regarded it as the best and most dangerous book of magic ever written. The magic of Abramelin supposes that the material world was created by evil spirits. These evil spirits can be enslaved by the magician, who is protected by the sacred Guardian Angel. The magician can use the spirits as servants. The angel appears to the magician and shows him how he can control both good and evil spirits. Only then can the magician heal the sick, use the miracle-working Abramelin tali smans, gain untold riches and overpowering sexual magnetism. The Masonic Temple in Amsterda m has Abramelin talismans above the door. The magician uses squares filled with Hebrew letters to exhort one of thousands of devils or evil spirits to bring him wealth, win the love of a maiden, animate a corpse for seven years, bewitch others, demolish buildings, open locks, and so on. The magic aphoristic squares are empowered with demonic life, which works through them. Crowley claimed that Abramelin talis- mans were \"as explosive as nitroglycerine and much more dange- rous\". These talismans can bring forth invisible, ghostlike soldiers to fight for the unnatural aims of the freemasons. The magic of Abramelin can be used without retribution only by a master who has successfully undergone spiritual cleansing. This form of magic differs greatly from all other European ritual systems and its practitioner does not even use the traditional magic circle. Instead he picks out and purifies an area, of ten an isolated spot in a forest surrounded by magic force. 120"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Modern magicians regard this system as extremely dangerous. Using the talismans before achieving mastery of them is very fool- hardy. If one is attacked magically with use of these talismans, one can protect oneself by forming a triple magic circle around oneself, using magic symbols of protec tion or objects charged with positive energy, or by wearing a powerfully magi cally charged one-piece garment. The pyramids are also talismans . The Illuminati and the Grand Orient use pyramids, triangles and obelisks as talismans to affect their surroundings. Amulets were central to Egyptian magic. They were worn by both the dead and the living. Each part of the body had its own amulet. Many of the amulets found on mumm ies are inscribed with words of power or magic formulas. Common amulets include the scarab, a depiction in faience, stone or wood of the sacred scarab (dungbeetle) which protected the heart; the pillow under the head of the mummy; the gold necklace which gave the deceased the power to free himself from his wrappings; the eye of Horus, the Egyptian god of the sky and the sun, which provided stre ngth and protection. Horus had the head of a falcon (Lewis Spence, \"Myths and Legends of Ancient Egypt\", London, 1915, p. 263). The masonic magician usually draw s a magic circle, in which he must stand to avoid the effects of the evil forces he calls upon. At such seances the pentagram aids the magician: it makes demonic forces compliant. While the pentagram shrinks the wearer's aura noticeably, sacred Buddhist items increase it . One-piece overa lls have the property of significantly increasing the energy field (aura) of the wearer, since the flow of energy in the body remains undisturbed. This can be shown with the aid of a divining rod. The magician Eliphas Levi (actually Alphonse Louis Constant, 1810- 1875) described how magic works in his famous book \"Dogme et rituel de la haute magie\" / \"Dogma and Rituals of High Magic\" (Paris, 1854). He claimed that there were three basic laws of magic. The first 121"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"law states that human will-power is not an abstract idea, but a material and measurable force. Cert ain geometric figures are used in ritual magic, which help the magician to concentrate his will. The second law states that the magici an can affect distant objects and cause events to occur at a great di stance by means of his astral body. The third law states that each part of the macrocosm (the universe) has a counterpart in the microcosm (the individual). The magician Raymond Lullus (1235-1315) further developed the wine-still through his experiments in magic transformation and discovered \"the water of life\" (aqua vitae), that is spirits. Magicians believe that the concealed knowledge of secret con- nections, makes it possible for them to use any of the cosmic forces. They can also bring forth the sam e force from their own souls and transmit it to a magic item or magi c process. Will-power is controlled by a highly developed sense of imagination. The magician Agrippa wrote: \"Nothing is concealed from the wise and sensible, while the unbelievin g and unworthy cannot learn the secrets.\" He emphasized: \"All things which are similar and therefore connected, are drawn to each other' s power.\" This is known as the law of resonance. The use of magically charged blood brings the magician much closer to evil. This is why the maso nic initiate's head is covered with a bloody cloth during a formal ceremony. The masonic leaders (especially within the Grand Orient) marked their blood sacrifices to increase their power by erecting obelisks in large cities, where they had total control. By these means, the in- visible illuminist powers have created an enormous, negative force field, which accumulates energy with the aid of obelisks. Obelisks generate the energy they accumulate. Napoleon was encouraged to invade Egypt in 1798 to plunder sites, where there were remains of ancient magic knowledge and magically charged items. The freemasons need ed these for their rituals. They demanded that Napoleon, upon completing his campaign, should bring a large Egyptian obelisk home to Paris as a spoil of war. 122"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" In 1835, the freemasons finally er ected a 2500 year-old Osiris obelisk from Luxor weighing 246 tons on the spot where they had guillotined Louis XVI and Marie Antoin ette, a square called Place de la Revolution in the 1790s (today it is called Place de la Concorde). Marie Antoinette of Habsburg wa s the daughter of Franeois de Lorraine, a descendant of the Mer ovingians. She was sacrificed for the sake of the future. Blood app ears to increase the power of the obelisks and thereby also the freemasons. The erection of the obelisk took place following the coup d'etat that the freemasons organized in June 1830 to put Louis Philippe on the throne. They wanted to dispose of Charles X, the brother of Louis XVI (Martin Short, \"Inside the Br otherhood\", London, 1997, p. 119), who had prevented the freemasons from erecting the obelisk on the site of his brother's execution. Among the conspirators was the masonic liberal Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877), who was then minister of employment. Five years later he became prime minister and at the same time the obelisk was erected on the chosen spot. He was elected president of the Third Republic in 1871. With the aid of a divining rod, it is possible to determine that the obelisk in Place de la Concorde has b een placed on a powerful line of earth radiation, which continues straight down the Champs Elysees towards the Arc de Triomphe and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 123"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The line of earth radiation has b een composed of several natural energy lines by means of a series of certain acts. The British freemasons stole their own Egyptian obelisk, originally erected by Tuthmosis III. The 3500 year old obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle stands on Victoria Embankment by the Thames in London. The obelisk was transported to London from Alexandria and erected on 13 September 1878. The fre emason Dr Erasmus Wilson paid for the transport which, due to a powerful storm in the Bay of Biscay, resulted in the death of six men. The obelisk originally stood in Heliopolis, but Cleopatra ordered the 186-ton monolith to be moved to Alexandria. The obelisk was a symbol of the sun (Heliopolis means \"the City of the Sun\") in Greek. The inscriptions honour the pharaoh Tuthmosis III's victories in Asia. On 22 February 1881, the freem asons (including William Hulbert and William H. Vanderbilt) raised a third obelisk from Alexandria in Central Park in New York City behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This obelisk was also originally erected at Heliopolis in Egypt in 1600 B.C. by Tuthmosis III. It was removed to Alexandria in 12 B.C. by the Romans. 124"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The freemasons erected an obelisk (known as \"the pyramid\") composed of 13 parts on an open place next to the Royal Palace in Stockholm after the murder of Gust avus III. It is built according to the measurements of the Luxor obelisk with a miniature model of Cheops' pyramid at the top. The si des of Cheops' pyramid are angled 51° 52' towards the base (Iorwerth E. S. Edwards, \"The Pyramids of Ancient Egypt\", London, 1947, p. 87). The masonic vampires use the Cheops lock on top of their obelisks to prevent enemies from entering their magical energy-field. Placing the miniature model of the Cheops' pyramid on top of the obelisk is a very clever move. The earth has a network of energy lines with different frequencies. Churches, cemeteries and ancient monuments were often deliberately built where these energy lines crossed each other. It is damaging for a human being to reside near a power ful field of earth radiation for a long period. Cats, however, like to sit where energy lines cross, since they feel the vibrations of mice crossing the lines, which makes hunting easier. Masonic lodges are often built upon powerful energy lines. This is the case with the masonic temples in Amsterdam and Stockholm. Magically, these lodges are at the centre of action and are thus optimally situated to affect the world around them, like a spider in the middle of its web. The fact that high-ranking free- masons deny using magic is thus nothing but impudent hypocrisy. On 12 December 2000, an experiment took place by the obelisk in Stockholm. A divining rod was used to ascertain that the human aura was affected so negatively in the immediate radius of the obelisk that it shrank to almost nothing. At the same time it was determined that the obelisk was erected on a powerful energy-line, which conti- nued directly towards the Baatska Palace, the headquarters of the Swedish freemasons. Further experi ments concluded that the two energy lines, which crossed by the gate of the lodge also, caused the human aura to shrink to a fraction of its original radius.

Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 that returned to the government the power to issue currency, without going through the Federal Reserve. Kennedy's order gave the Treasury Department the power \"to issue silver certi- ficates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury\". For every ounce of si lver in the US Treasury Depart- ment's vault, the government could introduce new money into circulation. Kennedy brought nearly 4.3 billion dollars in new notes into circulation. The ramifications of this bill were enormous. With the stroke of a pen, Kenn edy was on his way to putting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York out of business. If enough of these silver certificates were to come into circulation, they would have eliminated the demand for masonic Federal Reserve notes. This is because the silver certificates were backed by silver and the Federal Reserve notes were not backed by anything. Executive Order 11110 could have prevented the national debt from reaching its current level, because it would have given the government the ability to repay its debt without going to the Federal Reserve and being charged inte rest to create new money. To dismantle the Federal Reserve System and issue interest-free money was a crime against the intentions of the masonic financial elite. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated five months later, no more silver certificates were issued. The Executive Order was never re- pealed by any American president and is still valid. Nearly 6 trillion dollars in debt has been accu mulated since 1963 (\"President Kennedy: the Federal Reserve and Executive Order\", The Final Call, Vol. 15, No. 6, 17 January 1996, the United States). President Kennedy wanted to take home military advisers from Vietnam, call off the pointless \"confl ict\" with the Soviet Union and prevent Israel from producing nuclear weapons, thereby becoming enemies with the freemason David Be n-Gurion, the prime minister of Israel (Michael Collins Piper, \"Fin al Judgement: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Conspi racy\", Washington, 1998). 127"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"In his letter to Ben-Gurion, Kennedy makes it clear that he will under no circumstances agree to Israel becoming a nuclear state.

The American historian Stephen Green stated: \"In the early years of the Johnson admini stration the Israeli nuclear weapons program was referred to in Washington as 'the delicate topic'.\" When New Orleans District Attorn ey Jim Garrison prosecuted trade executive Clay Shaw for conspiracy in the assassination, Garrison had stumbled upon the Mossad link. The United States wasted two b illion dollars per month on their criminal war efforts in Vietnam. Kennedy was replaced by the high- ranking freemason Lyndon Baines Johnson, who did everything in his power to conceal the truth behind the murder. There was no way the unskilled marksman Lee Harvey Oswald could have managed to fire three shots, including two hits, within 5.6 seconds from his supposed hiding place on the sixth floor of the book depository on Elm Street in Dallas. The district attorney Jim Garrison in New Or- leans believed that at least three snipers were involved in the shoo- ting. The American investigative journalist Michael Collins Piper attempts to show in his book \"The Final Judgement\" that Israel's secret service, Mossad, was involved in the murder of President Kennedy. The assistant autopsy photographer Floyd Riebe, the X-ray techni- cian Jerrol Custer and another technician, all employed by the US Navy and present at the Bethesda Na val Hospital, when John F.

Washington's tallest marble obelis k, 555 feet tall a nd dedicated to the President and freemason George Washington, was completed in 1885. It was then the tallest st one structure in the world. The Washington Monument was designed in 1838 by Robert Mills (1781- 1855), following the measurements of the Luxor obelisk. The number 5 in masonic symbolism stands for d eath, while a series of three fives stands for murder. The masonic ph ysicians were responsible for murdering President George Washington. The City Planning Depart- ment ruled that no building could be taller than the Capitol. The Masonic Grand Lodge is directly to the north, the Capitol directly to the east. Washington, D. C. was planned in 1791 by the masonic architect Pierre Charles l'Enfant, who design ed the streets and boulevards to form a magic pattern with the White House at the centre (Frederick Goodman, \"Magic Symbols\", London, 1989, p. 6). In 1792, the foun- ding father laid the foundation stone of the White House on 13 October, the anniversary of the Knights Templar's demise.

The various sources of energy and radiation in the universe affects us daily. Only when we die, are we liberated from the physical uni- verse. The Russian scientist Semyon Kirlian managed to show with the aid of his apparatus that this energy continues to affect us after our physical death. The planets af fect us to a great degree (astro- logy). It is both ignorant and un wise not to reckon with this. The freemasons use astrology, the most ancient of all sciences. We cannot afford to be without this knowledge. Franeois Mitterrand, former president of France and a freemason of the 33rd degree, was very interested in astrology. He asked astro- logers to provide him with the optimal date for a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and ordered hor oscopes for the members of the socialist government at the time (Bjorn Erik Rosin, \"Mitterrand pri- sade sin stjarna\" / \"Mitterrand Praised his Lucky Star\", Svenska Dag- bladet, May 9, 1997, p. 1). The bolshevik freemasons had a de ep knowledge of the secrets of astrology. Their chief astrologer was Lev Karakhan (Karakhanyan), later a deputy people's commissar fo r foreign affairs. Naturally, the Nazi leaders who were connected to international freemasonry, were also interested in the secrets of astrology. According to the Buddhist author Michael Tamm in Boston, the freemasons are actively involved in magical warfare against us (Michael Tamm, \"Reflections on Magical Warfare\", Boston, 1990).

These phrases have been trumpeted by the freemasons themselves. The official motto of freemasonry is: Lux ex tenebris (light from darkness). Freemasonry officially stands for humanist values, but in reality it represents the worst form of atheism and materialism. The freemasons' greatest crime against humanity was to take away the former belief that we do not live only once and that we are completely responsible for our actions before the invisible worlds. It is therefore important for them to ridicule all knowledge of rein- carnation. The freemason Joseph Fouche, who acted as convention com- missar, during \"the great French revolution\" in 1793 issued an order to place a sign on rue de la Cimetiere (Cemetery Street) in Paris. The sign read: \"Death is eternal sleep.\" Heinrich Heydrich and Dieter Schwarz wrote in the book \"The World-View of Freemasonry\" (Berlin, 1938) that the order represented a humanist philosophy, where \"no differentiation is made between races, peoples, religions or social and political beliefs\". According to the current propaganda, freemasonr y creates better human beings. The facts suggest a different truth. The freemasons have distanced th emselves noticeably from Chris- tianity. Albert Mackey's \"Lexicon of Freemasonry\" states that \"the religion of freemasons is not Christianity\". It is actually occult demonism-Satanism. The Grande Oriente d'ltalia rented Palazzio Borghese in Rome in 1893. Two years later, due to a dispute about the rent contract, the freemasons had to vacate parts of the palace.

The flagpole was decorated with a wooden effigy of Lucifer. The famous Italian poet, Professor of literature and Deputy Grand Master of the freemasons (Felsinea, Bologna) Giosue Carducci (1835- 1907, received the Nobel Prize for lit erature in 1906) wrote \"Hymn to Satan\", which contains the lines: \"We greet you, Oh Satan! Oh rebellion! (\"Salute, o Satana! O Ribellione!) Oh the victorious power of reason! (0, forza vindice della Ragione!)\" \"La Rivista della Massoneria Italiana\" (Vol. X, p. 265) from the 1880s stated: \"My brothers, freemasons... Satan is great!\" Manly P. Hall, a 33rd degree freem ason declared in his book \"The Lost Keys of Freemasonry or the Secret of Hiram Abiff\" that the freemasons always has access to \"t he bubbling energy of Lucifer\". Samuel Paul Rosen (1840-1907) was active as a rabbi in Poland for many years and at the same time managed to reach the 33rd degree within freemasonry. Finally he had enough and began serving man- kind instead. He left freemasonry and converted to Catholicism. In his book \"Satan and Heaven\" (\"Sa tan et del\", Casterman, 1888), Rosen revealed that there was an evil conspiracy based on Satanism within freemasonry. Rosen stated th at the religion of freemasonry is the worship of death and that its goal is to degenerate society (p. 335). For this reason the freemasons have encouraged the founding of destructive political and pseudo-spiritual movements for the spiritually retarded and undiscerning.

Money was to them something dead; something dead cannot be allowed to grow. Aristotle wrote in his work \"Politics\" (Book One, part X): \"The most hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object of it. For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest... Wherefore of all modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural.\" Up until the end of the Middle Ag es it was forbidden for Christians to charge interest. To charge interest on a loan was tantamount to murder and robbery. Later, those w ho charged interest were treated as heretics. Martin Luther stated plainly: \"A ll usurers are thieves and belong in the gallows!\" Everyone who lent money at an interest rate of 5 to 6 per cent was considered to be a usurer. During the Middle Ages only Jews were allowed to lend money with interest. In Deuteronomy a Jew is forbidden to charge intere st from his brother. But the goy (non-Jew) was not his brother. And to Jewish extremists plunder was not unfamiliar. To guarantee normal economic development the Babylonian king captured Israelite robbers that pl undered caravans in the desert. These caravan robb ers lived on others ' toil and labour. The Swedish esoteric philosophe r Henry T. Laurency summed up the turn of events in the followi ng way in his great work \"The Philosopher's Stone\" (\"De vi ses sten\", Skovde, 1995, p. 249): \"The Jews were an uncivilised tribe of shepherds that to some extent lived on robbery.

The Babylonian exile was the Israelites' fi rst contact with a more sensible philosophy and with culture... Through acquired historical data and partly through their own oral traditions a history of the Jews was constructed. The writings of the prophets constitut ed their own revisions of that which had been overheard in captivity.\" In ancient Babylonia the legal interest rate was 30 per cent on money and 50 per cent on grain. In Assyria there was no upper limit for the interest rate. The farmers were often so deep in debt that they starved to death along with their families. This led to ruthless exploitation of the soil. In the city of Uruk in Babylonia there lived two brothers who lent money with interest. When a borrower no longer could repay his loan, he lost his house and had to start working for free for the brothers. The slave could be lent also to other employers. This is a classical example of economic slavery. Almost 3700 years ago the ruler of Babylon, Hammurabi (1848- 1805 B. C), who was descended from the Amorite dynasty, forbade through his law acts (containing 93 paragraphs) the taking of interest on interest, which meant that the borrower, in addition to the assets he had borrowed, had to give the same amount in goods or money. Anyone who broke the rule was severely punished, though very few abided by it. The 282 statutes of Hammurabi written in Acadian were found in 1901 at excava tions at Susa in ancient Elam (now Iran). Hammurabi understood that interest on top of interest would lead to a terrible economic burden that the people would not be able to bear. Because of that he felt it necessary to punish usury severely. The highest interest rate permitted was set at 20 per cent. Trade and the general economy i mmediately improved, though it was hard to adhere to the law. The Israelites enjoyed the practice of usury and eagerly started to exploit it. The prophet Muhammad demanded that usury be forbidden. He recommended that the lender should act as an investor who would 140"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"receive part of the profit. If th ere were no profit one should be satisfied with forfeiting the money. The Roman Tribune Tiberius Gracchus tried in 133 B. C. to reduce the power of the moneychangers th rough stricter laws against usury limiting the legal land ownership to one iugerum per family. He was murdered the same year. In 48 B. C. Julius Caesar deprived the moneychangers of the right to coin money and had it done hims elf. With a larger money supply he was able to erect many public buildings. Common people adored Caesar for his contribution of making money more available. After the murder of Caesar, there was an end to the abundance of money. The money supply was reduced by 90 per cent. Taxes rose sky-high. As a result most people lost their land and their homes. The slander of Caesar goes on even today. Jacques Attali, the Jewish historian, academician and freemason, who wrote the book \"The Jews, the World, and the Money\" (Paris, 2001) stated in the magazine L'Express that the Jews invented capi- talism. Attali stressed: \"My conclusion is that the Jews have every reason to be proud of that part of their history.\" The masonic Jews therefore wanted to acquire as much wealth as possible in order to serve their demons during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. That the Jews became so rich, Attali explains in the following way: \"It was a natural development. There is within Islam the same taboo against loan and interest as with Christendom. The Jews were among the few who could read and write. They were subsequently the only ones capable of organising the loan transactions that the commerce of that time needed. In addition to that th e educated Jewish businessmen the only international network of mo ney lenders, traders and money- changers.\" During the first three hundred years A.

The moneychangers were once again able to assert themselves. The Catholic Church did not relent to the pressure on interest until 1745. The Irish economist Margrit Kennedy has pointed out that a one per cent loan is doubled in 70 years. A 3-%-loan with accumulated interest doubles in only 24 years. A 6-%-loan doubles in 12 years, and at 12 % the amount is doubled in just six years. If anyone had lent one cent in A. D. 1 and charged a 4 per cent interest, in 1750 he could have bought gold weighing as much as the whole Earth. (At five per cent interest it would have been possible as early as the year 1403.) In 1990, he would have been able to buy 12 246 such Earth-size nuggets. These extreme examples show how madly interest damages each country's economy. Interest as a weapon During the 16 th and 17 th centuries the Spanish brought more than 16 000 tons of pure silver and 185 tons of gold out of Latin America, according to official Spanish record s. The gold and silver was among other things used for buying arms from England and Flanders. Europe thus received a huge capital influx , which gradually laid the foun- dation for the Rothschild and Bari ng banks. These banks then lent money to various governments. In the 16 th century, the charging of inte rest was more eagerly uti- lized. The merchants of Venice were leading this development.

After the so-called French Revolution the use of paper money was widespread. The gold traders began practising economic fraud to become even more powerful. They lent secretly part of the gold that had been deposited by them and kept the in terest they made on such illegal loan. The gold traders then issued more receipts (bank notes) of gold deposits than they had gold, in turn lent these notes and charged interest on them Far more money was thus lent than what the creditor had cover for. Soon these money crooks lent as much as up to ten times more than they had gold deposited. This breach of trust has become common in all areas in the world of the freemasons. The American banks have the right to lend ten times more money than they actuall y have. This means that their interest actually is close to 80 pe r cent and not 8 per cent, which is officially claimed. The masonic bankers create money out of nothing and force us to pay interest thereon. The Prieure de Sion initiated with the aid of the moneychangers (above all the Portuguese rabbi Me nasseh ben Israel, who lived in the Netherlands, and Antonio Fernandez Moses Carvajal) th e insurrection of 1642, led by Oliver Cromwell, which in turn led to the first republic (commonwealth) in England in 1649. The year 1643 a large group of rich Jews came to England. They met with the Portuguese Ambassador in London, Antonio de Souza (a Marano, converted Jew), where further moves were discussed. All their actions were co-ordinated by Carvajal (the German magazine Diagnosen, February 1986, p. 50). Having deposed and executed Charles I in 1649, and naming himself as dictator in 1653, Oliver Cromwell became bloodthirsty and hostile to cultural developmen t, letting the moneychangers strengthen their financial power. Under the puritanical rule of the Lord Protector Cromwell, music and other cultural activities were practically banned. Even colourful garments were forbidden. Only after Oliver Cromwell's demise was the genial composer Henry Purcell able to perform publicly. It was Oliver Cromwell who in 1656 having 143"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"negotiated with Menasseh ben Israel once again let the Jews settle in England. In November of 1688 (under the sign of Scorpio), the catholic king of England James II (Stuart) was overthrown through an well- organized invasion financed by the moneyed Jews of Amsterdam and led by the Prieure de Sion and the Orange Order. The king was exiled to France and in February of 1689 William of Orange, the prince of Nassau, was put upon the English throne by means of a coup d'etat, which became known as the Glorious Revolution. Even official histo- rians admit that the people did not participate in this coup. England at that time was in poor condition after more than fifty years of war with France and the Netherlands, and the new king, William III (of Orange), asked severa l powerful bankers for help. They provided the English state with a loan of 1.25 million pounds but only delivered 750 000 pounds. The terms of the loan were as follows: the names of the lenders we re not to be revealed and these were guaranteed the right to found the Bank of England, whose directors were ensured to establish a gold reserve so as to be able to issue loans to a value of 10 pounds for each pound deposited gold in the bank vault. They also were allowed to consolidate the national debt and the secure payment for a nnuity and interest through direct taxation of the people. The privately owned Bank of England was established in 1694 with absolute control over the currency (the right to issue bank notes). The lending of money on usury was able to continue at an even larger scale. Thus th e English people suffer ed a huge national debt. Taxes had to be raised and prices doubled. To the masonic bankers it was necessary to have a monopoly on money issuing. That way they were able to make enormous prof its and also control political pro- cesses. The Bank of England was allowed to lend money to an amount ten times the security the lender put up . With five-% interest it only took two years for the bank to earn back an amount equal to the original security. 144"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"By the year 1698 the national debt had risen from one and a quarter million pounds to sixteen mi llion. In 1815, it was 885 million pounds, in 1945 it had grown to 22.5 billion pounds, and in 1960 the National Debt was 28 billion pounds . By 1995 the National Debt had risen to more than 300 billion poun ds, equal to 45% of GNP. Since 1946 this central bank has offici ally been owned by the British government. Today London City is the financial centre of Europe and is guarded by 2000 private policemen. Not even the MacMillan Committee, which was appointed in 1929, managed to find out who governed the Bank of England. Only one name has leaked out - that of Roth schild. All great wars have been started and financed by the economic conglomerate emanating from one single banking family - Rothschild. In the Netherlands, secret societies had been able to found a central bank as early as 1609. About 40 of the world's most important central banks were established in a similar way as that of Bank of England. In that way the masonic bankers ruled the longterm development in the world with loan interest as a method, the central banks as middlemen, the politicians as dummies and the people as ignorant wage slaves. The masonic-controlled banks thus can govern political life by acting without being seen. The English people strengthened the power of these invisible freemasons through paying taxes during three centuries. Central banks were to keep the economy stable. In reality it works quite differently. Benjamin Franklin wrote of the Br itish colonies in North America in the 1750s: \"Nowhere on Earth does one find a happier and more well-being people.\" He explained that this was due to that \"we in the colonies make our own currency\", ca lled 'Colonial script'. He further explained: \"By issuing our own currency we can control its buying power and we are not obliged to pay interest to anyone.\" In these British colonies on the East Coast of North America, called New England, there was a wealth contrasting sharply to the poverty and misery in England. There was enough money and it was definitely interest free. 145"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"When the masonic bankers in England heard this at Benjamin Franklin's speech to the British Pa rliament, they made sure that Parliament forbade the colonies to use their own financial system and instead demanded they use interest free money in gold and silver. Only an insufficient amount of this money was to be available. The money supply was reduced in half , and the colonies were forced to borrow money from the Bank of E ngland. The result was interest and price increases. Within a year the streets of the colonies were full of unemployed people. In American schoolbooks the reason given for the outbreak of the Revolutionary War was the tea tax, but according to Franklin, \"the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax\" (of two per cent) \"on tea and other matters had it not been that England took away from the colonies their money, which created unemployment and dis- satisfaction\". The result of the infl uence of the English banks on the British Parliament was horrendous poverty in America. When this situation had been created, it was easy to get people ready for war, which the freemasons did with satisfaction. They wanted a safe base for their future global activities. Among the men who drew up the Constitution of 1787, there were those who thought one should protect oneself against the financial drain of the international bankers. Therefore Article I, Sec 8 of the Constitution reads: \"Congress shall have power... to coin money, regulate the value thereof.\" Alexander Hamilton, a freemason and secretary of finance in the government of George Washington, and also the agent of the international financiers, ordered the establishment of a privately owned union bank and the introduction of interest money. His argument was simple: \"A limited natio nal debt would be a blessing to a nation.\" He considered it dangerou s for the government to issue its own currency.

Andrew Jackson referred to the 146"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"fact that the Constitution had given Congress power to coin money in sufficient quantity but not transfer this right to others. The historian Richard Boesen disclosed that the freemason Nathan Rothschild (1777-1836), who in 1806 had founded his bank in London and who partly financed the Napoleonic wars trough the Bank of England, subsequently is sued an ultimatum - either the contract be renewed or there wo uld be war. Jackson called the masonic bankers a bunch of thieves and promised to exterminate them. Rothschild gave his own or ders: \"Teach these insolent Ameri- cans a lesson. Force them back to a colonial status.\" The British government began to limit the American sea trade and checked the American expansion in Canada. President James Madison in 1812 had no other choice bu t to let Congress declare war on England. The intention of the lead er of the freemasons, Rothschild, was to lay waste the country to su ch an extent that the Americans would be forced to seek financial aid. Great Britain, however, failed to regain the lost colonies, and the United States failed to occupy Canada. The war was actually fought in 1814.

The renewed central bank contract w as again suspended in 1836 during Andrew Jackson's presidency (1829 -1837), despite the fact that he was grand master of Tennessee. The central bank was abolished. Even so European bankers and their American agents managed to exercise an extensive control of the American monetary system. Gustavus Myers admits in his book \"History of the Great American Fortunes\" (New York, 1907, p. 556): \"Under the surface, the Roth- schilds long had a powerful influence in dictating American financial laws. The law records show that they were powers in the old Bank of the United States.\" In American history books there is nothing about the role of the banks in the Revolutionary War (1775 -1783) and the War of Indepen- dence (1812-1814). Neither is there anything about the debt-free 'greenbacks' that Abraham Lincoln issued. Their existence is only verified by a few encyclopaedias. To finance the American Civil Wa r, which broke out on 12 April 1861, President Abraham Lincoln was forced to utilize the right of the Congress to coin its own m oney. Between the years 1862 and 1864, 450 million interest free 'gr eenbacks' were printed. Lincoln promised at his re-election in 1864 to begin fighting the banks as soon as the war was over. Lord Goschen, the representative of the financial world, wrote in the London Times: \" I f this financial policy becomes permanent, the government can without expenses acqu ire necessary monetary provision. It can pay its debt and repay its loans without debt. It will have enough money to trade (on the open market). It is going to be healthier than any other (before) in history. If we do not overthrow this government, it will overthrow us.\" The North during the Civil War was financed by the Rothschilds through their American agent August Belmont (actually Schonberg) and the South by the Erlanger brot hers who were related to the Rothschild family. The Civil War ended on 9 April 1865, and the international freemasonry got bus y to remove President Lincoln. 148"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was carried out by the extre- mist Jew John Wilkes Booth (Botha), a freemason of the 33rd degree, on 14 April 1865 in Washington, D. C, only five days after the end of the Civil War. The Jewish silversmith John Booth's ancestors had been exiled from Port ugal because of their radical political views. John's fader was Junius Brutus Booth (Stanley Kimmel, \"The Mad Booths of Maryland\", New York, 1970). Izola Forrester, Booth's grand- daughter, stated in her book, \"This One Mad Act\" (1937), that Booth belonged to the lodge Knights of the Golden Circle and also Mazzini's \"revolutionary\" movement Young America. Izola Forrester revealed in detail that the freemasons were involved in the assassination of the president. The subsequent murder of Lincoln's assassin was organized by Judah P. Benjamin, an important freemason and Rothschild agent (William Guy Carr, \"Red Fog over America\", 1968, p. 194). He was head of the Confederate secret service and later fled to England. The masonic lodge Knights of the Golden Circle was mixed up in the plot. This name had begun to be seen in the press and so the masonic Sovereign Grand Commander Albert Pike in 1866 decided to rename it Kuklos Klan; 'kyklos' in Greek meaning 'circle' (John Daniel, \"Scarlet and the Beast\", Volym III, Tyler, Texas, p. 76). Knights of the Golden Circle appear ed first in Cincinnati, Ohio, under the supervision of the Scottish Rite's Midwest organizer Killian van Resselaer. From there, the Knights spread throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, down the Mississippi south to the Gulf of Mexico, and into Maryland and Virginia. The Golden Circle was to be a slave empire centred in Cuba. The Knights armed and trained up to 100 000 men. They were organized into lodges called 'castles'. It was officially founded as a new organization, the Ku Klux Klan, in 1865 in Pulaski, Tennessee, by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forrest formally disbanded the Klan in 1869, and the federal govern- ment crushed the residual chapters by 1871. In 1882 it was banned. The present racist group with the same name was founded in 1915 by William Joseph Simmons and Simon Wolf and thus has not grown out of the masonic organization that existed from 1866 to 1871. 149"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"After the demise of President Lincoln things were \"normalized\". The amount of money in circulation, which in 1866 amounted to 1907 million dollars or 50.46 dollars per capita, had by 1876 been reduced to 605 million or 14.60 dollars per person. As a result there were 56 446 bankruptcies in ten years and a loss of two billion dollars. In 1887, the masonic bankers reduced the money amount further to 6.67 dollars per head. The Irish economist Margrit Kennedy stated in the book \"Interest and Inflation Free Money\" that the interest rate al ways goes up when there is a shortage of money. This in turn leads to bankruptcies and worsens the unemployment rate. In American schoolbooks it is claimed that it was all for the good that the Democratic candidate for president in 1896, William Jen- nings Bryan, was not elected, because he was against the gold foo- ting and the \"sound money\" of the banks (that is money that creates debt). Bryan explained in his \"Cross of Gold\" speech at the Demo- cratic National Convention in Chicago on 9 July 1896: \"When we have restored the money of the Constitution, all other necessary reforms will be possible, and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished.\" Bryan was not elected and 17 year s later, in 1913, Congress passed a bill (introduced by the masonic President Woodrow Wilson), that repealed the right of the Congress to issue currency and transferred this right to a \"federal reserve\" funding system. Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh, father of the famous aviator, had the following to say about this: \"When the president signs it, the invisible government of the money brokers has become legalized. The worst legal crime of the century is a fact. The day of reckoning is only a few years removed.\" The one that played a crucial role in providing the United States with a central bank, was Paul Warburg. He was a German immigrant arriving in America together with his brother Felix. Both brothers, who were Illuminati and also member of B'nai B'rith, became partners of the banking house Kuhn, Loeb & Co., led by the illuminatus Jacob 150"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Schiff, who also belonged to B'nai B'rith (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Free- masonry, Culture, and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 583). The Warburgs were supported by Nelson Aldrich (later to become grandfather to Nelson and David Rockefeller), known as the Senate handyman of John Pierpoint Morgan. The family of (Samuel Moses) De l Branco in 1559 moved from Italy to Germany taking the name Warbur g. In 1798, the family founded the bank of M. M. Warburg & Co. The 1907 financial panic had been ca used by the masonic banker J. P. Morgan, historian Fredrick Lewis Allen concluded in 1949. This was used as pretence to show that there was a need for a central banking system. Frank Vanderlip, who worked for Rockefeller, admitted later in The Saturday Evening Post: \"I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.\" Jekyll Island is a well-known resort on the Georgia coast. During the Jekyll Island meeting at the end of 1910, Paul Warburg emphasized that the term 'central bank' should be avoided under all circumstances. It was decided to present the project as a Regional Reserve System. It was made sure that Morgan 's candidate, the freemason Thomas Woodrow Wilson was elected president. His campaign was financed by Jacob Schiff, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morgenthau, New York Times' publisher Adolph Ochs and other powe rful Jewish financiers and free- masons. The high-ranking freemason Edward Mandel House, President Woodrow Wilson's confidential adviser, by many historians considered the actual president of the United States during Wilson's administration, proposed in his novel \"Philip Dru: Administrator - A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935\" (New York, 1912), which was pub- lished anonymously, a transition to a graduated income tax and a central bank. These requirements were known from the Illuminati five-point program. \"Colonel\" House was in favour of forming a world 151"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"government and adopting \"socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx\". To accomplish this he was willing to u se political fraud. His hero Philip Dru seizes the government of the United States with the backing of a secret cartel of rich and powerful financiers. The Federal Reserve bill was presented the night of 22 December 1913, when most of the members of the congressional committee were asleep. The same day the b ill was hastily pushed through the House of Representatives and the Senate, President Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act and control over money supply was transferred from Congress to private masonic bankers. Four times earlier the American people had managed to get rid of a central bank but not the fifth time. The Federal Reserve Act was hailed as the victory of democracy over the money trusts, which was hardly the case. Paul Warburg immediately began working at Federal Reserve for a salary substan- tially less than that he received as a banker. Neither the president, members of Congress nor the secretar y of treasure have any authority over the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve System is actua lly a cartel of 13 large private banks, of which the Bank of New York is the most important. President Woodrow Wilson allowed the national debt to grow from 1 billion dollars to 455 billion. Intere st became the third largest post of the federal budget. The United States borrowed up to four trillion dollars from various private banks in 1992. At the same time the deficit was 285 billion dollars. In 1991, another two millio n people were registered as poor in the United States. The national debt was slightly less than one trillion in 1980, in 1995 it was five trillion. The 32.9 million Americans lived in poverty in the year 2002). The economist Milton Friedman is convinced that the economic collapse of 1929 took place because the Federal Reserve System refused to buy government bonds, which would have given the banks more cash, and thus it caused the monetary crash, which in turn led to the deep economic crisis. 152"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"In the 1810s, the freemasons had brought poverty to Europe in order to prepare for their socialist revolutions. Particularly bad was the situation on Guernsey, one of th e Channel Islands. Slightly more than half the size of Jersey, it enjoys a mild and humid climate and fertile soil. People had no money to buy things, production stopped and workers went idle. There was no trade, and no hope of employment for he poor. Bankrupt cy was near, since taxes to England and interest to the credit ors could not be paid and no new loans were granted. The situa tion was desperate. People were beginning to leave the island and emigrate to Australia. In 1815, Guernsey needed a covered market. There was no money. Then somebody proposed that the island should avail itself of its ancient prerogative and issue its own interest free money. At first the proposal was turned down, but as they urgently needed 5000 pounds and only had 1000 pounds in hand, the in one pound interest free the States of Guernsey notes. This was in addition to the supply of English pounds, which two main banks were circulating on the island already. Work was begun on the market hall, everything being paid for with the new money. When the ha ll was finished, customers arrived and business was better than expe cted. By 1822 the market hall was paid for. The 4000 one-pound notes were destroyed. The first project with the new money was so successful that it was soon followed by others. In Glasgow, by comparison the orig inal fruit market in Candleriggs was built in 1817, and cost 60 000 pounds. This money was raised by an interest-bearing loan. Unlike Gu ernsey public market, repaid 6 years after it was built, the Glasgow market was not paid for until 1956 - 139 years later! Between 1910 and 1956 no less than 267 886 pounds was paid in interest alone (Olive and Jan Grubiak, \"The Guernsey Experiment\", Hawthorne, California, 1960, p. 14). Next a new road was needed. There was gravel, stone and plenty of labour - but no money to pay for it. In all, the state issued 55 000 pounds worth of notes, which paid for the new projects. A new 153"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"school was built, then several more . The whole surroundings of the market hall were renewed and ma ny other public buildings were constructed, as well as widening of the streets. A new harbour was built along with the best new roads in Europe and new sewers. The sum was paid for with taxation an d the notes were again destroyed. All these projects provided employ ment and economic stimulance. In 1827, the Bailiff de Lisle Brock was able to speak of \"the im- provements, which are the admirati on of visitors and which contri- bute so much to the joy, the he alth, and well-being of the in- habitants\". Things had certainly improved since 1815. It is significant that the great depression never troubled Guernsey. There was no unemployment, and the income tax was a flat ten per cent. Things got even better. The import of expensive English flour was reduced. The money supply never exceeded 60 000 pounds. Un- employment was practically nonexis tent. Guernsey became a prospe- rous island community. But the free masons abhorred this paradise, for fear that the idea should spread to other parts of Europe. In that case they would no longer be able to construct their destructive projects. The freemasons dislike happy people. In 1830, the banks launched a counter-attack and began to flood the island with their own notes. The bankers Finkelstein & Co of London were the first to open an office on the island. They started their propaganda for \"better money\", \"real money\". People believed this hogwash, which resulted in money shortage and loan appli- cations in the banks. The bailiff fou ght like a lion to save the island's sound economy and high standard of living - but to no avail. The intrigues and undermining work of th e freemasons steered the island economy over to the banks and their exploitation. The Guernsey experiment of 1816 to 1835 speaks for itself. We can do without masonic economy and do much better - but to try to do away with interest is considered the worst possible crime against humanity. In 1837, 50 000 pounds had been put into circulation by the government for the primary purpose of local projects such as sea 154"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"walls, roads, the new marketplace, a church and a college. These 50 000 pounds more than doubled the money supply, but there was no inflation. In 1914, while the British restricted their own money supply, Guernsey issued more - another 140 000 pounds over the next four years. By 1958, over 500 000 pounds of interest free money was in circulation on Guernsey and still there was no inflation. By 1990, there was a total of 6.5 million pounds in circulation issued interest free. There was no public debt as in the rest of Britain, which was still paying for its war debts. And yet on Guern- sey, prosperity was very much evident everywhere (Dr Jacques S. Jaikaran, \"The Debt Virus: A Compel ling Solution to the World's Debt Problems\", 1992). This was nothing new. In 1793, Liverpool suffered from extreme cash flow problems, and solved this by creating by an act of Parliament some 300 000 pounds of non-repayable money, which was used for public works with great be nefit to the city and its people. This issue of money by the Live rpool Corporation alleviated the immediate debt crisis. The Island of Guernsey issued its own interest free banknotes to rebuild the economy. 155"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"On 30 June 1934, the London magazine New Britain published a statement by the freemason and form er Prime Minister David Lloyd George: \"Great Britain is a slav e under the international financial powers.\" The masonic bankers during the last twenty-five years have lent money to the governments of the industrial nations, which find it harder and harder to repay their enormous debt. The private (read: masonic) sector has become exactly that much richer. This (masonic) monetary power has enough money to stop any intransigent poli- ticians. Popularly elected politicians no longer have any means of conducting the policies they wish. They cannot regain their power until the debts are paid. For ever y dollar borrowed, the politicians relinquish more power. The developing countries are in a much worse situation. They are not even able to pay interest on their loans. During 1982-1990 the banks of the indust rial nation s received 1345 billion dollars in interest and annuity from these poor count- ries. On 11 March 1932 at about 5 p.m., a man bought a pistol in Paris, claiming to be the well-known Sw edish international financier Ivar Kreuger. At that time, however, Kreuger met his companion Oscar Rydbeck, so obviously someone else bought the gun. The news- papers stated that the Swedish match baron Ivar Kreuger had com- mitted suicide on 12 March, because his financial empire was near bankruptcy. Nothing of this was true, however. The examining doctor Erik Karlmark immediately concluded that Kreuger had been murde- red. A close relative, Eva Dyrssen , was present to verify this. No autopsy was performed (Lars-Jona s Angstrom, \"Kreuger-mordet\" / \"The Kreuger Assassination\", Stock holm, 2000, p. 55). Ivar Kreuger had lent money at very low interest to save nations in trouble. In 1930 he lent 27 million dollars to Romania, an amount that today would equal 500 million dollars. The Kreuger group was helping fifteen governments and 400 million people in the same way (Gustaf Ericsson, \"Kreuger kommer tillbaka\" / \"The Return of Kreu- ger\", Stockholm, 1936, p. 63). All of Kreuger's assets were plundered. 156"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The German-Argentine economist Silvio Gesell (1862-1930) wished to introduce \"free money\". Margrit Kennedy relates in her book \"Interest and Inflation Free Money\" (1988) how adherents to Gesell's theory of a free economy in the 1930s made several attempts with interest free money in various countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the United States. Particularly successful was the model used in the small town of Worgl in the Tirol in Austria. In 1932 the ideas described in Silvio Gesell's book \"D ie naturliche Wirtschaftsordnung\" (\"The Natural Economic Order\", 1916) was intro- duced. In August 1932, the town council of Worgl issued their own bank notes, called work certificates, to a value of 32 000 schillings. Backed by an equivalent amount of ordinary schillings in the bank, the town put 12 600 work certificates into circulation. The fee on the use of the money was 1 % per month or 12 % per year. This fee had to be paid by the person who had the banknote at the end of the month, in the form of a stamp worth 1% of the note glued to its back. A ski-slope was built, streets were renewed as well as the canal system. They built bridges, improved roads and public services, and paid wages and building materials with this money, which was accepted by the butcher, the shoemaker, the baker, by everyone. 157"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The small fee made everyone put this money into circulation before using the 'real' money. Within a year, 32 000 work certificates had been in circulation 463 times and thus had made possible the exchange of goods and services to a value of 14 816 000 schillings. In comparison to the sluggish national currency it circulated eight times as fast. Unemployment was reduced by 25 per cent within a year. When 130 communities in Austria bega n to be interested in adopting this model, the Austrian Nation al Bank on 1 September 1933 prohi- bited the printing of any local currency. Unemployment returned, prosperity disappeared and the situation was \"normalized\" - that is freemasonized. Economic Slavery Interest charges are always includ ed in today's prices, which makes all goods and services very expensive an d leaves very li ttle money in the wallet. The economic historian John King has pointed out that because of interest, businesses must constantly raise their prices. This is camouflaged as inflation. He recommended abolishing interest as soon as possible, so as to avoid economic catastrophe. Everyone must now help to pay interest. It is included in all prices - about 77 per cent of rental rates, for in stance. Taxes and other fees and imposts add up. Thus we have become slaves of the banks. All goods would be only half as expensive without interest payments. According to the Swedish historian Herman Lindqvist, the free- masons decided in the 1810s that wages should be fixed at the poverty level. Such an attitude sh ows an enormous contempt for ordinary people. Between the years 1860 and 1910 more than a million Swedes left for America in due to several years of famine, poverty and difficulties in providing for themselves. During the Middle Ages conditions were much better than the masonic myths claim. It has been ca lculated that a Saxony bricklayer in addition to free food, in today's currency made at least 13 300 158"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"euros a month. Craftsmen usually r eceived various benefits in ad- dition to their wages. Despite the high wages, working hours were short, normally eight hours a day, and at that a five and a half day week. Mining journeymen in Saxony only worked six hours a day. Not until 1479 did they put in an extra hour. Often the journeymen enjoyed a free Monday, called blue Monday, usually without wage reduction. This was terminated in Sweden with the 1669 guild law (\"Bonniers stora lexikon\" / Bonnier's Encyclopaedia, Stockholm, 1985, p. 252). So as not to be confus ed with noblemen, craftsmen in Freiburg, in Saxony, were advised not to wear gold jewellery and velvet and satin clothes, even tho ugh they could well afford all this. The fact that the economy and cultura l life flourished was due to the bracteate coins, which were the ba sis of a system with continuous withdrawal of coins, because they often broke. Wit hdrawal occurred thrice yearly and also served as taxation. Using old coins was not permitted. No one wanted to hang on to 'bad' money, so as not to make a loss, since by the exchange of twelve (old) coins one received only nine (new) ones. The economy prospered because the effect of interest-generating money was not present. There was to be no interest charged. For the frail, the old and the sick there were sick houses and the rich usually prov ided housing, clothing and free meals for the poor. Wealth was relatively evenly distributed at all levels of society (Margrit Kennedy, \"Interest and Inflation Free Mo- ney\"). All this disappeared when the ma sonic bankers took control of the economy. From then on, no one could a fford a decent li fe. To enable us to stand this misery, the lie that things were much worse before is being propagated, which is certainly not true. The current interest system makes it possible for those that al- ready have money to get even rich er, while those in need find it increasingly hard to make ends m eet. From 1968 to 1982 the national income of West Germany increas ed by 300 per cent, while the interest on the na tional debt increased by 1160 per cent. In 1982, the interest amounted to 29 billion DM.

The government will have to be satisfied with a very low VAT, otherwise the grey economy will grow. As of now interest rates go up, when there is not enough money available. The European Community during the years 1982-1988 lost up to 735 000 jobs due to the de bt crisis, while the United States lost 1.8 million jobs during the same period. The Swedish national debt was 140 billion dollars in the fall of 1997, which makes Sweden more debt ridden than either Brazil or Argentina. Interest on the national debt was 11 billion dollars yearly, which is about 40 billion more than the cost of old-age benefits. Every Swede owed various banks 16 000 dollars in 1997. Half of the Swedish national income goes to pay interest. Twenty-five per cent of the export income went to support the national debt in 1990. The head of the central bank, Bengt Dennis, said: \"In the circles where I move, it is expected that Sweden keeps a high interest rate.\" In the beginning of the 1990s the bankers Salomon Brothers, that had provided the Swedish government with huge loans, demanded that the Swedish crown be devalued. The government complied. Argentina paid some 200 billion to its creditors most of which went to cover usurious interest pa yment. Argentina went bankrupt in the spring of 2002, having a national debt of 132 billion dollars. Two Jewish banks (Banco de Patricios and Banco de Mayo) collapsed in 1998 due to the owners' criminal activ ities. This was a final blow to the national economy. The Italian national debt in the summer of 2001 was astro- nomically 2 391 663 000 000 000 lire (145 831 500 000 dollars), roughly equivalent to 105 per cent of the GNP. The Sultanate of Brunei in northern Borneo has free schools and free medical care. There is no tax and no VAT, but the standard of living is very high. Interest rates are very low.

Norway also has oil and gas, but th e red politicians do not wish to abolish the income tax and other ch arges. Prices are horribly high, medical care means long lines. On 1 May 1998, exactly 222 years after the founding of the order of the Illuminati (222 being a third of 666, which in turn is a third of 1998), the European Central Bank was established, actually a cartel of private banks. All of the people shall be in debt through taxation. The masonic bankers are thus trying to realize the Knights Templar ancient idea of creating a Europe an super state by means of the banking system. The Danish 'no' to the euro at a referendum in September 2000 and the Swedish 'no' in September 2003 showed, however, that not every- thing goes as planned. One does not have to be a prophet to see that the euro does not stabilize the economy, though one must not say it out aloud. Bernard Connolly, who was head of the department of cur- rency policy at the European Commission in Brussels, in 1996 published a book, \"The Rotten Heart of Europe\", claiming that fixed exchange rates and the monetary union (EMU) would lead to instabi- lity and growing unemployment. He felt the result would be horri- fying. Connolly was summarily fired. At a visit to Sweden in August 2003, Conno lly stressed that the introduction of the euro would lead to economic disaster and to the fall of the European democracies. He claims that the euro is used as a pretext for forming an eco- nomic, political and military super state. The problems have become worse in southern Europe. Portugal for instance is at the brink of a pol itical breakdown and riots in the streets are not far away. This will th en spread to the rest of Europe. He compared the situation to the economic collapse in Argentina, but the EMU countries are worse off. Arge ntina was able to cut its ties to the dollar, but the EMU countrie s cannot abandon the euro. Con- nolly's analysis is considered extremely pessimistic.

A litre is a litre, but a crown of 2004 is no longer wort h the same as in 1910. Its value has sharply declined. Is that not strange? Swedish and American official sta tistics state that in the early 1970s, roughly 75 per cent of the average working man's income went to necessities such as food, li ving, clothing, education, medical care, as compared to. Today it is barely enough for both parents to work to make ends meet. In the 1970s the total value of the world trade of industrial goods was 50 per cent, the rest was in st ocks and shares. The year 2001 the relation was 1 per cent goods and 99 per cent trading with securities. Speculation dominates. The current monetary system encourages fraud and extension of the grey economy and has led to that those who constantly are in need of money lose more and more to those who have far more than they need. More and more money is collected in the hands of certain individuals, who happen to be mas onic bankers. If interest is abo- lished, everyone benefits from the new system, not only the 80 per cent considered poor. Alfred Herrhausen, member of th e board of Deutsche Bank, has pointed out: \"Those responsible fo r the current monetary system, know very well that it cannot last, but they do not know any alter- native or do not want to know of any.\" To the freemasons it is important to keep us in economic slavery, otherwise they would have done everything to abolish interest. Through taxes and duty the government collects most of the result of the economic activities of the people. What are then the freemasons' beautiful phrases of humanism really worth? The masonic leaders' foremost goal has been to conceal as best as they can the current economic slavery. One must ask oneself if they have been successful. 162"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE GLOBAL POWER OF FREEMASONRY The freemasons call themselves brothers and a freemason brother's duty is always to aid another brother come what may. Elie Wiesel wrote in his book \"Legends of Our Time\" as follows: \"Some events take place but are not true. Other events are true but never occur.\" That was his Talm udic wisdom, which corresponds to the situation that exists in today' s world, where the freemasons have an enormous influence. \"So you see, dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not them- selves behind the scenes,\" said Sidonia in Benjamin Disraeli's novel, \"Coningsby\" (London, 1844, p. 233). Disraeli admitted in the same novel that Rothschild financed the revolutions in France the year 1789, 1830, and 1848. Therefore it is understandable that Marx neve r criticized Rothschild. At the Soviet Communist Party Congress in 1979 Professor Valeri Yemelyanov stated that \"the Jewi sh freemasons pyramid controls 80 per cent of the economy of the cap italist countries and 90-95 per cent of the information media\". In 1781, the Jewish masonic lead er Johann Georg (Ivan) Schwartz at a Masonic Congress in Frankfurt, where he represented the Russian freemasonry. There it was decided that Russian freemasonry should be headed by just Schwartz, who actually came from Transylvania. At the convention organized by Adam Weishaupt at Wilhelmsbad Castle in Hanau in 1782, Russia became th e eighth province of freemasonry. It was agreed to annihilate th e monarchy in France (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1999, p, 163"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"126). Schwartz later become professo r at the University of Moscow, all arranged by the masonic brothers. After Schwartz's demise in 1784, his position was taken over by Baron von Schroder. In 1875 at the Masonic Congress in Paris, the illuministic practise of sacrificing blood by means of murder committed by freemasons was unanimously sanctioned. It wa s to become one of the main secrets of freemasonry (Nicolas Deschamps, \"Les societes secretes\", Paris, 1881). Furthermore, if a fr eemason lost his life, he should immediately be avenged. Freemasonry and Politics As early as 1709, the London periodical The Tatler issued a warning about the freemasons, \"who are involv ed in dangerous political acti- vities\". The freemason Gonnoud stated at the banquet of the convent of the Grand Lodge of France on 18 September 1886: \"We have been accused of concerning ourselves too much with politics, but what else should we be concerned with? We freemasons do nothing but involve ourselves in politics... By all means do we formally declare that we neither deal with religion nor politics. Is that then hypocrisy? We were on the contrary forced to keep secret, that which was our only concern.\" ( Bulletin du Grand Orient de France, 1886, p. 545; Paris Magonnique, 1896, P. V - VI) At a lodge meeting in 1893 a nother masonic brother declared: \"Freemasonry is a power organizati on, which submits its members to rules of discipline that are necessar y.\" (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secrets Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1999, s. 48.) The freemason Sicard de Plauzoles admitted that there was a war against the enemies of freemasonry and the Repu blic (\"Convente de Grand Orient de France\", Paris, 1913, p. 393). Thus freemasonry is engaged in an utterly dangerous war against the world to accomplish radical polit ical and magic changes, that will benefit its own perverted interests. 164"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"\"The main part of our work takes place within the upper grades.

Under their influence are several popular orga nizations, movements and societies with various names - all these are but various forms of freemasonry.\" One of these organizations late r became the Internationale. The French historian Edouard Fribourg, who was one of the founders of the Internationale, admitted in hi s book \"Association Internationale des Travailleurs\" (Paris, 1871) that the organization always stood for the interest of the freemasonry and not the workers. He stressed the fact that the Internationale everywhere was supported by free- masonry (William T. Still, \"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies\", Lafayette, Louisiana 1990, p. 137). Freemasons were elected to the Supreme Council (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1999, p. 50). Many workers have led a bloody struggle for freemasonry with- out even suspecting that certain privileged gentlemen were behind their excitement and their aim with ringing but empty slogans of solidarity.

Thus the revo- lutionary freemasons as well as the communist leaders and the radical socialists were totally unbalanced people. They are simply psychopaths. According to a study by the father of modern criminology and Pro- fessor of Psychiatry, Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909, himself of Jewish descent), at the University of Turin, there are among the Jews four to six times as many mentally ill as among other etnic groups, and in Germany the rate is eight times that of other Germans (Grigori Klimov, \"The Protocols of the Soviet Elders\", Krasnodar, 1995, p. 39). It is therefore understandable th at Jewish extremists are over represented among various sorts of \"revolutionary leaders\" and Maso- nic grand masters. The Grand Orient magazine l 'Acacia stated in 1910: \"Freemasons must walk hand in hand with the proletariat. On the side of the free- masons are the intellectual powers and the creative forces, whereas on the side of the workers supremacy and the destructive forces. By uniting them the socialist revolution will be feasible.\" At the international Masonic Conference in Brussels in 1910, it was proclaimed: \"From the day that an alliance between the proletariat and freemasonry under our leadership is secured, we will constitute an invincible army.\" In the struggle against the spir itual development of man free- masonry joined forces with socialism, communism, and international capitalism. The freemason Konrad von Hagern stated: \"I am totally convinced that there will be a time, and it must come, when atheism is the universal human principle.\" ( Freimaurer Zeitung, 15 December 1866) In this war against mankind, which is a slow process, the free- masons are free to break any law at will.

The French judges that are also freemasons are more loyal to the masonic Order than to the laws of France. Masonic politicians are more likely to serve their brothers than their country. Masonic bank directors put their \"brothers\" first and together with other masonic ba nkers they block loans and even drive desired non-freemasons into bankruptcy. Like wise a freemason policeman will help a masonic criminal. This practice of helping each other first is frequent within the central administration of the European Union, where several high officials are freemasons (Brian Fr eemantle, \"The Octopus\", London, 1995). The Grand Orient freemasons within the EU Commission and the EU Parliament have above all co-operated with mafia groups. This has been confirmed by EU parliamentarians such as Leoluca Orlando, John Tomlinson, Terry Wynn and Peter Price. Totally criminal French and It alian masonic lodges have great influence over the EU Commission in Brussels and the EU Parliament in Strasbourg. This was admitted by the spokesman of the Grand Lodge of Great Britain, John Hamill. The Belgian Grand Orient is also criminally involved. Its masonic brot hers are in the upper echelons of the EU Commission, where they are ab le to influence decisions made by this non-elected executive body. The Grand Lodge of France has very influential members in both th e Commission and the Parliament. The Grand Orient of France in fact is considered the most active and most powerful in all of Europe. Within the central EU institutions the freemasons wreak havoc without any hindrance. They are according to John Hamill all socialists and have connection to the Mafia. All proposals of registering all freemasons within the EU parliament have been stopped ( ibid).

He empha- sized that a similar conspiracy was well under way in twentieth century Europe. During the Second World War, Fa? published many important data that he had uncovered. In 1943, he helped produce a revealing film, \"The Occult Forces\" (\" Forces occultes\"), the story of a young Frenchman who infiltrates the brotherhood to investigate its role in initiating the war. The f ilm showed how the masonic power over several countries had grown gradually. At the same time many occult secrets that the freemasons had kept hidden were revealed. The film is today banned from public showing. Bernard Fa? was appointed head of Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, where he initiated valuable research into the French archives of secret societies and revealed the names of 17 000 conspirators. The Vichy government immediately de ported 520 dangerous freemasons and executed 117 extremely dangerous ones. After the war the freemasons got their revenge. Bernard Fa? was sentenced by a masonic tribunal (kno wn as a war crimes tribunal) to life imprisonment in 1953. After serving seven years, however, he was pardoned by President Charles de Gaulle in 1960. France was where freemasonry was most avidly used politically. Louis XV soon realized that the free masons constituted a threat to society, and in 1738 the activities of the lodges were banned. On 21 October 1738, the king of Sweden, Frederic I, declared freemasonry illegal. No masonic meetings were allowed, transgressions were punished by death. Slightly earlier freemasonry had also been banned in Spain. The evil intentions of others are quickly forgotten, however. French masonic pamphlets from the 1740s onwards quite legally began propagating revolution and a democratic republic. People were to be equal and live in brotherly freedom, that is the kind of \"freedom\" the masonic lodges would allow them. At the end of the 18th century freemasonry shifted to a political direction. The driving force behind this was the Illuminati. 168"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Whereas the British lodges still ou twardly acted as gentlemen clubs with only three degrees and strict rules against the discussion of politics or religion during meetings, there appeared in France lodges that due to their secrecy acted as safe meeting places for various political intrigues. Thes e secret lodges suddenly took a new direction and began propagating abolishing all religions, civilian government, private property, and the creation of a Utopian world citizenship (cosmopolitism). The cosmopolitan lodg es Chevaliers Bienfaisants, Philalethes, and Amis Reunis, led by the Duke of Chartres, were known as \"improved lodges\". Ther e were 266 such lodges in 1784 (John Robison, \"Proofs of a Conspiracy\", Belmont 1967, p. 28). Lodge des Chevaliers Bienfaisants publishe d one of the first works propa- gating Cabbala and cosmopolitism. These actions were necessary for the Illuminati, who apparently were behind this sudden change, to rule the world. The Illuminati The secret society that controls everything within freemasonry, was founded in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, on 1 May 1776 as the Perfectibilists (Orden der Perfektibilisten). Th e founders were the 28-year-old university professor Adam Weis haupt, his student Prince Anton von Massenhausen (alias Ajax), who had had helped write the statutes, and the adviser Mertz (alias Tiberi us). The 20-year-old Franz Xaver Zwack was registered as Cato on 29 May 1776. Adam Weishaupt's father Johann Georg (1717-1753), who was from Westfalen had been appointed profe ssor of criminal law at Ingolstadt in 1746. Presumably in 1779 the new secret and subversive organization was rechristened Orden der Illuminaten (The Illuminati Order), and Weishaupt attached it at certain well-chosen points to freemasonry. Its most important slogan became: \"The Illuminati must rule the world!\" 169"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Under the name of les illumines, a similar sect appeared in Picar- die in France in 1623, but succumbed in 1635. Weishaupt developed secrecy without precedence. No one except the areopagi (that is the highest-ranking Illuminati) were to know that he was the leader. All writte n messages were in code. The leader and other members as well as the lodges received covert names taken from antiquity. Adam Weishaupt (alias Spartacus) underlined: \"The great strength of our Order lies in its secrecy. May it never appear under its real name but instead always be hidden by a nother name and another activity.\" The one who later helped Weisha upt gain admission to various masonic organizations was his closest associate Adolf Baron von Knigge (Pat Brooks, \"The Return of the Puritans\", Fletcher, North Carolina, 1976, pp. 68-69). He was born in 1752 in Bredenbeck in Bavaria. In 1777 he attained the highest degree of the Knights Templar (the Cypric Knight) at Hanau. The then 27-year-old Knigge became one of the Illuminati in Frankfurt in July 1779 under the name of Philo, named for the famous Jewish sage. It was largely due to him that the order spread all over Germany. Both money and sexual favours were used to ma nipulate people in high positions. 170"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Jakob von Manvillon who had plans for a revolution in Germany was one of Knigge's students (Augustin de Barruel, \"Memoires pour servir l'Histoire du Jacobinisme\" / \"Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism\", London, 1797). Illuminati lodges were also formed in Austria, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, and Italy. In Holland illuminism spread like a bushfire. Lodges were founded in Leyden, Harlem and Neuden. The motto of the IUuminati was freedom, equality, and brother- hood. In the Soviet Communist Party Program (Tallinn 1974, p. 29) it says that the bourgeoisie only used these oath words to bring down the feudal class and gain power for itself. It is a matter of political fraud in other words. Weishaupt stressed that the Orde r would rule the world: \"Every member therefore becomes a ruler.\" They all think themselves quali- fied to rule (John Robison, \"Proof s of a Conspiracy\", Belmont, 1967, p. 123). Robison, professor of human philosophy and secretary of the Royal Society, Edinburgh, Scotland, clai med that evil men used free- masonry as a tool for their own purposes. Weishaupt had the intention to initiate economic and psycho- logical warfare between different nations and peoples, and also to wage a magic war against the oppone nts of illuminism. Weishaupt claimed that the plan for the New World Order could not successfully be executed \"in any other way than through secret societies that gradually and quietly take over the government\". His utmost aim was through a cunning strategy to start a world revolution. He wished to unite all peoples into a world republic. That the IUuminati really were responsible for the bloodbath that took place during the great turmoil in France 1789-1793, was con- firmed by the freemason Marcel Valmy, who is a filmmaker from Munich, in the book \"Die Freima urer\" (Cologne, 1998, p. 27).

Among the Jewish bankers who are said to have helped finance the French Revolution are Daniel Itzig (1722-1799), David Friedlander (1750-1834), Herz Cerfbeer (1730- 1793), Benjamin Goldsmid (1755- 1808), Abraham Goldsmid (1756-1810), and Moses Mocatta (1768- 1857), partner of the Goldsmid brothers, and uncle of Sir Moses Montefiore (Olivia Marie O'Grady, \"The Beasts of the Apocalypse\", First Amendment Press, 2001, p. 123). All were connected to the Illuminati. The revolutionary and freemason Ge orges Jacques Danton was also an illuminatus. Within the orde r he was known as Horace (Douglas Reed, \"The Controversy of Zion\", Durban, 1978, p. 151). The astrological symbol of the Illuminati Order was the sun. The demonic nature of illuminism was hidden behind Christian terms. Their hidden symbol came to be a red rose, which had been taken from the Tudor dynasty in Englan d. When the rose withers, the stench is unbearable. The Rose is a powerful magic symbol of freemasonry. James Gra- ham (33°) wrote in the Journal Scottish Rite (January/February 2004, p. 37): \"As masons, we use symbols to teach and learn...\" He stated that freemasonry use the rose as an ancient and important symbol. As Scottish Rite masons, th e rose is an important symbol in the 18 th degree, Knight of the Rose Croix. Albert Pike in \"Morals and Dogma\" (Charleston, 1871, p. 291) said that the rose \"is a symbol of Dawn, of the resurrection of Light and the renewal of life\". On 1 May 1912, the Swedish socialists began using the red rose as their political symbol. Not until 1979 was the rose officially adopted as their symbol.

At the initiation into the Order the new brother had to promise: \"I shall never use my position or my office against a brother.\" To this corrupt group loyalty did, however, not concern the brothers as individuals but only as tools for the invisible power of the order. This power could equally well be used against the brothers themselves, that is if \"the end\" (Weishaupt himself) demanded so.

The highest Illuminati (the 13th degree) were called the invisible areopagites. According to Weishaupt a lie repeated often enough, is accepted by public opinion as truth. Those that accepted the Illuminati propag anda, were to be categorized as liberals and humanists. Others were to be discredited. As the more conservative and patriotic ruler, Duke Karl Theodor came to power in Bavaria, he issued a ban against all secret societies on 22 June 1784. Another even sharper decree was proclaimed the following year on 2 March 1785. On 11 February 1785, Weishaupt was discharged and forbidden to live in Ingolstadt and Munich. At the same time, the university was informed that Weishaupt would be arrested. On 16 February, he went underground and was hidden by his Illuminati brother Joseph Martin, who worked as a locksmith. A few days later he fled from Ingolstadt to Nuremberg dressed in the working clothes of a craftsman. He stayed in Nuremberg a short while and then travelled on to the free city of Rathenburg where he continued his activities, but then a stroke of fate occurred that put the police on tracks of the Illuminati (Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 291). 173"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"On 20 July 1785, the courier of the Illuminati Jakob Lanz (who worked as a priest) was struck by lightning in Rathenburg and died.

He had sewn in a list of IUuminati members and some compromising papers into his priest's robe. Weishaupt did not know about this and became the victim of his own conspiracy (Countess Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 291). The local police found other important documents at Lanz' house, including detailed instructions fo r the planned French revolution. Some of the papers were addressed to the grand master of the Grand Orient in Paris. Everything wa s handed over to the Bavarian government and on 4 August 1785, a new ban on secret societies was issued. On 31 August, an order to arrest Adam Weishaupt was issued. A price was put on Weishaupt's head in Bavaria. He fled to Gotha, where the Illuminatus Ernst, Grand Duke of Saxe-Gotha, could protect him. The IUuminati had managed to infiltrate many key positions of society. That's is why the police in vestigation progressed very slowly. A house search at Zwack's, who was directly connected to the secret documents found on Lanz, was only made fourteen months after his demise - that is 11 and 12 October of 1786. Among the documents found with Zwac k, there was a plan to start a similar order for women, so that the order could amuse itself. There were also a recipe on abortion, a powder causing blindness, a sub- stance to open sealed letters without a trace, and a dissertation on suicide. A very compromising co rrespondence was also apprehended.

Several other members were discharged from their employments, all according to Illuminati General Leopold Engel. The sinister work of the Illumi nati was beginning to be unveiled. Leading the exposure were the spir itual Rosicrusians. Up until 1790 as many as 50 items about the Illuminati had been published with many embarrassing details of the criminal activities of the sect. George Washington stated that he knew of the sinister and dange- rous plans and teachings of the Illuminati. Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, dismissed Professor John Robison's revelations in his book \"Proofs of a Conspiracy against all Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the Secret Meetings of Free Masons, Illumi- nati, and Reading Societies, Collect ed from Good Authorities\", first published in London in 1797 and the year after in New York. Another strong opponent of the Illuminati was Abbe Augustus de Barruel (\"Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism\" / \"Memoires pour servir l'Histoire du Jacobinisme\", four volumes, London, 1797), as was the geographer Jedediah Morse. Thomas Jefferson was very interested in astrology, but according to the American masonic historian Gordon Wood not at all a free- mason.

In 1786, Marquis de Mirabeau founded an Illuminati lodge in a Jacobin monastery in Paris. These Illuminati members soon called themselves 'Jacobins'. Another Illuminati group was founded the same year in Frankfurt under the name The All-Seeing Eye. This group was later to be infamous as the Frankists. The lodge was led by the extremist Jews Jakob Frank and Michael Hess, the latter employed by Meyer Amschel Rothschild. 175"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Weishaupt claimed that the aim of the order was to \"forward humane and social ideas, to obstruct all evil infusions, to support Virtue, wherever it be menaced or suppressed by Viciousness, to promote merited individuals and to spread useful knowledge among the large group of people, which at present are denied all education\". He believed that the power of the Church should be replaced by the rule of the Illuminati. The Illuminati Order had been founded on principles similar to those of the Jesuit Order. Adam Weishaupt had for five years been working on a system that suited him. The Order was divided into three classes whereas the Jesuits had four. The first class consisted of novices and the less enlightened (k nown as Minerval), the second class were freemasons (and the Sco ttish Knights), and the third class - the Mystery class - was for priest s, princes as well as magians, and finally one king or general. 176"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Illuminati candidate had to undergo many difficult trials, swear an oath of eternal silence and accept that the order should rule his life. From one degree to anot her the procedure was repeated. In- stead of reaching the gate of wisdom, all became wretched tools in the hands of Weishaupt. He did no t wish to create an ethical-philo- sophical society at all but a subversive society that immediately be- gan transforming its members into psychopaths. Weishaupt in other words was dealing with deception. According to the writer Rudolf Rockoffner, the Illuminati became a criminal organi zation (Rockoff- ner, \"Frimureriet\" / \"The Freemasonry\", Stockholm, 1866, pp. 35-36). The Illuminati admitted into the highest degree had to have a red cap at the meetings of the order. This cap was adopted by the Jaco- bins during the so-called French Revolution. To humiliate Louis XVI, the Illuminati functionaries put red cap on his head on 20 July 1792. The masonic revolutionaries were pr eparing him for his meeting with death. The supranational socialist power the Illuminati aspired to was summed up in the concept of Novus Ordo Seclorum (the New World Order). Some of the main poi nts of this program were: 1. Suppression of all religion, including all communions and doctrines which could not be subjected as tools for illuminism. 2. Suppression of all Sentiments of nationality and - in the long term - abolition of all na tions and introduction of an illuministic world government. 3. Successive transference of all private and national property into the hands of the Illuminati. The methods through which to accomp lish this were new taxation laws, which illuministic officials were to introduce. Weishaupt's original plans also included a pr ogressive income tax and an even more confiscatory inheritance tax. Karl Marx also wanted a high, progressive income tax in his \"Communist Manifesto\". The intention was to weaken society. 4. An all-encompassing espionage and denunciation system with the \"insinuating brothers\" as prototype. 177"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The symbol of this was the all-seeing eye, an eye within a pyra- mid, which was the illuministic sy mbol of power. It was also known as \"the evil eye\", which symbolized Osiris. This symbol originated from the Brotherhood of the Serpent (Dragon) of ancient Egypt, at the same time proclaiming Lucifer as wisdom incarnate. And finally: 5. A global moral rule, a complete standardization of the innermost will, wishes and aspirations of all peoples beneath \"the one will\", the will of the Illuminati. This is symbolized by olive branches. These five rules are also denoted by the five-pointed star of freemasonry. The secret code of the Illuminati is 666. The code number of King Solomon was also 666. Every year he demanded 666 talents of gold (I Kings 10:14). The design of his throne incorporated the code 666. The tale of Solomon is th e basis for masonic magic. The Illuminati simply wanted to abolish all forms of ordered government, patriotism, religion and the family to finally set up a world government. Righteous people would never work for such an abhorrent program, so the \"ordinary\" Illuminati were filled with fair phrases about love, charity and such which we call \"ideology\" today. The further up one advanced, the more primitive were the members. The more primitive the individuals, the lower the ideals guiding them. In 1776, the same year as Weis haupt founded his order, Moses Mendelssohn (actually Moses Menachem-Mendel) formed a well- manipulated haskalah movement only for Jewish illuminoids. Haska- lah is Hebrew for illumination. Mendelssohn was Weishaupt's \"in- visible\" teacher (Marvin Antelman , \"To Eliminate the Opiate\", New York-Tel Aviv, 1974). The confidence man Mendelssohn financed the illuminatus de Mirabeau, and the illuminatus Friedrich Nicolai was close to Mendelssohn. Behind him we re the Kahal, the secret Jewish council (Moses Samuels, \"Memoirs of Moses Mendelssohn\", London, 1825, p. 159). 178"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Several ignorant writers have claimed that the organization no longer exists that it ceased to exist already in the 1780s. The Illuminati certainly vanished from the scene but reappeared as a network of reading societ ies all over Germany. In the city archives of Dresden, there is a letter written by Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia on 3 October 1789 from Berlin to Grand Duke Friedrich August III of Saxony, where it says that the Illuminati had spread all over Ger- many and constituted an utterly dangerous sect. Even several well-checked official sources confirms that the Illu- minati were re-created (that is, reorganized) in Dresden in 1880 (\"Kleine W. P. Encyclopaedic\", Brussels/Amsterdam, 1949). It was actually Theodor Reuss, who reorganized the Illuminati Order in Munich in 1880, according to the Sp ecial Archive of the Soviet Union in Moscow. Leopold Engel took over as general of the Illuminati world organi- zation in 1893. The Danish National Encyclopaedia (Copenhagen, 1997, Vol. 9, p. 266) states that the Illuminati Order as an inter- national lodge again was reorgani zed in 1896 and its headquarters moved to Berlin. In the beginning there were 8 + 2 secret Illuminati degrees. Today there are 13 degrees. The organization was reorganized under the name Ordo Illumina- torum, which was fully active in Germany as late as the end of the 1970s, according to the German historian Peter K. Koenig. Their masonic pyramid has thirteen steps. On the Great Seal of the United States thirteen five-pointed masonic stars form the six- pointed Star of David on a pyramid. Efraim Briem, a professor and freemason, states in a Swedish ency- clopaedia (Vol. 14, Malmo, 1950) that \"in 1906 a new Illuminati Order was founded in Germany, which clai med to be a continuation of the old, without there being any real ties between them\". This means that the order was still allowed in Germany.

Preparations for reorganizi ng the German organization began in 1926. The headquarters of the Illuminati moved to Switzerland during the First World War and to New York after the Second World War (The Harold Pratt building). The Rockefe llers instead of the Rothschilds now funded the Illuminati (William Guy Carr, \"Pawns in the Game\", 1954). After the Second World War up until 1963, Julius Meyer was the Illuminati world leader ( ibid). The Illuminati (Council on Foreign Relations) and the Trilateral Commission headquarters is located at 58 East 68th Street in New York City and not at 345 East 46th Street (suite 711), as they officially claims. According to the Norwegian Encyclopaedia (Store Norske Lexikon, Oslo, 1979, Vol. 6, p. 183), the Illuminati still continue their activi- ties as a secret organization. There was also the So ciete des Illumines d'Avignon that used to gather at Mount Thabor outside of Avingnon. The Group was founded in 1783 by the freemason Antoine Joseph Pernetty in Avignon in southern France. Both Cagliostro and Fredric Antoine Mesmer were members thereof. Later this group was transferred to Montpellier and was retitled the Academy for True Freemasons. We Are Ruled by the Freemasons During its subversive period between the years 1868 and 1874 the freemasons declared Spain a republic in 1873, but the royalists managed to destroy the republic in 1874, and Alfonso XII ascended the throne. The freemasons tried to murder his son, Alfonso XIII, on 31 May 1906. At the celebration on 24 July 1854, arranged by the Grand Orient de Belgique, it was agreed that thenceforth freemasonry would be able quite openly to involve itself in politics (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1999, p. 104). 180"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"In 1886, the masonic brother Gonnoud stated: \"There was a time when our statutes proscribed that freemasonry should not concern itself with political and religious matters.

Only due to the law and the police were we compelled to hide that which was our sole aim.\" (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1999, p. 105) The coup d'etat of the freemason Napoleon Bonaparte 9-10 Novem- ber 1799 (under the Sign of Scorpio) was organized together with the Grand Orient. He was initiated into the Philadelphia lodge in Paris in 1798. Also his brothers Joseph, Lucien, Louis and Jerome were free- masons. Joseph Bonaparte was even grand master of the Grand Orient of France. Napoleon's personal counc il had six members of which five were freemasons. Napoleon was initially sympathetic to the Jews, but later changed his mind due to certain events. In 1806 he summoned the Sanhedrin (the Jewish World Council), which c onsisted of leading Jews from all over the world. Instead of givi ng them political and economical power, he put restrictions on them. Adolf Hitler used a similar tactic. The Zionists and masonic leaders we re furious and threatened to destroy the emperor. At the head of a conspiracy towards Napoleon was general of the army, and masonic master Jean Victor Moreau (Henry Wilson Goil, \"Goil's masonic Encyclopaedia\", Richmond, Virginia, 1995, p. 274). On 13 October 1809, the student Friedrich Staps tried to kill Napo- leon at Schonbrunn outside Vienna. The French emperor called him an illuminatus (Johannes Rogalla von Bieberstein, \"Die These von der Verschworung 1776-1945\" / \"The A nnals of Conspiracy 1776-1945, Flensburg, 1992, p. 90). The coup d'etat of Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (nephew of Napoleon I) on 2 December 1851 was also a work of the freemasons within the military. He had been elected president of France on 10 December 1848, but he wanted to be emperor. The day after the coup his cousin Lucien Murat was appointed grand master of the Grand Orient. 181"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"There is a letter extant sent from the Grand Orient to Charles Louis Napoleon. In the letter dated 15 Oc tober 1852, it is mentioned that Charles Louis was illuminated by the light of freemasonry. The freemasons liked to be portrayed as the soldiers of humanity under the leadership of Charles Louis Napoleon. The letter was concluded with the salute \"Long live the Emperor!\" On 2 December 1857, he was proclaimed Emperor of France under the name Napoleon III. The freemasons acted at will. Wh en called for, they founded a republic - when an empire served their interests, they proclaimed one. So when Napoleon III decided to pursue a more independent course, a decision was made by the Grand Orient of France: the emperor must be deposed! The di fficulties had begun in 1861. The freemasons wanted war with Prussia. The emperor tried to avoid that, since he thought France was ill prepared. This made no difference to the freemasons. They had to prevail and they wanted war. That's what their so-called \"friendship be tween nations\" really looked like (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of T horns: The Secret History of Free- masonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 2000, Volume II, p. 60). On 19 July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Prussia was given all possible aid in order to crush Napo leon III. The freemasons replaced the French commander-in-chief Patrice de MacMahon (1808-1893) in August of 1870 with Marshal of France Francois Achille Bazaine (1811-1888), who was a high-ranking freemason. His task was to lose the war. When the Germans had captured the French emperor at Sedan on 2 September 1870, he was overthrown in France two days later through a \"revolution\", where the freemasons had used the Internationale as their willing instrument. Napoleon III was vilified in a wild frenzy of accusations (Paul Copin-Albancelli , \"Pouvoir occulte contre la France\", 1908). Thus on 4 Sept ember 1870, a masonic government came to power by means of yet another coup. Nine of eleven mem- bers of the cabinet were freemasons, of which three were high- ranking ones and Jewish extremists - Isaac Adolph Cremieux, Alex- andre Glais-Bizoin and Leon Gambetta. 182"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Officially the freemasons had no involvement in politics. Here, however, we are concerned with reality. The French troops surrendered at Metz on 27 October 1870. It developed into a great scandal in France. People suspected Bazaine of treason. The masonic leader Leon Gambetta was forced to have him prosecuted. In 1873, Bazaine was sentenced to death for high trea- son, but the sentence was commuted to twenty years in prison by MacMahon. The following year he \"managed\" to escape from an island off Cannes and spent the rest of his life in poverty in Spain. Freemasonry together with the Illu minati have with all their might checked the spiritual development, been behind several political murders, all revolutions and all ma jor wars. Justin Sicard de Plau- zoles, one of the Grand Orient brothers, called freemasonry \"the mother of revolutions\". According to him, to instigate violent revolution was the divine duty of the freemasons. Nedelko Cabri- novic, who took part in the conspir acy leading to the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, said during the trial: \"Within freemasonry it is permitted to kill.\" (Taken from the trial prescripts.) Of ficially, he was murdered by the organization Young Bosnia and the Serbian secret society The Black Hand. Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin (1872-1932), and a close friend of Franz Ferdinand, revealed that the Archduke a year before the First World War told him that the freemasons had decided to murder him. The secret organization The Black Hand was founded on 9 May 1911 by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevic (alias Apis), who became its first leader. The freemason Dimitrijev ic together with Voja Tankosic and other conspirators had on 10 June 1903 stormed into the Royal Palace in Belgrade and killed the Serbian King Alexander and Queen Draga, and thereby started a \"re volution\".

Illuminati General Giuseppe Mazzi ni planned in the 1850s to cover all Europe with a network of masonic organizations and unite the European nations into a central committee. In 1834, Mazzini co- ordinated revolutions in various c ountries. As early as March of 1848 he dreamed of establishing the United States of Europe. Against such plans stood Austria-Hungary, wherefore the Grande Oriente d'ltalia demanded its destruction. Giuseppe Mazzini stated in his manifesto of Marc h 1848: \"Austria being the greatest denier of the European principle of nationhood must disappear. War against Austria! The in itiative to this European world revolution, which must lead to the United States of Europe, lies in the power of Italy, thus it is the duty of Italy. «The People's Rome» shall in its new universal republican faith unite Europe and America and all the parts of the inhabited world into the final all-encompassing world power.\" (Mazzini, \"Opere\" Volume XIII, Rome, 1884, p. 179) Similar schemes were later directed towards the German state, the great role model of freemasonry. M azzini joined the secret Sicilian societies of Young Italy (Giovine It alia) to his criminal network in the United States. He received funds to help undermine American society through his connections to th e Sicilian criminal families (la Mafia). He also controlled the carab inieri, who were under oath to assassinate people objec tionable to the leader , among those the kings of Italy. Despite the masonic schemes there was no republic, but instead the United Kingdom of Italy. On 4 November 1848, the French freemason and famous author Victor Hugo (grand master of th e Prieure de Sion) stated in the National Assembly: \"The French peopl e laid upon the ancient monarchist continent a foundation for an enormous structure, that will be known as the United States of Europe.\" On 19 July 2002, the News of Swedish TV4 stated that United States of Europe should be formed instead of the European Union (EU). 184"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"\"At the international Masonic Congres s, which took place in Paris on 1 6 and 17 July 1889, a world republic openly was proclaimed as the de- sirable end...

On 20 September 1873, Adriano Lemmi, a banker from Florence, Italy, became a new general of the Illuminati. He admitted: \"Freemasonry has as its aim to form and lead public opinion. It wants the influence on the government, which belongs to sound and powerful institutions. Th erefore it strives to place its own leaders in the administration, in th e legislatures, and at the highest pinnacles of power.\" Lemmi was a supporter of the revolutionary leader Giuseppe Garibaldi, and had been active in the Order to the New and Reformed Palladian Rite founded by Albert Pike. Lemmi had earlier been sentenced to a year in prison for theft and fraud in France (Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 344). Between the years 1885-1896 he was the leader of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia and in th at position became a successful instigator of political assassina tions. Lemmi was a close friend of Italian Prime Minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891 and 1893-1898), also a freemason. Crispi, who was a terrorist in his youth, conducted a ruthless domestic policy. Lemmi was born to Catholic parents but had to convert to the Mosaic faith to become a freemason leader. He was also a member of the highest palladistic masonic Council of Rome. After Lemmi the leadership was taken over by the extremist Jew Ernesto Nathan, who was also gran d master (Gran Maestro) of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia between the years 1896-1904 and 1917-1919.

It was Cremieux who in May 1860, together with Rabbi Elie- Aristide Astruc, Narcisse Leven, Jules Garvallo and others in Paris founded the Grand Jewish masonic Lodge L'Alliance Israelite Uni- verselle, which used B'nai B'rith as its executive organ. In 1863, Cremieux became president of the central committee of the move- ment. The motto of this organi zation was: \"All Israelites are comrades!\" In 1930, this lodge already had 30 000 members. Adolph Cremieux served as mini ster of justice in th e revolutionary govern- ment of 1870. Achille Ballori (freemason of the 33 rd degree) who in 1901 had become the chairman of the Italia n freemasonry and grand master of the Grand Lodge, demanded in 1908 \"the immediate implementation of the power of the lodge s on the political arena\". In the lodge La libre pensee in Aurillac (France), the masonic brother Pierre Roques on 4 March 1882 said the following, when referring to the role of the freemas onry in the French Revolution of 1789: \"The role of freemasonry is far from finished. When the political revolution is concluded, freemasonry mu st strive toward the social revo- lution.\" (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\" , Moscow 1999, p. 53) The lodges are not open to workmen. They are to be an underclass to the freemasons that will work out subtle means to oppress the proletarians. At the same time the social democrats are the busiest ideological watchdogs of freemasonry. They are spiritually degenerate and are more than willing to impede the development of others. In the lodge Parfaite Union in Paris on 23 July 1789 the following was concluded: \"The first sparks from our temples ignited the holy fire, which with the speed to the wind spr ead from east to west, from north to south and lit a flame in the hearts of all c itizens.\" (Pekka Ervast, \"Vapaa- 186"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"muurarein kadonnut sana\" / \"The Lost Word of the Freemasons\", Hel- sinki, 1965, p. 77) The political field of operation of freemasonry has expanded to all countries where lodges have been founded. As early as 1829, there were 3315 lodges worldwide (Alexander Selyaninov, \"The Secret Power of Freemasonry\", reprint, Moscow, 1999, p. 67). Modern freemasonry preaches intern ationalism, socialism, commu- nism, and globalism or mondialism - that is propaganda for a world government. Fred Zeller who was grand master of the Grand Orient the years 1971-1972, published a pamphlet of how to seduce youth for the ideas of socialism. The German freemason Raimund Mautner calls socialism \"the corporal freemason ry\". Other freemasons have also stressed that the freemasons with all their might must strive towards a socialist state. The German masonic magazine Latomia stated as early as 1849: \"We cannot help but greet socialism (Marxism) as an excellent comrade of freemasonry for ennobling mankind, for helping to further human welfare. Socialism and freemasonry, together with communism are sprung from the same source.\" ( Latomia, No. 12, July 1849, p. 237). The international masonic magazine Kosmos (No. 29, 1906) admitted openly: \"The spirit of our time demands us to control socia- lism, and some lodges have already found ways and means to achieve this goal.\" When the International Working Me n's Association was founded in London on 28 September 1864, Luigi Wolff, the secretary of the Illuminati leader Mazzini, was present and even initiated the statutes of the new organization, submitt ed to the Sub-Committee on 8 October. The board was solely made up of freemasons (Luber, Cremer and others). The activities of the Internationale were positively received by the freemasons. Its aim was globalism. The second Internationale was founded at the initiative of the lodge Le Socialiste in Brussels in 1889 ( Bulletin du Grand Orient, June 1943). 187"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The freemasonry stands for the unnatural multiculturalism. The Jewish General Wesley Clark, the high-ranking freemason and supreme commander of NATO forces in Kosovo, admitted to the TV network CNN on 24 April 1999: \"There is no place in modern Europe for ethnically pure states. That's a 1 9 t h century idea and we are trying to transition into the 2 1 s t century, and we are going to do it with multi- ethnic states.\" The freemasons, having relinquished nationalist sentiments, are willing to betray their country, when the interests of freemasonry so demand. Freemasonry thus is internationalistic. Masonic communists illegally procla imed soviet republics in Bre- men (existed between 10 January and 4 February 1919), Brunswick (28 February - 19 April 1919), Baden (22-25 February 1919), in Bavaria (13 April - 1 May 1919), an d Vogtland-Sachen (3 April - 12 April 1920). Similar attempts were made in Berlin, Leipzig, and Hamburg. National Geographic Magazine presented modern Russia over 60 pages in 1914. The magazine made a prediction: \"If Russia continues to develop at this rate, it will so on surpass all West ern countries.\" That could just not be allowed to happen, was the opinion of inter- national freemasonry. The French masonic magazine l' Acacia has admitted that free- masonry constitutes the first step towards the world government. The United States - the Masonic Executive Base The first accepted freemason that came to America was John Skene, who arrived in Burlington, New Jersey in 1682. This is told in official freemason records, but the first non-labourer to become a member of a masonic guild in America, was the Jew Abram Moses of Rhode Island in the year 1656. Dutch extremist Jews founded their magic lodge in Newport, Rhode Island, as early as 1658 (Viktor Ostr etsov, \"Freemasonry, Culture, and 188"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 603). These facts are too sensitive to be mentioned officially, but the secret history must be revealed. Estienne (Stephen) Morin, the French extremist Jew who appeared as a masonic leader in Great Britain, founded the political free- masonry in America. His followers were other masonic Jews such as Moses Michael Hays (1739-1805), Henry Andrews Francken, Bernard M. Spitzer, Isaac Dacosta (1798-1860), and Moses Cohen. There is also a reference from 1658 concerning the arrival at Newport, Rhode Island of fifteen Jewish families of Dutch origin bringing with them the three first degrees of freemasonry. Moses Hays started in Newport, Rhode Island, and Charleston a masonic core group of cabbalistic Jews, who had become millionaires in the Negro slave trade, among th em were the Lopez and de Leon families. Hays was himself a banker. All these people would soon plunge into the opium tr ade. These elements formed the Scottish Rite in the United St ates. Only prominent individuals were accepted. The Jewish masonic elite organized captured black people in Africa and transported them to America an d controlled every slave market in the United States. That alone the Jewish freemason Aaron Lopez had control of more than half of the combined deals in the Colony of Rhode Island (with Newport) is a well-known fact (\"Documents Illustrative of the History of the Slave Trade in America\", the Carnegie Institute, Washington\"). He had more than 5 per cent of all dealings with the black people for almost fifty years (1726-1774). There were other ships that he ow ned, but sailed under other names. The evidence is still available to see. More than 300 ships, owned by the Jews (Isaac Gomez, Hayman Levy, Moses Ben Franks, Isaac Dias , Benjamin Levy and many others), were engaged in the slave trade. The Jewish agency called Asiento, that later operated from Holland and England, helped Jewish freemasons provide black slaves for the colonists. With the yearly capture and transport of one million black slaves it is not difficult to figure that from 1661 to 1774 (113 years) approximately 110 million slaves had been removed from their native 189"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"land. About 10 per cent or eleven million black slaves reached the colonies alive. Each Negro was valued at about 100 gallons of rum, 100 pounds of gunpowder, or in cash 18-20 dollars . Later the price was 40 dollars. The blacks, purchased at the African coast for 20 to 40 dollars, where then resold by the same Jewish maso nic slave dealers in America for 2000 dollars. 11 million x 2000 dollars! This gives you an idea how the Jewish masonic leaders managed to build up tremendous for- tunes. Already from the start fundamentalist Jews we re actively involved in spreading freemasonry in America. The Jewish freemason Samuel Oppenheim's book \"The Jews and Mas onry in the United States before 1810\" (American Jewish Historical Society, 1910) proves this. Extremist masonic Jews wished to play the leading role. The Spanish extremist Jew Salomon Pinto became a member of the Hiram lodge in New York in 1763. Two years later he was already master of the chair. The banker Moses Seix as founded in Newport, Rhode Island, the Jewish lodge King David in the 1780s and became the first grand master of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island (1791-1800). All of the members were Jews. Other leading masonic Jews were: H. Blum (grand master of the grand lodge) in Mississippi, Jacob Lampert in Missouri, Nathan Vascher in Texas, Benjamin Jacob in Alabama, and Max Meierhardt in Georgia. As grand master of the grand lodge, Meierhardt, was also the publisher of The Masonic Herald. The extremist Jew Edwin Mark was grand master in Louisiana the y ears 1879-1880 (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Masonry, Culture, and Russian Hi story\", Moscow, 1999, p 604). Well- known Jewish grand masters were Solomon Bush in Pennsylvania, Joseph Myers in Maryland and later in South Carolina, Abraham Forst in Philadelphia in 1781, and Solomon Jacobs in Virginia in 1810. At least 51 Jews became grand master s. Also many orthodox rabbis participated in the masonic movement in the United States.

He was deputy inspector 190"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"general of freemasonry for North America in 1768, and grand master of Massachusetts from 1788 to 1792. Paul Revere in Boston was deputy grand master under him. J. J. Lanier shows in his articl e \"Jewish Masons in the American Revolution\" ( The Oklahoma Mason, December 1924) that the Jewish freemasons played a very important role in the American Revolution. The most fanatical masonic Jew was, however, Isaac Long, grand master of the lodge in Charleston, South Carolina (Alexander Selya- ninov, \"The Secret Power of Free masonry\", Moscow, 1999, p. 119). In 1795, Long went to Europe and re turned six years later with the statue of the idol Baphomet in his luggage. All masons in Charleston had to begin worshipping this awful monster. In addition Long brought de Molay's skull and ashes, which thereafter were kept in Charleston. After Pike's death in 1891, the Baphomet statue was sent to Rome (Oleg Platonov , \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret His- tory of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 2000, Volume I, p. 158). Isaac Long also brought with him from Europe the idea to introduce the 33-degree system in Am erica, which he also called the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The first great constitutions were signed in Charleston on 31 May 1801 (Domenico Margiotta, \"Adriano Lemmi\", Grenoble, 1894). In 1859, Long's position was taken over by the cabbalist Albert Pike, who began a close relationship with the Illuminati leader Giu- seppe Mazzini in Italy. The foremost lodge in America, St. John Lodge was founded on 24 June 1731 in Philadelphia. From Ph iladelphia and Boston (its lodge was founded 30 July 1733) freemasonry spread all over America. As early as 1732 Daniel Coxe, first m asonic grand master in America, proposed creating a confederation be tween the English colonies in America. The masons wanted to create a new, multiethnic society and an executive base for its international activities. The mother lodge in London began encouraging the masons in the American colonies to conspire and agitate against British rule. After having been forced to abolish in terest-free money, the colonists 191"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"faced enormous economic difficul ties. The freemasons provoked war between the British and the Fren ch, which in turn caused even greater financial problems for England. The British government therefore introduced even higher ta xes in the Amer ican colonies. This policy was proposed in London by masonic advisers, of course. Because of the American opposition, when the economic situation had severely worsened, the new tax es were repealed - except those on tea. St. Andrew's lodge in Boston usually had its meetings at The Green Dragon in the north of the city. The leading figures Paul Revere, John Hancock, and Joseph Warren used the British decision in 1773 of barring the colonists from the t ea trade, as a pretex t to start their revolt. The British had put a 3 % tax on all tea, which irritated many colonists. Warren later became grand master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts and a leading radica l in Boston. The British managed to murder him. Even in official masonic history it is admitted that the Boston Tea Party was planned and executed by St. Andrew's lodge and Loyal Nine in Boston. The Bradlee brothers in St. Andrew's came up with the idea. The operation, however, was directed by the masonic elite in London. On the evening of 16 December 1773, dozens of lodge brothers with Paul Revere at the head dressed up as Mohawk Indians, took over three British ships and threw 342 bales of tea into the sea. The leader of this raid was the freemason Samuel Adams. Masonic histo- rians admit that really was the case (Carl M. Hartreit, \"De skjulte br0dre\" / \"The Hidden Brothers\", Oslo, 1993, p. 141). It was a maso- nic action taken to protest against the many taxes. Britain imposed on the American colonies, while th e inhabitants had no influence in the British Parliament. Already in 1770 the freemasons had used the lie as a weapon, when they claimed that British troops fired on innocent Bostonians, when it really was a hostile mob. In 1794, King Solomon Lodge erected a monument to Joseph Warren in Boston. In the same year Paul Revere became grand master 192"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"of the Massachusetts freemasons. In 1825, the French General and freemason Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone to a great obelisk in the same place. In 1776, a special lodge was form ed for blacks that were anti- British. And in 1784 another black lodge was started under the name the African Lodge No. 459, whic h became known as Prince Hall freemasonry after the first black fre emason. The lodge declared itself the Independent African Grand Lodge No. 1. In Boston the blacks got yet another Prince Hall Lodge at their disposal in 1791, and in 1937 there were thirty-five grand lodges for blacks in the United States. The commander-in-chief George Washington (autodidact) used the masonic spirit to create solidarity among his troops - troops that had no country to identify with. La fayette noticed that Washington seldom used officers who were non- masons. He gathered around him only the most dependable - freemas ons. Most of Washington's gene- rals (thirty-three in total) were masonic brothers, among them Israel Putnam, Baron von Steuben, Henry Knox, Horatio Gates, and of course Lafayette. Only two were non-masons. The freemasons created the United States of America as an effec- tive base for their world-encompassing activities and to attain their utmost aim - world supremacy. The native inhabitants - the Indians - were in the way and their number had to be reduced. In 1900, there were barely a million left of the roughly 30 million natives, that inhabited the North American continent when Columbus arrived. The freemason Steven C. Bullock admitted: \"Masonry's first role, broadening of the boundaries of political leadership, can be seen as part of its support of enlightened values . Like the Revolutionaries, Masonry claimed to reject the older means of organizing society, the paternalism of patronage... Masonry could reject the particular interests of a small groups in favour of the good of the whole.\" (Steven C. Bullock, \"Revo- lutionary Brotherhood: Freemasonry and the Transformation of the American Social Order, 1730-1840\", North Carolina, 1998) A passage in the Supreme Council of 33° of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in Washington, D.C states: \"Members of the masonic 193"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"fraternity have always played an important position in our nation's history.\" One of the most evil masonic leaders in the history of the United States was General Albert Pike (born 19 December 1809 in Boston). He had studied law at Harvard University. He became one of the best- known lawyers in the South. Pike w as able to read and write in 16 different languages. Pike becam e a freemason in 1850 and joined Scottish Rite freemasonry on 20 March 1853. In 1854, he was appoin- ted as Deputy Inspector General for Arkansas, where he proceeded to introduce the Scottish Rite to hi s state. He was elected Grand Commander of the Consistory of Louisiana in 1857. The following year, Pike was elected to the Supr eme Council and on 2 January 1859 became Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council (leader of all freemasonry in the United States). He also became Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry, leader or high priest of world freemasonry, and a member of the American Illuminati. The revolutionary activities of Gi useppe Mazzini (violent anar- chism) had led to bad repute for the Grand Orient. Therefore Mazzini proposed a new, utterly secret orga nization, which was never to be mentioned at other lodge meetings, not even if the congregation consisted solely of fully initiated brothers. Only a chosen few from the common higher degrees were to know the secr et, according to the Italian historian Domenico Ma rgiotta (\"Adriano Lemmi\", Gre- noble, 1894, p. 97). Margiotta had been a freemason of the 33 rd degree within the Scot- tish Rite in Florence who later began to reveal the evil of free- masonry. The Grande Oriente d'Italia reluctantly admitted that Mar- giotta was a high-ranking freemason in the Savonarola lodge in Flo- rence. If one scrutinizes the material he has made public, it is evi- dent that many political crimes are a result of the sinister mani- pulations of the masonic lodges. Thus Mazzini was the one who orga- nized the Working Men's Congress at Rome in October of 1871 (Lady Queenborough, actually Edith Starr Miller, \"Occult Theocracy\", 1933, p. 214). 194"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Giuseppe Mazzini sent a letter to Albert Pike on 22 January 1870, in which he descried to Pike the new superior organization created by all freemasonry to achieve the Aim: \"We must allow all of the federations to continue just as they ar e, with their syst ems, their central authorities and diverse modes of correspondence between high grades of the same rite, organized as they are at present, but we must create a super rite, which will remain unknown, to which we will call those Masons of high degree whom we shall select (obviously referring to the New and Reformed Palladian Rite). With regard to our brothers in Masonry, these men must be pledged to the strictest se crecy. Through this supreme rite, we will govern all Freemasonry which will become the one International Centre, the more powerful because its direction will be unknown.\" (Lady Queenborough, \"Occult Theocracy\", 1933, pp. 208-209) Albert Pike formed this utterly secret organization called the New and Reformed Palladian Rite (or S overeign Council of Wisdom), which had been founded in Paris in 1737. It first had three important centres, which were Charleston, Rome, and Berlin. Through the efforts of Mazzini the organization eventually established a total of twenty-three subor dinate councils in st rategic places around the world, including five Grand Central Directories in Washington, D.C. (North America), Montevideo (South America), Naples (Europe), Cal- cutta (Asia), and Mauritius (Africa), which were used to gather infor- mation. All of these branches have been the secret headquarters for the Illuminati's activities ever since. Palladism in effect became a demonic satanic cult. This cult or religion worshipped Lucifer as a god, which is shown by its oath: \"The masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine.\" During the American Civil War, Pi ke served on the Confederate side as a brigadier general. He was appointed by the Confederacy to be the Indian Commissioner in order to create an army of Indian warriors. He became governor of the Indian territory, and succeeded in creating an army consisting of Chickasaw, Comanches, Creeks, Cherokees, Miamis, Osages, Kansas, and Choctaws. 195"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"His units of Indian tribes committed such cruel massacres that Great Britain threatened to interven e \"for humanitarian reasons\". The President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis (1809-1889), was there- fore forced to act against his own general and disband the Indian units. After the Civil War, Pike was found guilty of treason by a court martial for his evil deeds and imprisoned. The freemasons turned to Preside nt Andrew Johnson, who was a freemason himself (Greenville Lodge No. 19). On the 22 April 1866, President Johnson pardoned Pike. The very next day Pike visited the president in the White House. J ohnson was actually Pike's subordi- nate within freemasonry. For nine months the American press was kept uninformed about this (William T. Still, \"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies\", Lafayette, Louisiana, 1990, p. 123). On 20 June 1867, President Johnson was conferred upon - from the fourth degree to the thirty- second within the Scottish Rite. He later went to Boston to de dicate a masonic Temple. Albert Pike was one of the founders of the infamous white supremacy organization, the Ku Klux Klan, to which many free- masons belonged. The freemasons have firmly denied this, but he was actually the first Grand Dragon of the Klan in Arkansas and wrote the anthem and rules of the organization. His racist articles in his news- paper The Memphis Daily Appeal were written in the spirit of the Ku Klux Klan, for instance the one published on 16 April 1868. Here Pike shows his disgust for the blacks and speaks out for forming an organization for \"every white man in the South, who is opposed to Negro suffrage\", because \"with Ne groes witnesses and jurors the administration of justice becomes a blasphemous mockery\". In 1868, he also wrote: \"I took my obligation to white men, not to Negroes and when I have to accept Ne groes as brothers or leave free- masonry, I shall leave freemasonry.\" (Charles W. Ferguson, \"Fifty Million Brothers\", New York, 1937, p. 186) In 1868, Pike moved to Washington, D.C., and practiced law in the Federal Courts until 1880. He died in at his desk in his office at the Scottish Rite Temple in Washington, D.C. on 2 April 1891. 196"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" Albert Pike - leader of world freemasonry in the 19 th century. Albert Pike (his Illuminatus name was Limud Enhoff), who was called the Devil of the 19 th century, was very obsessed with the idea of world supremacy. When he became a mason of the 33 rd degree, and as a top Illuminatus in his mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas, he developed plans to take control of the world by means of three world wars and several great revolutions. Pike wrote a letter to Giuseppe Mazzini (whose alias was Emunach Memed), dated 15 August 1871 (or as he wrote it 0871). The histo- rian Domenico Margiotta published the letter in his book \"Le Palla- disme: Culte de Satan-Lucifer\" (\" Palladism: Cult of Satan-Lucifer\", Grenoble, 1895, p. 186). The inherent antagonism between di fferent ideologies was to be stirred up and made to explode in three world wars and three revo- lutions. The First World War was to destroy the three European em- pires, at that time being the last remaining bulwarks against illumi- nism. One of these (Russia) was to be made a centre of atheist totali- tarianism (communism). The Second World War was to erupt from heightened tensions between the Je wish race (and its spiteful Zio- 197"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"nism) and extreme European nationa lism (nazism and fascism). This war would weaken Europe economi cally and politically and commu- nism would expand and become as st rong as all Christianity, but not stronger, until the time was ripe for the final destruction of all society. A third reason for the Second World War was to create a Jewish state in Palestine. Gradually, it would be possible thereby to heighten the tensions between J udaism and Islam until it broke out in a war, which would involve al l of the world powers. The three revolutions, which would aid this carefully planned dissolution of all human civilization, were the Ru ssian, the Chinese and the Indo- Chinese. Someone seems to have implemented most of this evil scheme, despite the fact that it was announced as early as 1895. Concerning the last stage, General Pike wrote the following: \"We shall unleash the Nihilists and Atheists and provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the mu ltitude, disillusioned with Chris- tianity, whose deistic spirits will fr om that moment on be without compass (direction), anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view, a manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.\" Atheist communism was suddenly abolished in the Soviet Union in 1991 as part of the effort to expa nd the European Union - the most sinister of masonic projects, which will lead to the forming of the United States of Europe, the dream of Giuseppe Mazzini. Those American presidents that harmed masonic interests were deposed or murdered, even if they were freemasons, and were re- placed by dependable brothers. 198"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" In 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became William McKinley's vice presi- dent.

About his perverse initiation ceremony several articles were published in the American press on 26 August 1901. Hanging from a rope Roosevelt was flown around in tunnels and corridors under the masonic Temple, while wild screams could be heard. Thereafter he was hoisted up to a rotating globe and then he fell down by the feet of the grand master. He finally ended up on a platform rotating at high speed. B eside him were six beautiful women that actually were wax dummies. On the arena there were several gaping people that applauded every time one of the dummies fell down from the platform.

According to a radio speech Truman gave in 1941, George Washington built the foundation of the United States on masonic principles. Truman wanted to continue in the same spirit. On 19 October 1945, he advanced to the 33 rd degree within the Scottish Rite. On 22 February 1946, the Presi dent of the United States and masonic Grand Master Harry S. Trum an went to the American United Lodge (George Washington Memorial ) in Alexandria, Virginia and took an oath to govern the country according to masonic principles. In 1948, Truman appeared at a masonic meeting at the lodge Beach Grove No. 694, where he said: \"My work as a statesman is built on masonic principles. I believe that th ese leadership principles must be spread all over the world, and on these principles on e must build the entire civilization.\" In the same speech Truman furthe r stated that it was more im- portant to him to be masonic gran d master than president of the United States, because a grand master disperses masonic blessing all over the world (Oleg Platonov, \"The Secret of Lawlessness\", Moscow, 1998, p. 404). How did Truman then spread the masonic blessing? Well, among other things by committing ritual mass murder in Japan, when in August of 1945, he gave order to annihilate hundreds of thousands innocent people in the cities of Hi roshima and Nagasaki. At 8.16 a.m. on 6 August 1945, an atomic bomb called \"Little Boy\" detonated some 2000 feet above Hiroshima, which immediately was turned into ashes and ruins. 80 000 people were instantly vaporized and 160 000 died during the following months, bringing the total death toll for Hiroshima to 240 000. Truman was very happy when informed of the bombing of Hiro- shima and the killing of an enorm ous amount of innocent people.

He pronounced exploding the hellish 203"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"bomb \"an overwhelming success\". On 9 August, another atomic bomb was dropped, this time on Nagasaki. These evil deeds against Japan were planned as early as May of 1943. There was to be no discussion with the other allies. The scien- tists were against using the bomb but were ignored. It would have been sufficient to demonstrate the devastating effect of the bomb to Japanese representatives at a test in the United States. The Ameri- cans, however, wanted to use the Japanese as guinea pigs. After the war an American medical station was established in Hiroshima. Its only task was to document the symptoms of the bombing victims without giving the patients any treatment whatsoever. 204"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Tony Benn (prior to 1964 Sir Antony Wedgewood-Benn), who was a member of the British government, stated that Japan long before the bombs were dropped had been willi ng to surrender. Truman didn't want to have anything to do with that. The Truman administration consiste d solely of freemasons. One of the most important was Bernard Manasse Baruch, freemason of the 33 rd degree. Not a single decision was made without consulting him. Secretary of State George C. Marshall and General Omar Bradley (West Point Lodge No. 877, New York) considered Baruch as their boss. The banker Bernard Baruch made 200 mi llion dollars on the First World War. He was also an advi ser to President Wilson. The official American military investigation of the strategic bom- bings during the Second World War, arrived at the following con- clusion in its 1946 report: \"Japan mo st likely would have surrendered before 31 December 1945, with great probability even before 1 November.\" Admiral William D.

The often cited figure in politically correct media of 35 000 only refers to the victims identifie d shortly afterwards. Most of these were, however, so badly burned that no identification was possible. Dresden was one of the most beautiful cities in Germany with a huge amount of art and cultural treasures from the 16 th and 17 th centuries. For one entire week the city burned.

Also parts of the city wall were destroyed. This evil act had also been planned far in advan ce. About one million people were living in Dresden. At least a third of the inhabitants were refugees. There were also plans to level all the historical buildings and monuments of Bamberg to the gr ound under the pretence that the Bavarian city was a railway junction. In the early morning of 22 February 1945, 500 American bomb ers took off from their bases in southern England. But something protected the cathedral and the monastery this particular day. Dens e fog and zero visibility had the effect that only two out of thr ee divisions reached Bamberg. The bombardiers had difficulty in locating the railway and the 300 giant bombers mostly hit orchards and empty farmland. The third division flew on and hit the neighbouring towns of Schwenningen and Villingen instead. Less than ten percent of Bamberg was attacked. Nuremberg by comparison was 98% destroyed by 2 January 1945. In all of Germany 19 major cities were laid waste, among them Hamburg, Cologne, Essen, Dortmund, Diisseldorf, Hannover, Mann- heim, Wuppertal, and Aachen. In addition, 26 more were badly damaged.

He was never charged with war crimes, despite the fact that his calculations as to the result that he promised were totally wrong. On 8 July 1940, Churchill wrote that against the Germans was needed \"an absolutely devastating, exter- minating attack by very heavy bombers on the Nazi homeland...\" (Geoffrey Wheatcroft, The Spectator, 29 September 1979). The afore- mentioned Webster and Frankland were of the opinion that history's judgment would be devastating of this evil deed. The United States occupied Japan until 1952. President Bill Clinton said at a press conference in 1995, that there was no reason to apologize to Japan for the two nuclear bombings. The Yalta agreement prescribed a poli tical division of the Far East after the Japanese surrender. Wall Street wanted such a division that in the future could cause possible ar med conflicts. During the Tehran conference it in the fall of 1943 , it was suggested that the Soviet Union should take part in the war against Japan.

Also Manchuria and the Japanese islands South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands was given to the Soviets for their participation in forcing Japan to submission. Truman was opposed to such a plan and when in power, his will would prevail. The same day the Americans dropped the second atomic bomb over Japan, on 9 August 1945, the Soviet Union for no reason at all declared war on Japan and broke the non-aggression pact between them. Japan surrendered on 15 Augus t, but the Soviets managed to occupy a few islands. First the Soviet troops entered Manchuria, which at that time was the Japanese protectorate Manchukuo (capital Xinjing, pr esent day Changchun). There and at Sakhalin 594 000 prisoners of war were taken, according to figures made offi- cial in 1990. The majori ty of these were brought to camps in Siberia, where 62 000 died, 46 000 of which have been identified; that is roughly ten per cent probably due to good physique. The Japanese were used in forced labour in th e construction of the Baikal-Amur main railway in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, and also in the forestry. Many died of starvation and of the cold. They were also subjected to intense communist indoctrination. When the US Congress approved 125 million dollars in aid to Chiang Kai-shek in 1948, Truman made sure it never got there and that Chiang was beaten by Mao Ze dong's red troops. Chiang's troops were constantly being diminished . The American aid to the free- mason Mao Zedong went through Moscow from 1945 onwards (William T.

All this was planned already during the Potsdam conference in the summer of 1945. For understandable reasons the United States wished to hide its role in this process. This was confirmed by Owen Lattimore, a Johns Hopk ins University professor specializing in China and Asia, Roosevelt's key advisor on China policy, and adviser to Chiang Kai-shek: \"The problems was how to allowe them [China] to fall without making it look as if the United States had pushed them.\" (Gary Allen, \"None Dare Call it Conspiracy \", Seal Beach, California, 1972, p. 76) The secret masonic society led by Sun Yatsen, which had grown out of the Chinese renaissance swore an oath, when its members were exiled in Hawaii, to return to China and topple the Qing dynasty. Just in 1903, the freemasons on twen ty-five different occasions tried to bring down the Manchurian Empire; the following year there were ninety attempts, and in 1905 they tried eighty-five times. The Chi- nese government successfully defend ed itself for eight years. The freemasonry tried at the same pace until 10 October 1911, when several secret so cieties (among them Tongmengui) in Wuchang star- ted its Xianhai Revolution (meaning \"year of the pig). The free- masons led by Sun Yatsen proclaim ed a republic in Nanking on 1 January 1912. The commander-in-chief Yuan Shikai forced in con- nection with this incident the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for 268 years, to abdicate on 12 February 1912. Yan himself became president. The Chinese freemasons had achieved their foremost goal. The six- year old emperor Po Yi was overthrown and thus ended an empire of 2000 years. Po Yi was allowed to st ay on in his palaces in Peking, but the treasures were sold, a normal occurrence at such changes of power. In 1934, the Ja panese named Po emperor of the protectorate Manchukuo, where he already had been acting head of state for two years. At the end of the Second World War, Po was captured by Soviet troops. When the People's Re public of China was proclaimed, 209"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Po Yi was extradited to Peking in 1950. He was one of the few monarchs not to be executed after a \"revolution\". He was released in 1959 after having been brainwashed for nine years in prison and was allowed to work as a gardener until his death of cancer in 1967. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were not freemasons, which disturbed the Masonic Order. Kennedy was assassinated, Nixon was forced to resign. Noam Chomsky be lieves that almost all the corrupt methods, which led to the fall of Ri chard Nixon, had also been used by his predecessor Lyndon Johnso n and other masonic presidents. President Truman illegally blocked Nixon's investigation of organized crime. Powerful masonic forces want ed Nixon to resign. Behind the discussion about his morals were pol itical and economic secrets. That is why he was isolated by the establishment, even though he had accomplished an enormous amount for the Illuminati. Freemasons were, however, the Swedish-American chief justice of the Supreme Court Earl Warren (33 rd degree), Senator Richard Russell (Winder Lodge) and Vice-President Gerald Ford, who all acted to get rid of Nixon, which happened on 9 August 1974. They used the Watergate affair of 1972-1973. Ni xon's successor was Gerald Ford, a mason of the 33 rd degree and a Bilderberger. The Jewish lobby in America had made use of the Watergate affair to break Nixon before he forced Israel to make the necessary with- drawals for peace in the Middle East. The Washington Star reported the following on 1 December 1971: «Former President Lyndon B. Johnson confirms that Richard Nixon as a Republican president was able to do things that a Democratic president was not able to do. \"Could you imagine the commotion,\" he mused du- ring a short interview, \"if I had been responsible for the expulsion of Tai- wan from the UN? Or if I had introduced price and wage controls? Nixon did it,\" he concluded with an admiring undertone. \"If I, Truman or Humphrey or some other Democrat had tried that, they would have totally destroyed us.» New York Magazine of September 1970 had an article by John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard socialist professor. In the article 210"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"called \"Nixon and the Great Social istic Renewal\", Galbraith claimed that the change during the Nixon administration was the new great leap towards socialism. This game was dangerous, since it was labelled conservatism. Nixon hims elf called his policy \"the New Federalism\". The historian Gary Allen, who wrot e a biography of Nixon, claims that Nixon lived in a house owned by Rockefeller in New York. Theo- dor White stated in his book \"The Making of the President 1960\", that Nixon was ready to do anything fo r Rockefeller to gain the trust of the family. Rockefeller acted through Nixon, who took as his adviser an extreme socialist and hateful freemason, Henry Kissinger (born Avraham Ben Elazar, according to The Jewish Press, 18 June 1976). The Case of Kissinger Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born on 27 May 1923 in Furth in central Germany, the son of a rabbi ( Washington Observer, 15 April 1971). His parents emigrated to the United States in 1938 and Heinz became Henry. From 1943 to 1945 he worked for US intelligence. Later he taught political science at Harvard University. Kissinger himself was educated by Professor William Yandel Elliott, who adhered to H. G. Well's crazy ideas. In 1955, he developed a relationship with Nelson Rockefeller (Frank Capell, \"Henry Kissinger: So viet Agent\", Cincinnati, 1992, p. 29). The poor Jewish refugee became a powerful figure thanks to the Rockefeller family that began using him as a proxy. In 1956, he was named editor of the influential magazine Foreign Affairs. Henry Kissinger is a high-ranking official of the Jewish masonic organization B'nai B'rith. He is also a member of the Bilderberg group and the Trilateral Commission. He belongs to the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina, the elitist Bohemian Club, a nd he is a member of Phi Beta Cappa Club, Cosmos Club, Federa l City Club, and Century Club. 211"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Kissinger was an adviser to presidents Richard Nixon and George Bush Sr. In the years 1961, 1969 and 1973 he passed the internal security check. The information on him was given by the State Department not by the FBI. In the beginning of his career as Nixon's adviser, he gained control of the intelligence services in the United States (Frank Capell, \"Henry Kissi nger: Soviet Agent\", Cincinnati, 1992, p. 9). In April 1946, Kissinger started t eaching at a school for intel- ligence agents. During this period he was recruited as a Soviet agent by the KGB, under the codename Bor (Gary Allen, \"Kissinger: The Secret Side of the Secretary of Stat e\", Seal Beach, California, 1976, p. 18). Kissinger was the architect behind the Christmas bombings of Hanoi and Hai-Phong in 1972. He became secretary of state under President Gerald Ford in 1973. According to Wall Street Journal, Kissinger helped Peter Wallenberg in Sweden illegally to export high technology to the communist Eastern Europe. Outwardly Kissinger was a liberal. Liberalism is, however, basically a leftist ideology. The Salt Lake City-Deseret News reported on 27 March 1970 that behind the desi gnation of Kissinger as national security adviser to President Nixon was Nelson Rockefeller. It was Henry Kissinger who toppled Richard Nixon by using the Watergate Affair (Gary Allen, \"The Rockefeller File\", Seal Beach, California, 1976, p. 176). Kissinger received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for having the communists win the Vietnam War. It was Henry Kissinger who was behind the oil crisis of 1973-1974, and he pushed through his plans at a secret meeting in Stockholm, Sheik Yamani, a former minister for oil of Saudi Arabia revealed in The Observer on 14 January 2001. Kissinger organized a quadrupling of the oil price in November 1973. The meeting Sheik Yamani referred to was the Bilderberg convention in the vicinity of Stockholm in May 1973. This was confirmed in Will iam Engdahl's book \"A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order\" (1993). 212"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"In the early 1960s, however, a serious drawback occurred that he had not counted with. A defected communist agent exposed Kissin- ger as a Soviet spy, codename Bor. Colonel Michal Goleniewski of the Polish intelligence service had sent a letter under the alias Sniper in March 1959 to the United , States ambassador to Switzerland, and revealed secret information leading to the arrest of SIS officers George Blake and Gordon Lonsdale in England. Both were tried and sentenced as Soviet agents. During Christmas of 1960 Sniper him self defected. He was a relatively high-ranking KGB officer, who exposed many Soviet agents in Great Britain. The information was verified and the spies were arrested. A little later Goleniewski turned over a list of Soviet agents in Sweden, which Swedish intelligence could verify. The Swedish socialist government, however, did not allow the arrest of any Soviet agents, except for one dangerous traito r, called Stig Wennerstrom. Next in turn were West Germany, Denmark, and France. Again all the information turned out to be correct and Soviet agents were caught. A total of 5000 pages of top-secret material were delivered by Goleniewski, plus 800 pages of Soviet intelligence reports and 160 microfilms. All information was correct. On 12 January 1961, Goleniewski arri ved in the United States. He had extremely important informati on about a spy at high level and demanded to see President Kennedy, which was denied. Instead he saw the head of the CIA and reveal ed who the secret Soviet agent was - Harvard professor and nationa l security adviser Henry Kissin- ger. The CIA reacted instantly - Goleniewski received 50 000 dollars to keep quiet and was henceforth expelled. Kissinger was such a power- ful member of B'nai B'rith that they no longer could touch him. He was allowed to carry on with his harmful activities. Kissinger had sent all of the most secret information directly to the Soviet Union. This was, however, leaked from CIA and got to the right-wing press. The American Opinion exposed Kissinger secret activities in April 1975 (p. 35) and in March 1976. All this was 213"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"verified by the historian Ladislav Bitman in his book \"KGB: Soviet Misinformation\" (New York, 1985, pp. 54-55). The Soviet agent Victor Louis openly visited Henry Kissinger in the White House on 13 November 1971 (John Barron, \"KGB\", Tel Aviv, 1978, p. 230). Anatoli Filatov, who worked for the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union, was recruited (lured into a trap of a sexual nature) in the beginning of the 1970s by the CIA in Algeria. Through him the CIA got very valuable secrets from Mosc ow. At one time they got hold of a copy of a letter from the Soviet ambassador to Washington, Anatoli Dobrynin (actually Gutman). In this letter Kissinger is revealed as a Soviet agent. The high-ranking freemason David Aaron, who worked for the CIA and at the same time was an adviser to President Jimmy Carter, did all he could to protect his \"brother \" Kissinger from being exposed. He wanted to punish Filatov for having given information on Kissinger. Through a Romanian diplomat he had Filatov exposed as an American agent. Filatov was arrested in Moscow and summarily executed. It turned into a major scandal in the United States, but Kissinger was once again saved. The freemason David Aaron betrayed his country to save a high- ranking masonic brother from being exposed as a foreign agent. The Kissinger case was hushed up. Davi d Aaron was never punished for his hideous crime. During his time as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made sure that all known anti-communists were discharged from the State Department (Gary Allen, \"Kissinger: The Secret Side of the Secretary of State\", Seal Beach, California, 1976, p. 129). Ki ssinger could not tolerate anti-communists, not even as a joke. On 4 March 1982, it was claimed on the American TV station Channel Eleven that former secretary of st ate Kissinger was sexually involved with young boys. The human rights activist, Ellen Kaplan, asked Henry Kissinger on the street: \"M r. Kissinger, is it true that you are sleeping with boys at Hotel Carlyle?\" Kissinger's wife Nancy 214"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"then tried to strangle Ellen Kaplan, who reported the incident to the police and Nancy Kissinger was arrested for attempted homicide. When the New World Order is implemented, the world will be very different, promised the freemason Henry Kissinger in a statement: \"There won't be so many left, but everything will be better for people.\" This is a remarkable humanistic thought. Sinister Plans The foremost aim of the freemasons was real world power. From the United Nations emblem it is clearly seen that the 33 degrees of freemasonry already control the worl d. Around this circular symbol, containing a grade network of 33 sections, there are two olive branches with 13 leaves on either side - which symbolize a con- cretization of the spiritual mean s of development. To the free- masonry the acacia is its chief sym bolic sign, whose esoteric mea- ning is 'very intense activity'. The mythical builder Hiram Abiff supposedly was covered with leaves of acacia, which to the free- masons also symbolizes immortality. Recently a commission to implement a world government has been formed by the UN. The former Swed ish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson shares the chairmanship with Shridath Ramphal. Jim Garrison, of the Gorbachov Foundation, and a high-ranking freemason, told The San Francisco Weekly (31 May 1995) that \"thi s is the next phase in 215"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"human development... during the next 20 - 30 years we will at last have a world government. That is inevitable\". Another well-known high -ranking freemason, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was equally honest when in the 1970s he stated: \"I have no i l l u s i o n that the world government will appe ar in our lifetime... We cannot transfer to a world government in one quick step... The necessary requirement for final and true globa lisation is a continuous regionali- zation, because that way we move toward larger, more stable, and more cooperative units.\" This is amazingly like a Stalinis t scheme: \"Later on the various regions can be united to form one single world dictatorship.\" (Josef Stalin, \"Marxism and the Na tional Issue\", Moscow, 1942) The well-known freemason James Paul Warburg said before the US Senate on 17 February 1950: \"We shal l have World Government, whether we l i k e it or not. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.\" David Rockefeller stated: \"We are on the verge of a global transfor- mation. All we need is the right ma jor crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.\" Strobe Talbot, who was president Clinton's assistant secretary of state, stated in Time Magazine (p. 70) on 20 July 1992: \"The best mechanism for democracy... is ...a fede ration, a union of separate states that allocate certain pow ers to a central government while retaining many others for themselves. Federalism has already proved the most successful of all political experiments, and organizations l i k e the World Federalist Association have for decades advocate d it as the basis fo r global govern- ment... The US is s till the best example of a multinational federal state... Perhaps national sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all.\" Thus the freemasons are ready to reveal their secret power by introducing a world government. The Swiss author Karl Heise publi shed the British freemasons' map of Europe of 1888. It shows the new borders of Europe as they were after the war.

The British newspaper The Truth published in December 1890 a map, showing those European borders that only became a reality in 1919. Three great empires were gone!

It is upon them that sets the blood of millions of dead and millions of dying.\" (Congressional Record, 67 th Congress, 4th Session, 1923, Senate Document No. 346) The high-ranking freemason Jacques- Yves Cousteau said in an interview to The UNESCO Courier (November 1991, p. 13): \"I n order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350 000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.\" In just one year it would amount to 128 million people. Cousteau meant that the world leaders had ten years to reduce the population, before it was time for drastic decisions. Thomas Ferguson, the Latin Amer ican case officer for the State Department's Office of Population Af fairs (OPA), wrote in the early 1970s: \"There is a single theme behi nd all our work - we must reduce population levels. Our failure to lower population by simple means has created the basis for a national security crisis. The government of El Sal- vador failed to use our programs to lower their population. Now they get a civil war because of it.... There will be dislocation and food shortages. They still have too many people there. Civil wars are somewhat drawn- out ways to reduce population. The qu ickest way to reduce population is through famine, l i k e in Africa or through disease l i k e the Black Death. We look at our strategic need s, and we say that this country must lower its population - or else we will have trouble.

The population of the United States should be reduced to 100 million by the year of 2050. The goal of the New World Order is to establish a totalitarian world government. To achieve this goal the masonic leaders so far have taken the following measures: 1. They have taken complete c ontrol of the monetary market through the masonic families Rothschild, Warburg, Schiff, Rockefeller, the currency speculator George Soros. 2. They have exercised influence ov er the media through the free- masons William Randolph Hearst, Adolph Ochs, Silvio Berlusconi, Rupert Murdoch et al. 3. They have established control of the political system through the Grand Orient freemasonry in France , Italy, Latin America, Russia, Eastern Europe and in other c ountries. Georges Pompidou, Dean Rusk, Walter Mondale, Franz-Josep h Strauss, Willy Brandt, Bruno Kreisky and many leading politicians were members of various lodges. The last President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gor- bachov, became a freemason in the Knights Templar in the Uni- ted States, where he received the degree Knight of Malta ( Novoye Russkoye Slovo , New York, December 1989; Oleg Soloviov, \"Freemasonry in World Politics in the 20th Century\", Moscow, 1998). On 16 November 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was also initiated into this lodge ( Sovetskaya Rossiya, 9 September 1993). 4. They have spread a revolting type of \"entertainment\" like action movies with violence; pornogra phy; disharmonious plagiarized popular music like that by the freemasons George Gershwin and Irving Berlin (Israel Baline, 32nd degree), who came from Russia; and hard rock music; propagated for competitive sports such as soccer, which reaped 300 victims during the 1980s and in 1969 caused a war between Honduras and El Salvador that lasted four days and cost 6000 lives and made 50 000 people homeless).

Hollywood was already in the 1930s in the control of the freemason bankers Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and Goldman Sachs. B'nai B'rith founded in the early 1920s a lodge also in Hollywood, with Alfred Schwalberg, Baranay Bapaban (Paramount), Harry Gold- berg (Warner Brothers) and other le ading figures within the Ameri- can film industry. The lodge receiv ed the number 1366. Between the years 1925 and 1935, \"the king of m ovies\" Willy Hayes gave B'nai B'rith's president Alfred M. Cohen the option to scrutinise all scripts that had anything to do with Jews. B'nai B'rith thereafter managed to camouflage itself and founded the special Film Lodge in Hollywood on 16 November 1939. In 1974 it began to be known as Cinema Unit 6000, which was a lodge within B'nai B'rith. In 1977 it was reorganized under the name Cinema- Radio-TV Unit 6000. All B'nai-B'rith masons in the mass media were united in this lodge. In 1979, there were 1600 members, such as actors, distributors, directors, scriptwriters, producers, and composers. All these free- masons have had an enormous influence on the development of vio- lent entertainment. Larry Hagman, who played the mean oil producer J. R. Ewing in the soap opera \"Dalla s\", is one of the members of this lodge. Another member is Leonar d Nimoy of \"Star Wars\" (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Freemasonry, Culture and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 613). 5. The freemasons have made sure that as many young people as possible are dependent on drugs. What is called 'youth culture' is the worst crime against youth. The freemason George Soros propagates legalizing drugs. The Grand Orient favours the narcotics traffic by the Mafia. The CIA has with tacit support of the masonic leaders participated in drug dealing from Vietnam and helped distribute the drugs to young people on the streets. 219"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"6. They have spread spiritual confusion through destructive or deceptive sub-cultures or sects that they have tried to control to various degrees.

They have instigated wars, revol utions and armed conflicts, and supported terrorism. The freemas ons among other things caused two world wars, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. For example the freemason Jacob Venedy (1805-1871) was one of the leaders of the revolutionary committee of fifty, which was founded in Frankfurt am Main in March 1848 during the greatest revolution of Europe in 1848. The revolutionary commissar Venedy was leading the revolt in Berlin on 18 March 1848. The P2 Lodge as another example helped form the terror organization the Red Brigades in 1969. 9. They have installed totalitarian regimes, for instance in Russia in October 1917 and in China in 1949. (More about this in my book \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\".) 10. Finally they want to turn the UN into a totalitarian world government. Within the UN, as has been mentioned earlier, a commission for implementing a world government is already active. The Expansion of Freemasonry In 1829 there were 3315 masonic lodg es in the world. In 1986 there were 6 155 000 freemasons in 32 370 lodges. According to official sources in 1998 there were 8660 lodges with 358 214 freemasons in England, and in Scotland 1175 lodge s. In total there are roughly 600 000 freemasons in Great Brit ain. In France there are 120 000 freemasons in 700 lodges (Ghislai ne Ottenheimer, Renaud Lecadre, \"Les Freres Invisible\", Paris, 2001, p. 21).

In the year 2001 there were seven million freemasons worldwide (Ghislaine Ottenheimer, Renaud Leca dre, \"Les Freres Invisible\", Paris, 2001, p. 117). On 8 March 1775, the first mas onic lodge for women opened in Paris. Therefore March 8 was later celebrated as International Women's Day. The initiative was taken by the freemason Clara Zetkin. The international feminism is anothe r part of the masonic destructive ideology. In 1931, there were under the wings of the Grand Lodge 24 lodges in Yugoslavia. The freemason Josip Broz Tito did not ban freemasonry in communist Yugoslavia, as the freemason Castro also failed to do in Cuba. During the 1980s, the Serbian freemasons began to be very active again and in June 1990 a new Serbia n Grand Lodge was established in Belgrade with support from Vereinigte Grosslogen von Deutschland (The United Grand Lodge of Germany). It became known as 'Yugo- slavia' and its purpose is to fight the evil of nationalism. In the United States there were o fficially 4.5 million freemasons in 16 000 lodges in the 1960s. Today there are only 2.5 million re- maining. According to the defector 32-degree freemason Bill Schnoebelen, it becomes increasingly harder to recruit new members, since aversion towards freemasonry is growing. There are also lodges for children and a possible nursery for future freemasons would be the Boy Scout movement. Of the 41 presidents of the United States 14 were freemasons, or roughly 30 per cent. In 1929, the year of the stock market crash, about 67 per cent of all members of Congress belonged to the free- masonry (Paul. A. Fisher, \"Behind the Lodge Door\", Rockford, Illinois, 1994, p. 246).

In Japan only 18 lodges with 3743 freemasons have managed to establish themselves (1980). The first English-speaking lodge opened in 1865, the first Japanese- speaking one not until 1954. In 1867, the Yokohama Masonic Hall was constructed. During the Seco nd World War freemasons were arrested as traitors in Japan (Jasper Ridley, \"The Freemasons\", Lon- don, 2000, p. 239). In Thailand the lodge St. John No. 1702 was founded as early as 1911. The second Scottish lodge established in Pattaya not until 1993 under the name Lodge Pattaya West Winds No. 1803. The following year a French lodge was founded in Chiangmai and in 1995 an Irish lodge was established in Bangkok, called Morakot Lodge No. 945. In French Indo-China (present-day Vietnam) there was a very lively masonic activity. The current communist regime has officially banned freemasonry, but as is usual in the communist countries the lodges carry on unofficially. In Jordan only a few lodges are active. In Palestine an Israeli grand lodge was founded in 1933, prior to the proclamation of the State of Israel. In 1988 there were 60 masonic lodges with 3000 members (\"List of Masonic Lodges\", 1989, pp. 254-255). Yitzhak Rabin, who was murdered on 4 November 1995, was masonic grand master in Israel.

On 19 September 1950, he had been named secretary of the Communist Party at the University of Tartu. Documentary evi- dence shows his career as a persecutor of nationalists and \"the enemies of the people\". He has never recanted. The Minister of Finance during the 1990s Siim Ka llas was suspected of major em- bezzlement but was allowed to co ntinue as though nothing had happened and was acquitted of all wrongdoing. During his tenure as head of the Bank of Estonia, he ma de sure that the famous masonic symbol of the all-seeing eye was put on the 50 crown banknotes.

In an interview for the daily Aripaev (Business Day) on 13 December 1999 he asserts: \"We are good men, who wish to be even better.\" P2 - the Most Infamous Masonic Sect The most infamous masonic lodge in Europe is called P2, which has been interpreted as Propaganda 2, but should rather be read Palladism 2 (Albert Pike was the founder of this very secret Palla- dian freemasonry), whose centres were in Charleston, Rome, and Berlin. P2 officially was established in 1966 by Giordano Gamberini, grand master of the Grande Oriente d'ltali a, with a membership of 18 000. In actual fact a Palladian mas onic Council in Rome formed by Giuseppe Mazzini and Albert Pike, was developed into a secret Maso- nic lodge in 1877 called Propaganda Massonica. This was introduced for those freemasons that visited the capital from other parts of Italy, and the king himself was a member. Later its 23 councils became centres for terrorism. Together with the Illuminati, the Grand Orient of France played a leading role in the Jacobine takeover in France in 1789, the event known as the \"Great\" French Revolution. The Grand Orient was under the total control of the Illuminati, according to several historians, among those Nesta Webster. After the Second World War, when freemasonry again was legal in Italy, the Italian freemasonry was reorganized by the Americans. The CIA emissary Gilliotti personally began cleansing the Grande Oriente d'ltalia of less important members. Gianni Rossi and Francesco Lom- brassa stated in their book \"In the Name of the 'Lodge'\" (\"In nome della 'loggia': Le prove di come la massoneria segreta la tentato di impadronarsi dello stato italiano.

In 1965, P2 had only 14 members. It had become a lodge of the elite. The members were known as piduesti (P2s). When Gamberini during the years 1966-67 re-organized the lodge by order of the grand master of the Grand Lodge, Li no Salvini, he picked Licio Gelli as grand master in 1967. The small businessman Gelli, who came from Arezzo in Tuscany, had been initiate d into the Grande Oriente and P2 in Rome in 1965 after a long sojourn abroad. He was also a member of the Order of Malta. Gelli had fought on the Franco side in the Spanish Civil War and avidly supported Mussolini. During the Second World War he tortured and murdered communist partisans and reported them. At the same time he belonged to the underground communist party. After the war Gelli and the Catholic priest Krujoslav Dragonovic organized a 'rat line' for Nazis wishing to flee to South America. Gelli's fee was 40 per cent of their money (David Yallop, \"In God's Name\", London, 1985, p. 172). 225"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"In 1954, Gelli himself had to flee to Argentina, where he became the protege of President Juan Pe ron. He had acquired dual citizen- ship. Gelli was also close to Ni caraguan President Anastasio Somoza. Under Gelli P2 grew quickly. He used ruthless blackmail to recruit new members to his lodge (Stephen Knight, \"The Brotherhood\", London, 1994, p. 271). All members should be loyal to Gelli and not to the Italian state. P2 members we re to obey for fear of horrible punishment. He blackmailed his \"brothers\"; compromising documents were found in his villa in Tuscany. Membership fees were sky-high. The P2 headquarters were located at Hotel Excelsior in Rome. In actual fact P2 was run by the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina. In 1973, the Swiss journalist Matt ieu Paol began investigating the role of Alpina in forming the EC (European Community). The principal propagandist was Presiden t de Gaulle, who belonged to this lodge. Paol's book \"Les Dessous\" (\"The Undercurrents\") caused a feeling of insecurity in Europe. This had to be eliminated. The Israeli intelli- gence kidnapped him, accused him of espionage and executed him without trial. Mossad had in fact become the terror organization of the Rothschilds. Through a powerful member of P2, the banker Michele Sindona, Gelli became connected to the Cosa Nost ra in the 1970s. P2 soon had close ties to the Mafia and was above all involved in narcotics trafficking. Dr Agostino Cordova, the public prosecutor for the Calabrian town of Palmi and one of the foremost experts on the Mafia, in 1993 was able to link Gelli to the Calabrian masonic lodge Roccella Ionica, which was involved in criminal activities, as well as to the local Mafia, 'Ndrangheta, whose chief bus iness was to cheat the EU Com- mission of its agriculture benefits. At least ten per cent of the EU budget is lost due to fraud and corruption. Cordova concluded that P2 Grand Master Gelli, known as II Venerabile (the Venerable) was indeed involved in the fraud and ma ssive arms and drugs conspiracy. All P2 members were involved in economic crimes. The government was cheated of 2 billion dollars per year in unpaid taxes. Using false 226"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"documents crude oil was sold instead of petroleum, since diesel oil was heavier taxed. There were also fraudulent stock transactions and illegal currency exports. In April 1997, an international accounting firm claimed that organized frau d were swindling European Union citizens and companies of more than 50 billion dollars yearly. The firm investigated the fraud for th e EU Commission. In Italy alone 200 000 people make a living out of fraud. When prosecutor Cordova in Februa ry 1993 exposed Gelli's criminal ties with the Calabrian lodge at Ro ccella Ionica, in defrauding the Commission, the socialist Minister of Justice, Claudio Martelli, blocked Cordova's nomination as chie f prosecutor of the Italian Anti- Mafia Commission and as public pros ecutor of Naples, where the local Mafia is called the Ca morra (Brian Freemantle, \"The Octopus\", Lon- don, 1995, p. 19). Soon anticorruption Judge Cordova revealed that Martelli had completely stopped his investigati ons into masonic and Mafia in- filtration of the power centr e of the European Union {ibid, p. 256). Cordova pointed out that one member of the Parliamentary Anti- Mafia Commission was a P2 freema son. Martelli resigned his office and the Socialist Party. Briefly he went to London to take a course in economics. P2 was during the 1970s under great influence of the Grande Oriente, but Gelli wanted it to be more independent. P2 was responsible for the bombing attack at the Bank of Com- merce at Piazza Fontana in Milan on 12 December 1969, when 16 people died. They also arranged another bomb explosion in a tunnel against the train Italicus between Rome and Monaco, the night of 4 August 1974, as part of a planned coup d'etat, which failed. Twelve people died and 105 were injured. In December 1974, Lino Salvini, gran d master of the Grande Orien- te d'ltalia, suggested that P2 be closed. He wanted publicly to repu- diate the lodge. In March 1975, Gelli formed the new P2 and again became grand master. The list of the members was officially no longer secret to the Grande Oriente. Spartaco Mennini, grand secre- 227"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"tary of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia, only knew a third of the members, however. The rest of the list Gelli kept to himself as well as the Pentagon, who also had a complete list of members of P2 (Philip Willan, \"Puppet Masters: The Political Use of Terrorism in Italy\", Lon- don, 1991, p. 69). In July 1976, P2 was suspected of killing Judge Vittorio Occorsio, who was investigating P2 connections to other criminal organizations among masonic lodges. When the freemason Francesco Si niscalchi in 1976 informed the chief prosecutor of Rome that Gelli was involved in criminal activity, it was ignored. The bubble burst anyway, however. Pope John Paul I was a serious threat to freemasonry. He was going to stop the illegal money tr ansactions by the freemasons from the Vatican to various banks all over the world, and the corruption within papacy. In the Vatican ther e were 100 freemasons at the time. Some time between the 28 and 29 September 1978 the pope died. The cause of death was listed as unknown. He had been in office only 33 days. David Yallop proves in his book \"In God's Name\" (London, 1985) that P2 and Gelli had arranged the murder of the pope - and behind P2 was the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina. In 1979, Licio Gelli was chosen as chairman of the international organization of masonic lodges, Association Maconnique Inter- nationale (Vladimir Krasny, \"The Children of the Devil\", Moscow, 1999, p. 272). In 1980, Gelli was interviewed in the press, where he stressed that freemasonry in Italy to him was li ke a great puppet theatre. He ad- mitted that he always wanted to be the one pulling the strings. That was a terrible breach against the official policy of the freemasonry. The Italian freemasons were upset . The masonic tribunal convened early in 1981 and Gelli was banned from freemasonry, and P2 was closed. All actions from Gelli would he nceforth be considered illegal. The Grande Oriente gave clearance to the police to scrutinize the affairs of Gelli and P2. Before that he was left in peace under the wings of the Grand Lodge. 228"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Italian freemasonry was going to send a clear signal by punishing Gelli on 18 March, the day the last grand master of the Knights Templar was burned at the stake. On 18 March 1981 the police sear- ched Gelli's villa Vanda in Arezzo , and found many compromising documents. In Gelli's safe a list of 962 P2 members was found. Among these were 19 high judges, four ministers (among them the Minister for Industry Antonio Bisaglia), three assistant ministers, various industrial leaders, diplomats, 195 high-ranking military officers (30 generals, among them Giulio Grassini , and eight admirals), chiefs of police, bankers, journalists and TV stars, editors (including Franco LiBella, editor of Corriere della Sera), 58 university professors, heads of various political parties (except for the communists) and directors of three intelligence services. Among Bettino Craxi's socialists 35 were members of P2. At first onl y these 962 names were disclosed. The police also found 150 gold bars with a total weight of 165 kilos, in the house in Arezzo. Th e value of the gold was about 2 million dollars. It was found in the huge flowerpots that stood on the terrace in front of the house, wh ich had been searched 34 times before but nothing of value had been found. On 5 May 1981, the police searched the headquarters of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia at 8 via di Pancrazio in Rome, where the P2 mem- bership register and co rrespondence were seized. Then it turned out that the real number of freemasons in P2 was as many as 2600, 422 of which were employed in the civil service, though their actual positions rema ined unknown. It was revealed that P2 had close connections to Banca Nazionale di Livomo. Among the lodge members was also Silvio Berlusconi, who was considered to be the Italian media king. In the beginning he denied being a mem- ber of P2, but the records show that he became a member on 26 January 1978. His membership number was 1816, issued under the code E.19.78. He was recommended as a member by the socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who was retu rned to power on 4 August 1983. Craxi's socialist Minister of Finan ce, Pietro Longo, was also a member of P2 (No. 2223). 229"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"On 11 May 1994, Silvio Berlusconi became Italian prime minister, despite a career of scandals and fraud. He acquired his villa in Ancona through the attorney Cesare Previti (later gratified as minister of defence), who administered the estate for an under-age girl whose parents had died in a tr agedy. Berlusconi lived there for ten years without even paying the low fee agreed upon or the property tax (Giovanni Ruggeri, \"Ber lusconi gli affari del Presidente\" / \"The Business of Chairman Berl usconi\", Rome, 1995). Berlusconi was returned as prime minister in May 2001. In June 2002, Berlusconi had th ree outspoken newscasters fired. Enzo Biagi, Michele Santoro, and Daniele Luttazzi were some of the most popular journalists at Italian National TV (RAI). They had exposed some of his criminal activ ities. As a typical freemason, Ber- lusconi denied all involve ment in this new scandal. Now let us return to Gelli. The Fren ch intelligence service, which is controlled by the Grand Orient of France, prevented Italian security police from arresting Gelli in March 1982, so that he could escape to Switzerland (David Yallop, \"In Go d's Name\", London, 1985, p. 444). He was arrested in his absence, charged with political, military and industrial espionage. He was considered a threat to the national security. Interpol managed, however, to seize him in Geneva on 13 September 1982, when he tried to withdraw 120 million dollars from a secret bank account using a fals e passport. The account had been frozen at the request of the Italian Government. He was taken into custody in one of Switzerland's maximum security prisons. Champ Dollon outside of Geneva. On 10 August 1983, Gelli escaped. It was officially claimed that Gelli had paid 12 000 Swiss francs to a prison guard, Umberto Ger- dana. According to Admiral Emilio Massera (P2), Gelli had five false passports at his disposal. He first fled to Argentina and later to Uruguay, a country the Italian freem asonry maintains especially good connections with, but returned to Switzerland in 1987. He was extradited to Italy in 1988 and was released on probation after a month in custody. 230"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"On 8 May 1981, an investigation was opened and on 21 May 1981 the government made public the P2 membership list. There were members of the cabinet (Minister of Justice Adolfo Sarti, Giulio Andreotti, prime minister 1972-73 and 1976-1979), and 43 members of parliament among others. Andreo tti again became prime minister in 1989 as though nothing had happened. He was also a member of the Prieure de Sion (Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln, \"The Messianic Legacy\". London, 1986. p. 426). The Italian government under Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani fell, however, on 25 May 1981. The scanda l almost led to the dissolution of NATO. On 9 June 1981, there was a new search at the headquarters of Grande Oriente in Rome. Lists of all Italian freemason were seized and the archives were sealed. Not until 15 July 1981, could Gi ovanni Spadolini form a new government that took power on 28 July. P2 was declared illegal and was \"dis solved\" by an act of parliament on 21 January 1982. In the extensive file about the still-active organization, P2 is described as \"an invisible power structure con- nected to economic crime, political and military circles and the intelligence service, formed so as to be a state within the state\". The CIA made sure that P2 started to function again. Armando Corono, who was Spadolini's clos est associate, on 27 March 1982, became the new grand master, while in Gelli's absence. The masonic elite was in great need of such subversive lodges. On 2 July 1990, the former CIA and Mossad agent Richard Bren- neke was interviewed by Italian TV. He told the following: \"I have known P2 since 1969 and I had deals with P2 in Europe since that time and I had contact with it also recently, till the beginning of the 1980s. The US government sent money to P2. In some periods the sum was about 1 -10 million a month... The CIA money for P2 had several aims. One of them was terrorism.

In many cases it was done directly through the offices of the CIA in Rome and in some other cases through CIA centres in other countries... P2 collaborated with agencies of the American government in sending weapons to Iran after the meeting of 1980. I know that Bush was in Paris in the same day for meetings dealing with the freedom of the hostages and the payment of a ransom for their freedom. Gelli took part in these me etings... My accusations are very serious and I would not do it without evidence.\" Richard Brenneke claimed a close co-operation with P2 for over 20 years. The real control of P2 wa s in Switzerland and the United States. The journalist Mino Pecorelli, member of P2, also revealed that the lodge was controlled by th e CIA. Brenneke confirmed that the lodge continues as P7 in Ital y, Austria, Switzerland, and Ger- many. A further 128 freemasons were i nvolved with Gelli in a massive arms and drugs conspiracy (Brian Freemantle, \"The Octopus: Europe in the Grip of Organised Crime\", London, 1995, p. 19). In July 1990, the Italian Presid ent Francesco Cossiga demanded an investigation of the claims by Bre nneke that the CIA had paid Licio Gelli to encourage terrorist activiti es in Italy at the end of 1960s and 1970s. Gelli was also one of the main architects behind the communist terror group the Red Brigade's (Briga te Rosse) many operations. Gelli and P2 get them started in 1969. La Repubblica was upset that among the P2 members was also th e Judge Guido Barbara, who was to prosecute the Red Brigades (Juan Maler, \"Das Jiingste Gericht\" / \"The Doomsday\", Buenos Aires, 1982, p. 25). P2 together with the Red Brigad es organized the kidnapping and murder of the Christian democrat leader Aldo Moro (prime minister 232"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"1963-1968 and 1974-1976, and later ch airman of the National Council). According to the P2 secret list, he was also a member of the lodge. During the kidnapping on 16 March 1978, Moro's five body- guards were also killed. The authorities refused to negotiate with the terrorists. The Christian democrat's political secretary Flaminio Piccoli stated that Moro was killed on 9 May 1978, because he did not want Italy to be transformed into a masonic arena for various illegal activities. Half an hour before the assault took place (at 8:30 a.m.), a radio station already broadcast the story that Aldo Moro had been kid- napped. The Red Brigades had their accomplices. An intelligence officer was present as can be seen from press photographs. He explained that he was to have lunch with a friend - but a 9 in the morning? All members of the crisis group that was supposed to find Moro belonged to P2, namely the director of the secret police General Bassini, the chief of intelligence General Santo Vito, General Walter Perusi, General Raffaele Giudice, director of the Finance Police. Anti- terrorist experts resigned in protest against the incompetence and sloppiness. They claimed it was all a play to the gallery. Corrado Guerzoni, who was a close associate of Moro, testified in Rome on 10 November 1982 at the trial of the alleged killer that Moro was under great threat. During an official visit to the United States, Henry Kissinger showed up at Moro's hotel room and threatened him: \"Either you change your policies or you will pay for your opposition with your life.\" Aldo Moro was upset and immediatel y went home to Italy. His wife Eleonora confirmed this in her tes timony. Moro stuck to his policy. The American press did not report this, but in Italy it was widely published. The plan to kill Moro was co-ordinated at the highest level. This is shown by the fact that his police protection was withdrawn, although it was known that many in famous red terrorists were gathered in Rome at the time. Th e abduction and murder was a co- 233"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"operation between the CIA, the KGB, the Mafia, the Red Brigades and the freemasons. At the interrogation many Red Brigades members admitted that they kne w the CIA was involved. The Italian writer Lionardo Sciascia and the film director Giuseppe Ferrara were convinced that the police knew exactly where Moro was hidden, but that they had orders not to find him (Bjorn Kumm, \"Terrorismens historia\" / \"The History of Terrorism\", Lund, 1998, pp. 172-173). The journalist and P2 member Mino Pecorelli was the owner of the weekly L'Osservatore Politico, and had many contacts within the Italian intelligence service. He told his lodge brother Giulio Andreotti of his intention to publish an artic le about the role of Andreotti in the abduction and murder of Aldo Moro. Soon thereafter Pecorelli was murdered by order of Andreot ti. The defected mafia boss Tom- maso Buscetta revealed this 15 years later. Not until 17 November 2002 was 83-year old Andreotti senten ced to 24 years in prison for commissioning the murder of Mino Pecorelli in 1979. The Supreme Court acquitted him, however, on 30 October 2003. Gelli took the opportunity to get rid of other objectionable P2 members: Giorgio Ambrosoli, Antonio Varisco, and Boris Giuliano. They knew far too much and coul d threaten Gelli's safety and position (David Yallop, \"In God's Name\", London, 1985, p. 440). One of the prosecutors against P2 d eclared later: \"The P2 Lodge was a covert sect, which connected busi nessmen with politics in order to destroy the constitutional order of Italy.\" In early July 1981, Licio Gelli's da ughter Maria flew to Italy. At Rome's airport Fiumicino she was arrested and her bag was searched. In a hidden compartment was found secret P2 documents from the State Department in Washington, D. C., among these \"The Plan for the Democratic Renaissance\". The authorities disclosed that Gell i also was a KGB agent, who had secret affairs and hidden connections to communist countries, among them Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who according to Pier Carpi (?The Gelli Case?, Bologna, 1982) was a freemason. 234"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"It was evident that P2 was indirectly linked to the assault on Pope John Paul II and that the lodge organized the explosion at the railway station in Bologna, the fore most communist central in Italy, on 2 august 1980, where 85 people died and 200 were wounded. Gelli himself financed this bombing. The Italian weekly Panorama disclosed in September 1984 that Stefano delle Chiaie, the Italian freemason and terrorist leader who in 1982 had been named by th e ex-freemason Ciolini as the brain behind the Bologna bombing, la ter became a consultant to the communist terror group Sendero Luminoso in Peru. At the end of the 1960s he was the leader of the ne o-nazi group Avan guardia Nazionale in Rome. In the mid-1980s he worked with Alianza Argentina Anti- comunista, an organization of 2000 me n, financed with drug profits. Later he led a South American priv ate army (an assassination group). Panorama stated that the decision to place the bomb in Bologna actually was made by the Swiss Gr and Lodge Alpina together with lodges in Lausanne and Monte Carlo. P2 only served as a middleman in organising the bombing. In October 1984, General Pietro Musumeci, head of the domestic department within the Italian milita ry intelligence (SISMI), was char- ged with covering up the Bologna incident. The General was also a member of P2 (David Yallop, \"In God's Name\", London, 1985, p. 465). P2 was from the beginning financed by the KGB as well, which had recruited Gelli early on. The aim of the KGB was to destabilise Italy and to weaken NATO's southern flank. At the same time P2 was, of course, also financed by the CIA. The British writer Stephen Knight published a secret document, dated 4 June 1981, which he had received from the intelligence service MI6. In the document it shows that KGB was behind P2 and that they used masonic lodges to infiltrate Wester n nations with their agents. Communist agents that were freemasons in the West received substantial aid in their ca reers from their lodge brothers. One could mention, Georges Ebon, wh o was arrested in France in the 1950s (Terry Walton, \"KGB in France\", Moscow, 1993, pp. 67-68). 235"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"This document stressed the fact that within the intelligence services freemasons more easily reach top positions. KGB's greatest success was when their agent Sir Roge r Hollis was named director of MI5, where he served from 1955 to 1965. The official investigation did not reach this conclusion, however. Hollis was a freemason, and according to the above-mentioned document, high officials that also were freemasons usually were never exposed when suspected of wrong-doing. Either the case was clo sed or it was dropp ed for lack of evidence. Therefore the author of the document demanded that the heads of intelligence services s hould not belong to a masonic order. Stephen Knight pointed out that the freemasons in Great Britain have a very great influence. Prince Charles is the first in modern times to break the tradition that male pretenders to the throne be freemasons. In 1980, the chekist Ilya Dzhirkvelov who was stationed in Italy defected to the West and disclosed that the KGB was using the masonic lodges for their own purpos es. Especially successful were the Soviet agents in Great Britain (as well as in Italy), since they mana- ged to infiltrate the most powerful lodges. Dzhirkvelov explained how the KGB gave instructions to it s British agents to become free- masons, since society was ruled from these lodges. Licio Gelli plundered Italy's larg est private bank, Banco Ambro- siano, of a billion dollars in 1982 . He used 200 million dollars to buy arms for Argentina to use in th e coming war for the Falklands. The Argentine General Carlos Suirez and Admiral Emilio Massara, who participated in planning the inv asion, were also P2 members. The swindle put the bank in liquidation soon thereafter. The Vatican- owned Banco Ambrosiano left a defic it of nearly a billion dollars. It was the greatest banking scandal in Italy in modern times. The manager and chief owner of Banco Ambrosiano Roberto Calvi, his masonic bodyguards Florio Carboni and Sylv ano Vittot, went from his home in Rome first to Switzerland on 10 June and arrived in London on 15 June 1982. He told the press: \"Sono massone, ma della loggia di Londra.\" (\"I am a freemason, but belong to the lodge in 236"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"London.\", La Nazione, Rome, 11 December 1981) He was, however, also a member of P2. On 18 June, he was found hanged beneath Blackfriars Bridge on the Thames in London, four miles from Chelsea Cloister, where he was staying - not far from London Freemasons' Hall. The official verdict, published by Scotland Yard, was suicide. He suffered badly from vertigo, howeve r, and would never have arranged to climb down under the bridge to ha ng himself. In addition, it was concluded that he had first been strangled. The freemason Calvi, called God's ba nker, had just prior threatened to expose the P2 role in the bank crash. He was accused of 65 different crimes, including money laundering, fraud, falsifying of documents, and perjury. It is interesting to note that P2 members used to dress up as blackfriar monks (Dominicans) for their magic rites. Later on the ordinary polic e took over the investigation and concluded that it was murder. The day before Calvi's \"suicide\", his secretary Graziella Corrocher threw herself out the window on the fourth floor of the bank's main office in Milan. She had also kept the books for P2. And on 2 October 1982, another bank employee, Giuse ppe Dellacha, jumped out the window of the bank and committed \"suicide\" (David Yallop, \"In God's Name\", London, 1985, p. 436). ■ 237"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Supposedly Mafia black money (from robberies and kidnappings) were laundered at a financial centre in London with the aid of Calvi.

If I had not done so, it would have been impossible for me to do business in London.\" The banker, mafioso and freemason (P2) Michele Sindona, who was a financial adviser to the Vatican and the Mafia, was arrested in 1980 in the United States, charged with ordering the gangster William Arico to murder the accountant Giorgio Ambrosoli in Italy. Sindona was sentenced to 25 years in prison in the United States. He was originally from Sicily. In 198 6, he was extradited to Italy, to stand trial for commissioning murder, and sentenced to life in prison. In September 1986, he agreed to talk to investigators of the role of others in the Banco Ambrosiano case. Before he could do that, cyanide was slipped into his coffee in his TV-monitored cell in the Voghera prison. His killer was never found (Brian Freemantle, \"The Octopus: Europe in the Grip of Organized Crime\", London, 1995, p. 18). Sindona's last words were: \"They have poisoned me.\" When Stephen Knight's book \"The Brotherhood\" was published in London in 1985, the British Parliament demanded an investigation of P2 connections to the British freemasonry.

Razin said: \"During the summer of 1986 I interrogated a very im- portant leader of the American Mafia, whose name I cannot mention, who told me that such a telegram was sent from Gelli to Philip Guarino, at that time one of the most outstanding members of the Republican circle around Bush.\" RAI journalist Ennio Remondino: \"Do you have any precise indication about the existence of the telegram?\" Razin: \"At present the FBI has open ed an inquiry on this story. The existence of the telegram is also indi cated by the archives of the National Security Agency.\" Remondino: \"From where was this te legram sent precisely and who got it?\" Razin: \"It was received with the signature of Licio Gelli and was addressed to Philip Guarino. It was sent from South America, from one of the southernmost regions of Brazil. According to the most reliable information, it was sent by a man called Ortolani on behalf of Licio Gelli or in any case on Gelli's instructions.\" This mafia boss had close contact with Licio Gelli. The most bewildering thing was that a Soviet diplomat and KGB agent knew of this plan a few days in advance, when he mentioned it to his wife in their bedroom.. His home was bugged by the Swedish secret police (SAPO). 239"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"How could a Soviet diplomat know in advance that Olof Palme was to be murdered? The translator, w ho translated the tapes, realized that Moscow had initiated the murder (Expressen, 24 August 1989). The chief prosecutor Anders Helin of the case on the other hand thought: \"It meant nothing.\" The information was considered non- sense. The chief prosecutor Jan Danielsson discovered the bugging tapes, but the Swedish government did not let him use them because of the sensitive relations to the Soviet Union ( Svenska Dagbladet, 17 September 1990). In 1987, not far from the site of the murder a total of five obelisks were erected to \"ornamen t\" the area. One obelisk is just a few metres from where Palme was shot. In 1994, P2 was again declared ille gal. It had thoroughly infiltra- ted the Grand Lodge and the Grande Oriente d'ltalia. Giuliano di Ber- nardo, grand master of the Grande Oriente, failed to weed out the worst criminals. In 1993, he went through the secret documents of the lodge and left the order with the statement: \"I have seen a monster.\" (Brian Freemantle, \"The Octopus\", London, 1995, p. 14) The present grand master is Gustavo Raffi. Giuliano di Bernardo moved from Rome to Milan. There he founded a new lodge independent of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia. He began co- operating with the police in the investigation of the ties between the freemasonry and mafia. On 16 April 1994, Licio Gelli was sentenced to 17 years in prison. During the trial of P2 he was only accused of exercising undue influence, and the spreading of state secrets. Eleven of the other freemasons charged were acquitted. Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo and member of the Euro- pean Parliament, founded the Anti- Mafia Party La Rete (The Net- work). Orlando realized that orga nized crime gets its strength from its ties to freemasonry. To the writer Brian Freemantle he pointed out that \"never think of Mafia without freemasonry, the two are connected\". 15 armed bodyguards constantly guarded Orlando's family. 240"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"P2 has been involved in enormous financial rackets, arms trading, illegal art dealings, dr ug trafficking, terror ism and political assassi- nations. Despite all that was rev ealed, the lodge members still kept their key positions in Italian society. In his memoirs, \"My truth\", Gelli claimed that P2 merely was \"a club for friends with good intentions\". The French freemason Jean-Christoph e Mitterrand (Grand Orient), son of former president Franeois Mitterrand, was involved in illegal arms trading to Angola. A French court of enquiry in January 2001 demanded that the Swiss authorities freeze his bank accounts there. Tina Anselmi, chairman of the P2 commission, complained that: \"P2 is by no means dead. It still has power. It is working in the insti- tutions. It is moving in the society. It has money, means and instruments still at its disposal. It s till has fully operative power centres in South America. It is also still able to condition, at least in part, Italian po litical life.\" (David Yallop, \"In God's Name\", London, 1985, p. 446) Leoluca Orlando was of the opinion that through freemasonry the Mafia is going all over Europe. He considered that this is a serious international problem (Brian Freemantle, op. cit., p. 15). Much less has been written about th e sister lodge of P2, Iside 2 or A2, which was founded by Licio Gelli's associates. A2 became a sophisticated centre for various crim inal activities. The lodge was in the early 1980s involved in the murd er of Judge Carl o Palermo, who was the first to verify the ties between the Mafia, freemasonry and the Bulgarian and Syrian spy organizations. Several investigations by Judge Ciaccio Montaldo have carefully verified the connections the Mafia in Trapani, Sicily, had to A2. Among the members of the secret l odge A2 were also employees of the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome (Antonio Caspari, \"Freemasonry, Mafia, and Communism\", Stoppa Knarket, No. 4, 1988, pp. 8-9). In June 1993, Iside 2 Grand Master Giuseppe Mandalari in a Trapani court was sentenced for founding a se cret society (Claire Sterling, \"Crime without Frontiers: The Wo rldwide Expansion of Organized Crime and the Pax Mafiosa\", London, 1994, p. 230). 241"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Freemasons all over the world ar e morally responsible for the crimes lodges such as the Grand Orient of France, P2, A2, P1, P3, and Albert Pike in Calabria have committed. The Parliamentary Investigative Commission in Rome concluded that Italian freemasonry became the pr incipal victim of Gelli's activi- ties, not the Italian society. What was to be expected? Freemasonry in Italy is very powerful. Th ere are more than 500 lodges. Club 45 or \"The Red Lodge of Vienna\" The origin to the lodge Club 45, also known as \"The Red Lodge of Vienna\", can be traced to three influential men: Leopold Gratz, Hannes Androsch and Udo Proksch. Towards the end of the 1960s the young parliamentarian and secretary of the SPO (Austrian So cialist Party), Leopold Gratz, gathered a group of friends from th e Socialist Student Association, who had all started their careers in 1945 (thus the name \"Club 45\"). They pledged lifelong friendship a nd mutual unconditional support in their personal careers. Their aim was political influence, real power, success, and money. Does it seem familiar? About the same time, in 1969, Chancellor Bruno Kreisky sent his protege Hannes Androsch (later to become foreign minister) to Harvard University for a year. There he took part in the seminars of Henry Kissinger. Androsch was particularly aroused by Kissinger's lectures about \"the organiza tion and exercise of power\". Having returned to Austria, Andr osch knew what to do. He told some friends that they ought to st art a special masonic organization within the SPO. That way a small group could relatively quickly reach the top, at first within the party and then in the whole country. The third man of the original troika, the adventurer, arms dealer and Soviet agent Udo Proksch, decided to combine the plans of the two young socialist lions into one single organization and concept. Of course, he had his own plans in addition to that. Proksch 242"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"imagined a group patterned on the Italian masonic lodge P2, whose organizer and later master of the chair Licio Gelli was his role model. Ever since the P2 scandal erupted in 1981 and the secret lodge be- came known to the public, Club 45 has been compared to P2, and \"The Red Lodge of Vienna\" was ca lled the Austrian P2. There were, however, important differences. P2 had three thousand members from all political parties except the communists. Club 45 only had about three hundred members, all socialists, and \"very honourable and well-respected persons\" (Kreisky). Club 45 is indissolubly tied to Cafe Demel in Vienna. In April 1972 Udo Proksch acquired by proxy the old cafe. All the old customers fled, when the food got worse and prices went up. To many old customers the limit was reached when the new owners celebrated the anniversary of the October Revolu tion in Russia, with the burning Winter Palace and por traits of Lenin made of marzipan (!). Instead of the old clientele now gathered the top of the Austrian Social Democratic Part: Leopold Gratz, Helmut Zilk, Hannes Androsch, Erwin Lanc, Franz Vranitzky, Fred Sinowatz, and Karl \"Charly\" Blecha. Chancellor Bruno Kreisky cut the ribbon at the grand re- opening following the renewal unde rtaken by the new owners. For many years club life thrived surreptitiously in \"the Red Lodge\". At their lodge meetings in the upper stories of Cafe Demel, protected from all democratic control, th e red cafe masons conspired and constantly expanded their positions. As in Italy under P2, a state within the state soon existed. There was a period when Austria virtually was ruled by Club 45 from Cafe Demel. There was as well a time when nobody could be a member of the Austrian government without being a freemason. Among prominent socialists that between the years 1974 and 1989 reached the government through me mbership in \"the Red Lodge\", the following can be mentioned: Franz Vranitzky (chancellor), Fred Sinowatz (chancellor), Hannes Andr osch (vice chancellor), Leopold Gratz, Karl Blecha, Heinz Fische r, Helmut Zilk, Karl Sekanina, Gunther Haiden, Herbert Salcher, Fr anz Kreuzer, Willibald Paar, Ger- 243"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"hard Weissenberg, Karl Lausecker, Er nst-Eugen Veselsky, Karl Lutgen- dorf, and Erwin Lane. The most powerful people in Austria's financial circles were, of course, also members of the cafe masonry: Walter Flottl (the bank BAWAG), Karl Vak (Zentralsparkasse der Gemeinde Wien), Hannes Androsch (Creditanstalt ), Helmut Kienzl (N ationalbank), Theodor Mellich (Girozentrale), Otto Binder and Erich Gottlicher (Wiener Stad- tische Versicherung); executives from the nationalized corporations like Walter Fremuth (Verbundgesellsch aft), Kurt Meszaros (OMV), Heribert Apfalter (VOEST), and Johann Buchner (Chemie Linz). There were leaders of the media like the Kronen-Zeitung editor Friedrich Dragon and ORF (Austrian National Television) chairman Teddy Podgorski, as well as the chief of the Vienna police Karl Reidinger. The shrewd owner of Cafe Demel Udo Proksch knew how to use this bizarre freemasonry for his own purposes, and he was not alone. It can be shown that all major corrup tion affairs in Austria from the mid-1970s through the 1980s were pl anned and co-ordinated in one of the rooms upstairs in the cafe (Hans Pretterebner, \"Der Fall Lu- cona: Ost-Spionage, Korruption und Mord im Dunstkreis der Regie- rungsspitze\", Vienna, 1989, p. 84). Thus it was only natural that Club 45 also was the ideal centre for illegal arms trade. Proksch emphatically denied having anything to do with that. As early as on 1 June 1976 there existed a document (No. 84-Verschl-HbeschA/76) from Heeres-Beschaffungsamt (Austrian defence arms supplier), listing more than 50 people involved in such activity, Proksch being number 25 on the list. After the murder of the Italian politician Aldo Moro in 1978, the police in several countries tried to trace the murder weapon, a Chech submachine gun, type Skorpion. Th e search led not directly to Czechoslovakia, but first to Austria. On 19 April 1978, a few months before the murder of Aldo Moro, 150 such machine guns had been sent to a depot in Niederosterreich, owned by Proksch. From there the arms had been shipped on to Italy. 244"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Vienna newspaper Kurier asked Proksch on 25 November 1979: \"Mr. Proksch, are you a spy for the East and also an arms dealer? And how do you explain that the headquarters of the German police considers you the supplier of Czech handguns to Italian terrorists? it is well-known that Aldo Moro was killed with such a gun.\" Proksch dismissed the question, saying: \"What happened to Aldo Moro doesn't interest me. I don't know a single Italian Red Brigade member.\" With important friends like the brothers of \"the Red Lodge\", Proksch went free, of course. He said: \" Club 45 is my protection against the intrigues directed towa rds me.\" (Hans Pretterebner, \"op. cit, pp. 75-89) The bottomless swamp that constitutes political freemasonry even in a relatively small country like Austria has meant that an upstart and non-freemason like Jorg Haider has become very popular. People are tired of fraud and corruption. The freemasons in Austria and all of the European Union fear that anti-masonic politicians will attain power. These would not only threaten the masonic power structure but also expose the rotten intrigues and bring the criminals to court. Masonic Influence in Sweden During the 18th and 19th centuries most leading officials in Sweden were members of the Order (Frimuraren, The Freemason, No. 3, 2000, p. 12). masonic influence was much greater than today. High-ranking freemasons were Oscar Themptander, prime minister (1884-88), Gene- ral and War Minister Johan Bjornstierna; General and member of the government Anders Skjoldebrand, and Arvid Lindman (actually Salo- mon Achates), who was prime minister twice (1906-11 and 1928-30). Lindman was also a member of the 33rd degree Supreme Council in the Grand Lodge of England, according to the Catalogue of the Swedish Grand Lodge of 1934. This shows that Swedish freemasonry was directed from an international centre. 245"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"This also explains why the conservative leader and Foreign Minister Arvid Lindman would support Lenin who was passing trough Stockholm on 13 April 1917. He supported a masonic brother. The newspaper Aftonbladet made the following analysis by journa- list Goran Skytte in January 1985: \"The members of the Swedish Order of Freemasons have a great influence in Swedish society. Freemasons have members in every important inst itution: the civil service, the mili- tary, business, politics, the Church , and the media... These freemasons have connections and loya lties to each other that make them practically a state within the state, a hidden pow er that the public is unaware of.\" The Grand Marshal Tom Christian Bergroth stated in August 1994 that the Swedish Order of Freemas ons does not have connections to the Grand Orient and the Illu minati. That was not true. The rivalling daily Expressen on 12 January 1995 had the headline: \"Well-known Swedes are Drinking Blood in Secret Society\". The paper published the names of several se cret members. The freemasons threatened to take revenge. The conservative freemason Sten Svens- son admitted: \"I am using the freemasonry as a politician.\" He wanted more politicians to belong to freemasonry. A month later, the editor of the paper Olle Wastberg was fired and soon after the chairman of the board Johan Bonnier. One of the journalists, Curt Radstrom, who was a high-ranking secret freemason, was given a large sum of money for having been exposed. The defected freemason and socialist politician Roland Brannstrom (Skelleftea) revealed that it is not uncommon that social democratic politicians also are freemasons ( Expressen, 12 January 1995, p. 16). According to the freemason Trevor W. McKeown, a group called the Illuminati of Stockholm was found ed in 1721, also known as the Swedenborg Rite. Emanuel Swedenborg was initiated as a freemason in 1706, which was later confirmed by King Gustavus III, who him- self was a freemason. This group c onsists of those members of the Grand Lodge of Sweden that had reached the formerly secret ele- venth honour degree. In the year 2000 there were 67 such free- masons in Sweden and 56 in Norway. 246"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Membership in Scandinavia is dwindling. In 1971 Sweden had nearly 26 000 freemasons. By the year 2000 there were 14 000 left, of which only 8000 were active members. The loss of membership was 45 per cent in 30 years. In 1993, there were 2500 business leaders, more than 200 police- men, almost 500 lawyers and 900 mili tary officers that belonged to freemasonry. On 7 March 1998, Swedish Grand Master Gustaf Piehl denied that freemasonry was involved in occul tism of any kind. What of the magic ceremonies with coffins and skulls and even the deity Bapho- met, then? In the mid-1980s, pictures of skulls and bones in the basement of the Stockholm Masonic Palace were actua lly published in the newspapers. The Swedish Order of Freemasons has been classified as a harmless sect in an official government report (1998). Maybe that is not so strange considering that the chairm an of the survey was the high- ranking freemason Sten Svensson. Some freemasons are also members of the Knights Templar as was the former editor of The Freemason, Roland Swerin. The new Grand Master as of September 2001 is Phys ics Professor Anders Fahlman. Since 2001 the general laws of the Or der are available to the public. Odd Fellows is, however, the largest Order in Sweden, founded on 29 October 1884 and closely connected to the freemasonry. There are 39 600 members in 168 lodges, most ly men but the 80 Rebecca lodges enrol 12 100 women. The Order is le d by the grand sire. Membership is also here steadily declining. Odd Fellows originated in the guild s and crafts of Medieval Eng- land. The earliest printed record of an Odd Fellows Lodge appears in a reference to a lodge meeting at The Globe Tavern in London in 1748. This lodge was number nine, so appa rently there were at least nine associated Odd Fellows lodges at that time. In 1803, the Odd Fellows were revived by an organization called London Union Odd Fellows, which later became known as the Grand Lodge of England and assumed authority over all Odd Fellow lodges. 247"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Through English emigrants the Order was transferred to America, from where it returned in a partly different form to Europe. Among the first records of the order in Ameri ca is that of five brothers of the English Order who met in New York City in 1806, and formed Shakespeare Lodge No. 1. The founders were th ree boat builders, a comedian and a vocalist - a group befitting the name Odd Fellows. The Order of Odd Fellows was fo rmally founded by the freemason Thomas Wildey and four other members of the English Order in Balti- more, Maryland, on 26 April 1819 (Washington Lodge No. 1). In 1821, the Grand Lodge of Maryland and of the United States of America was founded. Thomas Wildey also served as the first grand sire (grand master) of the first grand lodge (e arlier the leader was called noble grand). The Independent Order of Odd Fellows in North America (the Uni- ted States and Canada) became i ndependent from the Order in Eng- land in 1834. There are only seven degrees. Acco rding to its propaganda, it teaches friendship, love, and truth. Several lodges together form a camp. The first degree in a camp is about faith, the second about hope, and the third is about mercy. It sounds just like the commu- nists. The symbols include a skull, an eye, and a hand holding a heart. Some Odd Fellows lodges in the United States have unfortunately taken over certain particularly perverse ceremonies from American freemasonry. James Madison, a member of the Knickerbockers Lodge in New York, told of his initiation into Odd Fellows in his book \"Ex- position of the Awful and Terrifying Ceremonies of the Odd Fellows\" (New York, 1847). When he entered the lodge chamber, a sack was pulled over his head. He was then hoisted up to th e ceiling with a metal hook in his trouser leg, rotated around until he got dizzy, and thrown onto the floor. Thereafter he was brought to a room that looked very dis- torted. When he had sworn the oath, six dancing \"skeletons\" appeared. One of them cried out: \"I fell on a dagger, when I swore 248"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"against a brother!\" Another \"skeleto n\" threatened: \"A s a dog dies, so dies the traitor.\" The Carbonari The Illuminati and freemasons wo rked behind the scenes very skilfully. In Italy the Illuminati star ted to infiltrate the Carbonari to use the organization for their own purposes. The Carbonari (charcoal burners) wa s a secret society that origi- nated 1806 in Naples and consis ted of freemasons, mafiosi and military officers. The members had r ituals that were similar to the masonic ones, but had th eir origin in the carpenters' guilds. The leader was called master and was assisted by the two cousins, Oak and Elm. Their table was the chopping block and their seats were bundles of twigs. They were wear ing leather aprons and surrounded themselves with magic attributes such as axes, branches, and oak leaf garlands. They recognized e ach other by rubbing their right eyebrow three times with the right hand. The password was to rub their right ear lobe with the ri ght hand. The members recognized each other also by secret hands hakes, different for each class. Their meeting place was called 'hut ' (baracca). The supreme lodge Alta Vendita (the Marketplace) was founded in 1828 and its grand master was Joseph Picilli. The armed Carbonari movement was established in southern Italy in 1807 and formed a veritable state within the state. The Carbonari, whose tactical guiding st ar was conspiracy, participated in all insur- rections in the Kingdom of Naples until 1835. Their slogan was: \"It is right to kill the kings of Italy!\" The Austrian troops succeeded in suppressing all their at tempts to seize power. After 1840 the psycho- pathic ideas of the Carbonari spread to the whole Apennine Penin- sula. The most important leaders were prominent freemasons and Illu- minati such as Count Camilio di Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and 249"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Giuseppe Mazzini. Mazzini was always dressed in black as if in mourning for his country. He became known as the 'Evil Genius of Italy' and tried to carry on the activities of the Illuminati through the Alta Vendita, the main lodge of the Carbonari. Cavour reformed the Italian economy and introduced the lira as currency. From November 1859, after the formation of the Provisional Government, the new currency became the lira. Cavour was appointed prime minister of Sardinia in 1852. He also founded and edited the newspaper II Risorgimento (The Awakening) in 1847. This eventually became the name given to the unification movement. The headquarters of the Carbonari was located in Rome. In the 1820s the movement had 700 000 armed members. They claimed that they could enlighten the world with the holy fire (illuminism!). The symbol of their message of truth was charcoal, the source of light. An upside-down tree symbolized the murdered king. They advocated removal of the wolves (tyrants) in the forest (society). The members of the same hut called themselves boni cugini (good cousins). Non-Carbonari were called pagani (heathens). The Carbonari were divided into two classes: apprentices and masters. No apprentice could rise to the degree of master until the end of six months. The Carbonari colours were blue (hope), red (love) and black (faith). At their gather ings they displayed five glowing triangles symbolizing the Illuminati five-point program. The novice, to be recommended by three members, was dragged in a sack from the antechamber to the threshold of the hut. The master kicked three times towards the door and uttered ceremoniously: \"Good cousins, we need help!\" A ritual answer allowed the novi ce to enter. According to the symbolic rite the candidate was dr agged through \"the forest\", \"the fire\", and \"water\", before swearin g the oath. Not until then was he let out of the sack. When the carbonaro received the highest degree, he was informed what the symbols really stood for. Before that they had lied to him and allured him with pious Christian stories. 250"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"A traitor lost his head, his body was burned at the stake, the ashes were spread in all di rections, the executione r washed himself in water. The movement spread to Spain, Switzerland, the Balkans and Germany, where the Carbonari used the name the Union of the Dead. At the head was the Al ta Vendita, to which deputies were chosen from the other vendite. A small hatchet was the distinguishing symbol of a master, the apprentices were indicated by a little faggot worn in the buttonhole. The similarity between the secret society of the Carbonari and freemasonry is evident. Freemason s could enter the Carbonari as masters at once. Its red, blue and black flag was the standard of revolution in Italy unt il substituted by the red, white and green in 1831. The Carbonari appeared in France about 1820. Two years later there were 60 000 members, who had be en recruited among naive military officers, students and common workers. Marquis de Lafayette became grand master of the militant cons piracy movement and organized a plot against Louis XVIII. The Carbonari made sure that Lo uis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon I, was elected presid ent of the Second Republic of France. During the Second Empire, when the authorities began to work against this masonic movement, the Carbonari committed several terrorist attacks. Their go al was to overth row the Bourbon dynasty for good. In 1860, Mazzini had formed an organization called the Oblonica, a name derived from the Latin word 'obelus', which means \"a spit or dagger\". Within this gr oup, he established an inner circle, a modern band of criminals, called the Ma fia, which was an acronym for Mazzini, autorizza, furti, incendi , awelenamenti (Mazzini, autho- rizes, thefts, arson, poisoning). Excerpt from the permanent instruc tion of the Alta Vendita: \"Crush the enemy whoever he may be; crush the powerful by means of l i e s and calumnies; but especially crush him in the egg. It is to the youth we must 251"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"go. It is that which we must seduce; it is that which we must bring under the banner of the secret societies. In order to advance by steps, calculated but sure, in that perilous way, two things are of the first necessity. You ought to have the air of being simple as doves, but you must be prudent as the serpent. Your fathers, your children, your wives themselves, ought always to be ignorant of the secret, which you carry in your bosoms. If it pleases you, in order the better to deceive the inquisitorial eye, to go often to confession, you are, as by right authorized, to preserve the most abs olute silence regarding these things. You know that the least revelation, that the slightest indication escaped from you in the tribunal of penance, or elsewhere, can bring on great calamities and that the sentence of death is already pronounced upon the revealers, whether voluntary or involuntary.\" Piccolo Tigre, Jewish agent of the Alta Vendita, stated in his letter, dated 18 January 1822: \"To find oneself a member of a lodge, to feel oneself called upon to guard from wife and children, a secret, which is never confided to you, is for certain natures a pleasure and an ambition. The lodges, today, can well create gourm ands, they will never bring forth citizens. There is too much dining amongst the right worshipful and right reverend brethren of all the Ancients. But they form a place of depot, a kind of stud [breeding ground], and a centre through which it is necessary to pass before coming to us. The lodges form but a relative evil, an evil tempered by a false philanthropy, and by songs yet more false as in France. All that is too pastoral and too gastronomic; but it is an object, which it is necessary to enc ourage without ceasing. In teaching a man to raise his glass to his lips you become possessed of his intelligence and of his liberty, you dispose of him, turn him round about, and study him. You divine his inc linations, his affections, and his tendencies; then, when he is ripe for us, we direct him to the secret society of which freemasonry c an be no more than the antechamber. The Alta Vendita desires that under one pretence or another, as many princes and wealthy persons as possible should be introduced into the masonic lodges. Princes of a sovereign house, and those who have not the legitimate hope of being kings by the grace of God, all wish to be 252"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"kings by the grace of a Revolution. The Duke of Orleans is a freemason, the Prince of Carignan was one also. There are not wanting in Italy and elsewhere, those amongst them, who aspire to the modest-enough honours of the symbolic apron and trowel. Others of them are disinherited and proscribed. Flatter all of their number who are ambitious of popularity; monopolise them for freemasonry. The Alta Vendita will afterwards see what it can do to uti lise them in the cause of progress. A prince, who has not a kingdom to expect, is a good fortune for us. There are many of them in that plight. Make freemasons of them. The lodge will conduct them to carbonarism. A day will come, perhaps, when the Alta Vendita will deign to affiliate them. While awaiting they will serve as birdlime for the imbeciles, the intriguing, the bourgeoisie, and the needy. These poor princes will serve our ends, while thinking to labour only for their own. They form a magnificent signboard, and there are always fools enough to be found who are ready to compromise themselves in the service of a conspiracy, of which so me prince or other seems to be the ringleader.\" In 1870 the Carbonari movement of the Illuminati was replaced by the more effective socialistic crusad e. Some of the Carbonari members joined Young Italy, which had been founded and led by Mazzini. This secret society was part of the 'revolutionary' societies network Young Europe (Giovine Europa), which operated from Switzerland by instructions from Mazzini in the years 1934-1936. Resistance against Freemasonry Sometimes the power elite has trie d to prevent the freemasons from taking total control of the political situation. This can be illustrated by the following example. Fredrik Wilhelm III of Prussia (1797-1840), on 20 October 1798, issued an edict that banned secret societies and orders that could be harmful to the public. But in 1814, he joined the freemasons in Paris because of his brother Alexander I, tsar of Russia, who was part of 253"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"the freemasonry since 1803. He did not understand how dangerous the masonic lodges could be. Fredrik Wilhelm III did not even intervene against the freemasonry in 1830, when his belief was shaken because of the revolt in Belgium, which was provoked and executed by the freemasons. The members of the Dutch Royal House did not want to let them-selves be controlled by the masonic brothers. Alexander I, however, followed the Austrian example and banned freemasonry in Russia in August 1822. In 1825, he was murdered by the freemasons as a \"traitor\". The mortal remains were gone, as the r ituals required. An empty coffin was buried. \"Of the traitor's body not a single trace shall remind us of his treason.\" In Milan and Venice fr eemasonry was banned in 1814. In Prussia several lodges were closed in 1820, due to political intrigue. In Bavaria freemasonry was again banned in 1845. Since the previous ban was lifted, the freemasons started more intensively than ever their undermining activities. Another example is from the United States. Captain William Morgan, who had reached a high de gree within the freemasonry and had a central position in the order, discovered some of the terrible masonic secrets in his Lodge No. 433 in Batavia, New York. He travelled around the United States to warn the other masonic lodges. In 1826, he explained that it was his duty to warn the public of the secret plans of the freemasons. Morgan wanted to expose the shady activities of the masonic elite in a book. He signed a contract with the publisher Colonel David C. Miller. The book, \"Freemasonry Exposed\", was publis hed in August 1826. This brought the members of the concerned lodges to the verge of a nervous breakdown. At that time there were 50 000 freemasons in the United States. Warnings against Morgan were quickly spread. In the newspapers were published advertisements, like this one in Canandaigua, New York, on 9 August 1826: \" I f a man calling himself William Morgan had come to the society, should everyone be on their guard, particularly THE 254"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"BROTHERHOOD OF THE FREEMASONS... Mo rgan is consider ed a swindler and a dangerous man.\" The freemasons in Batavia and the Illuminati in America and in Europe were worried. They decide d to punish him for breaking his oath and betraying hi s brothers. Richard Howard, an English Illuminatus, was sent to America to murder Morgan (Michael di Gargano, \"Irish and English Freemas ons and their Foreign Brothers\", London, 1878, p. 73). The freemasons trapped Morgan into a plot to murder him. Some freemasons went to Morgan's house and kidnapped him on 11 September 1826, claiming that he ow ed them money and that they were entitled to hold him in custody until he paid off the debt of two dollars and 68 cents. The freemason who came up with the idea of the debt was Nicholas Chesebro. The freemasons also claimed that Morgan had stolen a shirt. On 13 September 1826, the freemason Lotan Lawson went to the jail in Canandaigua, about 50 miles east of Batavia, and said that he was a friend of Morgan and had come to pay off his debt and obtain his re lease. Out in the street, Lawson invited Morgan to enter his carriage but Morgan refused. Two other freemasons, Chesebro and Edward Sawyer, then appeared and they and Lawson forced the struggling Morgan into the carriage. People standing in the street heard Morgan cry: \"Help! Murder!\" as the carriage drove off. One night between 17 and 21 September they took him out on the Niagara River in a boat, fastened metal weights onto his feet, and threw him into to the river, where he drowned. The idea was to put fear into other freemasons and force them into submission. One of the conspira tors, John Whitney, confessed the murder to his physician on his deathbed in 1860. Morgan's publisher, David Miller, on 13 September was also caught in the masonic claws bu t managed with the aid of the authorities to escape. On 4 October, Miller printed 5000 leaflets that in heavy lettering described the kidnapping of Morgan and requested public help. It was well known, however , that the freem asons threatened 255"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"people for revealing their secrets. Some masonic sources claimed that Morgan had received 500 dollars an d a horse to flee to Canada never to return. New York governor De Witt Clinton appointed several commissions to enquire into Morgan's fate. On 1 January 1827, the freemasons Lotan Lawson, John Sheldon, Nicholas Chesebro and Edward Sawyer were charged with kidnapping a nd murder. Later additional ten freemasons were sentenced to prison for accessory to the crime. The freemasons once again struck back by falsifying Morgan's book and published it with distorted contents in December 1826, typical for those that do not want the truth to come out. The printer that printed Morgan's book was subj ected to arson in August 1826. The American historian Emanuel M. Josephson revealed in his book \"Roosevelt's Communist Manifesto\" (New York, 1955, p. 24) that the Columbian Lodge of the Illuminati was founded in New York City in 1785. Its first leader was Governor De Witt Clinton. There was a lot of negative public ity about the Morgan case. All over the Midwest and north-eastern United States the freemasons were isolated. The public demanded that teachers and other promi- nent people should leave the Order or lose their jobs. Freemasons were banned from jury service. They were insulted in the streets. The Morgan case aroused public resentment against secret societies in general and the freemasons in par ticular. Politicians in favour of freemasonry cut their ties to the Or der. As many as 141 anti-masonic publications soon appeared. After the trial and publication of Morgan's book, 45 000 free- masons left their lodges. Nearly 2000 lodges were closed. Many of the remaining lodges cancelled their activit ies. In the state of New York alone, there were 30 000 freemasons. When Morgan's book was published, the number of members decreased to 300 (William J. Whalen, \"Christianity and American Freemaso nry\", 1987, p. 9). One of those that left freemasonry at this time was a young lawyer, Millard Fillmore, in 1850 to become the 13th president of the United States. He also began wa rning against the freemasons. 256"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), president of the United States, was a determined opponent of the se cret society and fraternity of freemasonry.

The existence of such an order is a foul blot upon the morals of a community.\" (W iliam G. Sibley, \"The Story of Freemasonry\", 1913) Adams wrote three letters to the historian Colonel William Leet Stone, a high-ranking freemason, a Knight Templar and editor of The New York Commercial Advertizer, in which he exposed how Thomas Jefferson was using ma sonic lodges for subversive Illuministic pur- poses. The letters are in the Whitt enburg Square Library in Phila- delphia. The Illuminati punished him by ruining his chances for re-election. Adams was totally destroyed in the press that was already controlled by the Illuminati. He was going to expose them in a book, but the manuscript was stolen. Because of the Morgan case David C. Bernard, David Miller and 41 former freemasons founded the Anti -Masonic Society in Le Roy, New York, in the spring of 1828, later to be called the Anti-masonic Party.

His limited success was due to the Morgan case, but people were also aware of the threat of inter- national freemasonry. The effects from the scandal slowly subdued during the 1840s. An ominous sha dow has, however, been hanging over the masonic sects ever since. Everyone is not a brainwashed idiot, as the masonic leadership assumes. Between 26 and 30 September 1896 an anti-Masonic Congress was held in Trento in Italy, where also 36 Catholic bishops participated. Some 18 000 people marched through the streets of Trento protesting the freemasonry. Another great demonstration against the freemasons was orga- nized by Colonel Emile Sonderegger in Geneva, Switzerland, on 9 November 1932. On 28 November 1937, there was a referendum to ban all secret societies. Those in favour of the ban (235 000 votes) lost heavily. Two-thirds (514 000) voted against. All political parties supported the freemasons. Sondere gger's anti-masonic movement rapidly collapsed after the referendum.

They knew wh at a powerful force the free- masonry could be for political pur poses. Bela Kun allowed the activi- ties of the Grand Orient, however, since his communist comrades belonged to that order. He was also a member of B'nai B'rith. Freemasonry was declared illeg al in Hungary in 1920, when Admiral Miklos Horthy came to power. On 18 March 1946, a new masonic-controlled government annu lled the ban and reinstated its legal status. Stalin once again banned freemasonry in Hungary on 13 June 1950, because the lodges were \"meeting places of the enemies of the people's democratic republic , of capitalistic elements, and of the adherents of Western imperialism\" (\"Anti-Masonry\", article in \"Coil's Masonic Encyclopaedia\", pp. 58-59). Many dictators were opposed to freemasonry, even though they knew that it was a far too powerfu l and dangerous enemy to deal with. Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolin i as a young socialist was against the Italian entry in the First World War. All of a sudden he changed his mind and participated in the war as a foot soldier. The Jewish syndicalist Margherita Sarfatti turned him into a fascist. On 23 March 1919, Mussolini and his Jewish syndicalist friends Aldo Finzi, J. Pontremoli, A. Jarach, El io Jona, and Cesare Sarf atti founded in Milan their strongly nationalistic fascist party Fasci italiani di combatti- mento. Mussolini utilised syndicalism and Fabian socialism to the full. Fascism is nothing but another fo rm of the Fabian socialism for which the freemasons laid the foundation.

After the fascist assumption of power in 1922, Jews were overly represented within the central ad ministration, the military, and higher education. Many Jews joined the Fascist Party, where they could reach high positions, some very close to Mussolini (Meir Michaelis, \"Mussolini and the Jews: German-Italian Relations and the Jewish Question in Italy 1922-1945\", Institute of Jewish Affairs, The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1979). The most important Jewish freem asons belonging to Mussolini's government were Aldo Finzi (Mus solini's right hand and deputy minister of interior), and Guido Jung (minister of finance 1932-35). The fascist chief ideologue was the Jewish Illuminatus Gino Arias, who used the economic model of th e syndicalists. He was a member of the Fascist Council that in eff ect ruled the country. Members were also the Jewish masonic bankers Gi useppe Toeplitz and Otto Herman Kahan. Mussolini's advisers in economic affairs were all Jews: H. Ancona, A. Luria and T. Meyer.

In the summer of 1925, Mussolini ordered the dissolution of free- masonry in Italy. In an open letter to II Duce, Domizio Torrigiani, grand master of the Grande Orie nte d'ltalia, demanded that demo- cratic principles be respected. Mussolini ordered him exiled to the island of Lipari in 1927, where he later died. On 4 November 1925, the masonic socialist Tito Zaniboni attempted to murder Mussolini. General Cape llo was arrested for complicity and was sentenced to 30 years in pris on (Sven G. Lunden, \"The Anni- hilation of Freemasonry\", The American Mercury, No. 206, February 1941). Following the anti-masonic agitation, the black shirts were in- volved in many illegal actions against the freemasons between 26 September 1925 and 4 October 1925. They entered the homes of many well-known freemasons in Milan, Florence and other cities and killed 137 of them. The Grand Mast er Raol Palermo escaped but was caught and murdered.

The freemasons never forgave Mussolini's limiting their means to act, after having helped him organize his march on Rome on 27 October 1922 that forced King Victor Emmanuel III (also a freemason) to appoint him prime minister on 31 October. The freemasons lied to the king that the garrison of Rome only had 6000 men (actually there were 28 000) to put up agai nst the fascist black shirts 100 000 (actually 40 000).

It would not end freemasonry in Italy. The word 'fascism' comes from the Latin word 'fasces' meaning 'bundles of sticks'. In ancient Rome the bundle of sticks was a symbol for those officials with the ri ght to punish their subjects. This was a radical symbol during the Illuminati coup d'etat, also known as the Great French Revo lution of 1789 (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", New York , 1983). In the Illuminati headquarters in Ingolstadt there was a painting on the ceiling, where an old man carried a bundle of sticks in his hand. This symbolized power to the Illuminati as it later did to the fascists. The press under Mussolini remain ed free. No secret police was established. The economy was controlled by corporative economic councils. To Mussolini the socialist Kurt Eisner was a great example. His people were dressed in black le ather jackets as were Lenin's com- missars. Mussolini's rhetoric recalle d the violent language of Lenin, saying: \"There is no li fe without bloodshed!\" Under Mussolini the Cosa Nostra was persecuted and forced to go underground. Many mafiosi fled to the United States, where they could operate freely. During the Second World War the Mafia supplied the American troops with information on the military situation in Sicily. After the American landing in 1943, the Mafia had free hands. Mafiosi were made mayors of Si cilian towns and cities. And the Americans could only look on as Mafi a leaders publicly executed their enemies. The American authorities released 200 gangsters during the war, who originally came from Italy, to send them back to their former homeland to renew their Mafia activities. This was described by former German Minister of Rese arch and Technology, Andreas von Biilow, in his book \"Im Namen des Staates\" / \"In the Name of the State\" (Munich, 1998, p. 173).

In September 1928 he closed down the Grande Oriente and other subversive lodges. After the 1931 revolution they were, however, all reopened. The most effective opponent of fr eemasonry was the Spanish head of state General Francisco Franco (a Christian Jew). He knew there was a real masonic conspiracy. The masonic leaders of the Supreme Council, of the 33° in Washington, D. C. in the autumn of 1936 urged their communist and socialist henchmen the world over to support the reds in the Spanish Civil War and fight against Franco. They influenced the policy of several governments. The various masonic supreme councils around the world convened as early as 1931 in th e heavily masonic-infested city of Havana, Cuba, to hold an international congress to discuss common issues concerning the political changes the world was facing. In 1938, Franco issu ed a decree ordering all symbols connected with freemasonry to be obliterate d from the gravestones of free- masons buried in Spain. Freemasonry was a criminal offence, punishable by prison for any man ever to have been connected with the Order, or anyone who did not denounce freemasonry and reveal to the police the names of all freemasons with whom they had been associated (Hamilton, \"Freemasonry: A Prisoner of War,\" official organ of the Supreme Council 33°, The New Age, November 1948, pp. 655-656). On 2 March 1940, Franco issued a decree \"for the suppression of communism and freemasonry\" making masonic membership a crime punishable by six year in prison for those below the 18th degree. The assets of the lodges were confis cated. Many freemasons were tried before tribunals and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. A special Spanish military court wa s created to suppress freemasonry. About 2000 men were im prisoned for up to 30 years, depending on their rank and activity within the freemasonry (Hamilton, \"Free- masonry: A Prisoner of War\", The New Age, November 1948, p. 655).

Article 1 of the decree stated that one could not be a communist, belong to a masonic order or other secret societies. All freemasons who also were communists should automatically be sentenced to twelve years and one day in prison. This only applie d to \"aggravating circumstances\". Article 6 explained that this meant freemasons of the 18 th to 33rd degrees or those having been a member of th e central committee of the Spanish Gr ande Oriente. All freemasons or communists had to leave their organizations within two months after the proc lamation, and all such within the civil service or leading positions within the priv ate sector were to be discharged. Many freemasons fled abroad and had their property confiscated. Not until the late 1970s, several years after the death of Franco in 1975, the ban on freemasonry was abolished. Franco felt it was important to inform the people of the danger of freemasonry. He wrote mo re than fifty articles about freemasonry in the magazine Arriba between the years 19 46 and 1951. In 1952 the articles were collected into a book, called \"Masone ria\", under the pseudonym J. Boor. It was re-pub lished in 1982 when it was stated that the real author was Franco.

The Grand Master Jose de Matos was arrested and put in mental hospital against his will.

Also the French Vichy-government persecuted freemasonry beginning in 1940. masonic activity was neither permitted in Romania, Bulgaria, nor Yugoslavia during the war. The reason was simple. During the preceding two hundred years the freemasons without a public ma ndate meddled in politics, com- mitted terrorism, planned and executed murder, provoked revo- lutions and wars. Surely there wa s reason to ban this undemocratic and destructive movement that was using democratic means to harm the society that surrounds them. In Austria freemasonry was banned in 1938, and most freemasons were sent to concentration cam ps. The same thing occurred in Czechoslovakia a year later. The Finnish freemasons closed their lodges voluntarily during the war to impress their Nazi allies. Pope Pius XII in 1958 condemned all those, \"that attached their name to freemasonry\". In today's world there is more than ever a need for an anti- masonic movement to shut out th e freemasons from the democratic insti-tutions and the centres of power, including the parliaments. For example only 11 out of 155 Norwegian parliamentarians were free- masons in 1983, or 7 per cent. There were also 250 high-ranking police officers, 250 bank executiv es, 400 officers and 110 clergymen. Burma (now Myanmar) and Cambodia do not allow any masonic activity on their territory. It is re markable that General U Ne Win in 1962 came to power in a coup d'etat in Burma and in 1974 introduced the masonic favourite political system - socialism - and at the same time closed all the lodges. Burma has since become the world's lea- ding producer of opium and heroin. The largest lodge of Indonesia wa s the Dutch Grand East. President Sukarno banned all masonic activity in 1961.

The British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the autumn of 1999 said he felt it improper that high officials within the judicial institutions (police, prosecutors, and judges) and the government administration be freemasons. His stat ement raised strong protests from the masonic camp. It was immediately hushed up. In Norway the chairman of the justice committee Jorgen Kosmo in the early 1990s, dissuaded police and other judiciary employees from being freemasons. A member of the Norwegian cabin et, Stein Ludvigsen, refused to leave his lodge, despite the opposition's protests. Conflict of interest was to be avoided at all costs (Norwegian daily Dagsavisen, 22 Octo- ber 2001). The Finnish parliament in 2001 issued a law forbidding judge to belong to the same secret society as the accused. Such a law is nee- ded in many other countries. In the autumn of 1997, the British Commons Home Affairs Select Committee demanded a list from the United Grand Lodge of England, of freemasons employed in the criminal justice system ( The London Times, 20 February, 1998). Within the police in West Midlands, ma- sonic corruption was widespread. Four out of five police officers were freemasons, and to a non-mason it was very hard to make a career. In the membership list the names of 30 judges were found. Within the Scotland Yard a special lodge is operative - Manor St. James, to which 200 police in central London belong. The home secretary had to comp ly with the committee's recom- mendation and sign a bill requiring all applicants to high posts within the criminal justice system whether they be freemasons or not.

Something similar was the case in the Soviet Union, where all careers were closed to non-members of the Comm unist Party. In the Soviet Union the organized society only counted 3 million communists. In Great Britain about half a million freemas ons fulfil a similar function, and in the United States there are at least 2.5 million such conspirators. The British police serve freemason ry and not the public. Scotland Yard already in 1877 was so corrupt ed that three leading chiefs of police were sentenced to hard labou r. The organization was restruc- tured. In 1977 it was time again. Then it was revealed that detectives and high officials took bribes. 13 detectives, all freemasons, were sentenced to prison.

Freemasons closely monitor and collect all anti-masonic statem ents, articles, and books the world over. All this is then analysed and proper measures are taken. The international freemasonry is issuing special instructions on how to handle their opponents. Among other masonic documents in the Special Archive in Moscow, the Russian critic of freemasonry Viktor Ostretsov found a report on a renega de that is a freemason who has left the order.

In 1903, the idea was taken over by Edouard Quartier-la Tente, former grand master of the Grand Lodge Alpina in Switzerland. This agency was to better co-ordinate the masonic struggle against the world. A sarcastic survey of various networks was published in the respected magazine The Economist on 26 December 1992. The Illu- minati were presented as the \"mothe r of all networks\" and \"the True Rulers of the World\". The magazine mentions Adam Weishaupt and 1 May 1776, and states that the conspiracy of the Illuminati \"is im- mense and terrifying\" and that \"it is the network of those who run networks.\" Then it goes on to point out that \"many American presi- dents have been Illumi nati; some of them have been killed by the Illuminati and the Illuminati symbol - that of the eye in the pyramid - still graces the dollar bill.

On 26 June 1999, James C. McGee was elected new grand master of DeMolay International. Drug traffic via an airfield in Me na, Arkansas, took place without disturbance, while Clinton was governor. Unwanted witnesses of this activity met with \"lethal accidents\". Clinton was involved in the drug traffic with the Contras (Patrick Ma trisciana, \"The Clinton Chronicles Book\", Hemet, California, 1994). As president he committed the serious crime of perjury. To the surprise of many lawyers he did, however, not go to prison. Bob Woodward, assistant editor of The Washington Post, told in his book \"The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House\" (1994) that President Clinton exhibited violent outbursts of anger and caused bitter conflicts between his political advisers. In Great Britain there is a powerful masonic organization called The Round Table with branches all over th e world. It hides itself carefully from official scrutiny but nevertheless exercises a subtle influence on people's lives. The world's great political architect was Alfred Milner, who planned and financed the \"revolutions\" in Russia in 1917 to \"celebrate\" the 200th anniversary of modern freemasonry. The Freemason Chronicle stated in 1902: \"The greatness of Great Britain is the work of Freemasons.\" (p. 319). Michel Baroin, former grand master of the Grand Orient in 1979, stated: \"Freemasonry's hour has arrived. We have everything we need in our lodges, men and methods.\" (Humanisme, September 1979) Gary H. Kah wrote in his book \"En Route to Global Occupation\" (Boblesville, 1992) that the Marx ist movement was \"completely dominated by the secret societies, eventually worked its way into Russia where, with the help of existing Russian lodges, the assistance of Trotsky and Lenin, and the outside support of the international financiers, it forced itself upon the Russian people\".

In order to destroy the existing social state we have suppressed re ligious education and human rights.\" (Domenico Margiotta, \"Le culte de la Nature dans la Franc-maconnerie Universelle\", Geneva, 1897, p. 45) Domenico Anghera meant that it is because of the freemasons th at feelings for one's country, religion and family have disappeared. The Austrian masonic magazine Her Zirkel admitted on 13 Decem- ber 1908: \"We are sworn together; we are conspiring every day with malice towards the existing order of society. May we not wait in excess to use our destructive forces. We will not ask what to build instead of that we have destroyed.\" The masonic magazine in Mecklenburg stated in 1910: \"The driving thought is at all times focussed on d estruction and annihilation, because the power of this great secret societ y can only rise from the ruins of the existing.\" The American lodge magazine The Foreword in 1927 openly stated: \"We wish to support the construction of the great monument that the great people of the Bible now shall bring to its conclusion.\" So the freemasons are building a Ne w World for us on ruins. They state themselves \"that freemasonr y is building the temple (of Solomon) in the hearts of men and nations\". Thus we live in the misled and unscrupulous world of the freemasons. If anyone is displeased, he should complain of the secret activity of the freemasons. But the freemasons are deceived deceivers. They never admit their mistakes, although their actions have put us through indescribable suffering. In general, no individual will re ach an important position without being recommended by the lodge. The mass media are put in motion to secure the victory of the freemaso ns' candidates. Even the corps of military officers is permeated with freemasonry. Here is a list of famous freemasons: George C.

Instead the banker Gustaf Piehl became grand master (\"The King Rejects the Freemasons\", Swedish daily Expressen, 21 April 1997). His Majesty dislikes secret ceremonies. The free- masons became both angry and sad. Congratulatory letters from all over Sweden honoured the king for his decision to reject the free- masons (Dagen, 30 April 1997). Officially freemasonry is a ch arity organization, sponsoring children's hospitals, orphanages, educational institutions and nursing homes. The Grand Orient of France had enough of this double talk and explained that charity had not hing at all to do with free- masonry. The Hungarian masonic magazine Kelet stated in July of 1911 (No. 9): \"We are laying the foundation of a new social order, where charity is only a cover. The pledge of secrecy would have no meaning, if it only concerned charity, and the dreadful masonic oaths would be unneces- sary.\" 273"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"\"The Irish Masonic Constitutions\" confirm this: \"The board was asked if the funds of a lodge might be used for a purpose, which was not masonic.

Our society has been infected by the perverse elitist freemasonry in one form or another, which has caused the largest spiritual crisis in the history of mankind. We ha ve been too weak to resist its ruthless treacherousness. The freema sons have discovered this and are therefore tyrannising us ideol ogically (socialism and communism and other unnatural isms), economi cally (interest), chemically (by toxic additives to our food, an d through the pharm aceutical in- dustry), and culturally (trash culture). The vast majority of people have no idea that they are toys in the hands of these cunning forces. In today's society, \"built\" by the freemasons, a spiritual individual is considered abnormal, which show s that this society is itself ab- normal. Spiritual devel opment is favoured only in spiritual surroun- dings, not in materialistic and ruthless ones. They have taken our history, ou r dignity, our wisdom, and our honour, sense of responsibility, sp iritual insight and our traditions. Those that have done this against a sensible civilization should be considered the worst of criminals. We are all partly responsible, how ever, because we have failed to act against the masonic madness due to our enormous gullibility. We have been totally fooled a nd ignored the warning signals. The German scientist Robert Eberth ardt said: \"Don't be afraid of your enemies - at worst they will k ill you. Don't be afraid of your friends - at worst they will betray you. Be af raid of the apathetic ones, because they won't kill and they won't betray, but through their silent apathy, betrayal and killing exist in this world.\" It is vital to do well.

The fact is that these \"forces of light\" cannot stand the light themselves. The freemasons continue to threat en the whole world. When will we put an end to their illegal a nd global power? It is illegal because the Swedish Constitution ensures that \"all political power emanates from the people\" and most constitut ions of democratic states are based on a similar principle. The freemasons claim that the move ment stands for political free- dom and human dignity. Facts speak otherwise. The freemason Sven G. Lunden in his article \"The Anni hilation of Freemasonry\", published in The American Mercury, No. 206, February 1941, claimed that free- masonry fought against tyrants. Who was a tyrant, was for the grand masters to decide. According to the Swedish political scientist Anders Westholm, free- masonry constitutes a danger to democracy. But one cannot touch these hidden people in power. Ni klas Stenlas, another political scientist, has stated that secret societies are a democratic problem: \"Influential people meet and get acc ess to an unsurpassed network, which in turn enhances their influence. Often there are direct channels to the parliament itself.\" In 1996, there was a ruling in the Swedish Supreme Court, regarding a law that forbids the use of the human scull as a symbol. The law has been used only on neo-nazis. The freemasons have gone free, despite the fact that this ev il symbol occurs also within free- masonry. This means that the law is applied selectively. Freemasons are above the law. What else could be expected? Freemasonry is a brotherhood for the powerful and influential. It is an organization that speaks with a fo rked tongue. According to the English freemasons Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, the freemasons have approximately 50 000 skulls in different lodges around the world (\"The Second Messiah\", London, 1998, p. 117).

Those freemasons who are still not aware of the crimson past of their criminal sect should leave it as soon as possible, if they truly want to help humanity. The leading freemasons are mentally deranged fanati cs, led astray by their own destructive Utopias. They have become psychopathic creatures, exhibiting many signs of their sick behavioural pattern. They value their sect the highes t and humanity the lowest. They have lowered themselves to the reptile level, which excludes all spiri- tuality.

It presents a false version of history by hiding certain facts and distorting others. He meant that under the influence of fr eemasonry, we have gone astray and therefore in every ar ea of life we will live in an atmosphere of absurdities and lies. The freemasons are proud of the malicious pseudo-history that they have written for us. The quest ion is how much longer we will accept their insolent fairytales. Because of the very superficial education of the intellectuals, ma- ny of them have been influenced by the distorted, black-and-white worldview of the freemasons, and thereby in good faith brought harm to others, both mentally and physically. The Australian journalist John Pilg er once wrote: \"The deceptions of democratically elected government s appear more ma gnificent than those of the dictatorships, only because of the illusions they create.\" In today's confused world there are many shrewd people, though. In February 2003, there was a resolu tion in the Ukraine parliament to prosecute freemasons. They were to be sentenced to 3-5 years in prison; government employees and hi gh-level military officers would get 7-10 years. If a freemason caused someone's death and harmed the state interests, it would lead to a maximum of 15 years in prison.

They are based on the myths and deceit of the freemasons. The most dangerous myth coerces us into thinking that there is no plot on the part of the financial elite and the freemasons. Such ideas are noth ing but \"right-w ing extremist\" theories about an impossible conspiracy. This masonic view is propa- gated by communists, socialists and conservative liberals. Those in power make sure that anyone who treats important information about the conspiracy se riously is discredited. The very thought of a malicious plot is horrible and disgusting even to the Swedish conservative magazine Contra, which has worked against the communists but denied that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a powerful international organization of conspiracy, which received all the aid it needed from the West. Contra has refused to examine the grounds behind this claim and has thus become part of the international network of disinformation that conceals undesirable facts. Their l eading writers may be blinded by official propaganda (that is lies), but no sensible person would deny something they knew nothing about. The history of the world contains many secrets kept by inter- national freemasonry. The vilest secrets of all are associated with socialism and communism. The growth of socialism and communism is beyond doubt linked to the most powerful and dangerous m asonic lodge in Europe, the Grand Orient of France, which has its headqu arters at 16 rue Cadet in Paris.

The primary t ask of freemasonry is to combat knowledge of the real world and to ignore facts from true history. Those who deny this obvious conspiracy carry moral responsibility for the cruel abuse mankind suffers at the hand of the freemasons. One should not dismiss a claim un til it has been investigated. The freemasons have used a terri ble weapon - socialism in its various guises. The Jewish author and freemason Heinrich Heine (born Chaim Biideburg) was convinced that co mmunism was complete barbarism. An organization, which propagates anything so vile and disgusting, must therefore also be regarded as barbaric. Heine became a free- mason at the Les Trinosophes lodge in Paris in 1844. The freemasons of Paris are commemorated all over the city. Few are aware that Marquis de Lafaye tte (Marie-Joseph Motier, 1757- 1834) was a very powerful freemason. On 25 December 1775, the 18- year-old Lafayette opened the lodge La Canduer in Paris. This was possible because of the fortune he had access to. In 1777, he founded the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. When Lafayette returned to France, he became grand master of the Gran d Orient, a post he retained until his death in 1834. The Historical Backgro und of the Grand Orient Le Grand Orient de France was founded in Paris in the years 1771- 1773. Its aim was to infiltrate government and then destroy it. The first Grand Master was Louis Philip of Orleans (until 1792, officially until 1793, when he was executed for \"betraying\" the revolution). Other important grand masters were Alexandre Roettiers de Monta- leau (1795-1804), Joseph Bonapart e (1805-1814), Jacques Mitterrand (1962-1963, 1967-68), Fred Zeller (1971-1972), and Jean-Robert Ragache (1987, 1989-1991). 281"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Alain Bauer has been the grand master of the Grand Orient of France since 8 September 2000, and according to his own claim, \"un- deniably Jewish\".

At 21, Bauer was promoted to vice president of the University of Paris 1 ( Le Point, 4 January 2002, p. 24). The syndicalist Alain Bauer runs a company, which acts as a con- sultant to French city councils on questions regarding video moni- toring services, which give between 10 000 to 90 000 euros. The Grand Orient has a yearly budget of 4 million euros. In the beginning of the 19 th century, the Grand Orient also assu- med the 33-degree system by joinin g with the Scottish Grand General Lodge of France (Carl Dahlgren, \"Frimureriet\" / \"Freemasonry\", Stockholm, 1925, p. 114). The Grand Orient's coat of arms depicts an all-seeing eye, 40 five-pointed stars, a hammer (against enemies) and a snake biting its own tail. This snake is called Ouroboros. When I first entered the headquarter s of the Grand Orient in Paris in September in 1999, I was confronted with a large red triangle with slogans along its three sides: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite (freedom, equality, brotherhood). This shows that the Grand Orient was behind the so-called French Revolution. The freemasons do not deny this, instead they claim in their periodical Humanisme (No. 240, June 1998) that this orgy of violence was indeed their work. The republic was declared by the freemason Je an Marie Roland on 21 September 1792.

These facts have been exploited in modern propaganda. Many lodges were under the influence of the Grand Orient, including Les Amis Reunis, which was founded in Paris on 23 April 1771. It had 12 classes (not degrees). The Grand Orient was in turn controlled by the Illuminati. The Gr and Orient still maintains this intimate relationship wi th \"the enlightened\".

Only a few chambers out of hundreds in the palace are open to the public. The Louvre houses only the remnants of France's former wealth of art. Two thirds of th e crown jewels are still missing. The freemason Benjamin Disraeli described how his masonic brothers organized riots in Europe in the spring of 1848: \"When the secret societies, in Febr uary 1848, surprised Europe, they were them- selves surprised by the unexpected opportunity, and so little capable were they of seizing the occasion, th at had it not been for the Jews, who of late years unfortunately have be en connecting themselves with these unhallowed associations, im becile as were the governments, the uncalled for outbreak would not have ravaged Europe.\" (Benjamin Disraeli, \"Lord George Bentinck: a Political Bi ography\", London, 1882, p. 357.) Members of the Grand Orient became ministers in the provisional government after the February Revolution in 1848. One of them was Victor Schoelcher (1804-1893). Th eir aim was to depose the July Monarchy, which no longer served th e interests of the Grand Orient. On 24 February 1848, King Louis Philip was forced to abdicate. The freemasons declared their Second Re public, which was the seed of a new empire. Louis Philip was th e son of Philip of Orleans. This happened despite the fact that Louis Philip himself was a member of the lodge Les Trois Jours. He had become the freemasons' (officially the bourgeoisies') king on 7 August 1830 by means of a coup d'etat on 27-29 July, which was known as the July Revolution and had deposed Charles X.

The most important socialist freemasons were Pierre Le roix and the role-model and ideo- logist of the anarchists, Jose ph Proudhon. Proudhon claimed that all private property was stolen property, which should be confiscated at a suitable opportunity and wrote in his book \"La justice dans la Revolution et dans I'Eglise\" (\"The Justice of the Revolution and of the Church\") that the meaning of the terms \"socialist workshop\" and \"masonic lodge\" were identical. In this context, I can also mention Armand Barbes, Felix Pyat (membe r of I'Assemblee Nationale, 1848), Jules Simon, Jean Mace ( 1815-1894), Jules Valles . The anarchist lea- der Louise Michel played a greater role as a \"revolutionary\" than as a freemason (Alec Mellor, \"Logen, R ituale, Hochgrade - Handbuch der Freimaurerei\" / \"Lodg es, Rituals, Degrees: Handbook of Free- masonry\", Graz, 1967, p. 477). Louis Blanc was also a \"revolutionary freemason\". The leadership of the Paris Commune in 1871 (18 March - 29 May) consisted entirely of members of the Grand Orient. The freemason Eugene Pottier wrote the Internationale. The French section of the International belonged to freemasonr y (Alec Mellor, \"Logen, Rituale, Hochgrade - Handbuch der Freima urerei\", Graz, 1967, p. 477). The French periodical Commune wrote on 27 May 1871 that a masonic delegation was being received at the Paris City Hall. Le- france, member of the Paris Commune and the lodge 133, said that he had \"realized a long time ago that the goal of the Commune was the same as the goal of freemas onry\". Another freemason stated: \"The commune is Solomon's new temple.\" And this \"temple\" claimed many victims. The Soviet Union became the perfect temple for the freemasons, a temple in which over a hundred million individuals were sacrificed. 285"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"In 1879, Jewish masonic republican s (Leon Gambetta, Jules Ferry and Jules Grevy) took power and formed a new government.

Leon Gambetta (1838-1882) was an exceedingly important lodge brother (he was a member of the lodge La Reforme in Marseille), and became prime mini ster in 1881.

In those areas where the National Front has taken power - Vitrolles, Orange, Marignane and Toulon - the Grand Orient has been forced to close several lodges an d replace them with a \"travelling lodge\", which is under dire ct protection from Paris. In 1998, the Grand Orient expelled the masonic brother Jean-Pierre Soisson, a regional politician from Bourgogne who had been re- elected with the support of vo tes from the Front National ( ibid, p. 66). 288"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" The Grand Orient headquarters on rue Cade t, Paris.

The Justice of the Freemasons Under certain circumstances, it is the highest and holiest civil duty of the freemason to raise arms against the legal government of a nation, according to The Freemason Chronicle (London, 1875, I, p. 81). For this reason freemasonry had already been banned in several parts of Europe: in Naples 1731, in Poland 1734, in Holland and France 1735. Catherine the Great banned the activities of secret societies on 8 April 1782 and again in 1794 in order to prevent the continued activities of the lodges in Russia. The freemasons had simply refused to obey her. The lo dge Osiris simply continued with their actions against Ru ssia. Ordinary people regarded freemasons as treacherous criminals. 289"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Russian-Jewish masonic socialis t Alexander Herzen (the Grand Orient) agitated for the total and utter destruction of the govern- ment of the time. There would be general destruction in the form of blood and thunder. \"What is born out of this blood? Who knows?\" he wondered. He welcomed the destruction and chaos, which was to come. The Grand Orient wanted to control politics not only in France but also abroad, preferably in the whol e of Europe. Members of the Grand Orient were particularly interested in meddling in Russia's internal affairs. They felt a particular hatred for Russia. From 1890, the Grand Orient de France took good care of all revolutionary emigrants from Russia by organising an interna tional school for revolutionaries. Many Russian extremist Jews began pursuing \"revolutionary studies\" at this school (Yuri Ivanov, \"The Jews in Russian History\", Moscow, 2000, p. 94). Behind the Jewish revolutionary association stood the Grand Orient. This Order helped \"revolutionaries\" to escape justice. In 1897, there were 5 215 800 Jews living in Russia (nearly five per cent of the population). All revolutionary activity was in the hands of the extremist Jews, who cont rolled most of the 370 masonic lodges ( ibid, p. 97). Those rulers that disturbed the plans of the Grand Orient were to be murdered. Within freemasonry, killing an enemy is justified. Tsar Paul I (son of Catherine th e Great) gave the freemasons free rein again, in spite of the official prohibition against freemasonry. He became grand master of the Order of Malta. The freemasons \"than- ked\" him by murdering him on the night preceding 11 March (24 March New Stile) 1801. The murder of Paul I of Russia was organized by Count Pavel Stroganov, representative of the Grand Orient of France. He also belonged to th e lodge Les Neuf Soeurs. Several Russian freemasons were involved in the murder of Paul I. Count Stroganov had come to Russia fro m France as a masonic agent of influence, all according to Oleg Platonov. After this political murder, more and more lodges in Russia came under the influence of the Grand Orient of France. 290"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The decabrists in Russia were act ually Illuminati. The freemason Colonel Pavel Pestel (1793-1826) was an infamous decabrist. The most important representative of th e Illuminati was Ernst Benjamin- Solomon Raupach, who lived with Count Sergei Volkonsky. The Illu- minati had founded Soyuz Blagodentsviya, a subversive society. In 1822 Raupach was expelled for activ ities against the Russian state. On 14 December 1825, the revolt of the decabrists broke out and was subsequently suppressed by the government. 1271 were killed. The freemasons had agitated among so ldiers and civilians, spreading lies just as the communists, socialis ts and liberals do today. All these intolerant individuals are the tools of freemasonry. In 1876, three Jewish freemasons, Lieberman, Grigori Goldenberg and Zuckerman, met in a Grand Orient lodge room in London to work out a plan to murder the Russian Tsar Alexander II. They found a suitable assassin, the extremist Jew Leon Hartman (1850-1913), who was a member of the executive committee of the terrorist organi- zation Narodnaya Volya (the Peopl e's Will, founded by the free- masons). He attempted to blow up the Tsar's train near Moscow on 19 November 1879 (under the sign of Scorpio). The attempt failed and Hartman managed to escape to Paris, where the Grand Orient took good care of him. He was arrested in Paris thanks to the Russian Embassy, but the local freemasons protested when he was to be extradited to Russia. Meanwhile the Grand Orient helped him to escape to England, where he was met with applause and immediately initiated into th e lodge The Philadelphians (Yuri Ivanov, \"The Jews in Russian History\", Moscow, 2000, p. 93). He later moved to the United States, where he was praised by anarchists. Hartman's status as a freemason is confirmed by a letter from Gari- baldi to Gabrielle Pia from 6 Marc h 1880 (Vasili Ivanov, \"The Russian Intelligentsia and Freemasons from Peter I until Today\", Moscow, 1997, p. 346). The Grand Orient did not give up. Several attempts were made on the life of the tsar. The freemasons finally managed to kill Alexander II with a bomb on 1 March (13 March New Stile) 1881 by utilising 291"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Narodnaya Volya (the People's Will). Since the assassin was a Jewess, Chesia Mironova-Helfman, it led to vicious pogroms against the Jews. Vera Figner, an another Jewess, was one of the chief operatives. Helf- man was sentenced but released an d deported in 1 879. She escaped in the same year. Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) w as transformed into an Italian national hero by the freemasons. Garibaldi became a freemason in 1833 and was a member of Mazzini's Young Italy and the Grande Oriente. In 1834, he was sentenced to death in his absence for ha- ving taken part in a mutiny in the Sardinian navy but managed to escape to Brazil in 1836. Garibaldi lived in Uruguay between 1836 and 1848. After he came to Uruguay, he agitated the former President Fructuoso Rivera's \"revolutionary\" movement against the legal President Manuel Oribe, since Oribe did not want a war against Argentina. In June 1838, Rivera defeated Oribe with Garibaldi's help. Oribe fled to Buenos Aires in Argentina. Garibaldi was then the virtual dictator of Uruguay bet- ween 1838 and 1843, while power offi cially rested with Rivera. Du- ring this time, Garibaldi led Uruguay into a war against Argentina. On 16 February 1843, Oribe deposed the dictatorship with the aid of Argentine elite forces. The new President Joaqukn Sujrez took office in March 1843. Garibaldi founded the lodge Les Amis de la Patrie in Montevideo in 1844 (Karl R. H. Frick, \"Licht und Finsternis\" / \"Light and Darkness\", Part 2, Graz, 1978, p. 206). In D ecember 1845, he led the first Italian legion, which defended Montevideo against the British and French. In April 1848, Garibaldi returned to Italy and entered into service for the provisional government in Rome. In 1849, he fought against the French superiority but had to flee the country again. The illuminist terrorists of Garibaldi, some of whom were called Carbonari, wore long crimson executioner's shir ts. After his \"re volutionary\" acts of terror between 1848 and 1849, Garibaldi became a hunted man, who fled and was forced to stay away. He lived in North Africa, the United States and Peru. He returned to Italy in 1854. Garibaldi's 292"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"attempt in 1859 to make Tyrol a part of Italy was a failure, however. The war suddenly ended as he was prepared to engage the enemy. On 6 May 1860, Garibaldi left Genoa with 1067 men and began a new uprising. On 11 May, he landed in Marsala, Sicily, with his red- shirts. There he defeated a force several times as large and made himself Lord of the island and pr oclaimed himself dictator. Since Garibaldi called himself a socialist, he founded a socialist dictator- ship. The callous Garibaldi urged hi s accomplices: \"May our hearts not harbour any mercy whatsoever.\" Six months later it was the turn of mainland Italy. On 8 November 1860, Garibaldi marched into Naples with the King of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel II by his side. The freemason Victor Emmanuel wanted to be king of all Italy. Mazzini and Cavour gave him the throne. In 1862, Garibaldi took part in the assault on the Papal Sate, in which he was captured. He was granted amnesty and soon orga- nized a new uprising, whereupon he was interned but managed to escape. During the same year, his hard work to destroy the old world order gained him the 33 rd degree and thereafter he became grand master of the Scottish Rite in Palermo, and in 1864 the Naples Constituent Assembly elected Garibaldi honorar y grand master of the Grand Orient of Italy. He became the \"First Italian Freemason\". The Grand Orient of Italy was founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in Milan in 1805. Garibaldi was also grand master of l'Ordre du rite Memphis-Misraim. Together with the crime syndicates, he planned atrocious crimes against politically uncomfortable people. In 1867, Garibaldi founded the S upreme Council of Freemasons in Italy and the Association for Peace and Freedom, which began to propagate for the United States of Europe. This union would put an end to national states, after wh ich the freemasons hoped to found a global superstate. The masonic dream about the United States of Europe would become a reality, wh atever the cost, even if it was necessary to use both fire and sword. Instead the cunning step-by- step method was chosen, which involves countless political 293"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"deceptions. Different nation states would be founded and destroyed on the way to a world empire. Garibaldi remained an agitator and was again sentenced to prison. He was soon free and took France's part in the war against Germany in 1870-1871. His sole aim was d estruction, thereby clearing the ground for the construction of the new temple of Solomon. In Madrid the young anarchist Mateo Morral threw a bomb at the royal wedding procession on 31 May 1906. Alfonso XIII and his bride Victoria Eugenia survived, however . The terrorist immediately com- mitted suicide. It was uncovered that he had worked at a publishing company, which belonged to th e known anarchist and freemason Francisco Ferrer. The police suspected Ferrer of having planned this attempt on the king's life, since he had been a suspect in two earlier political murders. Ferrer was arr ested on 4 June 1906. His lawyer Bulot (a masonic brother) handled the defence. Ferrer was freed on 12 June (Revue Magonnique, January 1907, No. 310, p. 13). In June 1909, violent troubles began to surface in Spain. The free- masons instigated a riot in Ba rcelona, during which 97 buildings, including 76 Catholic churches, chapels and assembly halls, were burned down and nuns were raped and then murdered (Edward Cahill, \"Freemasonry and the Anti -Christian Movement\", Dublin, 1959). The main instigator was once ag ain Francisco Ferrer. He was sentenced for causing the riot in Barcelona and executed on 13 October 1909. He was Spain's most famous freemason and anarchist, and was declared a martyr by the dark forces. The former freemason Sidonio da Silva Pais reached power on 8 December 1917 by overthrowing the masonic government in Portugal. As president, he consciously bega n to support national interests. He decreed amnesty for all political pr isoners. The freemasons regarded him as a traitor and vermin that had to be liquidated. On 14 De- cember 1918, Pais was assassinated in the Rossio railway station in Lisbon, shot by a trade unionist and former Western Front soldier. Pais had been on his way to Braga in an attempt to avert a civil war. 294"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"In February 1920, the Portuguese Grand Master Se bastiao Magal- haes de Limas was arrest ed for his part in the masonic coup d'etat on 14 May 1915, against the dictator Pimenta de Castro. The inter- national freemasons immedi ately began to act. Shortly thereafter, de Limas and his masonic friend, deputy grand master Jose de Castro were released, since \"there were no grounds for the arrest\". The Hungarian-Jewish freemason Holl ander said in a speech on 16 April 1905: \"The final goal of soci al democracy and freemasonry are one and the same.\" (\"Grossversamml ung der Symbolischen Grossloge von Ungarn\" / \"Compilation of Sym bolic Grand Lodges of Hungary\", Budapest) The freemason Ludvig Balint wrote in 1918 in the lodge magazine Eotvos (Hungary): \"The ideas, which ma ke people happy are at the same time our goals, that is cosmopolitanism, atheism, communism.\" The greatest success of the masonic elite in deceiving people is the spreading of socialist stray ideas th at solely rest on contradictory lies. For intelligent people it is easy to see through this social fraud, but most people lack the ability to think clearly and therefore easily fall prey to socialist lies. The freemasons' foremost task is to stop correct information and to provoke economic and spiritual stagnation in society, which then no longer can escape the thrall of the masonic bankers. Michel Reyt, who attained the 33 rd degree within the Grand Orient founded Sages, the aim of which is to provide the Socialist Party with money (Ghislaine Ottenheimer and Renaud Lecadre, \"Les freres in- visibles\", Paris, 2001, p. 25). The hidden influence of the freemasons has been and still is enormous. Eighteen of Napoleons marshals were freemasons, in- cluding Bernadotte, Brune, Jourdan, Kellermann, Massena, Mortier, Murat, Ney, Oudinot, Poniatowski, and Serurier (the French periodical Historia, No. 48, July-August 1997).

More than a third of the members of the Economic and Social Council, the third chamber of the French National Assembly, are free- masons. The Entry hall to the Council's building is covered with masonic symbols: two columns with pictures of Horus and Isis. Horus holds a globe and a mitre in his hands. Isis holds a right angle in the crook of her arm. Other symbols are the moon, the sun, the starry sky, the pyramid, the carved stone, and the chain with three links. 296"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The energy sector, the nuclear power industry and telecommu- nications are basti ons of freemasonry. Alain Grange Cabane, general director of an employers association mentioned: \"The first time I met Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1 (the first national French TV channel), I said: 'I think we belong to the same fami- ly.' Le Lay answered: 'I know that we do.' We became friends. I became friend with Jean Miot in the same way.\" Miot was then chairman of the board of the Press Employers Association in Paris ( ibid, p. 35). There is a theoretical rule within Grande Loge Nationale Francaise that neither politics or religion shoul d be discussed in the lodge. In practice, this only applies to the blue lodges, i.e. the lowest degrees. In the higher degrees, called chapters, everything is discussed. The work of the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of France is focused on society from the very beginni ng (Ghislaine Ot tenheimer and Renaud Lecadre, \"Les freres invisi bles\", Paris, 2001, pp. 49-50). The Grand Master of the Grand Orient, Alain Bauer, admits that there is a lack of ideas and that there exists philosophical poverty within his order. There have b een hardly any new ideas recently, except for the protest actions agains t the pope's visit and the general mobilization against the National Front. Masonic Corruption The masonic leaders admit that a misuse of power occurs, but claim at the same time that the order itsel f deals sternly with such issues. That is not true. Nearly everyone who has attempted to work against the corruption within freemasonry or warned higher instances within the order, leading freemasons like J ean Verdun, Pierre Marion, Pierre Bertin and Thierry Meyssan, have b een ostracized or have themselves chosen to leave freemasonry ( ibid, p. 9). The brothers have an obli- gation to aid each other, even at the risk of their own lives. The freemason Jacques Medecin wa s mayor of Nice between 1966- 1995. His closest two associates Jean-Paul Claustres and Jean Oltra 297"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"were also freemasons. Together with several other freemasons, they founded an entire network of fic titious local organizations, which received government grants funded by tax-payers money. Many of the masonic brothers that Medecin involved in his criminal activi- ties, were members of the Grand Orient, but when their presence felt uncomfortable to the other brothers , they went over to the French National Grand Lodge where they founded a lodge of their own (No. 475). Other local government employ ees flocked to this lodge. It is estimated that the brothers of Nice managed to steal a billion francs between 1983 and 1989 (Bernard Br agard, Frederic Gilbert and Catherine Sinet, \"Le feuilleton ni cois\", Paris, 1990). Medecin later moved to Uruguay, where he died. Another example of how a brot her who has made himself im- possible in one order can be \"re-used\" in another: Guy Kornfeld was thrown out of the Grand Orient in 1986 for stealing 180 000 francs from the brothers in his lodge, Salvador Allende. Four years later he was accepted without difficulty into the National Grand Lodge of France. In May 1990, Kornfeld was caught in an identity check in a bank in Monaco and was arrested. He was carrying 3.6 million francs in state bonds, which had been taken in an armed robbery in Belgium a week earlier ( ibid, p. 86). In order to attract influential people, the French National Lodge has formed lodges of special interest ( loges d'appel), based on the secretive lodge Demain in the Gra nd Orient, where the rituals have been reduced to a minimum. Ministers and other men of power feel at home in these lodges. The Spart acus lodge was created for heads of radio and television, the lodge La Banniere Etoilee (the Starry Banner) is for businessmen who wish to invest in the United States, the lodge Les Chevaliers de Jerusalem (Knights of Jerusalem) is for those who are especially interested in Israel, L'Esprit Olympique (the Olympic Spirit) is for sportsmen, Les Cabires is for masons interested in French-African issues. The year ly membership fee for some of these exclusive lodges is 10 000 francs, which pays for ten meetings.

Masonic corruption has its own si gns. The sign of recognition for the first degree, the degree of the apprentice, consists of placing the hand across the throat with four fi ngers clenched and the thumb at a right angle and then drawing the hand from left to right, as if cutting one's throat. This is also called \"the throat sign\" and symbolizes that the brother would rather have his throat cut than reveal any of the secrets of freemasonry. For the journeyman's degree, the right hand is laid upon the heart. The hand is rounded, as if to grab the heart. At the same time, the left forearm is raised with an open hand. This means: May my heart be torn out if I betray the secrets. In the third degr ee, the masters' degree , the right hand with pointing thumb is placed on the le ft side of the abdomen at the height of the navel. An yone who betrays freemaso nry will die in this manner. These signs of recognition are described by many sources. There are several signs of recognition for the highest degree, which outsiders are unaware of. One of these consists of placing the index and ring finger of the right hand across the lips three times in succession. This shows that one has been informed of the most important secrets. The masons recognize each other by asking simple questions like \"What is the time?\", \"How old ar e you?\". If you answer: \"Half past nine\" or \"fifty years\", this shows that you are not a brother. One is supposed to answer: \"There is no time any longer\" or \"I am very old\". You can also show that you are a brother by asking: \"Do you also work day and night?\" Those who have not atta ined the master's degr ee do not have the right to visit other lodg es. They must obey th eir master and everyone possessing a higher degree than themselves. 299"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Destruction of Russia The freemasons are always prepared to play a cat and mouse game to undermine their enemies. The victim is allowed to play the game on the cat's terms, until he is bewitched by consensus trance and his mind becomes totally paralysed. This is exactly what happened to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. At the end of the 1890s, the freemason Philip Vashod founded the masonic lodge Krest i Zvezda (the Cross and Star) in the Winter Palace and later in Tsarskoye Selo, in order to surround the tsar and destroy him. He even tricked Nic holas II into joining the lodge. But the tsar was not informed of any important secrets. Philip Vashod became adviser for questions of state (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Free- masonry, Culture, and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 387). The freemason Leonti Kandaurov (the tsar's emissary in Paris) confirmed this (the Central Historical Ar chive in Moscow, section 730, I). French freemasonry got the all-clea r in the tsarist Russia, despite the fact that it actually represented atheism and republicanism. Nicholas II was aware of this. By associating with the freemasons, he destroyed Russia's chances of development. Between 1900 and 1902, 10 000 people, mostly Russian Jews, were trained in the United States. Thei r mission was to return to Russia after their revolutionary training in order to spread terror and crush the tsarist regime. Most of the fina ncial resources for these activities came from the Zionist billionaire Ja cob Schiff and other Jewish ban- kers in the United States. These bankers also fi nanced the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and the Revolution of 1905 in Russia (Nikolov Dichev, \"The Evil Conspi- racy\", Urgench, 1992, p. 99). In 1904, the Grand Orient agita ted against the Russian govern- ment, calling it a disgrace to the ci vilized world. The Order of Grand Orient of France was constantly i nvolved in Russia's internal affairs by supporting the \"revolutionaries there as early as 1905-1906, when many agitators were ac tive\" (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of 300"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 172). The tsar was influenced by several freemasons acting as close friends. Prince Alexander Mikhailovich was one of them. Mikhai- lovich's mother was Jewish. Anothe r was Duke Nikolai Niko-layevich, who convinced the tsar to sign the Manifesto of 17 October 1905, which cleared the way for the freemasons. This document gave the parliament, which was completely under the control of the masons, more power. The tsar's understanding of Russian free-masonry was primarily gained from these high-ranking masonic gentlemen who were unable to tell the truth and in reality wanted to depose and kill him. In 1905, in St. Petersburg, the secretary of the Masonic Supreme Council, David Bebutov, delivered 12 000 roubles to the leader of the social revolutionaries in exchange for murdering Tsar Nicholas II. The plans could not be realized. In 1906 the freemasons made another attempt to kill the tsar with the aid of the social revolutionaries. They even used a submarine in the attempt. There were also plans to build an aeroplane for this purpose ( ibid, p. 179). The action was organized by the infamous terrorist and freemason Nikolai Tchai- kovsky (social revolutionary), who had designed the aeroplane that was to attack the tsar from the air. When their henchman Jevno Azef was arrested, the plans were put on hold. When General V. Teplov became a member of the lodge, a \"brother\" wanted to know what he thought of the plan to physically remove the tsar. Teplov answered with the fr ankness of a military man: \"If I am ordered to do so, I will kill him.\" (Sergei Melgunov, \"On the Way to the Palace Coup\", Paris, 1931, p. 185) During the autumn of 1905, the freemasons led all the attempts to take over power in Russia. Among the conspirators were two mem- bers of the National Council, Alexander Guchkov and Mikhail Stakhovich (who also acted as diplom at), as well as other well-known freemasons like Sergei Urusov, a landowner who had betrayed the tsar. He handled the contacts with the Grand Orient of France. 301"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Urusov was simultaneously the ch airman of the Masonic Supreme Council of Russia. These men immedi ately wanted to be part of a Russian government. Also the free masons Vladimir Rozenberg and Georgi Lvov took part in this plan. They sought to impose the French republican model on Russia. The blood-red masonic directors, including Alexander Parvus and Leon Trotsky, had started a devastating wave of terror in 1905. \"Revolutionary\" crimes committed in 1905-06 were great advances, according to the freemasons. The freemasons continued to murder their enemies in Russia. Betwee n 1906 and 1908, the revolutionary movement controlled by the fr eemasons performe d 26 268 assassi- nation attempts - 6091 Russians were killed and over 6000 were wounded (Vladimir Krasny, \"The Dev il's Children\", Moscow, 1999, p. 181). In December 1905, Bori s Nikolsky, professor of law and a member of the National Council, gave a spe ech before the Russian Assembly and the tsar. Nikolsky spoke of the activities of the Jewry and the freemasons in Russia, that is subve rsive activities. The tsar disliked this speech so much that he proh ibited its publication. Nicholas II wanted to win over elements from the left, who still hated him in spite of this. Freemasonry was called a criminal or ganization in the reports from the secret police. This was true, since the lodges constantly broke Russian law. The tsar had access to these reports. The tsar dissolved the parliament twice - in July 1906 and in June 1907. At this stage the Duma had broken the law time and again. The masonic member of parliament and lawyer Yevgeni Kedrin received a notice from the Grand Orient of France on 7 September 1906, which proclaimed that the Russians were suffering on account of the tsar's tyranny and that the Grand Orient of France provided opponents of the regime with means to defeat this despotism, all according to documents found in the Soviet Unio ns Special Archive, which became public in connection with the weakening of the communist regime in 1989. 302"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"After several attempts at a revolution in 1905 and 1906, the Grand Orient opened new lodges in Russ ia: The Iron Ring in Nizhny Nov- gorod (Kilvein was grand master), Kiev (Steingel was grand master) and in other cities. Count Alexei Orlov-Davydov financed these new lodges (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crow n of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 172). In 1906, the Grand Orient incite d their members to serve the highest interests of international socialism. The Grand Orient pro- mised all the support imaginable for anti-government activities in Russia. The decision about this support was to be kept secret, however (ibid, p. 178). Laferre, one of the leaders of worl d freemasonry, said at an Inter- national Masonic Conference in 1908, that the freemasons were prepared to finance a conspiracy against Russia. He specified: \"The Council of the Order will make any ne cessary sacrifices in order to achieve true progress for this nation, which has not yet been delivered from darkness and where the triumph of freemasonry is about to unfold.\" (Kolokol, 9 November 1908) When Nicholas II went on a state visit to Sweden in 1909, he was the victim of an assassination attempt. The anarchist who had been hired attacked the wrong person, however, and ended up killing a Swedish colonel in dress uniform. In the middle of 1911 deputy Minist er of the Interior, Lieutenant General Pavel Kurlov, issued a spec ial report to the Minister of the Interior Piotr Stolypin, the conten ts of which disturbed the Russian freemasons deeply. The report deal t with the freemasons' connection with terrorist activiti es against the Russian state and its repre- sentatives. It appears that Stolypin took this threat against the state from the freemasons most seriously and decided to impose measures against them. Stolypin was not just minister of the interior, but also chairman of the Council of Ministers, that is prime minister. Earlier, in 1910, a police agent named Boris Alexeyev had been sent to Paris to gather information about the Grand Orient of France, where the actions against Russia or iginated from.

Soon after, a report arrived from Alexeyev in Paris. The report mentioned that \"the masonic leaders have reached the conclusion that the chairman of the Council of Ministers... is an individual who is damaging to the interests of freemasonry. Such a decision, made by the Supreme Council, has been known to exist for several months... It transpires that the secret leaders of freemasonry are displeased with Stolypin's policy and have utilised the intimate connections between the Grand Orient of France and the revolutionary committees in Russia to complete the plan, which they only had as a draft. It is also said that the pur ely technical aspect of the crime and certain details in the circumstances , which made it possible to bring about the assassination, were prepar ed by the freemasons\" (Oleg Pla- tonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, pp. 198-200). Leon Trotsky met Bogrov on the morning of 1 September 1911 in a cafe in Kiev. The residents of Kiev wa nted to kill all the Jews in Kiev after the murder of Stolypin but the government sent a regiment of Cossacks to prevent a bloodbath (\" The War by Common Law\", Minsk, 1999, p. 42). The murderer Bogrov was hanged. He was a member of the Grand Orient. The terrorist and freemason Manuil Margulies (a henchman to Alexander Guchkov) was the leader of the plot. Stolypin's plans against the freemasons were never realized. After his murder, the freemason Count Vl adimir Kokovtsev (1853-1943) became prime minister. He had prev iously held the post of minister of finance. He was the only tsarist minister to receive a high pension from the provisional government in the spring of 1917, while others were imprisoned. Nor did the bolsh eviks touch him. He must have rendered great service to internatio nal freemasonry (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Freemasonry, Culture, and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 399). 304"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The Jewish extremist Nikolai Maklakov became the new minister of the interior in 1912. His brother, the lawyer Vasili Maklakov, was a notorious freemason. The freemasons immediately began to infiltrate the Russian government, which was doomed to perish. After the murder of Stolypin, the police no l onger received the necessary infor- mation about the damage being done by the freemasons. Those responsible for the information had been replaced with masonic agents, who deliberately neglected to pass on the information they received to their superiors. Through the deputy Interior Minister and freemason, Vladimir Dzhunkovsky, the international orga nization of freemasons also had control of the Russian police. From the beginning, the freemasons supported the undermining activities of Lenin. By 1912, the free- masons controlled the entire Russian diplomatic corps. On 18 February 1912, the masonic banker Salomon Loeb gave a speech in Philadelphia, stating th e necessity of creating a fund to enable to send arms and leaders to Russia. These leaders would teach the Jewish youth to exterminate oppressors like dogs. He stressed that \"we will force Russia to her knees\". With the help of the fund, all this would be achieved ( Philadelphia Press, 19 February 1912). As the reader will recall, freemasons regard all non-freemasons as dogs. From 28 August to 1 September 1911, international freemasonry held its Second Internationale So cialist Congress at the Odd Fellows palace on Bredgade in Copenhagen . The main organizers were the freemason Walter Rathenau and the Jewish masonic lodge B'nai B'rith. Among the participants were the well-known freemasons Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Le nin, Trotsky, Hjalmar Branting (Sweden), Georges Clemenceau and ot her leading representatives of the destructive forces (Aage H. Andersen, \"Verdensfrimureri\" / \"World Freemasonry\", Copenhagen, 1940 , p. 29). Rathenau was also a member of B'nai B'rith.

He left the lodge, when he became a 305"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"member of foreign lodges, among them Art et Travail (Art and Work) in France (L.

Gacinovic to discuss plans for the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. The maso- nic brothers Trotsky, Radek and Zi noviev were all informed of the plans for murdering the pretender to the Austria-Hungary throne (Yuri Begunov, \"The Secret Powers in Russian History\", Moscow, 2000, p. 220). In 1916, Trotsky studied revolution ary tactics in the French lodge Les droits de l'homme (Yuri Ivanov, \"The Jews in Russian History\", Moscow, 2000, p. 124). He was also made a member of the powerful Jewish Order B'nai B'rith, which in the United States provided him with financial means on his way back to Russia in the spring of 1917 (Charles W. Ferguson, \"Fifty Million Brothers: A Panorama of Ameri- can Lodges and Clubs\", New York, 1937, p. 253). This was confirmed by the Austrian political scientist Karl Stein- hauser. Trotsky was also a member of the Shriner Lodge, where only freemasons who have reached the 32 nd degree can be members (Johan van Leers, \"The Power Behind the President\", Stockholm, 1941). While staying in the America in 1917, Trotsky also became a member of the Memphis Israel Lodg e (Vladimir Istarkhov, \"The Battle of the Russian Gods\", Moscow, 2000, p. 154). He achieved the 33 rd degree in Moscow in 1919, while receiving a delegation of brothers from abroad (Grigori Bostunich, \"Freemasonry and the Russian Revolution\", Moscow, 1995, pp. 55-56). Lev Trotsky played a revolutionary in the American spy film \"My Official Wife\". Fidel Castro al so took part in Hollywood movies (\"Bathing Beauty\" in 1944 and \"Holidays in Mexico\" in 1946). In July 1914, the Grand Orient began to urge Russia to join the war against Germany. The masonic advisers were increasingly direc- ting the decisions made by the tsar . He was manipulated into making disastrous mistakes. 306"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The murder of Grigori Rasputin, a monk close to the tsar family and in possession of parapsychic powers, was planned at the Masonic General Convention in Brussels durin g the First World War. Rasputin had wished to prevent Russia from taking part in the war. The freemason Alexander Guchkov (Grand Orient) had previously orga- nized a campaign of slander against Rasputin. The leading force behind the plans was the freemason and Jewish extremist Vasili Maklakov (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The History of the Russian People in the 20 th Century\", Moscow, 1997, Volume 1, p. 456). Count Felix Yusupov, also a freemason, murdered Rasputin on 29 December 1916. Yusupov was suffering from serious mental problems, which Rasputin had been attempting to cure. Yusupov's confederate was Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich. The tsar did not have the murderers prosecuted. They were simply deported. The gravediggers of the Russian nation interpreted this as evidence that murder were now permitted, as the murderers no longer risked prosecution. In 1915, the British Ambassador George Buchanan (a freemason) received almost daily visits from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov, leader of the octobrists Alexander Guchkov, the speaker of the Duma, Mikhail Rodzianko, and the leader of the right-wing Cadet Party and member of parliament Pavel Milyukov. They were all maso- nic criminals and conspirators, aimi ng to overthrow the reign of the tsar. Buchanan played a very dirty part in the Russian tragedy, sup- porting them morally as well as financially ( ibid, Volume 2, p. 35). In January 1917, a number of influential masonic conspirators, among them general Nikolai Ruzsky, met with the Ambassador Buchanan in Petrograd. They discus sed a coup d'etat, deciding that it should take place on 22 February 1917 (Fazarov, \"The Mission of Russian Emigration\", Stavropol, 1972, Volume 1). The date was later changed to the following day, 23 February. On 24 March 1917, the Jewish periodical Jevreyskaya Nedelya (Jewish Week, No. 12-13) published an article on the \"February Revolution\" under the revea- ling title \"This Happened on Purim Day!'\", that is 23 February 1917. 307"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The freemasons Alexander Guchkov and Alexander Kerensky were preparing the overthrow of the tsar. General Alexander Krymov (free- mason) was made governor-general of Petrograd, a move that pre- vented all attempts at saving the tsar. Kerensky co-operated closely with Genrikh Sliozberg, the Russian B'nai B'rith leader (Lady Queen- borough, \"Occult Theocracy\", 1933, p. 466). In late February 1917, a delegatio n of local Zionists visited Ambas- sador Buchanan to thank him for his contribution to destroying the monarchy in Russia (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 2000, Volume 2, p. 35). Tsar Nicholas II was aware of the masonic conspiracy and knew the members by name but he did nothing to stop it. On the contrary, in early January 1917 he issued an order that the police were not to arrest Guchkov and Kerensky (V iktor Ostretsov, \"Freemasonry, Culture, and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, p. 406). He continued to finance the Committee for the Wa r Industry, a nest of vipers intending to lead tsarist Russia to destruction. Financial support was also handed out to various left-w ing organizations, the extended arm of freemasonry. Nicholas II is th e prime example of how freemasonry induces paralysis of thought and isolation from reality in spiritually weak individuals. The freemasons forced the tsar to abdicate on 2 March (15 February Old Stile) 1917, on the threat that if he did not, his family would be killed. This was revealed by Anna Vyborova, a close friend to the tsar family, in her memoirs. The tsar, who at the time was in Pskov, renounced the crown in favour of his younger brother Mikhail, who would become a constitutional monarch. The next day, the free- masons forced Mikhail II from the throne as well. He was the last Russian tsar. A Russian, English-speaking documentary film, \"The Russian Revo- lution\" (Moscow, 1993), admits: \"The politicians, powerful industrial magnates and members of the military forces who were unable to reach an agreement with the tsar, began to consider a conspiracy.

In 1916, the popular lawyer Alexan der Kerensky was made chairman of the Supreme Council. He and other me mbers of the Grand Orient were planning a coup against the tsar.\" This film was financed by the Am erican Jews Alexander Aisenberg, John Doukas and Matthew King Kaufman. They believed the time had come to tell the truth. Sergei Melgunov, a Russian historian in exile, shows how in February 1917, when the coup d'etat took place, the military branch of the freemasons was led by Alexander Guchkov, while the civilian branch was led by Alexander Kerensky (Melgunov, \"On the Road to the Palace Coup\", Paris, 1931). After the overthrow of the tsar, a masonic commission was unable to locate a single document proving the alleged crimes of the tsar (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 271). In spite of this, the commission demanded his execution. The plan was never carried out, however. When the British royal family wished to invite the tsar family to come to England, mas onic forces headed by Jacob Schiff made sure that the threat of a general strike would keep the tsar family out of Britain. Large numbers of documents concerning the atrocities committed by freemasons were however removed from the archives and destroyed. Alexander Kerensky, who was a member of the provisional masonic government, ordered the destruction of all objectionable documents, including an edition of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". Kerensky also receive d money from Germany, another reason why the Provisional Government was unwilling to prosecute the bolshe- viks.

It was Kerensky's inte ntion to keep this information secret (Igor Froy anov, \"October 1917\", St. Petersburg, 1997, p. 81). On 24 March 1917, The New York Times reported that the banker Jacob Schiff had paid tribute to Le v Trotsky: \"He was the person we had been hoping and striving for through all these years.\" Schiff (B'nai B'rith) had arranged for Trot sky to arrive in the United States in January 1917, and to be able to live comfortably with a limousine at his disposal. The Red Guards were subsequently made to wear a medallion around their necks, bearing the image of Trot sky (Grigori Bostunich, \"Freemasonry and the French Revolution\", Moscow 1995, p. 89). International bankers from Great Britain, the United States, Russia, Germany and France met in Sweden in the summer of 1917. They agreed for Kuhn, Loeb & Co. to deposit 50 million dollars in a Swedish bank for the account of Lenin and Trotsky, according to Oleg Platonov. Moreover, John P. Morgan's lawyer Elihu Root paid to the \"revo- lutionaries\" a further 20 million dollars via a war fund. This money came from Jacob Schiff, as confirme d by the American Congressional documents of 2 September 1919. An alleged \"Red Cross delegation\" travelled to Russia in August 1917 with the intention of discussi ng with the bolshevik leaders the final details of a red assumption of power. Of the members of this delegation, seven were doctors, the others bankers from New York, among them John P. Morgan and J acob Schiff. The delegation was headed by William B. Thomson, th e head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who handed over to the bolsheviks at least one million dollars ( The Washington Post, 2 February 1918). The bankers were hiding behind this delegation thei r real intent, which included handing over large sums of money to the bolsheviks (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Re volution\", Morley, 1981, p. 83).

After the bolshevik assumption of power it became vital to bar criticism against the red bandits. Co lonel Edward Mandel House, in- fluential presidential adviser and high-ranking freemason, sent a cable to President Wilson on 28 November 1917, urging him to down- play any criticism of the bolsheviks: \"It is of vital importance that this kind of criticism is silenced.\" The telegram was classified as secret and remained so for the next six years. Deliveries of arms to the enemie s of the bolsheviks (the White Guards) were stopped, as engineered by the arms dealer Basil Zaha- roff. In April 1919, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office published a white book on Soviet Russia, which stated that the bolshevik seizure of power had been organized and financed by inter- national bankers. It was pointed out that Chinese criminals were imported to co-operate with the ch ekists in terrorizing the Russian people. The white book was hastily withdrawn and replaced with a shortened version lacking this sens itive information (Dr Kitty Little, \"Subversive Infiltrators into West minster and Whitehall: Promotion of a Federal Europe\", Jamai, 1995, p. 4). Lenin was a freemason of the 31 st degree (Grand Inspecteur Inqui- siteur Commandeur) and a member of the French lodge Art et Travail (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 2000, Volume 2, p. 417). On his visit to the Grand Orient headquarters on rue Cadet in Paris in 1905, Lenin wrote his name in the visitors' book (Viktor Kuz- netsov, \"The Secret of the October Coup\", St. Petersburg, 2001, p. 42). Lenin was a member of the most malicious lodge of the Grand Orient, the Nine Sisters, in 1914 (Soviet Analyst, June, 2002, p. 12). Lenin also belonged to the Union de Belville Lodge. The French freemason Rozie of the Jean Georges lodge in Paris hailed his masonic brothe rs Lenin and Trotsky (La Libre Parole, 6 February 1918). 311"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Many of the bolsheviks, apart from Lenin and Trotsky, were freemasons: Boris Solovyov, Vike nti Veresayev, Grigori Zinoviev (Grand Orient), Maxim Litvinov, Nikolai Bukharin (actually Moshe Pinkhus-Dolgolevsky), Christian Ra kovsky, Yakov Sverdlov, Anatoli Lunacharsky (actually Balich-Mandelstam), Mechislav Kozlovsky (Polish freemason), Karl Radek (G rand Orient), Mikhail Borodin, Leonid Krasin, Vladimir Dzhunkovsky, and many more. In the KGB archives, the historian Viktor Bratyev found a document according to which Lunacharsky belonged to the Grand Orient of France (Anton Pervushin, \"The Occult Secret of the NKVD and the SS\", St. Peters- burg, Moscow 1999, p. 133). At the Fourth Comintern Congress, Lev Trotsky announced that the comrades Zinoviev, Radek and B ukharin were freemasons (Viktor Brachev, \"The Freemasons in Russ ia\", St. Petersburg, 2002, p. 439). Even before the seizure of power in October 1917 Zinoviev, Trotsky and Kamenev paid a visit to the lodge The Students of St. Petersburg (Yuri Begunov, \"The Secret Powers in Russian History\", Moscow, 2000, p. 308). \"What we need is hatred!\" was a favourite saying of Anatoli Lunacharsky, the people's commissar for educational affairs. Lenin, Zinoviev, Radek and Sverdlov were also members of B'nai B'rith.

Until the late 1990s, a particularly dark secret concerning Lenin was kept well hidden, as is show n by the correspondence between Lenin and his party comrade and freemason brother Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky). Lenin wrote to Zino viev on 1 July 1917: \"Grigori! Circumstances force me to leave Pe trograd immediately... The comrades suggested a place... It is so dull, bei ng alone...

He ended by sending his Vova a Marxist kiss. He suggested that they hide nothing from Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, reminding him of the first time she found them out (Vladislav Shumsky, \"Hitlerism is Horrible, but Zionism is Worse\", Moscow, 1999, p. 479). Thus, the two masonic brothers practised David's love for Jonathan. Perhaps this will enab le us to understand why the freemasons are such willing advoca tes of homosexual liberation. In Russia, Lenin's grandfather, the Kalmuk Nikolai Ulyanov, had four children by his own daughter Alexandra Ulyanova (officially known as Anna Smirnova). Lenin's fath er Ilya was the fourth of these children, born when Nikolai Ulyanov was sixty-seven years old (Vladimir Istarkhov, \"The Battle of the Russian Gods\", Moscow, 2000, p. 37). Ilya Ulyanov married the Je wess Maria Blank, whose father Moisha Blank had been charged with a number of crimes, among them fraud and blackmail. Inbreeding probably played a very large part in making Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin such a perverted man. He had an enormous, congenital aggressiveness and extensive brain damage, suffered a number of nervous breakdowns, and was bisexual. The OGPU officers, Gleb Boky and Alexander Barchenko among others, also belonged to the freem asons. Many of them were members of the lodge Brotherhood of Common Labourers. The freemason Leonid Krasin acted as an intermediary in procuring money for the Grand Orient in Paris. He managed to find suitable receivers, who bought up the gold and antiques the bolsheviks had expropriated from the tsar. He wa s in contact with the freemason Dmitri Rubinstein, who acted as gr and receiver.

The Grand Orient brother Zabreshnev worked for the Comintern's international branch. According to the Russian historian Vasili Ivanov, Russia was trans- formed, as early as the beginning of the 1930s, into a typically masonic nation, which clearly show ed freemasonry and socialism to be branches on the same dark tree. Vasili Ivanov described the situa tion as follows: \" I n order for the masonic ideals to triumph, it was necessary to k i l l the soul of the Russian people, remove the people from its God, obliterate its national character, trample its mighty history in the dirt, dull the intellect of its young generation and raise a new kind of people without a God or a native country: two-legged wild creatures who, after being trained, would obediently place themselves in the masonic cage.\" (A.

In October 1920, Libre Parole published information about the Grand Orient council meeting of 20 December 1919, held at rue Cadet. Officially, the leadership of the lodge wished to keep a straight face and show an anti-bolshevist attitude. The magazine reported the lodge brother Millet admitting that the Grand Orient enthusiastically welcomed the bol shevik seizure of power, stating that thanks to the bolsheviks the Grand Orient was able to rebuild the temple, the lodge building in ru e Cadet. Brother Giuarte stressed, without specifying, that the bolshevik movement, through critical periods, had done enormous se rvice to the Grand Orient. The Portuguese Grand Master, Sebastiao Magalhaes de Limas, was equally friendly towards the bol shevik republic in Russia. Brother Lankin of Paris admitted there were bolsheviks among the members of the Grand Orient of France, and that the lodge aided the bolsheviks in their worldwide activities.

Le Socialiste appropriated the pr oposal, and the highest Belgian masonic authority, Le Supreme C onseil de Belgique unanimously agreed to accept Ragon's anarchis t programme \"as corresponding to the masonic view of the social issue, and that the world which is united in the Grand Orient at all costs must apply itself to its realization\" ( Bulletin du Grand Orient, June 1843).

Together with the bolsheviks they planned common measures against the right-wing, anti-Soviet tendencies in the West (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 297). Most of the freemasons the world over were in support of the Soviet regime of violence. Without that support, it would have collapsed. Although there were disag reements between freemasons and the uninformed Bolsheviks, thei r collaboration continued. The Grand Orient of France condem ned the anti-Soviet attitudes of certain lodges. In 1933, the international office for co-operation within freemasonry accepted a re solution taking exception to the anti-Soviet propaganda pursued by the French lodge Etoile du Nord (the North Star) in Paris. Certain freemasons, acting as soci al revolutionaries on the left wing of the party, proclaimed the view that there was no need to fight against the bolsheviks, as support of the White General Kolchak constituted a crime against Russia. The freemason and former Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov stressed in 1924, that the communists were developing towards democracy, and that Russian exiles were not al lowed to interfere in this process by advocating anti-communism (Svobodnaya Rossiya, 1924).

According to Lenin, they sacrificed people to Mo lok, as revealed by the defected bolshevik leader Georges Solom on (Georges Solomon, \"Among Red Rulers\", Stockholm, 1930, p. 56). The name of the demon Molok is derived from the Hebrew expression la-molek ('to the king'), which is used in connection with the sacrifice. How then did the masonic communists perform their ritual sacri- fices to Molok? A room at the Chek a headquarters in Kiev in 1920 contains a basin, which formerly held goldfish. It was filled with the blood of sacrificed human beings. Along the walls hooks were placed, where several human corpses were hung. On the shoulders of the officers, shoulder straps had been carved, and the chests of the Christians were carved with crosses. Some had been flayed, leaving bloody carcases on the hooks. On a table was a jar containing a chopped off head in alcohol. The head had belonged to a strikingly handsome man in his thirties (Aleksei Shiropayev, \"The Prison of the People\", Moscow, 2001, p. 75). When, in the spring of 1920, the experienced conspirator Alex- ander Guchkov realized that the bolsheviks had no intention of sharing their power with those freem asons originally from Russia, he began to scheme against Russia from Berlin (Oleg Platonov, 'Russia's Crown of Thorns: The History of the Russian People in the 20 th Century', Volume 1, Moscow, 1997, p. 580). This, however, led now- here, since the freemasons centrally continued to support the bandit regime in Moscow. International freemasonry certainly wished to help the bolsheviks build the false front of communism. In 1932, the Grand Orient called an extraordinary convention in Paris, where the chairman Gaston Bergier said: \"It has been reported to us in person by our earlier brother in the Grand Orient, Radek, that the Soviet government intends to keep in close contact with freemasonry world-wide, and that it asks us to influence the Ameri can brothers to do 318"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"everything they can to persuade the Roosevelt government to recognize the Soviet power.

Karl Radek (Chaim Sobelsohn), who was already a member of the Grand Orient of France before the bolsheviks seized power, was appoint ed grand master of the Soviet Grand Lodge The North Star. The leaders of various revolutionary movements have always been freemasons: Giuseppe Mazzini, Giusep pe Garibaldi, Aurelio Saffi, Agostino Bertani, Simon Bolivar (t he liberator of South America), Francisco de Miranda (a general, who founded the lodge Lautaro and became generalissimo in Venezuela in 1812), Francisco I. Madero, Venustiano Carranza (a general who le d \"the revolution\" in Mexico in 1913-1914), Alvaro Obregon, Plutarco Elias Calles, Jose Marti, Salvador Allende, Fidel Castro... General Simon Bolivar (1783-1830 ) became a freemason in Europe. He belonged to the Craft lodge in Cadiz, Spain, and was a master of the lodge the Nine Sisters (Grand Or ient) in Paris in 1807. Benjamin Franklin was also a member of the same lodge and was for a while its grand master. In Paris, Bolivar became a member of the Knights Templar. He instigated \"revolutions\" in Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru, and eventually founded Bolivia. In 1824, he founded the lodge Libertas No. 2 in Peru. Bolivar acquired the hair of George Washing- ton, which he sent to Lafayette, who meant to draw power from it (Manly P. Hall, \"America's Assi gnment with Destiny\", California, 1998, p. 102). Francisco Madero was the son of a rich landowner in Mexico. He studied economics in France, where he became a freemason. On 5 October 1910, he started a revolt against the regime. In 1911, he 319"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"managed to overthrow the dictator Porfirio Diaz, with aid from the United States. He subsequently became president of Mexico. Madero was deposed and murdered by Genera l Victoriano Huerta in February 1913. Jewish masonic milliona ires led the Mexican revolution in 1910- 1917. When it was over, Plutarco El ias Calles, a freemason of the 33 rd degree, secured for himself an indirect position of power. In 1924, he became president of Mexico, making sure that Mexico recognized the Soviet power in Moscow the very same year. The Calles fortune amounted to 80 million pesos, despite the fact that he was born into a poor Jewish family. His comrade Aron Saez (whose fortune amounted to 40 million pesos) was another freemason and Jewish extremist taking part in the 'revolution' that did not resu lt in anything positive. 20 000 Catholics were murdered (Louis Mars halko, \"The World Conquerors\", London, 1958, p. 54). During Call es' four years as president, all the property belonging to the Church was confiscated and the priests were barred from teaching religion to the children. Beginning in 1928, Calles became the grey eminence behind three short-term presidents: Portes Gil, Pascual Rubio and Abelardo Rodriguez. Another freemason was Jose Marti (1853-1895), the founder of Cuba's Revolutionary Party in 1892, who led the rebellion against Spain in 1895. Even the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong belonged to the Grand Orient (John Daniel, \"Scarlet and the Beast\", Volume III, Tyler, pp. 33-35). He made sure that cert ain high-ranking masonic brothers abroad were kept constantly s upplied with narcotics from China. The Northern Lodge of China, No. 570, was founded in Shanghai in 1849. Later, the Chinese branch of freemasonry was to become very powerful. A new grand lodge was opened in the Shanghai Masonic Temple on 18 March 1949 with large num bers of invitations issued to representatives from other lodges. After the proclamation of the Peoples Republic of China, most of the lodges carried on their activities as if nothing had happened. Most of them, however, had 320"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"moved to Hong Kong for reasons of safety. In 1962, the Chinese Ministry of the Interior expressed a wish that the lodges register in the same way as other organization s. The freemasons were unwilling to publicise lists of their members, and thus preferred to move to either Hong Kong or Taiwan. According to masonic sources, the members were not persecuted in co mmunist China. Th is was probably due to the fact that freemasons were active in the very highest ranks of the government (as advisers among other things). Fidel Castro Ruz was born in 1926, the son of a rich landowner in the vicinity of Santiago de Cuba. The parents of his mother Lina Ruz, who was Jewish, emigrated from Turkey. Fidel Castro's father Angel Castro became a millionaire working for Rockefeller's United Fruit Company. While a student at the Un iversity of Havana Castro was also a notorious hooligan (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", New York, 1983). Fidel joined UIR, an anti- fascist and anti-catholic organi- zation. He also associated himself with communists. His friends were all communists. At that time Castro became a KGB agent. While at the university, together with Ortiz he killed Manolo Castro-Campos on 22 February 1948. He was also involved in the killing of a police officer Fernand ez and in the murder case of Lionel Gomez. Castro was involved in the Confe tti Key invasion of the Dominican Republic on 20 September 1947, a rebellion staged by a terrorist student group. He was armed w ith a sub-machine gun (Hugh Thomas, \"Cuba: Or Pursuit of Fr eedom\", 1998, pp. 814-916). The journalist Gerardo Reyes wrote in his article \"Scotland Yard Investigated Castro for Assassination\" (El Nuevo Herald, 10 April 2001), that Fidel Castro was consid ered one of the suspects in the murder of the Liberal Colombian leader Jorge Eliecer Gaitin by Scotland Yard detectives, who inve stigated the case in July 1948, according to Amer ican investigator Paul Wolf. Castro made an appointment with presidential candidate Gaitan. On 9 April 1947, at 11 a. m., Cast ro and his associate Del Pino met in the Cafeteria Colombia in Bo gota with Gaitan 's assassin, the 22 321"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"year old student leader and freem ason Juan Roa Sierra, hours before he shot the politician in a central Bogota street. The assassination brought on riots where 5000 people died. CIA agents William A. Wie- land and Robottom kept an eye on the events. The Cuban Ambassador to Washingt on, Octavio Belt, was present in Bogota, and in charge of providing a plane for Castro and the other communist terrorists to return to Cuba. Castro got his law degree in 1949 in Havana and thereafter worked as a lawyer. At this time he also became a freemason. He lacked principles, and labelled himself a 'revolutionary'. He found inspi- ration in the Spanish dictator Primo de Rivera. As long as the Cuban economy was thriving, he was unable to introduce communism. Castro together with Batista pla nned all the details of Batista's takeover from 1948 to 1950, sometimes in Batista's villa Cookyness. Batista was called a symbiant, because the only purpose for having him in power was to help Castro and the communist takeover. Castro received communist training in the Soviet Embassy in Havana from 1948 to 1949. Batista's coup on 10 March 1952 was like a bad TV movie repeated. On 26 July 1953, Castro led an armed riot against the dictator Fulgencio Batista in Santiago de Cu ba, which officially rendered him a 15-year prison sentence. He was, however, granted amnesty in 1955, after which he moved to Mexico. Exiled in Mexico, Castro got even more help from the communists. Veterans of the red brigades of Spain trained Castro in Mexico. The Mexican press accused them of being communist terrorists. The socialist President Lazaro Carden as and London's bankers protected them. Cardenas also provided them with some fancy weapons and several farms and security houses where to train and live. Benjamin Vega published Castro's interviews in Alerta, a newspaper owned by Vasconcelos and Batista. On 2 December 1956, he returned from Tuxpan together with 82 terrorists that landed near Belic-Niqu ero, Oriente, in Cuba intending to fight Batista with the support of the CIA. 322"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The Cuban authorities monitored the landing. They did nothing, because Fidel Castro was in symbiosis with Batista. Castro's permanent headquarters was at Hacienda Sevilla, the largest farm in Cuba, in the Sierra Maestra Mountains, east of Turquino Peak. Rockefeller's Standa rd Oil earlier owned Hacienda Sevilla. The Americans were also able to supply Castro from Guantanamo Bay. US Marine ships were caught tr ansporting supplies to Castro in Caimanera-Guantanamo in 1957. To justify Batista's not using his air force for the only large military operation of the war, Plan \"H\", Castro had his brother Rasl kidnap fifty American citizens in the area. The American consul in Santiago on 18 July 1958, without authorization negotiated with the rebels the release of the hostages. He made Batista promise not to use his air force anymore, to which Batista gladly agreed. William A. Wieland, who led the State Department's Caribbean office in Washington, to ld Earl Smith, who was ambassador to Havana in 1957: \"Cuba has been assigned to you to oversee the fall of Batista. The decision has been made: Batista must go.\" (Earl Smith, \"The Fourth Floor\", New York, 1962) Smith was not a freemason, and he wished to warn the American public against Castro. He was stopped, and the State Department began working behind his back. On 17 December 1958, Batista in a meeting with high-ranking army officers who were not part of the conspiracy, made public that Ambassador Earl Smith had told Batista he had to go. News spread to all garrison commanders and ended the army's will to fight. The rebels had not taken a single garr ison or important town by that time. In Havana, the CIA was very pro-Castro (\"The Communist Threat to the USA through the Caribbean: Hearings of the Internal Security Sub-Committee, US Senate\", Washington, D. C, 1959-62). Castro's main advocate was Herbert Matthews of The New York Times, who portrayed him as the T. E. Lawrence of the Caribbean. 323"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"In July 1959, Major Pedro Diaz Lanz, of the Cuban Air Force, toured the United States, and revealed that Castro was a communist. This fact was kept out of the media. The State Department was purposely covering up Castro's communi st connections, the fact that his supporters were trained by the Soviet Union, and that he was carrying out a communist revolution. Suddenly, all arms sales to Cuba we re stopped by the White House. A shipment of rifles was intercepted in New York harbour (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", New Yo rk, 1983). The United States was arming only one of the sides - Castro's \"revolutionaries\". The Cuban economy was deteriorating, and support for Castro was growing. Before the arms embargo he had counted no more than 300 terrorist followers. Batista went into exile on the island of Madeira (Portugal) and died in Spain in the early 1970s. After the communist accession to power on 8 January 1959, the freemason Fidel Castro closed all 339 masonic lodges in Cuba with roughly 35 000 members except for the Grand Orient, where he had himself been initiated in his youth. He later had all lodges reopened. In 1998, Cuba had 314 lodges with a total of 24 000 members. After seizing power Castro had 100 000 opponents imprisoned. Not until 1961 did he introduce communi sm. On 2 December 1961, Castro proclaimed: \"I have been a communist since my teens.\" After the fall of communism in th e Soviet Union, Castro voiced his opinion that it is better to perish like Atlantis than to abolish socialism. Robert Hill, US ambassador to Mexi co, said under oath in a Senate hearing: \"Individuals in the Stat e Department, and individuals in The New York Times, put Castro in power.\" Th ese individuals included Robert McNamara, Theodore C. Sorenson, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr, Roy Rubottom, McGeorge Bundy, J. William Fulbright, Herbert Mattews, and Roger Hilsman. The afore-mentioned William A. Wieland claimed that the autho- rities and the military intelligence knew in advance of Castro's plans 324"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"to enforce communism. Even so, the American press portrayed him as a patriotic and benevolent leader. Several observers were of the opinion that the Bay of Pigs operation on 17 April 1961 intended to get rid of Castro, was a deliberate failure. Earl E. Smith, the former US ambassador to Cuba, stated: \"Castro could not have seized power in Cuba w ithout the aid of the United States. American government agencies and the United States press played a major role in bringing Castro to power... The State Department consis- tently intervened... to bring about th e downfall of Batiste, thereby making it possible for Fidel Castro to take over the government of Cuba.\" (Letter to the Editor, The New York Times, 26 September 1979, p. A 24). The historian Jean Boyer stressed that Castro's money and arms did not come from Moscow but from the United States. It was President Eisenhower who helped Castro to power. Castro exploited foreign aid to b ecome rich. He has at least 32 houses in Cuba, three of which are in Havana. He and his assets are guarded by 9700 guards. He has at le ast 14 children by different wo- men (Georgie Ann Geyer, \"Guerilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro\", Boston, 1991). Castro's pers onal fortune is estimated at near- ly a billion dollars. He is four times richer than Queen Elizabeth II. The United States also stopped all aid to the right-wing President of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza, secretly directing their assistance to the Marxist Sandinistas instead. With the help of the United States, the Sandinistas managed to seize power. The US claimed that Anastasio So moza had established a dictator- ship of terror in Nicaragua, a nd demanded that innocent political prisoners be released. The White House started to act frantically to overthrow the president. When th e Sandinistas came to power, it was discovered that the Nicaraguan pris ons held no more than 59 commu- nist terrorists, regarded as political prisoners by the Americans. After the Sandinista assumption of power on 17 July 1979 the world (that is the freemasons) no longer cared about the tens of thousands of new political prisoners or the fact that 150 000 Nicaraguans fled the country to escape the communist terror. 325"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Somoza later claimed in his memoirs that Nicaragua had been the victim of an international conspiracy. Robert Pastor, a White House nati onal security adviser, had asked Daniel Oduber, president of Costa Rica: \"When are we going to get that son-of-a-bitch up to the north out of the precidency?\" (Ana- stasio Somoza and Jack Cox, \"Nicar agua Betryed\", Boston, 1980, pp. 79-80) The IMF (International Monetary F und) was blocking all credit to the Somoza government. The United States made sure that other countries taking part in a mutual power station project withdrew from it. The market for Nicaraguan coffee was closed. Somoza's Nica- ragua was closed to the world. The meat export to the United States was stopped. The United States also closed dow n the oil market for Nicaragua. The Sandinistas knew by then that victory was within reach ( ibid, p. 259). The United States stopped se nding military supplies to Mana- gua. Enormous amounts of dollars were sucked out of Nicaragua, preventing the government from buying arms elsewhere. Eventually, all arms markets were closed to Nicaragua by the United States. The Nicaraguan army lacked ammun ition and was unable to fight the communists. The United States immediately gave 75 million dollars in aid to the new Marxist regime, as well as food and medicine worth three million dollars. The US Congress withdrew 8 million dollars from its aid fund, sending it to the communist government of Nicaragua. The money was originally intended for other countries (Jack Cox, Anas-tasio Somoza, \"Nicaragua Betrayed\", Boston, 1980, p. 288). Before the President Jimmy Carter ordered the aid to Nicaragua, the Sandinista leaders claimed: \"We are Marxists!\" Apparently, Carter approved.

Humberto Ortega was a communist, who had studied in Moscow. After this coup ex-President Somo za was no longer welcome in the United States. The Masonic Contribution to Soviet Russia Far too many freemasons were happ y to work for the bolsheviks. Mikhail Skobelev was a freemason and a member of the Provisional Government in 1917. In 1922, he became a bolshevik and began to work for the Soviet government. One of the leaders of the right-wing Cadet Party, Nikolai Nekrasov (1879-1940) had been minister of transport in the Provisional Government. Before that, he was secretary general to the Grand Orient Supreme Council in Russia. After Nekrasov's resignation, Alex- ander Kerensky, a freemason of the 32 nd degree, was appointed secre- tary general in the summer of 1916. Later the same year he handed this position over to Alexander Galpern. Kerensky received his 33 rd degree in the United States. He was also a member of B'nai B'rith. In 1918, Nikolai Nekrasov changed his name to Golrofsky, and started working for the bolsheviks. He became one of the leaders of the Co-operative Union. He also taught at the University of Moscow. In 1921, he was arrested by the Cheka, but was unexpectedly released. The chief of the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, had given the order: \"The investigation must be stopped immediately.\" He began to work for the Central Trade Union Or ganization of Soviet Russia the same year (Platonov, \"The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1996, p. 364). The freemason Sergei Urusov had been minister of the interior in the tsar government and later also in the Provisional Government. After the bolshevik takeover, he held a prominent post in the National Bank (\"The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia, Vo lume 56, Mos- cow, 1936, p. 301). He was the emissary of the French freemasons. 327"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Alexander Manuilov was the principal of the University of Moscow. / He became one of the managers of the bolshevik National Bank. The well-known economist Vladimir Groman was a menshevik, who be- came a freemason, preferring to work for the bolsheviks. Maximilian von Mekk rose to be an important o fficial with the Peoples' Com- missariat for Transport. The historian Mikhail Lemke turned into a dedicated bolshevik and began to fake history. The tsarist deputy Minister of Finance Nikolai Kutler and the deputy Minister of the Interior, General Vladimir Dzhunkovsky were two more high-ranking freemasons that served communism by working for the Cheka. Even the speaker of the Duma, the freemason Fiodor Golovin, managed to reach a high position in Soviet Russia. The tsarist Minister of War, the freemason Alexei Po livanov, joined the bolsheviks and served in the Red Army. Grigori Petrovsky, another freemason, was made the people's commissar for interior affairs. He was still working for the government in the 1950s. Gleb Boky, the supreme chekist in Petrograd, kept his masonic brothers protected. In 1919, Boky was a member of the Common Brotherhood. By the mid-1920s freemasons were found everywhere in the Soviet administration (Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 292). The high-ranking freemason Dmitri Navashin was the adviser on planned economy to the Soviet government. The bolsheviks were very kindly disposed to these masonic brothers. Before 1925, no harm seems to have come to them. In 1925, General Boris Astromov, secretary general to the Auto- nomous Russian Freemasonry, contacted the political police, the GPU. In a letter, he stressed the comm on goals of the freemasons and the bolsheviks. He wanted to assist in establishing communism (ibid, p. 293). Astromov pointed out that the communist symbol, the red five- pointed star, was a masonic token, as were the hammer and the sickle. The communists also advocated brotherhood, as do the free- masons. Freemasons are world citizen s without loyalty to any parti- 328"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"cular country, as are the communist s. Both groups advocate 'equa- lity'. The communist confiscation of private property was a masonic idea. Freemasonry as well as communism is rooted in the working class \"movement\", and the pioneer organization was copied from the masonic scout movement in the West. Astromov, the leader of the Au tonomous Freemasonry, realized that if freemasonry was legalized in Soviet Russia, the movement would be prevented from acting with efficiency. Acting in secret was preferable. The Soviet Autonomous Freemasonry was a union of a large number of lodges. Astromov had taken over the leadership after the Grand Master Vladimir Telyakovsky, who died in 1924. January 1925 saw the re-establishment of the Northern Star Lodge in France for Russian freemasons, a number of members transferring there from the Grand Orient of France. The lodge had actually been founded before 1917. Many notorious terrorists were active there, including Nikolai Avksenchev, who was master in 1925-27 and 1931, and Pavel Pereverzev (1929-30), a previous member of several terror organizations (Platonov, \"Russia' s Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 307). Avksen- chev later joined the Provisional Government as foreign minister. Pavel Pereverzev was finance minister in the same cabinet. The Northern Star became the lead ing lodge for the Russian exiles in France. The Grand Orient of Fran ce allowed its members to meet at its headquarters in Paris. On 10 February 1927, the Russia n Consistory became the admi- nistrative centre of freemasonry. As from 1930, the centre received financial assistance from Paris. Many members of the Grand Orient, including Teplov, Lobolensky and Count Alexander Orlov-Davydov, did, however, not join, as in their opinion the activities of the re-born lodge were far too public. The Free Russia lodge, founded on 9 November 1931, had very frequent contacts with international Zionism. Vladimir Jabotinsky, a radical Russophobe, belonged to this lodge ( ibid, p. 308). 329"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The refugee organizations were al so under masonic control. Only these spiritually lost individuals were allowed to determine who was a political refugee from Russia. One organization that very eagerl y began to act under the masonic authority was the Union of Russian Jews. It had a budget several times larger than all the other refugee unions together ( ibid, p. 311). The freemasons were not prepared to let go of Russia even after the fall of communism. The freemason journalist Lev Lyubimov exposed their plans in 1934: \"After the fall of the bolsheviks, free- masonry will take charge of the education of the Russian people.\" ( Vozrozjdenije, 3 October 1934). He later left freemasonry and returned to the Soviet Union in 1948. After the Second World War a group of exiled Russian freemasons visited the Soviet Embassy in Pari s to express their support for the Soviet Union. The delegation was led by Vasili Maklakov (33 rd de- gree), who had organized the murder of Grigori Rasputin. The free- masons paid tribute to Stalin and toasted him. They were trying to draw the Russian emigrants ideologically closer to the Soviet Union. Stalin's Struggle against Freemasonry The Soviet freemasons suffered severe setbacks in the Stalin era. Although they had encouraged Stalin to strike at the Church, that dangerous enemy and rival of fr eemasonry, and the nationalist forces, they found themselves the vi ctims of persecution in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Soviet dictator Josef Stalin had had enough of freemasonry and began an intense battle against the secret societies in the mid-1930s, even though Soviet freemasonry had been legalized a few years earlier. Starting in 1926, Stalin systemat ically executed freemasons, since he no longer trusted the conspirato rs. They had served their purpose and were no longer needed, in his opinion.

Stalin had them all closed down. In 1931 the Knights Templar in the Soviet Union was liquidated (Anton Pervushin, \"The Occult Secrets of the NKVD and the SS\", St Petersburg, Moscow, 1999, p. 153). A \"revolution\" had been planned for 25 May 1937 in Venice by two Italian Stalinists and freemasons, Carlo and Nelli Rosselli, who planned to lead 2600 terrorists in an attack, provoking a civil war. Stalin suddenly wished to cancel the operation and vetoed any activities by the Rosselli brothers against Italy. The communist brothers ignored the veto. The NKVD, with the help of a right-wing organization, then engineered the murder of the brothers (Franco Bandini, \"II cono d'ombra: Chi armo la mano degli assassini dei fra- telli Rosselli\" / \"The Cast of the Shadow: Who Armed the Assassins of the Rosselli Brothers?\", Rome, 1990). Carlo Rosselli was a member of the Italia Nuova in Paris. At this point, international freemasonry came to an important decision: the Soviet Union must be manoeuvred into a bloody war against Germany (Platonov, \"Russi a's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 1996, p. 298). The free- masons ensured there would be no economic sanctions against Ger- many. They wanted Hitler to be able to threaten the Soviet Union. In 1948, the freemason Igor Krovoshein, 32 nd degree, a member of the exile government, returned to the Soviet Union. The chekists were able to reveal his mission, and he was arrested and sent to a labour camp. In 1957, the French brothers helped him back to France.

In connection with the German occupation during the Second World War the freemasons in France we re hit by serious setbacks. The Vichy government, where Marshal Henri Philippe Petain played a central part, was against freemas onry and closed down the Grand Orient in 1940. On 13 August 1940, Marshal Petain forced through legislation demanding the disbanding of all secret societies. Civil servants belonging to the freemasons were forced to resign either from their posts or from their lodges. Petain had the principal free- masons arrested (a total of 5000 ) and sent to concentration camps. The conspirators, however, carried on their activities in the camps. Petain took the opportunity to confiscate the archives of the freemasons, which were handed over to the Germans. The freemasons took their revenge on him in 1945, when he was sentenced first to death and then to life in prison. Ninety-six masonic members of parliament had voted in favour of gi ving Petain the authority to rule Vichy-France (Ghislaine Ottenheimer, Renaud Lecadre, \"Les frcres invisibles\" / \"The Invisible Br others\", Paris, 2001, p. 63). In 1945, at the castle of Altan in Nieder-Schlesien, the Red Army came across 25 large railway cars containing highly sensitive archive material, including documents from various masonic lodges in Ger- many, France, Belgium, Holland, Luxemburg, Poland and Czecho- slovakia (Platonov, op. cit. Vol. 1, p. 3). The documents gave a comprehens ive picture of the secret power wielded by international freemasonry.

The extremist Jew Andrei Kozyrev (actually Aaron Friedman) who after the demise of communism became Russian foreign minister, organized the return of the secret masonic documents to the masonic central in Paris. On 20 May 1994, Russia handed over one million secret acts to France. According to th e Grand Orient librarian, Pierre Mollier, this was \"like Christmas many times over\". These documents contained important information about the masonic global conspi- racy. The Russian historian Oleg Platonov managed to copy several of these documents before they left Russia. Freemasonry Today (January 2002) wrote about these documents: \"On 14 June 1940, the German army entered Paris and on the same day took control of the buildings of the Grand Orient of France, at rue Cadet, situated in the centre of the city.. . On 1 July 1940, the German Foreign Minister, Alfred Rosenberg, informed Martin Borman that \"great treasures\" had been discovered in the occupied Masonic premises. Teams were established to seize documents relating to the workings of the Grand Orient, the largest organized b ody of French Freemasonry. They seized valuable historical documents, specifically targeting files covering the Grand Orient's external relations from the middle of the nineteenth century, and special attention was paid to the years immediately pre- ceding the outbreak of the 1939 war ...

Without belonging to the freemasonry, there is no reasonable chance of a fast career, regard- less of how talented one is. The freemasons admittedly control science and influence cultural life in a certain direction (Robert Lomas, \"Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Science\", Gloucester, Massachusetts, 2002).

The box contains letters and documents belonging to the Illu minati Order, wh ich was founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, and which systematically infiltrated the masonic lodges of the time. Many prominent freemasons were Illu- minati, and the history of the Illu minati Order is considered an im- portant part of the history of freemasonry as a whole. The Swedish trunk is of great interest. The leading Illuminati brother Johann Christoph Bode died in Weimar in December 1793. Bode had been recruited by Knigge in Wilhelmsbad in the summer of 1782. Bode also had access to the most important part of the Illu- minati correspondence in Gotha a nd Weimar. These documents ended up with the high-ranking illuminatus Ernst Duke von Gotha for safe- keeping. After his death in 1804 both his own papers and the Bode archive were returned to the Gran d Lodge of Sweden, as Duke von Gotha was not convinced that they would be safe from publication if they were kept by a German lodge. The high-ranking masonic King Charles XIII of Sweden assured hi m that the documents would never reach the public. In 1880, Duke Ernst II (grandson of Ernst von Gotha) asked for the Illuminati documents to be returned to Ger- many. Three years later, the archive containing 20 volumes of assor- 334"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"ted papers, became the property of the Ernst zum Kompass Lodge in Gotha. In 1909, the historian Carl Lepp named the material the Schwedenkiste. Leopold Engel, the Jewish grand master of the Illu- minati, used the Schwedenkiste ma terial when he published his book on the Illuminati Order. Rene le Forrestrier, who was not a free- mason, also referred to this material. Later in the 1920s and 30s, however, the duke's instructions were followed, and the sensitive material was not published. None of this information was leaked to the pres s, even though a large amount of information reached the masonic cont rolled part of the press at this time. The Hidden Influence In his book \"The Jacobins Club\" (\"Le club des Jacobins sous la Troi- sieme Republique\", Paris, 1900), the French historian Paul Nour- risson showed how all laws were disc ussed in the Grand Orient before being passed through parliament. Jean Bidegain published an excerpt from a masonic protocol in his book \"Masques et Visages Maconniqu es: Documents inedits\" / \"The Masonic Masques and Visages: Unpublished Documents\" (Paris, 1906, p. 187): 'The freemason Schwander was of the opinion that free- masonry should hold its protecting hand over the socialist move- ment.\" But he stressed that it wa s important for freemasonry not to compromise itself by these stealthy procedures. According to Bide- gain, freemasonry was in support of a highly secret association, a Chevalerie de Travail (The Labour Knighthood), which indoctrinated its members with a heavily militant socialism. Bidegain pointed out that all politics is masonic politics, which does not benefit the development of mankind but only the secret intentions of the free- masons. These intentions will eventu ally destroy the traditions that create harmony in any society (Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 347). 335"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"On 24 October 1883, under the sign of Scorpio, 17 socialist Illu- minati agreed to found the Society of the New Life in London. On 7 November 1883, a group gathered to discuss the formation of a new and potentially influential society. The group was split into two factions, and on 4 January 1884 one of these factions founded the Fabian Society. On 25 January, J. G. Stapleton was appointed its first chairman. The aim of the society was a slow and secret introduction of socialism, which accounts for its name, taken from the Roman military leader Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (The Delayer). Through a clever manoeuvre he defe ated the much la rger army of Hannibal. The other faction carri ed on its activities for another fifteen years under the name of The Fellowship. In May 1884, the masonic journalis t George Bernard Shaw became a member. (He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1925.) He was relatively soon promoted to one of the leading Fabians. His mist- ress Florence Farr was a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn. Shaw suggested never calling socialis m by its true name, in order not to frighten people away. He labelled himself a Marxist socialist. In March 1885, the freemason Sidney James Webb (1859-1947) became a member, and the next year Graham Wallas, another free- mason, also joined. Shaw, Webb, Wallas and Sidney Olivier were called \"the great four\". Sidney Webb founded the London School of Economics in 1895. It received economic contributions from the masonic bankers Rothschild, Julius We rnher, and Ernest Capel. In 1912, Webb founded a propa gandist periodical, The New Statesman. He was later to be found among th e leaders of the Labour Party. Other members of this group were the freemasons Edward Pease, Havelock Ellis, Frank Podmore, A nnie Besant, John Galsworthy, R. H. Tawney, G. D. H, Cole, Harold Laski, Israel Zangwill, and Israel Cohen. Fabianism also spread to other countries, among them the United States and Australia, as well as Canada, New Zealand, Denmark, Germany, Spain and India. In the United States the most influential Fabianist was Dean Acheson, who in 1933 did all he could to per- suade the USA to recognize the Soviet Union. 336"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The writer, freemason and intellig ence agent Herbert George Wells became a member in February 1903. That Wells was a freemason was made clear in the magazine The American Mason (October 2001, p. 24). The Grand Lodge of Minnesota c onfirms Wells' membership. Wells wished to act more openly and intensively and suggested the name be changed to The British Socialist Society. The conspiracy leadership did not approve of this suggestion, and in 1908 he left the group. The secret goal of this group was to establish an atheistic, class- less, socialist society, which wo uld prepare the way for the final victory - communism. In 1891, the group joined the Second Inter- nationale, which was created by the freemasons with the intention of turning England into a socialist country. In 1890, the Fabians left the Libera l Party. Thereafter, they helped found the Labour Representation Committee, which in 1906 became the Labour Party, which in 1918 took over all the main ideas of the Fabian Society. By 1946, the Fabian Society had 8400 members, among them Bert- rand Russell, (Pandit) Motilal Nehru, father of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ramsey MacDonald (British prime minister 1924, 1929-35), Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley and John Maynard Keynes. A member was also Harold Wilson, who later became prime minister. Almost half the Labour MPs were Fabians. The society's headquarters can be found at 11 Dartmouth Street in London. It publishes The Fabian Journal and The Fabian News Maga- zine. The fabianists demand a tota l nationalization of industry. In September 1902, the Fabians Beatrice and Sidney Webb formed an elite club, the Coefficients, wh ich met once a month at St Ermin's Hotel in London for dinner, usually consisting of some 10-14 persons. Later that year, H. G. Wells became a prominent member. Other members were the freemasons Richard B. Haldane, Lord Robert Cecil, Lord Edward Grey, Bertrand Russell, Lord Alfred Balfour and Lord Alfred Milner. Haldane, Cecil, Grey and Millner were ministers of the liberal government during the First World War. The Coefficients' chief ideologist was Wells. 337"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Many of the gentlemen were memb ers of the Illuminati lodge, the British Round Table, also called the Cliveden Set, after the name of the Astor family seat. Lord Wald orf Astor became a powerful press magnate {The Times). This masonic organization, founded and financed by the freemason Cecil Rhodes (Apollo University Lodge No. 357, and Prince Rose Croix Lodge No. 30), on 5 February 1891, did nothing to hide its support of Lenin and Hitler. This elite organi- sation also included members such as Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Bal- four and Lord Rothschild. After the death of Rhodes in 1902, Lord Alfred Milner was appointed its new leader. Out of the Round Table grew a number of other organizations: in 1919, the Illuminati Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) in London; in 1921, the Council on Forei gn Relations (CFR) in New York; and in 1925, the Institute of Paci fic Relations (IPR). The most im- portant ideologist of the American Round Table was the Fabian journalist Walter Lippmann. The defected illuminatus, Professor Vitus Renner, witnessed under oath on 7 April 1785: \"The Illumina ti fear nothing more than to be known under their right name. They hide under the cloak of free- masonry.\" The international spokesman of this conspiracy was H. G. Wells. In 1884 he had received a grant to study at the Normal School of Science in South Kensington, where for three years his teacher was Thomas H. Huxley, a dedicated ad vocate of the false doctrines of Darwin. Wells pointed out his decisive contribution to the under- mining of the concept of God. After the Second World War, Huxley's sons Aldous and Julian contributed enormously to brai nwashing the young generation with rock music, sex and drugs, thereby achieving social control. Wells later called Hitler his twin brother in spirit. As early as 1855, the m asonic socialist Alexander Herzen observed: \"It is possible to lead a whole generation astray, blind it, blunt it, and guide it towards the wrong goals... .\" (Alexander Herzen, \"From the Other Shore\", Tallinn, 1970, p. 130). 338"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"During the First World War, Wells led the propaganda department of the British intelligence service. He was an adviser on the develop- ment of military equipment in both world wars. In 1901, Wells published \"Anticipations of the Reaction of Mecha- nical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought\", where for the first time he introduced the idea of an 'open conspiracy' leading to a \"world state with one language and one government'\". Wells demanded that the less wort hy be killed. The Elite should decide who the less worthy was. Wells wrote: \"For a multitude of contemptible and silly creatures, fear -driven and helpless and useless, unhappy or hatefully happy in the midst of squalid dishonour, feeble, ugly, inefficient, born of unrestrained lusts, and increasing and multi- plying through sheer incontinence and stupidity, the men of the New Republic will have little pity and less benevolence.\" Wells emphasized: \"They will hold, I anticipate, that a certain portion of the population - the small minority, for example, afflicted with in- disputably transmissible diseases, with transmissible mental disorders, with such hideous incurable habits of mind as the craving for intoxication - exists only on sufferance, out of pity and patience, and on the understanding that they do not pr opagate; and I do not foresee any reason to suppose that they will hesit ate to kill when that sufferance is abused... They will have an ideal that will make killing worth the while; like Abraham, they will have the faith to kill, and they will have no super- stitions about death... All such kill ing will be done with an opiate... If deterrent punishments are used at all in the code of the future, the deterrent will neither be death, or mutilation of the body, nor mutilation of the life by imprisonment, nor any horrible things like that, but good scientifically caused pain, that will leave nothing but a memory.\" (Wells, \"Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought\", London, 1901, pp. 299-300) In 1905, he published his book \"A M odern Utopia\". Wells was of the opinion that the conspiracy c ould very well be public, as opposed to the secret plots of the French freemasons. 339"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"In his pamphlet \"The Open Conspiracy: Blueprints for a World Revo- lution\" (London, 1929) Wells spelled out the main features of the masonic enterprise: • Control over the worl d's natural resources • Reducing world population by means of war • Replacing a multi-polar world order, consisting of sovereign nations, with one uni-polar world dictatorship Wells thought that the very exis tence of national states would inevitably lead to war and had th erefore better be eliminated. A supreme race would establish the new world state. The new priest- hood would consist of the \"open conspirators\". This all fits in with the aims of the Grand Orient, as published in 1982 in their magazine: \"The concept of race, proved to be unreal by the discoveries in biology; the concep ts of boundaries, a nnihilated by the development of communications; the concept of class, weakened by the progress of equality; all these outdate d concepts ought to be abolished in order to fully integrate man in a universal framework\" It is, in fact, the great revolution of modern time, the real revolution, which remains and from which the Gra nd Orient of France can not be ab- sent, if it wants to keep true to its own principles.\" (Humanisme, Novem- ber 1982, p. 84). Wells emphasized that ideas and mo rality should be controlled in such a way that people will \"volun tarily\" wish for the New World Order of 'the open conspiracy', which will be introduced a step at the time. 'The open conspiracy' is planned as an insidious network, a stream- lined system, developing as a nation within the nation, eventually to abolish this nation and establish wo rld government. This network is to act as \"a kind of open secret society... informal and open free- masonry\". It will influence and dire ct the existing government in all conceivable ways. The 'open conspiracy' will be founded on Darwin's ideas. Wells stressed: \"All these obsolete va lues and attitudes with which our minds are cumbered must be cleared out if the new faith is to have free 340"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"play. We have to clear them out not only from our own minds but from the minds of others who are to become our associates.\" Wells considered it necessary that 'the open conspiracy' use this kind of brainwashing on young people, in order to create \"better\" people with the help of mass psychology. He called it \"cultural struggle\". The idea of the open cons piracy, according to Wells, is to kill the human soul, to destroy human conscience and morality and to turn human beings into creatures with out will-power. The open conspi- racy would take man hi s worth, since it will deprive him of freedom and make him a subject of a world empire. The consequence of this conspiracy would be to reduce th e cognitive ability of man to see through the horrendou s madness of the ma sonic psychopaths. People are following the freemasons as if they are enchanted, as the crew followed the demoniacal captain Ahab, who divorced from reality, fanatically chased the gho stly white whale, Moby Dick. Eventually, he allowed the ship to perish, since most of the crew did not dare to question Ahab and the minority we re unable to resist him. They were all entranced. Wells admitted: \"The Open Conspiracy is not so much a socialism as a more comprehensive offspring, whic h has eaten and assimilated what- ever was digestible of its socialist forbears.\" \"The 'open conspiracy' is not so much a case of socialism, as a more extensive plan which has devoured and digested everything useful from its socialist ancestors.\" (\"The Open Conspiracy\"). Wells' plan has for the last 75 year s, been implemented in a most frightening way. Wells was an ardent believer in \"glo balisation\", the most destructive goal of the I lluminati. Today the Fabians open conspiracy is carried on by the Society's member and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The secret meetings of the Illu minati were called synods. Those who, within any one district, have achieved the middle degree, the epopts, constitute a synod. Each dist rict has nine epopts. Their work is with propaganda that is they create public opinion. According to 341"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"the Weishaupt constitution those belonging to the epopt degree direct public opinion. In the name of science, the Illuminati aim to turn the world upside-down. The epopts act as apostles. Those who achieve the degree must have aba ndoned their belief in God (Augus- tin Barruel, \"Memoirs Illustrating th e History of Jacobinism\", Lon- don, 1797). Wells was one such epopt. Then there are of course the higher degrees (Initiate of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, Rex Summus Sanctissimus, Frater Superior, and Outer Head of the Order (12 th degree). Above them all is the Supreme Council of the Order, w hose members are called areopagi. Their chairman is the secret king of the Illuminati, whose name and residence are known only to the areopagi. The areopagi are the invisible class, the hidden part of the conspiracy. If, due to the criminal activities of an Illuminati member, there is a risk that secrets of the order fall into the wrong hands, he must commit suicide. The leadership demands suicide in such cases. To protect the secrets of the order, the adept Serge of Portugal, killed himself in the 1790s. Weishaupt po inted out: \"No worldly power can save him who betrays us.\" The freemasons required an intern ational organization, able to monitor all nations. It was set up on 28 April 1919 in Paris under the name of the League of Nations on the initiative of the freemasons Woodrow Wilson and Jan Chris tiaan Smuts (1870-1950, prime minister of South Afri ca 1919-1924), and was originally led by the freemasons headed by James Eric Drummond (English Liberal poli- tician, 1876-1951), and Joseph Avenol (1879-1952). Its charter came into force on 10 January 1920. The League of Nations would, accor- ding to its propaganda, end all wars. The masonic elite had instigated th e First World War, which lasted for four years, three months and eleven days. Eight million soldiers were killed, some twenty million civilians died from disease and star- vation and in connection with soci al upheavals. Twenty million sol- diers were seriously wounded and three million were disabled. The war cost 100 million dollars per day. While the freemason govern- 342"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"ment looked on, English businessmen sold food to the Germans, thus prolonging the war by several year s. The deliveries were made through Scandinavian intermediaries. The masonic elite later offered its solution, the League of Nations, which would officially establish peace and co-operation between the nations of the world, but which eventually became a world govern- ment. The Convention of the Grand Lodge of France in 1922 admitted that the League of Nations would lead to the formation of the United States of Europe and a world federation (Vasili Ivanov, \"The Russian Intelligentsia and Freemasonry from Peter I to the Present Days\", Moscow, 1997, p. 476). The attempt was a failure. On 25 September 1919, the US Senate voted against membership in the Le ague of Nations. When President Wilson was informed, he had a nervous breakdown. Shortly after, he suffered a stroke that paralysed the left side of his body. On 19 March 1920, the Senate again voted ag ainst the United States joining the League of Nations. Germany constituted the main obst acle to the realisation of the plans made by the British Round Table for a world government ruled from London and New York. Lord Lionel Rothschild was an all-powerful member of the Round Table, who financed both Cecil Rhodes and the leader of British freemasonry, Alfred Milner. In this wa y, they were able to build their mining empire (DeBeers Consolidated Mines) in South Africa. Roth- schild was pleased with Milner and therefore appointed him chairman of the board of Rio Tinto Zinc. Before the First World War, there was already a high-ranking free- mason, Rene Viviani (1863-1925), serving as prime minister of France. After the war he represented France at the League of Nations. In 1925, the prominent freemason (G rand Orient) and leader of the French radicals, Leon Bourgeois (1851-1925), became head of the French delegation to the League of Nations (Pierre Mariel, \"Les Francs-Maeons en France\" , Paris, 1969, p. 204). 343"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Great Britain was also ruled by po werful freemasons on high poli- tical posts, among them Lord Alfred Milner (1854-1925), who in 1918-19 was the conservative secretar y for war in the Lloyd George cabinet, and in 1919-1921 secretary for the colonies, as well as being a delegate at Versailles in 1919. Du ring the First World War, he was a member of the coalition war cabinet. In 1936, a delegate for the Grand Orient made a speech in Paris: \"Is it right to use goodness against ev il things?\" On the contrary, it was entirely wrong in his opinion. Evil things included everything not beneficial to the interests of the freemasons and the Grand Orient in particular, even though it might further the spiritual development of mankind. On 1 March 1931, the high-ranking freemason Gabriel Terra became president of Uruguay. Two years later he established a right-wing dictatorship, which lasted until 19 June 1938. Without the support of American lodges his rule would not have been possible. The Special Archives in Moscow contain documents, which show B'nai B'rith (Sons of the Covenant) as superior to all other branches of freemasonry, that it in fact constitutes a kind of free-masonry within freemasonry. The 1090 lodges of B'nai B'rith have no names, only numbers. The President of B'nai B'rith International is Richard D. Heideman. B'nai B'rith was founded under the name Bundesbriider by twelve German Jewish freemasons on 13 October 1843 at the Saint Germain Cafe in New York. Only Jews and half-Jews are admitted to the order. The American lodge B'nai B'rith wo rks very closely with the Illu- minati. B'nai B'rith is represented in the UN since its foundation (\"Lexikon des Judentums\"). An agreement was signed on 12 September 1874 in Charleston between B'nai B'rith and the Supreme Council of Scottish Rite, con- cerning their extensive co-operation and the formation of a general confederacy of Israeli lodges. Si gnatories of this document were Armand Levi and Albert Pike, alias Limud Enhoff, his masonic name, grand master of the Palladium. In his edict, issued in connection 344"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"with this agreement, Pike stated that the year was in fact 874 (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns : The Secret History of Free- masonry 1731-1996\", Moscow, 2000, Vol. II p. 102). In the Soviet Union, B'nai B'rith was acting openly as early as 1988. In May 1989 the Jewish periodical l' Arche reported a visit to Moscow by a delegation of 21 members of the French branch of B'nai B'rith on 23-29 December 1988. The president, Mac Aron, founded a lodge that soon included 63 Russia n Jews, among them the finan- ciers Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Fridman and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and the politician Grigori Yavlinsk y (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia under the Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 2000, p. 25). Soon B'nai B'rith had been established in St Petersburg , Kiev, Odessa, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk. Many things depends on the suppor t of B'nai Brith, among other things whether any one country is allowed as a me mber of NATO. This was made clear on 13 September 2002, when the leaders of B'nai B'rith and the Jewish Committee in the United States promised the Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, who was visiting the United States in the course of work, that they would support Latvia's NATO membership. Henry Kissinger also me t the Latvian president in order to discuss the expansion of NATO. The B'nai B'rith representative Saul E. Joftes stated in 1969, that th e aim of Zionism (and thus of its organizations, including B'nai B'rith) is to achieve world-wide control with the help of a world government ( Washington Observer, 12 De- cember 1969). The freemasons infiltrate extreme ideological movements or establish new ones, pit one against the other and thus achieve their aims of changing society. At the same time, they attempt, through exclusive clubs, to control and gove rn that elite in society, which does not belong to it. Rotary International for instance is entirely in the hands of the freemasons. This movement was foun ded in Chicago in March 1905 by the free-mason Paul Harris, who al so belonged to B'nai B'rith.

The 19 33-1934, President of the French Rotary Club was Ulisse Fabre, w ho at the same time was acting as grand master of the Orange La Cite Future lodge, according to the Grand Orient register. Masonic periodicals have praised the activities of the Rotary Clubs, as these ar e very useful for freemasonry. In 1952, the movement had one million members in 7650 clubs in 84 countries. In Sweden, Rotary has 30 000 members in 522 clubs. Today, Rotary is also present in Russia. The well-known film director Stanislav Govorukhin is a member of this exclusive club. Rotary is also active in Estonia today (12 clubs with almost 400 members). There are also several other similar groups or clubs such as Lions and Le Cercle. Lions Internationa l was founded in 1917 by Melvin Jones, a member of B'nai B'rith. In 1968, Lions had 470 000 \"brothers\" in the United States and 160 000 in the rest of the world, in a total of 17 441 clubs. The Bohemian Club was founded as an organization for selected journalists in 1872 in Monte Rio in Sonoma County, 75 miles north of San Francisco. This club was inf iltrated and transformed into a brotherhood. Every year on 15 July several dozen leading members take part in a ritual dressed as \"priests\" in red- hooded Illuminati robes, guardians of the fire, worshipping a huge stone owl as Molok. They thereafter practise magic by burning an effigy. A torch from the lamp of the Fellowship is used to ignite the fire. This elite club of Grove Camp is reminiscent of the enclosed area, like the Soviet nomenclature had. It counts 2700 male members, among them Henry Kissinger, George Schultz (former secretary of state), Helmut Schmidt, World Bank director Tom Clausen, Caspar Weinberger (former secretary of de fense), Paul Volcker (former Fede- ral Reserve chairman), Gerald Ford, President of the United States George W. Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell (CFR), and other important personages on the political arena. George W. Bush is also a member of the secret lodge Skull and Bones and the Hillbilly Camp.

Alex Jones tells about that evening: \"Suddenly the owl was lit up by some flood lights and out ran a hundred priests or so in black, red an green robes.

It was total insanity.\" The old men make the hateful shouts: \"Oh yeah! Burn that bastard! Kill him! That 's what he deserves!\" Charles Taze Russell, freemason of the 32 nd degree, founded Jeho- vah's Witnesses in 1879 in the Un ited States in an attempt to manipulate those who are outside the lodges, but do not mind playing the part of useful idiots . His successor was Joseph Franklin Rutherford. They used masonic and Illuminati symbols. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, founders of the Mormon Church in 1830, were both freemasons of hi gh rank. In their ceremonies, the Mormons wear white gowns with a s quare on the right side and a pair of compasses on the left. Until 1937, Mormons were not allowed to become freemasons (Charles W. Fer guson, \"Fifty Million Brothers\", New York, 1937, p. 28). The Mormon leader Heber C. Kimball wished, however, that all people were freemasons. The hippie movement was founded and led by two Jewish free- masons, Herbert Marcuse and Jerry Rabin. They did everything in their power to introduce young people to the use of drugs and to dissonant rock music, thus silencing their protests against the stagnant masonic society. 347"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Those trying to undermine our society are not interested in peace and happiness.

Russian politicians, or rather, political villains, are constantly su pported from abroad, in particular from the United States. In June 1992, the freemasons arranged a seminar under the title The Social Rights of the European Citizens, where they advocated a Europe without borders. Behind th e seminar were among others the Grand Orient of France, the Grand Lodge of France, the Grand Lodge of Turkey, the Grand Symbolic Lodge of Spain, the Grand Lodge of Italy. Freemasons from Russia were represented, among them the mayor of St. Petersbur g, Anatoli Sobchak (Pravda, 21 July 1993). A year later another similar c onvention was arranged.

In May 1991, Radio Liberty of Munich urged Soviet citizens to be- come members of the Pushkin lodge in Paris (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia under the Power of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 2000, p. 30). When the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin saw through the evil of freemasonry and no longer wanted to remain a member of this movement, he was provoked into a duel and murdered in cold blood. Pushkin as an enemy of freemasonry was regarded as dangerous (Platonov, \"The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Mo scow, 2000, Vol. I, pp. 559-560). The real politics was determined in the masonic lodges. Politics has always been made with the help of big money. The masonic elite is able to steal and rob without risking prosecution. In just a few days in the autumn of 1992 the super thief and freemason George Soros (B'nai B'rith ) managed to drain Sweden of 18 billion dollars, causing the country enormous damage. He conducted a similar operation against Great Britain, making some 1-2 billion dollars. In September 1992, he acqu ired nearly 300 million dollars, speculating against the Italian lira . Italy was forced to devalue the lira by 30%. Soros' attacks on the currencies of the South-East Asian countries were an important factor behind the heavy devaluations of these currencies, which began in the summer of 1997. At the IMF meeting in Hong Kong in September 1997, Ma laysian Prime Mini ster Mahathir bin Mohamad labelled these activities \"extortion\". On 23 August 1997, he made the following statement: \"All these countries have wor- ked for 40 years trying to b u i l d up their economies, only to have a creep l i k e Soros come along with a load of money to speculate against their currencies.\" He pointed out Soros as one of the thieves. Soros, the currency pirate and head of the Quantum Fund, clearly stated on 4 September 1998 that Mahathi bin Mohamad \"would need to be removed from power\".

Only those politicians wh o harm the national interest are allowed to remain in power in to day's macabre masonic world. In October 2003, Mahathir said, \"Jews rule the world by proxy\". The masonic mass media protested. The board of Soros' Quantum Fund includes re presentatives of the Rothschild family, among them the financiers Nils 0. Taube and Richard Katz. Also included are such forces that deal in money laundering. George Soros has emphasised: \"I cannot, and do not, con- sider the social consequences of my actions.\" Thus speaks no one but a hardened villain. It was perhaps for this reason that the chairman of the American banking committee, Henry Gonzalez, named him 'Golem Soros'. Soros made sure that a special or ganization, the Magisterium, was founded for the Russian political elite . Soros is himself a member of the Magisterium as are Alexander Yakovlev (Knight of Malta) and Eduard Shevardnadze (Knight of Malta) as well as Yegor Gaidar, Ana- toli Chubays, Leonid Abalkin, St anislav Shatalin, Yevgeni Yevtu- shenko, Ernst Neizvestny, Anatoli Sobchak, Ivan Brodsky and many other well-known persons. They all received economic suppor t from the United States, as did the freemason Grigori Yavlinsky. This was ensured by the Trilateral Commission. In the years 1993-97, Soros has paid out at least 6 million dollars to organizations in the United Stat es promoting legalization of drugs. He has also founded his own institu tes for the legalization of drugs and for euthanasia, with offices in his \"charitable foundation\", the Institute for an Open Society. Judging from his activities, it would seem that to Soros, an \"open society\" is a country, which opens its doors wide for his attacks of speculation and robbery. With the shock therapy that Soros and his gang have forced on the Eastern European countries, he has extinguished every reasonable possibility of a successful economic reform policy.

In 1907, the freemason Debner said in a speech to the Grand Orient: \"Par ents must never forget that they have the right to keep their own children only thanks to the authority given to them by society.\" This was entirely in the Illuminati spirit, as Weishaupt had pointed out that parents ought not to have the right to be in charge of their children's education. A Masonic Congress at the Hotel du Grand Orient in Paris in 1903 passed a resolution to make an add ition to the civil rights legislation. The congress wished to remove from the parents the right to educate their children, of losing their rights as parents and citizens ( ibid, p. 318).

To achieve this one should start a communist or at leas t a national socialist revolution. Eventually the bankers decided that a national socialist regime was to be preferred. Earlier they had taken notice of Adolf Hitler. This information appeared in a book by \"Sidney Warburg\", \"'De Geldbronnen van het Nationaal-Socialisme\" (\"The Financers of Natio- nal Socialism\"), which was publis hed in 1933 in Amsterdam and disappeared without a trace. Later it surfaced in Sw itzerland trans- lated into German. The book still remains in the social archive of Zurich. James and Paul Warburg declared it a horrid anti-Semitic forgery (Antony C.

On 7-8 November 1918, the Jewish socialist, freemason and journa- list Kurt Eisner (actually Salomon Kosmonowski) had in the name of socialism seized power in Munich. In October that year he was released from prison. During the c oup d'etat he agitated people and arranged to rally 100 000 naive Germans. With a few hundred freemasons he occupied the parliament and government buildings and proclaimed a socialist repub lic. The Bavarian king was over- thrown and forced into exile. A workers and soldiers council with freemasons in the lead came to power. Eisner named himself prime and foreign minister. In the govern ment there were both mensheviks and bolsheviks.

The Soviet regime was implemented on 8 November 1917, and the European Union was also proclaimed under this sign on 1 N ovember 1993. Those books within the secret Jewish societies that we re forbidden to non-Jews displayed a symbolic scorpion on its covers. Three months after the socialist coup, on 21 February 1919, Kurt Eisner was murdered by the German officer Count Anton Arco-Valley, who had been expelled from the na tionalist and occult Thule Society because of his Jewish blood. He wa nted with this murder show that he was loyal to the German ideals.

Hitler got financial support from at least three Jewish art shops. The historian Ken Anderson admitted in his book \"Hitler and the Occult\" (New York, 1995, p. 37) that Hitler's early contacts with the Jews had been surprisingly cordial. Despite his later attacks on the Jews, he respected and protected the Jewish physician Eduard Bloch, who had treated Hitler's mother for free when she was suffering from cancer. In 1940, Hitler allowed the Bloch family to emigrate to the United States (Richard Swartz, \"Hitler's Political anti-Semitism was Established in Vienna\", Svenska Dagbladet, 9 January 1997). But Hi tler disliked that the Jews controlled the Social Democratic Party in Austria. In the chaos emerging from the murder of Eisner, some masonic bolsheviks took the opportunity to establish a new red government with Johann Hoffmann at the head . But the government ruined the economy, and had to flee to Bamber g in early April 1919. Then some- thing strange happened. On 7 April 1919, a group of intellectuals, anarchists and representatives of the Farmers Alliance under the head of Gustav Landauer came to power and established a new government that was trying to normalize the economy by getting rid of \"the villain of the drama\" - the charging of interest. The freemasons became very concer ned that they would lose their secret hold on the community. The new government of Bavaria had been in power for only one week, when the masonic communists on 13 April overthrew it. Landauer went to the side of the bandits. His ideal was the masonic anar chist Francisco Ferrer. Thereby Minister of Finance, Silvio Gesell, was stopped from introducing a well-functioning system for an economy without interest and inflation. Willy Hess wrote the following in his book \"Silvio Gesell und die Freiwirtscha ft\" (\"Silvio Gesell and the Free Economy\", Winterthur, 1985, p. 22): \"Gesell's reforms were regarded 358"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"as a deadly blow to capitalism, and were to be fought with any means available.\" Information on this short period in German political history is hard to find. In ordinary history books one gets the impression that the political masonic criminal Levine took control immediately after the murder of Eisner. That was not the case at all. One simply wanted to wipe out Silvio Gesell's name from the history books, although this was the only positive phenomenon that occurred in this time. Jewish masonic communists with Eugene Levine, Ernst Toller (the leader of the local Red Army), Ma x Levien, Erich Miihsam (son of a rabbi), Arnold Wadler and Tobias Ax elrod at the top were in power during two weeks (13 April - 1 May 1919). They proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Munich and thereafter the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. All of its leaders belonged to the secret masonic lodge Num- ber Eleven, situated at Brennerstrasse in Munich. Most of them had come to Bavaria from Russia after taking part in the revolutionary red terror in 1905. Eugene Levine became president of the People's Commissars Coun- cil in the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. He was born in St. Petersburg in 1883 as Nissen Berg. Eugene Levi ne raped Countess Westarp, the famous nationalist, before ha ving her and other people shot. Tobias Axelrod (freemason of the 33 rd degree and illuminatus) was the grand master of the lodge and became people's commissar for economical affairs. He immediatel y annulled Gesell's financial re- forms. In 1918, he had founded a Bu reau of Information in Copen- hagen on behalf of Soviet Russia (Mikhail Demidenko, \"Tracing the SS to Tibet\", St. Petersburg, 1999, p. 177). The Galician extremist Jew and freemason Dr Ernst Neurath became people's commissar for communist id eology of the Soviet Republic. These \"revolutionaries\" wanted to grab as much gold and jewellery as possible in Munich. The Communi st Militia took hostages in order to get hold of the riches of the citizens. Eugene Levine and Max Levien also murdered their hostag es. For example, the Jewish revo- lutionary guards on 26 April 19 19 took seven members of the Thule "},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Society hostage and thereafter (on April 30) murdered all of them, including Count Gustav von Turn und Taxis. All over Munich one could see Red Army soldiers perpet rating various atrocities. The Revolutionary Tribunal was be hind the organized terror. The Thule Society quickly founded a special battle unit, Thule, whose task it was, with guns in their hands to fight the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. Adolf Hitler also managed to play the bolshevik role during these two weeks. He became number two in the Battalion Council of the Red Army of the Soviet Republic. In other words, Hitler started his political career as an activist in a So ldier's Council. It is said that he was politically confused. In the usua l descriptions of the way Hitler came to power, these facts are missi ng. The documents, however, are still there. The White Troops that had surrounded Munich, managed to over- throw the masonic communists on 1-2 May, which the Illuminati considered a very hard setback. Landauer was arrested on 1 May and executed the next day. Eugene Levine was immediately arrested, and on 3 June he was sentenced to death. Two days later he was shot. Toller was sentenced to five and M iihsam to 15 years in prison. The mass murderer Max Levien (born 1885 in Moscow) first escaped to Vienna and in 1921 moved to Soviet Russia where he became a member of the Central Executive Committee and active in the Comintern. The blood-red masonic ba ndits had played their part and had to leave Bavaria. Max Levien had become leader of the red Spartakist League and established a Communist Party in Munich after the First World War (David Korn \"Wer ist wer im Judentum: Lexikon der Jiidischen Prominenz\" / \"Who is Who in Judaism: Encyclopaedia of Prominent Jews\", Volume 2, FZ-V erlag, Munich, 1999, p. 188). He had tried to exterminate so many nationalistic Germans as possible. The leaders of the Spartakists belonged to the IUuminati Order. The Jews Tobias Axelrod, Karl Liebknecht, and Rosa Luxemburg belonged to the New IUuminati Order (Friedrich Wichtl, \"Freimaurerei, Zionismus, Kommu- 360"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"nismus, Bolschewismus\" / \"Freemasonry, Zionism, Communism, Bol- shevism\", Munich, 1921, p. 15). Karl Liebknecht was also a member of B'nai B'rith ( Zeiten-Schrift, No. 32, 2001). In September 1919, Hitler became a member of the tiny German Workers Party (DAP) in Munich, after having attended its meetings for the military intelligence (William L. Shirer, \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\", New York, 1960). At the beginning of 1920, Hitler took over the party's propaganda function. Eventually he would control the entire party. The movement started to grow rapidly. Hitler skilfully used the discontent with the worsening social con- ditions. Already on 1 April that same year, the movement received its new name - The National Socialist Ge rman Workers Party (NSDAP). In the summer of 1921, Hitler became th e official leader of the party. In November 1922, the American Embassy in Berlin sent Captain Truman Smith to Munich to get information on Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist Party (ibid). 361"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"In the beginning of 1923, Lenin and Comintern leader Grigori Zinoviev decided that Germany was ready for a bolshevik revolution. The communists considered it a key area for world revolution and wanted to use the discontent among the people. Comintern and the Red Aid desperately tried to implement the plan in Germany while the sun was in the sign of Scorpio. Their seizure of power was to take place at midnight 22 October 1923. At dawn the next day Hamburg, Berlin and other large cities would be in the hands of the bolsheviks. All these operations were led by the freemasons Karl Radek (actually Sobelsohn), Bela Kun, and Josef Unschlicht (member of the Cheka and the Soviet military intelli- gence) from Moscow. The operation was to be extended to all of Germany. Officially Radek was stationed at the Soviet Trade Dele- gation in Berlin. The German communist functionaries thought, however, that preparations were not sufficient for such a large undertaking (the time was not ripe , as it were), and wanted to postpone the \"revolution\" for three months. The high-ranking free- masons, who controlled various communist movements, simply had other plans for Germany. Only, they \"forgot\" to inform the terrorist leader Ernst Thalmann. Therefore together with his 300 \"revolutionaries\", he began his attempted coup in Hamburg on 23 October at 5 a. m. On 25 October, all terrorists were defeated. Hitler got the attention he needed, when on 8 November 1923 he tried to stage a counter-action - a very badly organized coup d'etat in Munich. Afterwards he hid temporarily at a house of a Jewish women called Hanfstaengl in Muni ch. Hitler became known not only in Germany but also abroad. Hitler's name was on the front pages of the newspapers all over the world. He utilised the trial fully and turned defeat into an ideological victory. He was released after less than nine months, even through he was sentenced to five years in prison (the law actually stipulated life imprisonment). In prison he dictated his political manifesto \"Mein Kampf\", whose first part was published on 18 July 1925 and second part in 1927. He 362"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"quoted Henry Ford's book \"The Inte rnational Jew\". Later the book brought him large royalties - in 1930 it amounted to 50 000 Reichs- mark and all in all he made over a million. \"Mein Kampf\" was first translated into Russian and printed in a limited edition for the Central Committee in Moscow in 1928. Stalin began to admire Hitler and decided to support him on his way to power (Viktor Suvorov, \"Suicide\", Moscow, 2000, pp. 55-56). It took several years to reorganize the National Socialist Party. In January 1927, the national socialists and their struggle for power and socialism seemingly had no future. Ac cording to his sentence, Hitler was not allowed to speak publicly until 1927. Since 1925 Hitler was stateless, having failed to beco me a German citizen. Not until 1932 actually he did become a German citizen. After some time he was considered by Wall Street bankers as a promising figure. They decided to wager on Adolf Hitler and thereby provoke chaos in Europe. To contact him a courier with dipl omatic status was sent to Ger- many. This person called himself Sidney Warburg, an obvious alias. To help Hitler to power the masonic bankers indented to offer him economic support. In return the se people wanted an aggressive foreign policy and actions against France. The bankers calculated that France in that case would turn to Britain and the United States, and thus the French government would find itself in an economic trap. It was decided not to reveal to Hitler why he was actually con- tacted. The agreement between Hitler and the bankers in June 1929 was signed among others by John D. Rockefeller, Jr, J. H. Carter (Guaranty Trust Company, The Nati onal City Bank of New York), the banker Tommy Walker, and Presiden t of the United States Herbert Clark Hoover (1929-1933), most of them high-ranking freemasons. The press mogul William Randolph Hearst (Consolidated Publications) was also present at this meeting. This important information former economics professor Antony Sutton gives in his book \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\" (Sudbury, England, 1976). The information 363"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"was verified and made more speci fic by the German politician and author G. Schmalbrock. William Collins Whitney, one of th e managers of Guaranty Trust Company, was a member of the sec retive Skull & Bones Society and the Illuminati. Skull & Bones is closely connec ted to the freemasonry and the Illuminati. The Order of Skull & Bones Society was once called The Brotherhood of Death. Skull & Bones, originally Chapte r 322 of a secret German Order, was founded at Yale University the years 1832-1833 by General William Huntington Russell and Alph onso Taft, who later was secre- tary of war in the Ulysses S. Gran t administration. Both were free- masons. The Order was built on income from illegal narcotics traffic. Every year 15 new members are selected. President George W. Bush's grandfather Prescott Sheldon Bush, and some other Bonesmen, robbed the grave of Geronimo, took a skull and other relics of the Apache chief, and still have them on display in a glass case. Bonesmen say they is still there, despite demands for their return. Bush Senior claimed that they \"lost them\". Famous Bonesmen were also William Howard Taft, president of the United States, Henry Luce, founder of Time Magazine, and Averell Harriman, diplomat and confid ant of American presidents. John D. Rockefeller, Jr, was at the time a member of the masonic organization The Ameri can Protective Association (APA), which was founded on 13 mars 1887 in Clinton, Iowa, by the high-ranking freemason Henry Francis Bowers (Paul A. Fisher, \"Behind the Lodge Door: Church, State, and Freemasonry in America\", Rockford, Illinois 1994, p. 79). His brother Percy Rockefeller also took part in financing the bolsheviks as well as the national socialists. Percy Rockefeller also belonged to the Skull & Bones Society. In addition the banker George Herber t Walker (father of George H. Bush, president of the United States 1989-1993) helped finance Adolf Hitler.

Congress did, ho wever, confiscate the bank, but members of the board were awarded some 1.5 million dollars each after the war. By studying documents that have been kept concealed from us, we can discover the actual circumstances of Hitler's seizure of power. We are also informed of the names of those persons responsible for starting the Second World War. These are gentlemen who were never tried at Nuremberg. According to Antony Sutton, the war crimes trial of Nuremberg was a political farce, where neither the Soviet atro- cities nor the horrendous crimes of th e allies, during as well as after the war, were ever mentioned. The Nazi leaders were accused of crimes against the peace (instigating the war). The German government was seen as conspiring against the peace. On the contrary , the victors were the powers behind this crime. Germany was tr ying to avoid war, since it was unprepared for it, as shown by statis tics discovered by war historian Viktor Suvorov in his book \"Suicide\" (Moscow, 2000). Starting in April 1945, American and French forces killed more than a million German prisoners of wa r. Most were interned in Ameri- can camps. Eisenhower created a reig n of terror never before seen in American military history. This was a tremendous war crime. That were virtual death camps (James Ba cque, \"Other Loss es\", Toronto, 1991). A deceptive myth exists that it was German capitalists, headed by Fritz Thyssen, the railway engine manufacturer Ernst von Borsing and the coal magnate Emil Kirdorf in the Ruhr area who provided Hitler's financial support. Until 1933, Th yssen paid no more than 2 million RM. This was a comparatively small sum. The German Communist Party alone received tens of m illions of marks from Moscow. That German capitalism in genera l had no connection to the Nazi Party is easily proved by study ing the documents found in the archives of the major companies. The Nazi Party had from the start 365"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"an anti-capitalist attitude, aimed against German capitalism. When the Nazis in November 1932, tried to make the German capitalists sign a petition for Hitler's appointment to Chancellor, only one of them actually signed it - Fritz Thyssen, who was in fact one of their supporters. Franz von Papen was in the hands of the financial elite. The German financial elite played a minimal role, as confirmed by the American historian Henry Asby Turner Jr in his magnum opus, \"Ger- man Big Business and the Rise of Hitler\" (Oxford, 1987). Unfor- tunately Turner says nothing about the role American big business and freemasonry played in Hitler's rise to the top. Hitler received help only from a few Jewish capitalists, whose enterprises were based in Germany and who were closely connected to international freemasonry, in particular IG Farben and the Warburg family, who acted as a front for Rothschild. In 1937, Max Warburg changed the name of his bank from Warburg & Co, to the Brinkman Bank, in order to camou flage the business. Herr Brinkman was a gentile who would not attract attention. Hitler's meetings with his Financial Backers The meeting between Hitler and \"Sidney Warburg\" took place in Munich in June 1929, and was arranged by the mayor of Munich Deutzberg. Hitler demanded 100 m illion marks (24 million dollars) from the Americans. On 25 October 1929, another meeting was arranged, which included major bankers and representatives from the large trusts. Among the participants were Henry Deterding, the director of Royal Dutch-Shell and a high-ranking freemason. Georg Bell, one of the SA leaders, was hi s agent within the Nazi movement. The SA (Sturmabteilung) was made up of the infamous brownshirts. The SA symbol consisted of large five-pointed stars. The New York bankers regarded the amount demanded by Hitler as far too large, and gave him a mere 10 million dolla rs. This money was transferred 366"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"to the Mendelsohn's Bank in Amster dam, controlled by the Warburg brothers, who were high-ranking fre emasons and Illuminati. They were part of the Rothschild financial empire. Ten of the top Nazi leaders had the right to withdraw the money by cheque in ten diffe- rent German cities. At a later stage, Schroder Bank of Frankfurt am Main also took part. Baron Kurt Schroder was Hi tler's personal banker and SS- Gruppenfiihrer (equivalent to army lieutenant general). From 1938, Schroder Bank represented the Nazi fi nancial interests in Britain. In the United States, Schroder and Rockefeller merged some of their business interests. Avery Rockefelle r, son of Percy Rockefeller, was vice president of the Schroder Banking Corporation of New York (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\", Sudbury, 1976, p. 81). Henry Deterding promised to send 500 000 pounds to Hitler, who in addition would receive 20 per cent of the Germany profit made by the Shell subsidiary Rhenania-Oss ag. According to the historian Oswald Dutch, Deterding and Yahudi Samuel (Royal Dutch Shell) gave Hitler 30 million pounds in 1931. Even the falsifier of history William L. Shirer claimed that Hitler had been freed of his debts in 1929 (\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\"). Suddenly, he had plenty of money, a car with a chauffeur, a villa in Ober-Salzburg, and a luxur y apartment in the Printzregent- strasse in Munich. According to Shirer, it has never been established how much money the German bankers and industrial magnates gave to the National Socialist Party prior to January 1933. The figures are known, however, just as the financ ial contributions from the Ameri- can freemasons are known. But th e information is extremely un- pleasant for these obscure figures. Soon after the agreement between Hitler and the international bankers, the American press mogul William Randolph Hearst (1863- 1951) began to show great interest in the Nazi Party and its leader Adolf Hitler. Even The New York Times covered Hitler's speeches. The Harvard University Magazine published a lengthy survey of nazism. 367"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The British press magnate Harold Sidney Rothermere (1868-1940) added his voice to the Nazi propagandists. According to information acquired by Stalin after the end of the war, 40 000 Jewish-owned companie s kept financing the strengthe- ning the German war machine even after 1938. Advertising for Hitler John D. Rockefeller Jr was particular ly interested in Hitler's anti- communist statements, which were quoted in the press. During the 1920s, Rockefeller had used the well-known advertising agency Ivy Lee & T. J. Ross of Ne w York to give the bolsheviks a positive image. They were to be regarded as confused idealists and charitable humanitarians. Lee claimed that the communists were \"all right\", and that no communist pr oblem existed. It was simply a question of a psychological misu nderstanding. A statement by Frank Vanderlip, comparing Lenin to George Washington, was eagerly pub- licised. The same agency also compiled the insidious propaganda pamphlet \"The USSR - an Enigma\". The mass murderer Stalin was in a familiar manner nicknamed \"Uncle Joe\". In May 1927, Ivy Lee travelled to the Soviet Union summoned by Stalin and Radek to discuss communist propaganda in the West. At the same time, he took the opportunity to refine the manipulative methods of the Soviet ideologists. In 1939, Joseph Stalin was elected Man of the Year by Time Magazine (after the extensive extermin ations of 1937-38). The same honour was granted to Mikhail Gorb achov in 1987, after his promise to exterminate the Afghan people. After Hitler's assumption of power in January 1933, the advertising agency Ivy Lee & Ross was again called in to pacify the American public. Ivy Lee was given the task of polishing the propaganda methods of Hitler and Goebbels. Their services were paid for by American IG Farben, headed by the Warburg family.

For reasons of propaganda, Adolf Hitler was chosen Man of the Year by Time Magazine in December 1938, for \"keeping the world peace\". As early as 1936, the former Brit ish Prime Minister and masonic Grand Master David Lloyd George (actually David Levi-Lowit), on returning from Germany, had called ou t: \"Heil Hitler!\" In his opinion, Hitler was a great man, and the Ge rmans were the happiest of people. On 4 October 1938, Winston Churchill said the same. Churchill's mother Jennie was an American Jewess, whose maiden name was Jerome. Jennie's mother Clara Hall was one quarter Iroquois ( Jerusa- lem Post, 18 January 1993). Winston's father Randolph died as a result of syphilis at the age of 47. In 1956, Churchill told President Eisenhower: \"I am, of course, a Zionist, and have been ever since the Balfour Declaration.\" (Herbert Mitgang, \"The Official Churchill in One Volume\", The New York Times, 6 November 1991) 369"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The Bonnier Popular Encyclopaedia (\"Konversationslexikon\", Stockholm, 1926, Vol. 8, p. 634) has the following to say about national socialism: \"A movement ai med at society's intervention for the benefit of the poorer classes, and the extension of state control of the social economy, strongly emphas izing national solidarity between classes. N. is hereby in sharp contrast to international socialism based on class struggle. N. is primarily represented in Germany, where Hitler in 1920 f ounded a National Socialist Party, wh ich co-operates with the right wing. The Nationalsozialer Verein, which was active in 1896-1909, is regarded as its predecessor.\" The same encyclopaedia called Hitler a social democratic worker, who distinguished himself in the World War (Vol. 5, p. 779). The Nationalsozialer Verein origina lly represented Christian socialism. \"Sidney Warburg\", together with the representatives of James Warburg and several executives of Am erican oil companies, went to Berlin, where at the Hotel Adlon, they met with Hitler, Gregor Strasser, Hermann Goring, \"von He ydt\" (Thyssen), and a German lawyer. The Americans expressed thei r wish that Germany no longer should be obliged to pay war damages to France. Germany had already paid close to 10 billion dollars in damages to the United States alone. In October 1931, Hitler sent a lett er to the international masonic bankers, which led to a new meetin g at the Guaranty Trust Company. Some of the financiers (Montagu Norman, Royal Dutch Shell, and Glean) did not consider Hitler able to act. On the other hand, Rockefeller, J. H. Carter and McBean believed their investment in Hitler to be wise. All agreed on a continued support for Hitler. \"Sidney Warburg\" once more went to Germany, where he met the banker von Heydt (Thyssen), who explained to him that the SS troops were in need of good quality machine guns, revolvers and rifles. Warburg again met Hitler, who told him of his plans to seize power. He had two options - a revolution or a coup d'etat, which would take three months at a cost of 500 million marks. He also had 370"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"another plan, which involved lega l assumption of power. This was expected to take three years and cost some 200 million marks. Hitler suggested that the bankers themsel ves decide, which plan to use. In the opinion of the New York bankers, these amounts were far too large, however. A week later, they sent Hitler a mere 15 million dollars, demanding aggressive initiatives on the neighbouring countries. Hitler agreed to use the 15 mi llion dollars for his election propaganda. The money was transfer red to three banks: Mendelsohn & Co. in Amsterdam, Rotterdamsch e Bank in Rotterdam and Banca Italiana in Rome. Each bank received 5 million dollars. In total, Hitler received at least 32 million dollars from the American financiers (Morgan, Lamont, Rockefeller, Kuhn, Loeb & Company, General Electric Company, National City Bank and others) between 1929 and 1932 (Antony Sutton, op. cit., p. 134). Further contributions came from other American, British and German sources. Attempts to Investigat e Hitler's Secret Income After this, the German socialist Minist er of the Interior Carl Severing, discovered that Adolf Hitler's nation al socialists were receiving vast sums of money from abroad. He immediately informed the Chan- cellor, Heinrich Bruning, who much later gave orders to stop Hitler's speech to the Americans on 11 December 1931. Carl Severing ordered his assistant Dr Abegg, to find out every- thing he could concerning Hitle r and those providing him with money, intending to take Hitler to court. Hitler in addition lacked German citizenship. The governme nt arranged a meeting, where according to secret minutes, Major General Kurt von Schleicher said that the amounts received by Hitle r from within the country were much lower than claimed. Schlei cher became chancellor on 2 Decem- ber 1932. The party was in need of 80-100 million marks. This infor- mation came from the SA leader Ernst Rohm, who later became 371"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"infamous as a pederast. The SA received money from the secret Reichswehr fund, but the amount was very modest. The election cam- paign had already started, and the authorities did not have enough time to investigate the secret sources of Hitler's finances. It was commonly known, however, that Hitler had access to enormous amounts to cover his propaganda costs. As early as 20 December 1922, The New York Times stated that the automobile manufacturer Henry Ford financed Adolf Hitler's national socialist, anti-Semitic movement in Munich. The Berliner Tageblatt published a protest against Ford's involvement in German politics. Hitler later thanked Ford in a letter for his generous contributions to the Nazis. Henry Ford was also a freemason (Palestine Lodge No. 357, Detroit, Michigan, 1894). Hitler's Goal After five years of research, the Swiss historian Wolfgang Hanel was able to show that information re ceived from the former gauleiter Hermann Rauschning, concerning Hitl er's secret intentions, was made up. He had not in fact met Hitler \"over a hundred times\", but only four times and never alone. The q uotes that Rauschning claimed were Hitler's actually came from different sources, among them Ernst Junger and Friedrich Nietzsche. Th e story of how Hitler was visited by demons at night was taken from a short story by Guy de Mau- passant. The purpose of Rauschning 's widely distributed books \"Hitler Speaks\" (London, 1939) and \"The Voice of Destruction\" (London, 1940), was to inflame public opinion in many countries, above all in the United States, to war against Germany. The brain behind this project was the Hungarian-Jewish journalist Emery Reves, who ran an influential anti-German propaganda bureau in Paris in the 1930s. Reves later wrote a book, \"The Anatomy of Peace\", containing the usual Illuminati propaganda that nations should be broken up and a world government established. 372"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Wolfgang Hanel's sensational findings were published in 1983 in the revisionist historical magazine Journal of Historical Review. Two years later, two influential German periodicals. Die Zeit and Der Spiegel, admitted that Hanel was right. In a lengthy article, Der Spiegel wrote that Rauschning's book \"Hitler Speaks\" is a falsi- fication, a distortion from the first page to the last... \"Hanel not only proves that it is a fake, he goe s on to show how this impressive substitute was quickly concocted and which ingredients were mixed together.\" ( Der Spiegel, 7 September 1985). We have access to several original sources that reveal the kind of socialist society the Nazis actually intended to build. Joseph Goebbels stressed in his book \"Bolshevism in Theory and Practice\" (Berlin, 1936) that \"our str uggle against bolshevism is not a struggle against, but on the contrary a struggle for socialism, a struggle inspired by the deep conviction that true socialism can only be realized if the most vulgar and most compromising offspring of socialism... is first eliminated\". He did not intend to defend the antisocialist and capitalist inte- rests, but the Nazis were fo rced to do this regardless. Jewish high-ranking freemason Max Wa rburg was behind Hitler's poli- cies. 373"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"As early as 1926, Joseph Goebbels dreamed of an alliance between Nazis and communists for the purpose of solving social problems. Many SA members were former communists who were discontented with the current unemployment. In lengthy articles in National- sozialistische Briefe and Volkischer Beobachter, Goebbels had defen- ded Soviet Russia, calling Lenin a liberator of the nation. In his opinion, the leading bolshevik Jews in Western Europe were practi- sing economic exploitation. In 1928, he made a speech (via Zentral Sprechabend) to the Munich groups, where according to a report published in the Nazi press, he said: \"We are blamed for using Marxist methods in Berlin. Of course we fought using Marxist meth ods. These methods are simply the best, and the only correct ones, if we wish to win over the masses. We just need to improve our practice a little. We are not only addressing certain classes, but the entire German people.\" (\"Adolf Hitler\", by the Jewish journalist Konrad Heiden, Zurich, 1936) In this way, the German people were lured into accepting Illu- minati ideas in a new guise. The Ma rxist (that is Illuminati) methods that so well suited the masonic communists as the masonic Nazis, can never be adequate for fully develo ped people. Goebbels was reported to say openly: \"Lenin is my idol!\" (Der Spiegel, No. 46, 1986). Goebbels was impressed with Sergei Eisenstein's propaganda film \"The Battleship Potyomkin\". He emphasized: \"A person who has no fixed view of the world, could become a bolshevik through this film.\" Ernst Niekisch even founded what he called national bolshevism. In November 1932, the Nazis led by Goebbels openly co-operated with the communists in organizing the transport workers' strike in Berlin. This was disapproved of by the German capitalists (Kay Glans, \"Nazism and Big Business in New Light\" / \"Nazismen och stor- kapitalet i nytt ljus\", Svenska Dagbladet, 2 July 1987). Hitler also condemned this action. The Nazis wished to build a \"peopl e's state founded on socialism\" (from a leaflet distributed during the 1932 election campaign). In this Volksgemeinschaft (popular alliance) the proletariat and the 374"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"middle class were to merge. The Sw edish socialists also wished to build a welfare state that was originally founded on principles of racial purity. The freemason social ist leader Hjalma r Branting foun- ded the Institute for Racial Studies in 1922. The German national socialists also wished to introduce an interest free economy. Usury was to be punished by death. The people of Nazi Germany were organized as collective beings. The East German communists used the same system after the Second World War. Hitler learned from Lenin. This is the reason why the SS began to combine state control of the economy with the system of concentration camps. There were commissars in Germany as well as in the Soviet Union and in France during \"the Great Revolution\" 1789- 1793. Hitler's socialism was of the same character as that of Lenin. Goebbels stressed that a socialist ha d to give up his individualism for the collective good. Hitler also learned from Stalin. In order to strengthen the power of the party and the state's control of the economy, four-year plans were introduced (Stalin had used five-year plans since 1929). These plans were similar to Roosevelt's New Deal. In the Third Reich, the control of the economy was so strict that one can speak of another kind of planned economy after 1936. The term 'The Third Reich' expresse d the Nazis' belief that two eras would be replaced by a final third and eternal one, where the right- left dichotomy would be replaced by a third alternative, a national and social option. The term was a dopted by German writer Arthur Moeller van den Bruck in his book \"The Third Reich\" (\"Das dritte Reich\", 1923). During the war. Hitler disclaimed the term, and even prohibited its use. Hitler skilfully used the difficult economic situation in Germany. The country was suffering under hu ge damages in accordance with the Versailles Peace Treaty. Each year Germany had to pay 132 million gold marks, which amounted to 25 per cent of the export value. In fact, 20 per cent was regard ed as the absolute limit to avoid bankruptcy. Hitler vowed to an nul the Versailles Peace Treaty. 375"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The German position deteriorated further since France and Belgium showed no patience in claiming their part of the war damages. On this account they occupied the Ruhr area, intending to use force to get as much as they could. Wall Street (Douglas Dillon, Harris, Speyer, Kuhn, Loeb and others) subsequently granted Germany a loan of 800 million dollars. The money was used to build up the giant corporations IG Farben (Internati onale Gesellschaft Farbenindustrie), which was controlled by Rothschild and Warburg, and Vereinigte Stahlwerke. Louis Rothschild was a prominent ma n in Chicago in the 1890s. He belonged to the Grand Lodge of the Scottish Masonic Rite, and had reached the 32 nd degree. Lord Lionel Wa lter Rothschild became a freemason while studying at Oxford. He was recruited by Lord Alfred Milner, the leader of the Round Table. Paul Warburg was married to Nina Loeb, daughter of the banker Salomon Loeb. Kuhn, Loeb & Co., of the most influential finance company in the United States in the early 1900s. Paul's brother Felix Warburg was married to Frieda Schiff, whose father was the notorious Jacob Schiff. Schiff, a leading Zionist, was the principal owner of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. He had helped finance Lev Trotsky when the bolsheviks seized power. Prior to that, he had helped Alexander Kerensky (Aron Kiirbis) to powe r. Jacob Schiff had further ordered Lenin to execute the tsar family, as demonstrated by the telegram he sent to Lenin. Controlling a government receiving loans from foreign private banks is very easy. According to Antony Sutton, several Jewish finance companies - Dillon, Read & Co., Harris, Forbes & Co. and National City Company - were the prime movers behind the establish- ment of IG Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\", Sudbury, 1976, p. 163). Together these companies produced 95 per cent of the explosives used by the Nazis duri ng the Second World War. IG Farben played an important role in financing the Nazis, even though Hitler called the company \"a n international Jewish organi- 376"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"zation\". Max Warburg, one of the ma in stockholders, instructed other leading Jews not to boycott it, or protest against Hitler's persecuting the Jews, according to the historian Anton Chaitkin. The Warburg family had after all contributed greatly to the creation of the American central bank, the Federal Reserve System, in 1913. IG Farben grew into the world's leading chemical industry, manufacturing everything from arms to medicines. As early as 1928 the company decided to support Adolf Hitler and his program. The management of the company c onsisted entirely of freemasons. IG Farben supplied the chlorine gas during the First World War. This company had developed plans during the Second World War to fluoridate people of the occupied countries, because it had been found that fluoridation caused slight damage to a specific part of the brain. This damage had a very particular effect. It made it more difficult for the person affected to defend his freedom. He became more docile towards authority. IG Farben officially began support ing Hitler in 1931. In the autumn of 1932, at least 400 000 marks was pa id to the Nazis on the order of IG Farben president Carl Bosch (Joseph Borkin, \"Hitler and IG Farben\", 1978). IG Farben also gave financial support to Himmler's SS, as did the large American comp anies ITT and General Motors. On 4 February 1999, Deutsche Bank was forced to op en its archives from the Nazi era. Deutsche Bank admitted to having financed the concentration camp Auschwitz and th e Nazi war effort on order from IG Farben. The Jewish-owned IG Farben gave 70 million Reichsmarks in total to the Nazis. Without the aid of IG Farben, the Nazis would not have been able to act as effectively as th ey did. IG Farben was happy to use Auschwitz prisoners to test its medicines. In his book \"All Honourable Men\" (Boston, 1950), James Stewart Martin revealed that the IG Farb en plant near Cologne was spared from bombing during the Second World War. This is obvious since nearby buildings were totally demolished. Nor were the Ford plants 377"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"and United Rayon plants on the Rhine bombed. John Foster Dulles, as well as Allen Dulles (CFR) were involved in financing Hitler ( ibid, p. 51). All German companies ow ned by German-American cartels escaped bombing. The IG Farben headquarters were entirely unharmed after the American bombings of Hanover, even though large parts of the city were destroyed. The American pilots were instructed to spare the buildings, which was the backbone of the German war machine. After the war, IG Farben was turned into three companies: Hoechst, Bayer, and BASF (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 6 February 1999). The spreading of this information was diverted by giving priority to news of the German carnival season. The chance to prosecute the prominent freemasons behind Hitler has never been explored. But the documents are still there! Even the companies are still there, although under different names. Wh y have they never been called upon to pay damages? Secret Manipulations In 1928, Wall Street constructed the so-called Young Plan, which required that Germany pay its war damages in cash rather than in commercial goods. The freemason Owen D. Young was acting for the banker J. P. Morgan. When the plan was carri ed out, the result was a dramatic increase in the unemploym ent rate, which led to a worse- ning of the situation in Germany the years 1929-33. In 1932, six million Germans were out of work. Industrial production had dropped by 40 per cent since 1929. When interrogated in September 1945, the industrial magnate Fritz Thyssen said: \"People were desperate. Hitler promised to put an end to the unemployment situation. The go vernment was weak and the con- ditions for the people were worsening.\" \"Sidney Warburg\" once more met Hitler shortly before his assumption of power. Hitler told hi m of the party's success. The num- 378"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"ber of members of the National Socialist Party had trebled in a couple of years. Hitler wanted another 100 million marks, but Wall Street offered a maximum of 7 million dollars (about 24 million Reichsmarks in 1933). Hitler accepted this, and the money was transferred via foreign banks. This information was later made available through other sources as well (\"Financial World History\", Zurich, 1936). Hitler was further financed by Paul Warburg, board member of IG Farben (or GAF, as it became kno wn after Pearl Harbor), the management of which consisted enti rely of Rockefeller's men, and Max Warburg, director of IG Fa rben headquarters in Germany. Documents have been published beari ng Hitler's name next to that of Max Warburg. One of these documents mentions Hjalmar Schacht as chairman of the national bank. Schacht was a freemason, as is confirmed by masonic sources. He belonged to the Prussian Grand Lodge (Dieter A. Binder, \"Die di skrete Gesellschaft: Geschichte und Symbolik der Freimaurer\" / \"The Discrete Society: History and Sym- bolism of the Freemasons\", Graz, 1988, pp. 77, 90). In the opinion of Antony Sutton, Hitler had never been able to attain power without contributions from the largest chemical cor- poration in the world. The legal manager of IG Farben was August von Knieriem, the paternal uncle of Olof Palme, the future Swedish prime minister. Between 1932 and 1939 General Motors invested close to 30 million dollars in IG Farben. General Motors also supported Hitler's political movement. In the early 1940s, IG Farben co-operated with 53 American companies. The industrialist William R. Davies was appointed official suppli er to the German Navy. The major economic enterprise late r undertaken by IG Farben was the Auschwitz concentration camp. The investment amounted to 300 million dollars in today's money. At the Nuremberg trials, only three German executives (all non-freemas ons) were convicted of slavery, conspiring against humanity and ot her crimes. The American direc- tors were never mentioned. The Ge rman directors of AEG were like- wise prosecuted, while the American ones were not. 379"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"At the Nuremberg trials everything possible was done to avoid disclosing the activities of those Americans that had financed Hitler. German capitalists who had joined in the activities of the American companies were also able to escape unchallenged. Only two German financiers were sentenced: Fritz Thyssen and Emil Kirdorf (post- humously, as he died in 1937). The Soviet Union tried to reveal more names. The United States opposed th is, which led to the acquittal of the Director General of AEG, Buecher. He claimed that, apart from IG Farben, Siemens and AEG were the strongest German companies, and were led by convinced anti-Nazis. Antony Sutton was, however, able to publish a document proving that AEG transferred money to Hitler's account Nationale Treuhand (the Na tional Holding Company), which was used to finance his election campaign (Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\", Sudbury, 1976, p. 56). No action was taken against the illuminatus Paul Warburg, who financed Hitler, and was managing di rector of American IG Farben. It was not possible to charge him with crimes against humanity. The Americans were not charged, du e to pressure from Rockefeller. American factories in Germany (O pel and Ford) manufactured 90 per cent of the three-ton lorries used by the Wehrmacht. Of course Moscow kept quiet about th e role played by Wall Street, since the communists were dependen t on the same source of capital. It was never pointed out that the United States was the only country that made a profit from the Second World War. All other countries lost money, and ended up with enormous debts. Information available today shows how easily Hitler acquired American technology (Charles Higha m, \"Trading with the Enemy\", New York, 1984). The bankers were counting on German defeat in a potential large- scale war, and expected to be able to completely control Europe after the war had ended. In the parliamentary election held in April 1932 the national socia- lists increased their seats from 107 to 162. On 31 July, another parliamentary election was held that gave the Nazis 13 745 000 380"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"votes, 37 % of the total, granting them 230 seats in the Reichstag. The Nazi Party was now the largest and most powerful in Germany, thanks to a massive propaganda campaign. On 6 November the Nazis lost two million votes and 34 seats in the Reichstag. Two days later, Hitler requested a meeting with President Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler dema nded to be made chancellor. Once again he was turned down. Kurt vo n Schleicher became chancellor of Germany on 2 December 1932. In the small German free state Li ppe, local elections were sche- duled for 15 January. Hitler took this opportunity to make a big impression. The Nazis campaigned h eavily and received a small in- crease in votes over the previous election total. But they used their own widely circulated newspapers to exaggerate the significance of the vote and to once again lay claim that the Nazis were the wave of the future. It worked well and even impressed President Hindenburg. On Sunday, 22 January 1933, a secret meeting was held at the home of Joachim von Ribbentrop. It was attended by von Papen, Hindenburg's son Oskar, along with Hitler and Goring. Hitler grabbed Oskar and brought him into a private room and worked on him for an hour to convince him that the Nazis had to be taken into the government on his terms. Oskar emerged from the meeting convinced it was inevitable. Franz von Papen th en pledged his loyalty to Hitler. On 28 January, Schleicher went to Hindenburg and asked him once again to dissolve the Reichstag. Hindenburg said no. Schleicher resigned. On the 29th, a false rumour circulated that Schleicher was about to arrest Hindenburg and stage a military takeover of the government. When Hindenburg heard of this, it ended his hesitation. The freemason Paul von Hindenbur g decided to appoint another freemason, Adolf Hitler as the next chancellor of Germany. Around noon on 30 January 1933, a ne w chapter in German history began when a teary-eyed Adolf Hitler emerged from the presidential palace as chancellor of Germany. Surr ounded by admirers, he got into his car and was driven down the street lined with cheering citizens. Hitler exclaimed: \"We've done it! We've done it!\" 381"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The magician Franz Bardon (alia s Frabato, 1909-1958) held a high post in the government (Franz Bardon, \"Frabato\", Wuppertal, 1979). According to Bardon, Hitler belonged to Der Freimaurerischer Orden der Goldene Centurie in Dresden , commonly known as Lodge 99. All the 99 lodges of this order had 99 members. Each lodge worship a horrible demon. The demon helps members gain money and power. The members of the 99 Lodges are also industrialists and bankers. That Hitler really was a high-ranking freemason, is confirmed by Norman MacKenzie in his book \"Secret Societies\" (New York, 1967). It has also been confirmed from Moscow, where all documents referring to the subject are kept. In 1933, the freemason Rudolf von Sebottendorf published a book called \"The Magicians\". He no longer wished to remain behind the scenes in the National Socialist Party. The book was immediately banned and orders for its destruction were issued. Only a few copies were salvaged, one of which is s till in Moscow. According to this book, Hitler achieved the rank of gr and master of the Germanenorder in 1932. On film and on photographs, Hitler has been shown displaying the essential sign: arms crossed on the chest. This is the sign of the grand master, the symbol of power (Yuri Vorobyov, \"The Road to Apocalypse: A Step of the Serpent\" (Moscow, 1999, p. 94). A model for this secret masonic sign is the image of Osiris, shown holding his arms crossed on his chest, his ha nds holding the serpent staff and the scourge. These attributes symbolized order and punishment. On 30 January 1933, Wall Street got its candidate appointed leader of Germany. On 27 February 1933, there was a fire in the Reichstag building. After the war, the falsifying historians laid the blame for this on the Nazis. It has now been established that the fire was not started by the Nazis under Goring's leadership. It was actually started by the communist Marinus van der Lubbe alone. In 1962, the British historian Fritz Tobias published a de tailed investigation showing that the evidence previously presented as proof of Nazi involvement was false. Examination of police records revealed that van der Lubbe was 382"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"very well aware of the political implications of his actions. Edward Calic, the secretary of the invest igating corn-missi on, had produced a number of forged documents, which we re used as the basis for a false report. The Nazis took the oppo rtunity to ban all communist organizations. After the election in November 1932, the party coffers were empty, but suddenly money was coming in again. Following the new elec- tions on 5 March 1933, Hitler and th e German nationalists received a majority of 16 votes in the parlia ment, which enabled them to carry out their plans. From 23 March, Hitler became Germany's dictator. He no longer needed to consult the parliament. His power was un- limited. The national socia list revolution could begin. During 1933 the Nazis banned all anti-Jewish songs, including the brown shirts' song \"When Jewish blood runs off the knife\". In October 1933, Hitler dissolved the parliament. Hitler wished to clear the farmer s' debts of 12 billion marks and lower the interest rate to two per cent. The interest rates amounted to fourteen per cent of the total income of the farmers, and added to that was approximately the same am ount in taxes and social security. Hitler's aim was to completely abo lish interest on the farmers' loans and exempt them from taxes altogether. But prominent freemasons, headed by Warburg, prohibited Hitler from abolishing taxes and inte- rest. Hitler managed, however, to lower the interest rate to six per cent. He later wished to introduce a system that would limit the ability to oppress so ciety by means of specu lating in capital, but those that had helped him to power disapproved. Abraham Lincoln was after all murdered for tryi ng to abolish interest rates. Hitler created work for the six million unemployed. From February 1933 until spring 1937 the number of unemployed went down from six million to less th an one million. Eventua lly, there was no un- employment. The Nazis introduced the \"workbook\" concept, which originally came from the Soviet Union. No German worker could be employed without his workbook. The same system was later used in Sweden and many other countries up until the 1960s. 383"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The Gross National Product doubled from 1932 to 1937. Motorways were built through the landscape in ways least harmful to nature, even though this increa sed the cost.

The successful economy was directed by the director of the national bank, Hjalmar Schacht who according to the SS-official Hans Werner Woltersdorf was a freemason. IG Farben, along with other major corporations, needed improving, and their needs were met. In 1933, the US government consider ed the time ripe to recognize the Soviet Union. Many American companies (Electric Boat Company, Ford Company, Seversky Air-Craft Corporation, General Electric and others) helped build the Soviet fals e front, and many financiers, such as Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Morgan, Rock efeller, the Warburgs, Douglas Dillon (actually Lapowitz), Cyrus Eaton, and David Kendall, also invested enormous amounts in communism (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981). On 2 August 1934, the German president Paul von Hindenburg died. Hitler never disclosed that Hindenburg's political legacy in- cluded a wish to rein troduce the monarchy. This was out of the question for Hitler and the freem asons that had installed him. Any foreigner, no matter how an ti-Nazi, could visit Germany and see and observe anything he wished to see, with the exception of the concentration camps and the military sites (as is the case in all countries). No anti-communist was permitted to visit the Soviet Union, and no foreigner was able to see much of Soviet every-day life. Anyone, except a few thousand blacklisted German citizens, was able to travel abroad. This was not the case with Soviet citizens. Only a chosen few were granted permission to travel abroad. The high level of prosperity was made possible because in 1934, Germany abandoned the internati onal gold standard, and began issuing money in accordance with its own needs, with a currency based on the value of the work produced. 384"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"During the years 1923-1929, the American economy had a high growth rate. This trend had to be checked, according to Gary Allen and Antony Sutton. On 24 October 1929, a day that became notorious as Black Tuesday, a coll apse on the stock market was arranged on Wall Street. As a consequence, th ere were 13.2 million unemployed in the United States in 1932, and the production index fell from 120 to 57 (100 having been set for the year 1930). This terrible economic crisis, which was arranged by the banks, had repercussions worldwide. The aim of the criminal power groups is control of the world economy. Today, this is achieved through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, whose intentions are criminal, regardless of the official, misleading propa- ganda. The Black Tuesday in October 1929 was a contributing factor to the election of Franklin Delano Roosev elt, who promised all kinds of reforms. Roosevelt had co-operated with Owen D. Young, whose so- called Young Plan brought Hitler to power in Germany. The leading bankers had reduced the amount of money in circulation, and the trade volume, by raising the interest rate (the minimum-lending rate), but they paid very little attention to the financial needs of the industry. The economic squeeze caused a depression, which in 1934 reached the worst level in 100 years in the Western world. Thanks to Hjalmar Schacht's eco nomic policies, however, the Ger- man economy once again began to approach prosperity. Eventually this even led to a labour shortage. The infant mortality rate was lower than that of Britain. The social security system was developed most efficiently. Hitler ordered the use of natural energy resources such as wind and water. The fuel of the future was hydrogen. The Hitlerjugend pursued a cult of nature. In Germany in the 1930s, large numbers of farmers were producing methane from manure, using the gas to fuel tractors and combine harvesters, since the cost of ordinary fuel had risen too high (Bjorn Gillberg and Arthur R. Tamplin, \"Murder by Government Consent: 385"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"How Environmental Policy Shortens Our Lives\" / \"Mord med statligt tillstand. Hur miljopolitiken forkortar vara liv\", Helsingborg, 1988, p. 120). National socialism turned out to be superior to the democratic system. Hitler was able to solve the social and economic crises against which the democratic countr ies were struggling. People were happy with the system of a market economy with centralized leader- ship, although human rights were not very well respected by the authorities. Hitler's policies concerning gold, credit and interest was a severe blow to the European economic system. The leaders of the London stock exchange, who all happened to be freemasons, regarded this state of affairs as a threat to thei r efforts to control national as well as international trade. They demanded that Germany return to the slavery under interest rates, and threatening to destroy the country through war unless the demand was met. Secret negotiations were held between London and Berlin fo r several years. In August 1933, Samuel Untermeyer, president of the Zionist World Organization, threatened to destroy Germany, should it continue its new economic policies. This was the man who had previously directed the plunder of the Kreuger financial empire, which had saved several countries by providing loans at low rates. Untermeyer considered the Jews to be the aristocrats of the world. The masonic government of Poland began an extensive persecution of Germans living there. Betwee n March and Sept ember 1939, the Polish authorities interned more than 50 000 Germans, many of whom died in the concentration camps. The Polish marshal Edward Rudz-Smigly announced in the summer of 1939: \"Poland wants a war against Germany.\" Thousands of Germans were massacr ed by the Poles following agi- tation by the government. Of these, 12 857 could later be identified (\"Die Polnischen Greueltaten an den Volksdeutschen in Polen\", \"Polish Atrocities against Ethnic Ge rmans in Poland\", Berlin, 1940). This was confirmed by the East Ge rman historian Theodor Bierschenk 386"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"in 1954, on the basis of Polish do cuments. According to the social democratic writer Otto Heike of L odz, there were at least 15 000 victims. Germany was the only countr y to protest, the documents to prove this still remain. The freemasons understood that Ge rmany would not accept this indefinitely, but would have to act. Hitler intended eventually to act in order to put a stop to the terror and the killings. One may well ask why the German government waited so long. The answer is simple. Poland was planning a lightning attack by 700 000 troops on Berlin. Warsaw was only waiting for a go-ahead sign from London. The Polish military equipment was basically modern, but according to myth, Poland had only cavalry to muster. Germany was unable to wait any longer. Hitler used Stalin as an ally through the non-aggression pact of 23 August 1939. On 1 September 1939, Hitler attacked, in spite of the fact th at Germany lacked a war economy at this time, as even the historian Paul Johnson admits (\"Modern Times\", New York, 1983). 387"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" In accordance with the secret trea ty with the Nazis, the Soviet Union took the opportunity on 17 September to occupy the Byelo- russian and Ukrainian parts of Poland. In the 21 months of Soviet rule prior to the German attack on 22 June 1941, up to 750 000 people belonging to these ethnic mi norities were killed. 1 250 000 of the former Polish citizens (among them non-communist Jews), were deported to Siberia and Central Asia in February 1940. Young children, old and sick people died of the cold, which reached some- times minus 30-40 degrees (Celsius). The railways to the east were lined with frozen corpses. A new wave of deportations killed its victims by thirst. Almost half died in the sealed railway cars during transport. Of the survivors, 120 000 were permitted to leave the Soviet Union in 1942 in connect ion with the establishment of the Polish army under General Wladysla w Anders. In June 1941, up to 100 000 Poles were shot by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police (Jan T. Gross, \"Revolution from Abroad: The Soviet Conquest of Poland's Wes- 388"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"tern Ukraine and Western Byelorussia\", Princeton University Press, 1988). In comparison with this, the Nazis seem like minor hooligans. Dr Burton Klein published a book, \"Germany's Economic Prepa- ration for War\" (Cambridge, 1959), where he rejected the common accusation that Germany had a military economy entirely directed towards warfare: \"France and England each spent as much or more on armaments, and together their sp ending on arms was much higher.\" The historian A. J. P. Taylor in 19 61 also pointed out British respon- sibility for the development. In his final report to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, General George C. Marshall noted that Hitler was in no way prepared for a long war, least of all a war to conq uer the world. In fact, he was not even prepared for a war against England and France, let alone against the Soviet Union. This was confirmed by a leading expert on military economic preparedness, Colonel A. G. Texley, in an article in Quarter- master Review, June 1948. The prominent American historian, Professor David Leslie Hoggan, shows in his work \"The Forced War: The Origins and Instigators of the Second World War\" (\"Der erzwungene Krieg: Die Ursachen und Ur- heber des zweiten Weltkrieges\", San Francisco 1961) that Hitler never wished a war in 1939, and that hi s claims on Poland were more modest than many of American a nd British publications have shown. Hitler had requested a motorway through the Polish Corridor and the return of the German city of Da nzig. As of March 1939, Poland refused to negotiate. The British Ambassador Kennar d (a freemason) put pressure on the Poles not to negotiate in August 1939. First published in Germany in 19 61, Hoggan's book was based on his dissertation. He described the British and Poles as the aggressors and Germany as the victim. Hoggan' s book also asserted that the German Jewish policies were benign, or at least more lenient than those of Poland. Professor Hoggan states: \"Ultimate responsibility for the outbreak of the German-Polish war lay with Poland and England, and the responsi- bility for extending the war to all of Europe lies mainly with England.\" 389"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Hoggan gained his Ph. D. in history from Harvard University in 1948, and held several important academic-teaching positions. Rather than helping Germany, Britain declared war at 11 a. m. on 3 September. France was hesitant in the beginning but six hours later did the same. These were the nations that had promised Poland their \"help\", in case Germany dared defend the ethnic Germans in Poland. Poland carried on its terror agains t everything German even after the war. After 1 September 1939, neither England nor France were inte- rested in Poland. For several da ys they refused to see the Polish military attache, who was asking for military assistance. The allies had no time for Poland. It was not until 9 September that British military officers agreed to meet a Polish delegation in London. Even then, the head of the British General Staff, William Edmu nd Ironside, was unable to pro- mise Poland any arms deliveries. There were simply no plans to help Poland. It was claimed that Britain had already bombed Germany, and that 44 aircraft had arrived in Romania for the Poles. This was a downright lie from an \"ally\" (Mikhail Meltiukhov, \"Stalin's Lost Opportunity\", Moscow, 2000, p. 102). All England had done was to bomb the German towns of Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven on 5 September. The Jewish World Council declared war on Germany on 5 September 1939. The Nazis regarded this action as legal grounds for in- carcerating all apparently hostile Je ws. As early as June 1934 the Jew Emil Ludvig had stated: \"Hitler does not want war, but he will be forced into it.\" (Les Annales) When Hitler attacked Poland on 1 September, Germany had no more than 2980 tanks altogether. Ac cording to the historian David Irving, Hitler was an excellent strategist, far better than his generals (\"Hitler's War\", London, 1977). It was he who planned the blitzkrieg operation against France, which began on 10 May 1940. After two weeks of fighting in Poland, the German tanks were running short of fuel, and the bombers were out of bombs.

The military historian Basil Henry Liddell Hart refers to the ex- change of telegrams that took plac e between the Brit ish and German foreign ministries in 1939-1940. Li eutenant-Colonel J. Creagh Scott spoke of the same exchange on 11 August 1947 at Chelsea Town Hall in London (Tomorrow on 6 November 1947). Creagh Scott related: \"During the entir e period of the telegram war, in 1939-1940, lengthy negotiations took place between the German and British foreign ministries, in which t he British suggested to cancel the war if Germany would reinstate the gold standard and reintroduce interest rates.\" J. Creagh Scott unveils the insidious masonic forces ruling from behind the scenes (\"Hidden Governme nt\", London, 1954). World- wide, people were unable to understand why no fighting took place on the Western front in 1939-1940. The public knew nothing of the negotiations. The Jewish banker Montagu Norman , a spokesman fo r the English financiers, had no interest in th e fate of Poland or other small nations, if Germany would only return to the gold standard. Ger- many's reply was negative. Montagu No rman was at this time head of the Bank of England, which was controlled by the Rothschilds. Winston Churchill assured Norman that the gold standard would be reinstated in Germany. This was the reason behind the destruction of Germany and the killing of 55 m illion people in the Second World War. Montagu Norman and Hjalmar Schacht secretly met in October 1935 in Badenweiler, Schwarzwald, to arrange loans for Hitler. Nor- man was in effect an errand boy for the Rothschilds (Eustace Mullins, \"The World Order: Our Secret Rulers\", Staunton, 1992). The Second World War was started for the financial elite to be able to control the economy, to divide the world in communists and capitalists, and to facilitate the eventual introduction of a world government. 391"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The Soviet Union agreed to the plans. Christian Rakovsky, the Soviet emissary to Paris and the li aison between the Soviet elite and high finance, when questioned by the GPU officer Gabriel Kuzmin in Moscow on 26 January 1938, stressed that he had access to infor- mation not because he was a freem ason, but as a spokesman for the financiers. In 1919, Lenin had put him in charge of the Soviet Ukraine govem-ment. He successfully kept th e area for the bo lsheviks during the Civil War. Stalin appointed him Soviet ambassador to Paris in 1925. Rakovsky belonged to the power ful Trotskyite faction that took their orders from the Rothschilds. Many members of this group were shot in Stalin's 1937 Communist Party purge. According to Rakovsky, \"Hitler, th is uneducated and elementary man, has restored thanks to his natural intuition and even against the technical opinion of Schacht, an economic system of a very dangerous kind\". The communists ha d merely talked of abolishing economic exploitation, while Hitler had actually done so. Rakovsky accused Hitler of having eliminated \"international and private finance\". In his opinion \"something so completely counter-revolutio- nary that, as you already see, he has by means of magic, as it were, radically eliminated unemployment among more than seven million technicians and workers\". He emphasized: \"If Hitler reached this despite all the bourgeois eco- nomists who surround him, then he was quite capable, in the absence of the danger of war, of applying his system also to peace-time pro- duction... There is only one solution - war.\" Rakovsky suggested an attack from the east towards the west, that is a planned Soviet act of war agai nst Nazi Germany. This move would benefit the international financial elite and the masonic leadership. Hitler had after all let them do wn, and had to be abused and destroyed through a war on two fronts.

Money is power and the sole power.\" 392"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"All information concerning Rakovs ky is taken from Bruno Schu- bert's publication \"Free-Economy A ssociation\" (Huntington, 1972). The protocols of Rakovsky's interrogation was smuggled out of the Soviet Union after the Second World War by the NKVD physician Josef Landovsky, and published under the title \"Sinfonia en Rojo Mayor\" (\"Symphony in Red Major\") in Spain in 1950. The whole transcript was published in English in 1968 under title \"The Red Symphony: X- Ray of Revolution\". The 50-page transcript of his interrogation was not meant to become public. It confirms that the Rothschild's Illuminati planned to use communism to establish a world dictatorship of the super rich. The fact that Britain did not care about Poland is demonstrated by the fate of General Wladyslaw Sikorski. He had fled to London and become head of the Polish governme nt in exile. When the Germans discovered the Soviet mass acre of Polish officers in the Katyn forest in April 1940, Sikorski intended to publicly condemn this mass murder. The British hoped he would keep quiet, but since he did not, there was only one option - getting rid of Sikorski. On 4 July 1943, during a flight to General Anders' Po lish army in Alexandria, Egypt, the pilot parachuted over Gibraltar and the plane crashed. Sikorski was out of the way. After conquering Poland, von Ribbentrop again went to Moscow on 27 September 1939, where he met wi th Stalin. A pact was signed concerning mutual borders and th e friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union. On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union issued a common statement explaining that the two countries had \"solved\" the question of Poland's disintegration, urging England and France to make peace with Hitler. Britain and France were warned that unless they agreed to peace treaty, they would be held responsible for the war. Stalin, who was a cruel tyrant, nevertheless sometimes told the truth when it suited his purposes. In Pravda of 29 November 1939, he stated: \"It was not Germany that a ttacked France and Britain, it was 393"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"France and Britain that attacked Germany and they are responsible for the war.\" In November 1939, Comintern orga nized a peace movement aimed at a quick end to the \"unfair imperialist robber war\". On 9 October Izvestiya had reported that waging war to crush Hitlerism was political and criminal madness. In Moscow, Walter Ulbricht condemned the anti-Hitler attit ude of the Western powers. In the summer of 1940, Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy, and incapable of waging war. But London was expecting help from Wall Street. The American Contribution In 1938, in an interview for The New York Times, the freemason Henry Ford said: \"Somebody once said that sixty families have directed the destinies of the nation. It might well be said that if somebody would focus the spotlight on twenty-five persons who handle the nation's finances, the world's real war makers would be brought into bold relief.\" Hitler also received financial s upport to build up the war industry from Henry and Edsel Ford. The ma in financiers, however, were Standard Oil (Rockefeller), General Motors, General Electric, ITT, J. P. Morgan's bank and Bernard Baruch. Standard Oil is today called Exxon, among other things. All thes e enterprises and bankers also helped Franklin Delano Roosevelt to power in 1933. Precisely this same group of intern ational bankers and industria- lists also supported the bolshevik as sumption of power in Russia. In his book \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Antony Sutton refers to some very interesting documents from various archives belonging to the American govern ment. According to these docu- ments, the same financial elite armed both sides in the Korean and Vietnam wars, to be able to kill as many people as possible. The illuminatus J. P.

Congress, and in particular the members Dickstein and MacCormack (both freemasons), ensured that no information regarding this plot was leaked from the investigation (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and th e Rise of Hitler\", Sudbury, 1976, p. 175). President Roosevelt was also eager to conceal the details of this criminal venture. Only in the 1950s was a minor part made available to historians. The American Ambassador to Be rlin, William Dodd, wrote in his diary that the embassy received visits in 1933 from Wall Street bankers and industrialis ts, who all admired Adolf Hitler and were looking for new opportunities to do business with the Nazi regime. For instance, Henry Mann, representa tive of the National City Bank, and Winthrop W. Aldrich of the Chase Bank, met Hitler on 1 September 1933 to discuss this matter (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\", Sudbury 1976, p. 15 and p. 133.) Dodd wrote on 19 October 1936 from Berlin to President Roosevelt: \"Much as I believe in peace as our best policy, I cannot avoid the fears which Wilson emphasized more than once in conversations with me, August 15, 1915 and later: the breakdown of democracy in all Europe will be a disaster to the people.

The DuPonts have three allies in Germany that are aiding in the armament business. Their chief ally is the I. G.

I mention these facts because they complicat e things and add to war dangers.\" It is impossible to find all the facts relating to these affairs, because some documents were destro yed in 1945. But according to an investigation by the US War Department shortly after the Second World War, the Germans would have been unable to fight a war without IG Farben and other American efforts. It is significant that the gian t American corporation General Electric, which in the 1920s and 1 930s provided electric power to the Soviet Union, played an essentia l role, in establishing the Nazi regime. The German press had at the time no idea that General Electric technically had total mon opoly over the Soviet electric industry, which according to the GOELRO Plan, was built using American money and engineers and Russian slave labour. Hitler was aided also by AEG (Allg emeine Elektrizitats-Gesellschaft, the German General Electric Company) and OSRAM, each of which had five American board members from Wall Street. Henry Ford, who helped finance Hitler from the beginning, after 1933 built a modern automobile plant in the Soviet Union. The plant was situated near Gorky (today Nizhny Novgorod) and it began making trucks for the Red Army. The United States had only shortly before recognized the Soviet Union diplomatically. In 1932, the finance elite had withdrawn all support from the American President Herbert Hoover. He disclosed this fact, but was silenced by the press. The financial elite would rather support a powerful freemason and lawyer, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1933, after his election victory in the November of 1932, Roosevelt began to carry out his socialist program under the designation the New Deal, which involved control of the economy. The New Deal was hailed as the New World Order, Novus Ordo Seclorum. The official claim was that the economic crisis needed stabilizing. The market economy was remodelled. The trade un ions gained a large influence, which began dangerously to slow down the economy, since a number of gangs of organize d crime took control. 396"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"The government agencies created to deal with the crisis basically copied those institutions established at the US entry the First World War in 1917. Roosevelt also delibera tely revived the rhetoric of that time. The government declared wa r on the Great Depression. Nothing but the threat of war could make the freedom-loving Americans accept increasing taxes and a regula ting government. In spite of this, the New Deal was basically a failure during the 1930s. The economic recovery was weak, and in 1939 the country entered another recession. It was only the massive rearmament in connection with the Second World War that set the wh eels in motion again, as shown by the historian Michael Sherry in his book \"In the Shadow of War: The United States since the 1930 s\" (Yale University Press, 1995). The Supreme Court, however, reject ed Roosevelt's demand that the federal government should control the economy. The Supreme Court instead limited state and federal involvement in the economy. Roosevelt wished to expand the membership, so that he could appoint justices open to his philo sophy. Congress refused to expand the size of the Supreme Court. Pr esident Truman, on the other hand, began nationalizing the steel industry. The cunning President Roosevelt belonged to the Wall Street circle, which made enormous profits from their support of the national socialist regime in Germany. Roosevelt formally recognized the Soviet Union as early as 1933, in order to allow American business inte rests to take a greater part in building up the Soviet economy. He gave his permission to finance Stalin's five-year plans. The previ ous President Herbert Hoover called the New Deal programme fascist, that is a corporative form of socia- lism. Rockefeller as well as Morgan, who had helped Hitler to power, kept aiding the Soviet Union. According to The Washington Post (2 February 1918), Morgan had give n the bolsheviks 1 million dollars.

Hess, being Hitler's deputy, had flown to Scotland in May 1941 to try to arrange a solution to negotiations about the gold standard and thus an agreement on the conditions for peace. Hess had blindly believed in the ps ychic General Karl Haushofer's dream that the trip would be a success. But the dream was not realized and Hess was arrested. After his parachuting over Scotland on 10 May 1941, several astro- logers, whom he had protected, we re arrested. They were seen as accessories to Hess' misjudgement. In 1946, Hess was sentenced to li fe imprisonment in Nuremberg. While in Spandau prison in Berlin, he wrote his memoirs. When he had filled three books, they were removed and burned. He started again, and the same process was repeated. The victors did not want the truth disclosed. Hess died in Spandau prison at the age of 93, on 17 August 1987, under mysterious circumstances. He was far too weak to have taken his own life. Close Collaboration between Nazis and Zionists Moses Hess coined the term nati onal socialism, commonly shortened to nazism, which he intended to use for Jewish nationalism - and this as early as 1862. The connection between Zionism and German nazism thus already existed from the beginning and would later on be developed further, both ideologically and politically. Documents found by he German historian Klaus Polkehn, reveal an extensive co-operation between the l eading Nazis and Zionist leaders. This information was published by th e Israeli Professor Israel Shahak in the Israeli newspaper Zo Haderekh on 2 September 1981. The Nazis and the Zionists had a common interest to frighten European Jews to emigrate to Palestine. The leading Zionist organizations in this close co-operation were Lohamei Harut Is rael (later infamously known as the Stern Gang) and Irgun Zvai Leumi. Among the leaders were also 398"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin, who later both became Israeli prime ministers. Lenni Brenner divulged in 1984 in his book \"The Iron Wall\" that the Stem Gang in 1940 delivered a memorandum to a German diplomat in Beirut. It was suggested that the Jews in Poland should receive military training to fight against the British in Palestine. After the victory, a Jewish State - \"a Hebraium\" (Hebrew national home) - should be set up, which then should enter into a treaty with Nazi-Germany and be ruled accord ing to the same totalitarian principles. Many Jewish extremist politicians, for example the members of the Revisionist Party in Palestine, were dressed in brown shirts in the 1930s (Donald Day, \"Forward, Christian Soldier!\" / \"Framat, Kristi stridsman!\", Helsin ki, 1944, pp. 139-140). The Zionist terror organization Betar was organized like the SS. That is why today's Israel is using Nazi methods. Heinrich Himmler's emissary Le opold von Milden stein together with Zionist functionaries visited Palestine in 1933 and 1934. Thereafter articles were published in Goebbels' newspaper Der Angriff that in the most excitable words hailed the Jewish struggle to build new settlements in Palestine. The majority of the Jews who left or were forced to leave other European countries, preferred to move to Germany (Ingrid Weckert, \"Feuerzeichen: Die Reichskristallnacht\" / \"The Kristallnacht: A Beacon\", Tubingen, 1981). On 23 December 1935, an intervie w with the German Zionist leader Georg Kareski was published in Der Angriff. He was satisfied with the new Nuremberg laws that strongly prohibited all sexual contacts between Jews and Aryans. In words of gratitude he hailed these laws as a fulfilment of the wishes of Zionism. In connect ion with this, it became permissible to raise the Zi onist blue-and-white flag together with the swastika.

There were so many new settlers that many Arabs suspected Hitler of being Jewish and a crypto-Zionist. In 1934 alon e, 120 000 German Jews emigrated to Palestine. Until September 1940, 500 000 Jews from Germany and from occupied Poland had emigrated to Palestine. In 1950, it was claimed from official Je wish sources that the total amount of Jews in Palestine from various European countries only amounted to 80 000. As many as 420 000 of those present were listed as gassed in the camps. Even t hough they were alive and well in Is- rael, the Zionists considered them victims of the holocaust and de- manded retribution for them (Weckert, \"Feuerzeichen: Die Reichs- kristallnacht\" / \"The Kristallnacht: A Beacon\", Tubingen, 1981). At the end of February 1937, Feiw el Polkes, a representative of the Zionist Haganah movement, met the SS officials Herbert Hagen and Adolf Eichmann at Restaurant Traube in Berlin for amicable discussions of suitable ways to outwit the British authorities, who were considered too strict in their limitations of the immigration to Palestine. Polkes also wanted th e Germans to prevent Jews from moving to other countries. It was a well-known fact that the German Jews were not partial to Palestine, but would rather settle in other countries. In return, Polkes would supply the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the SS security service, with \"all po ssible secret information and at the same time further Germany's interests in the entire Near East\" (Andreas Bliss, \"Der Stopp der En dlosung\" / \"The End of the Final Solution\", Stuttgart, 1966). In October 1937, Adolf Eichmann went to Cairo, and paid a visit to Palestine on the way. The negotiations broke down, since most of the Jews were not willing to move to Palestine.

The Zionists have done everything in their power to suppress information of their co-operation w ith the Nazis in the years before the Second World War. The co-operation forced a Zionist provocation without precedence - the Kristallnacht (the night of the broken glass), which took place under the sign of Scorpio. The real target was the German people. Ingrid Weckert found archive inform ation other than the usual anti- Nazi propaganda, and in 1981 publishe d this information in her book \"Feuerzeichen: Die Reichskristallnacht\" (\"The Kristallnacht: A Bea- con\", Tubingen, 1981). The official explanation was that a seventeen year-old Polish Jew, Herschel Feibel Grynszpan, shot the secretary of the German Embassy in Paris, Ernst von Rath, in protest against the deportation of his family. Although Grynszpan lacked valid identification papers and money, he was able on the morning of 7 November 1938 to buy a gun for 250 francs and go to the embassy an hour later. In revenge, fanatic Nazis were supposed to have burnt and destroyed Jewish property. While investigating the Krista llnacht events, unknown persons appeared, claiming to be representatives of the top party leadership. On several occasions, the gauleiter (district leader) received anony- mous phone calls from men claiming to represent the party leaders. The party leadership had never given any orders for the destruction of Jewish property, however. These anonymous agents were the first to throw rocks against the windows of Jewish shops. They led the attack on Jewish residences. All th e rioting was led by a centrally placed group of well-trained agents. The provocateurs took advantage of the fact that on 8-9 November 1938, all decision making within the Nazi Party had been delegated 401"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"to men of lower rank and less experi ence, as the Nazi leaders were busy celebrating the anniversary of the Munich coup 1923. As the first reports of the disturbances came, the SA commander Viktor Lutze ordered that Jewish property must not be damaged. In case there were still anti-Jewish demonstrations, the SA would intervene to stop them. Following th is order from Lutze, SA members began to guard Jewish shops whose windows had been broken. The SS and the police were given similar directives to restore law and order. In spite of this, at least three of the 28 SA units refused to obey orders, and sent their men out to destroy synagogues and other Jewish property. In December 1937, several German newspapers reported that the murdering of Jews would be punishable by death. It was reported that Josef Reinhardt had been sentenced to death for killing a Jewish merchant Abraham and his gentile wife. It was pointed out that murder was murder regardless of the victim. 402"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"No more than 180 synagogues we re destroyed, not 1400 as was claimed by the propaganda. 7500 wi ndows were broken, not 100 000. In many cases, the assailers were fought by Jews and SA members together. Heinrich Himmler ordered Reinhard Heydrich to put a stop to all demonstrations and to protect the Jews from the demonstrators. The telegrams giving the orde rs are still available in the archives. When Hitler was informed at 1 a.m. of the riots in Munich, and that a synagogue had been burn ed, he was furious a nd ordered the Munich chief of police to report to him immediately. He ordered the fire put out at once and all demonstrations and riots in Munich to be stopped. He made sure that a telex was sent to all gauleiter at 3 a. m. The order demanded: \"From the highest authority: Arson or assault on Jewish shops or other Jewi sh property must not occur under any circumstances.\" In the morning of 9 November, Go ebbels spoke on the radio prohi- biting all actions against Jews. Anyone found violating this procla- mation would be severely punished. It turned out that it was the Jewi sh masonic lodge B'nai B'rith, in co-operation with the Zionist organization, LICA (Ligue International contre l'Antisemitisme) in Paris that was behind the so called Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938. Th e aim of the LICA provocation was to encourage the emigration of German Jews (Weckert, op. cit., pp. 254-256). B'nai B'rith had infiltrated the Nazi movement's vital parts: the SS, the SA and the party. These freema sons had managed to infiltrate the telephone operators in the gaul eiter offices. When they received the orders from Lutze, it was altered to its opposite. The Nazi leadership took no legal action against B'nai B'rith, which was allowed to continue its subver sive activities. B'nai B'rith had 12 000 members in 80 l odges in Germany, three of them in Berlin. B'nai B'rith was the only Jewish organization allowed by Hitler to remain active and open during the Nazi regime after 1933 (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Freemasonry , Culture, and Russ ian History\", Moscow, 403"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"1999), although propaganda claims that it was dissolved in Germany in 1937 (Lexikon des Judentums\"). Bu t Hitler actually first in 1939 closed B'nai B'rith's operations in Germany. It was not until the war had begun, in November 1939, that the B'nai B'rith had their documents confiscated. The Jewish VOBB lodge had its library confiscated in April 1938. In 1952, Nahum Goldman, president of the World Jewish Congress, demanded 500 million dollars from the German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer as compensation for th e damages suffered by the Jews during the Kristallnacht. When Adenauer questioned the justification of this outrageous claim, Goldman replied: \"You may justify as much as you like, I want the money!\" And it was given to him. This is called chutzpah, Jewish insolence! Adenauer's wife, by the way, was Jewish. In the 1930s, Cyrus Adler, presid ent of the American Jewish Com- mittee, co-ordinated the activities of the B'nai B'rith and The New York Times in order to block any American political measures against Hitler. The American freemasons had no inte rest whatever in fighting na- zism, but were merely looking for a suitable opportunity to satisfy their thirst for blood. President Roos evelt was firmly set against sup- porting any anti-Nazi groups, since he wished to kill as many Ger- mans as possible (Colonel John Beaty, \"The Iron Curtain over Ame- rica\", p. 74). General Mark Clark, a freemason and Commander-of the US Fifth Army, told the soldiers of the US Fifth Army: \"There is no limit to the number of Germans you can kill.\" ( The New York Times, 13 February 1944) The SA members who had taken part in the disturbances were tried in court. The party had its own cour ts of law with Walter Busch in charge. All documents are still available. Herschel Grynszpan su rvived the war, even though he had been brought to Germany. After the war he returned to Paris, where he should have been tried for murder. Instead, he received a new name and new identity papers. His family also survived the war, and 404"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"managed to emigrate to Palestin e. Someone had paid 4000 pounds to give them the opportunity, as the family had no money of their own. As a consequence of the Kristallnacht, the National Centre for Jewish Emigration was formed. The Zionist collaboration wi th Hitler went so far that some of them were declared Aryans, among them the banker Oppenheimer and the aircraft manufacturer Ernst Heinrich Heinckel. In his book \"Bevor Hitler kam\" (\" Before Hitler\", Geneva, 1975), the Jewish Professor of History Dietrich Bronder showed, which Jews financed Adolf Hitler, thus helping him to power. This explains why a large number of Jews were give n Aryan documents. He also proves that most of the Nazi leaders were Jews or half-Jews, or were married to Jewish women. Bronder's book is banned in Germany. In 1943, American intelligence compiled a file on Hitler. The material was classi fied and was not released until 1972. The psychiatrist Walter C. Langer, w ho during the war had analysed all secret information about Hitler for the White House, published the delicate material in his book \"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\" (New York, 1972). He had access to facts sim ilar to those made available to Dietrich Bronder. The Nazi leadership also included Jews with \"the right docu- ments\", among them the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler (shown to be Jewish by the Jewish writer Willi Frischauer in his book \"Himmler: Evil Genius of the Third Reich\", London, 1953). Himmler's homo- sexual activities were recorded on film by the Nazi photographer Walter Frenz. Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr, was a Greek Jew. Other Jews were Alfred Rosenberg, who developed the national socialist ideology using as models the Talmud and Bulwer-Lytton's \"The Coming Race\" (1871), and Jo seph Goebbels, whose first girl- friend was Jewish and who only a ppreciated Jewish professors (Grigori Klimov, \"The Protocols of the Soviet Elders\", Krasnodar, 1995, pp. 328-329). Goebbels' Jewish ancestry has also been de- monstrated by the historian David Irving. His family came from Holland; he was nicknamed \"rabbi\" in school.

The deputy Chancellor of the Reich, Rudolf Hess, was bom in Egypt by a Jewish mother. In the homosexual circles in Munich, he was known as \"Fraulein Anna\" (Bronder , op. cit.). It is less commonly known that in the 1920s, Hitler sexually abused Richard Wagner's grandson Wieland Wagner ( Time Magazine, 15 August 1994, p. 56). This information is well documented. Julius Streicher, editor of Der Sturmer, was another Jewish homo- sexual. His real name, Abraham Goldberg, was publicized on his han- ging on 16 October 1947, after the Nuremberg trials (Bronder, op. cit.). During the Nuremberg trials, Streicher admitted: \"Our model was the Jewish law\" (Nikolai Ostrovsky, \"The Temple of the Beast\", Mos- cow 2001, p. 120). Both SS officer Adolf Eichmann and Labour Minister Robert Ley were Jews, as were the SS generals Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (1899-1972) and Odilo Globocnik (1904-1945). After the war, Bach- Zelewski was kept under house arrest for ten years. In 1958, he was taken to court again and sentenced to life imprisonment (Bronder, op. cit.).

Goring declared him to be Aryan, although his father was also Jewish. According to Bronder, Goring himself was Jewish, as was his second wife. In 1961, the British writer Char les Wighton published his book \"The Story of Reinhard Heydrich\", which is based on Nazi sources. He showed that the head of the SD Reinhard Heydrich was Jewish on his mother's side. His father (Bruno Ziiss) was also Jewish, and Heydrich himself was a homosexual. Hitler had a good impression of Heydrich, and believed that his non-Aryan roots would guarantee his obe- dience. General Karl Haushofer, a university professor and director of the Munich Institute of Geopolitics, was married to a Jewess. His Jewish son Albrecht Haushofer, later ha d no problems working for Nazi Germany's Foreign Ministry. He was a scientist as well as a politician (David Korn, \"Wer ist wer im Judentum\" / \"Who is Who in Judaism: Encyclopaedia of Prominent Jews\", Vol. 2, FZ Verlag, Munich, 1999, pp. 124-125). In 1940, Albrecht Haushofer became a professor in Berlin. He took part in planning He ss' flight to Scotland in 1941, and was later executed suspected of complicity in the attempt to murder Hitler in July 1944. On 10 Marc h 1946, Karl Haushofer murdered his wife ritually and then before a black Buddhist altar opened his own belly using a Japanese short sword, Samurai style (harakiri). According to Henneke Kardel's book \"Adolf Hitler: Begriinder Israels\" / \"Adolf Hitler: Creator of Israel\" (Geneva, 1974), Hitler's lawyer Hans Frank was half-Jewish, because his father was a Jewish lawyer from Bamberg. The book was banned in Germany, and in accordance with a court decision, al l copies found there were sunk in a Hamburg harbour basin in 1974. On Hitler's appointment as chancello r, Frank was made minister of justice in Bavaria. In 1934, he wa s appointed minister without port- folio.

His half-sister Angela was employed by Hitler as a housekeeper in Obersalzburg, while his half-brother lived in Berlin. Eva Braun was half Jewish, and ha d been introduced to Hitler by the half-Jewish photogra pher Heinrich Hoffman. Many leading officers in the Wehrmacht were Jewish: at least two field marshals, ten generals, co mmanding more than 100 000 sol- diers, fourteen colonels and thirty majors. In some twenty cases, soldiers of Jewish descent were decorated with the Ritterkreuz, one of the high est awards of merit in the Ger- man army. This information was verified in greater detail by the American historian Bryan Rigg, himself of Jewish origin (William D. Montalbano, \"Judiska soldater slog s for Hitler\" / \"Jewish soldiers fought for Hitler\", Dagens Nyheter, 5 January 1997). Thousands of men of Jewish desce nt, and hundreds of those desig- nated as Jews by the Nazis, served in the military with Hitler's know- ledge. A dozen lists of exception bearing his signature are still in existence. More than 1 200 cases ar e well documented. In one docu- ment, personally signed by Hitler, he used his right to make excep- tions for the 77 top offi cers on the list, according to the Nazi laws of 1935, which prohibited anyone who had a Jewish grandfather from becoming an officer. The list also contained names of top managers within the civilian administration that co-operated with the military. The blond and blue-eyed half-Jew Werner Goldberg was used by Nazi propaganda as the ideal Germ an soldier. Commander Paul Ascher and General Johannes Zukertort were both Jewish. The half-Jew Colonel Walter H. Hollaender was d ecorated with the Ritterkreuz and German Cross of Gold. Hitler declared the half-Jew and later Luft- waffe General Helmut Wilberg to be Aryan in 1935 (military awards: Hohenzollern Knights Cross with Swords).

Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor (1974-1982), was an Air Force (Luftwaffe) officer, even though his paternal grandfather was Jewish. In 1921-1937, the Jew Ernst Hanfst aengl was a close friend of Adolf Hitler, and later was friendly with Franklin Roosevelt. He was warned by the Austrian writer Rudolf Kommoss: \"Should there arise a party led by anti-Semite Jews or half-Jews, we will have to watch out!\" (Ernst Hanfstaengl , \"Hitler: The Missin g Years\", London, 1957). 430 000 Soviet Jews fought German Jews in the Second World War (Aron Abramovich, \"In the Decisive War\", St. Petersburg, 1990, p. 25). The Red Army high command in cluded many Jews, among them the generals Solomon Raikin, Isaak Revzis, Simon Reizin, Josef Rubin, Mikhail Belkin, Zelik Yoffe, and Grigori Preizman. Who was Hitler? Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 at 6.30 p. m. in Branau am Inn in Austria. According to his horoscope, he was to become a man of action, who would expose himself to personal danger due to needlessly careless initiatives, and would be likely to cause a crisis. The positions of the planets indicated that his fate was to be a leader. His horoscope clearly indicate d that he had a great gift as a speaker. It has been stated that Hitler's paternal grandfather was Jewish, but there is no evidence either for or against this claim. His grand- mother, Anna Schicklgruber, was a peasant woman who gave birth to a son, Alois. The identity of his father has never been established. Two brothers have been pointed out, one a farmer and the other a miller, as well as a Jew named Frankenberger from Graz. Anna Schicklgruber was working for this Jew when she became pregnant, and he paid allowance for Alois until he was 14. Alois later became the father of Adolf Hitler. There is strong evidence that Hitler's 409"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"grandfather was Jewish, rather than the miller Johann Georg Hiedler. A relative of Adolf's mother, Joha nn Salomon, was Jewish. Hitler's biographer Konrad Heiden mentions this. According to the Jewish physician Kurt Kreuger, Hitler's godfather was a Jew, named Prinz. He claims that Hitler's real father was a Jew living in the vicinity (Kurt Kreuger, \"I was Hitler's Doctor\", New York, 1953). Anti-Nazi propaganda has claimed th at Hitler had apparently never read a book. In fact, he was well read. In Vienna, he preferred to starve, rather than forego buying an essential book. He also borrowed large numbers of books. He usually read a book a day, above all books on German history and mytholog y (William L. Shirer, \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\"). Bu t he also read books on Marxism, eastern magic, yoga, hypnotism, astr ology, religion, occultism, Tal- mudism, numerology, graphology, psycho kinetics, black magic, alchemic symbolism... He read works by Hegel, Homer, Ovid, Cicero, Nietzsche, Schelling, Dante, Schiller and others. He st ored everything essential in his prodigious memory. His knowledge included mechanics and biology as well. Althou gh self-taught, he had a more thorough knowledge than most mediocre academics holding degrees. The Estonian freemason Gunnar Aarma, who interviewed Hitler on 30 September 1930, reported on 30 August 1994 in the newspaper Eesti Elu that Hitler gave \"a very good impression\". According to Aarma, he was an intelligent man. The freemasons judged Hitler to be a suitable man to bet on as the loser in a major war. Hitler was also involved in communist-style plunder and embezzle- ment. According to Gestapo Chief Heinrich Muller, Hitler had 188 457 322 Swiss franks in his personal Swiss account at the end of the war. The code for the account was \"Wolf\" (Gregory Douglas, \"Geheimakte Gestapo-Muller: Dokumente und Zeugnisse aus den US- Geheimarchiven\", Berg am Stamberger See, 1996, Vol. 2, p. 258). This may explain why in 1939 alone, Hitler was able to afford 264 ex- clusive works of art. 410"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"The CIA hired Muller in 1948. He worked for the CIA in Washing- ton, D. C. until his death in 1963 ( Spotlight, 3-10 January 2000, p. 2). Muller had left most of the German masonic lodges alone, which is why he was spared. Moreover, th e CIA needed his knowledge of the communists. Miiller and other Gestapo leaders also help ed to trans- form the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) into the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). Hitler was far too vigorous and independent, and he was beginning to deviate from the masonic doctrine. His health problems were therefore used as an excuse to drug him. He had constant problems with his digestion, including flatul ence and constipation, which indi- cates a lack of vitamin B. He was unable to digest his food properly. But instead of giving him vitamins and minerals, he was given large doses of chemicals, which completely ruined his health. This fact was known by American inte lligence service, according to reports that are now available. Hitler's Jewish doctor Theodore Mo rell, professor of psychiatry and a member of the Thule Society, was able to put Hitler into the con- dition required by the financiers of national socialism. Hitler was given up to 20 belladonna and strychnine tablets per day. Every doctor is aware of the effects of belladonna. It aggravates the digestive problems, rather than al leviates them. Belladonna causes paralysis of the central nervous system and the inner organs such as the stomach, inhibiting secretion in the digestive tract and the mucous membranes. Belladonna also has a negative effect on the brain. The higher the intelligence, the more harmful it is. The patient's sensitivity deteriorates, he becomes manic and prone to hysterical outbursts of anger. Belladonna also affects vision and hearing, may cause rapid speech, vertigo and rabies-like symptoms. It causes paralysis of the spinal marro w and the stomach muscles. The digestive process is halted, and the patient becomes choleric. Strychnine is also a poison, which causes cramps, amnesia and headaches, and causes difficulties in holding up the head and in the ability to walk. 411"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"On top of this, Hitler was given atropine, which causes exaltation and disorientation. He had hallucin ations, palpitations of the heart and aggravated constipation. The facts were revealed by the Ameri- can neurosurgeon Bert Edward Park in his book \"The Impact of Illness on World Leaders\" (1986). It is therefore not true that Morell was an \"ignorant, unscrupulous pill doctor\" as was later claimed. After the war, Morell told the allies that he had deliberately poisoned Adolf Hitler. Furthermore, the Fuhrer received large quantities of caffeine, cardiazol, coramine, sympatol, among others - a total of 28 medi- cines and drugs (Hugh Trevor-Roper, \"The Last Days of Hitler\", London, 1947, p. 68). Hitler demanded to be given natural medicines, but these were neutralised by perv itine, a close relative of ampheta- mine, which began to destroy his brain. He would frequently wake up trembling at night. Because of his insomnia, he became hysterical and afraid of the dark. Hitler preferred Morell to his othe r doctors, Professor Karl Brandt and Professor Hans Ka rl von Hasselbach. Brandt accused Morell of \"criminal negligence\" as early as 1934 (David Irving, \"Hitler's War\", London, 1977, p. 713). Dr Theodore Morell was also a freemason (Hans Werner Wolters- dorf, \"Die Ideologie der neuen Weltordnung\", 1992, p. 110). The Fuhrer began each day tired, grumpy and out of sorts. After his daily dose of pervitine, he changed completely. His eyes became manic, his speech was rapid and confused and his body trembled. Morell's cures also incl uded large doses of testosterone, the male sex hormone. In 1945, Hitler was ta king 92 different chemicals. President John F. Kennedy also had his brain ruined by ampheta- mines and steroids. The Jewish doct or Max Jacobson visited the Ken- nedy family four times a week to administer the injections. As early as the summer of 1961, the Kennedys had developed an ampheta- mine addiction. After the attempt on his life on 20 July 1944 Hitler received maxi- mum doses of cocaine for his sinus trouble. Twice a day, he took 412"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"cocaine solution in the form of nasal spray. At one point he took an overdose, which led to a collapse, unconsciousness and an epileptic fit. Cocaine causes depression and lo ss of energy and appetite, and affects the heart.

The brain ceases to func- tion properly and one is reduced to a zombie, a suitable tool for evil powers. Cocaine causes permanent damage to the nerve cells. Drugs, above all opiates such as morphine and heroin, destroy the nerve cells in the brain's basal ga nglia, causing Parkinson-like symp- toms. Hitler had Parkin son's disease as early as the mid-1930s. The disease caused deterioration from 1940, and he began to disinte- grate mentally. Hitler became bizarre and irrationa l. His notorious neurotic out- bursts came more and more often, whenever he was contradicted. They seemed to function as discharg es or withdrawal symptoms in his intoxicated nervous system. In his book \"The Impact of Illness on World Leaders\", Edward Park assumed that Hitler was suffering from a primary brain disorder, a type of temporal lobe epilepsy. In fact, he must have been in remarkably strong good health to be able to withstand attacks from su ch large quantities of chemicals. They are partly responsible for the criminal decisions made by Hitler under the influence of these awful drugs and toxins. If one can no longer control one's brain, there are other forces willing to do so, and they are as a rule anything but benevolent. The German historian Anton Joachi msthaler discovered that Hitler had ordered the execution of Eva Braun's lover Hermann Fegelein, a liaison officer between Hitler and the Waffen SS. Fegelein became engaged to Eva Braun's sister during the course of the affair. Hitler found out about his cheating when one day Fegelein telephoned Eva Braun, asking her to run away wi th him. Joachimsthaler had access to letters from Hitler's private secretary and from a close friend of Eva Braun. 413"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Hitler eventually becam e physically a broken man.

The artillery explosions had completely destroye d the area. There was nothing left of Hitler's body, even though it may have been there. The commu- nists falsified all photographs and so-called evidence. The records of the post mortem, which were made available in 1992, were also forged. The fact that Hitler was allowed to stay in power as long as he did, in spite of being unbalanced, si ck and therefore dangerous, is evidence that as a weakened and confused leader, he was very useful to the masonic leaders. Had this not been the case, he would have been toppled at once. British RAF even planned to kidnap Hitler with the help of his pilot Hans Baur, as confirmed by a number of documents in the national archives in London. The file was declassified in 1972. Apparently, Baur was prepared to fl y to Britain with Hitler. There is no explanation in the documents as to why the kidnapping never took place. Another theory, put forward by the Gestapo Chief Heinrich Miiller, among others, says that Hitler ma naged to escape from Germany. The reason that Hitler's body was never found was that his and Eva Braun's bodies had been burnt, and the ashes transported as a relic by a submarine to a German base in the Antarctic. Previously, in- correct information about Hitler's a lleged escape was deliberately cir- culated. Later, several German officers, who at the time were in the navy, and who subsequently moved to the United Sates, contacted the Russian historian Valentin Prusakov, who had written about Hitler. He published their story in \"Hitler's Remains\" (Moscow, 1994). The Washington Post found it easy to choose Hitler as the most evil person of the century: \"There is no alternative. Adolf Hitler was 414"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"the most evil.\" (1 January 1996). Still, Hitler remains a minor hooligan compared to Lenin or Stalin, the worst of them all. The Magic of the National Socialists National socialist ideology is founded on many of the ideals advocated by the masonic lodge Germanenorden and the mystic Thule Society. The Germanenorden (founded in 1912 in Leipzig) was the origin of the Hammer League. The order soon had up to 100 lodges, under the lead ership of Herman Paul. The Germanenorden was dissolved in 1916 and reorganized by Philip Stauff in 1918. The freemason Rudolf von Sebottendorf was a member of one of the splinter groups, the Germanenorden Walvater. His real name was Adam Alfred Rudolf Glauer. He be came master of the lodge in 1918. In the autumn of 1919, the order had 1500 members, among them Hermann Goring. The order's main lodge, which was located in Munich, was renamed the Thule Society, under the leadership of the astrologer \"Baron\" Rudolf von Sebottendorf. The members worshipped the lost continent of Thule. Sebottendorf was above all a Sufi expert. He believed that the esoteric tradition of Islam, particularly sufism, was the purest stream of Ancient Wisdom and that it had nourished European occultism through the Rosicrucians, alchemists and the authentic freemasons of the Middle Ages (Wulf Schwartz waller, \"The U nknown Hitler\", Ber- keley Books, 1990). In 1917, he ha d returned to Germany from Turkey where he had become acquainted with a Jewish family called Termudi from Saloniki. The father of the family was a member of the masonic lodge The French Memphis Rite. Because of Termudi, Sebot- tendorf was initiated into the same lodge. He also took over Ter- mudi's occult library (Anton Pervushin, \"The Occult Secrets of NKVD and the SS\", St. Petersburg, 1999, p. 278). The fact that Sebottendorf was openly a freemason was highly embarrassing to the Nazis, who did everything they could to hide their movement's masonic origins. 415"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"In 1919, the Thule Society took as its symbol a male swastika with its arms turned to the right and with curved lines, revolving counter- clockwise (power poured from th e centre, out through the cross ends). The female sauwastika is a mirror image of the male. Power is sucked in to the centre from the ends. The female cross also rotates counter-clockwise, like Mother Eart h, to gather power. A one-sided explosive principle, after generating power, leads to exhaustion. The male swastika is magically robust, while the female sauwastika is highly sensitive and very energy consuming. Both rotate in the same direction, as do wsing will confirm. The aim of the Thule Society w as to fight against the primitive German Marxism, which encouraged envy. The leaders of the society, among them the journalist and occult ist Dietrich Eckardt, began by founding a political worker's club for the dissemination of ideas on racial biology. On 5 January 19 19, the German Workers Union (Deutscher Arbeiterverein) was founded. The Thule Society news- paper Munchner Beobachter became the party paper, the Volkischer Beobachter. This is the explanation behind th e prominent Nazi interest in magic phenomena and astrology. Am ong the members of the magic Thule Society were judges, police chiefs, lawyers, teachers, profes- sors, industrial leaders, doctors, scientists and very rich people. The chief of police in Munich, Ernst Pohner, and his deputy Wilhelm Frick and the Bavarian Minister of Justice Franz Gurtner, were members. Frick became minister of internal affairs in the Third Reich. The lawyer Hans Frank, who later became Hitler's minister of justice, Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg and the magician Hans Horbiger were also members. Rudolf Steiner was also grand mast er of Mystica AEterna, which belonged to the Memphis-Misraim Ri te. This lodge was open to both male and female members. Steiner later fell out with Hitler. In 1909, Steiner began to have close contact with his masonic brother Lenin in Zurich.

He worked actively to make the Western nations officially lift their trade embargo against the Soviet Union. In this way Steiner was working for the Illuminati. As an agent for the military in telligence, Hitler attended a general meeting of the German Workers Party on 12 September 1919. After his first personal meeting with Hitler, Dietrich Eckardt immediately realized that he had found the man predicted by the Thule Society. Through spiritualist sessions he ha d received detailed information about the future leader of Germany. Through Eckart, Hitler came into contact with the Thule Society. Eckart was a prominent occultist initiated into the art of black magic by Aleister Crowley (actually Edward Alexander Crowley, 1875- 1947) in a magic colony, the Abbey of Thelema, founded by Crowley in 1920 in Cefalu, Sicily. Crowley initiated several others occultists of Hitler's close associates in the secrets of magic. Crowley worshipped Baphomet. All members of the colony were punished, if they forgot to avoid the first person in their speech. Following the death allegedly of food poisoning of one of the colo- ny's members, Raoul Loveday in 1923, the British press began to pub- lish articles about Crowley's magic orgies. The members of the colony had sacrificed a cat and consumed its blood as a magic rite, shortly before the death of Loveday. The Italian leader Benito Mussolini then forced Crowley to leave the country, as he had practised perverse sexual magic (he had homosexual relations with Victor Neuberg and others) and ritual child abuse. According to several sources, he sacrificed children. Crowley himself stated that he had sacrificed 150 young boys between 1912 and 1928. He also practised drug magic. Crowley encouraged human sacrifice, particularly of children. At the age of 21, at midnight on 31 December 1896, when he hap- pened to be in Stockholm, Crowley had a mystical experience, which opened up for him a world of magi c. Since the early 1900s Crowley was an asthmatic, recommended by his doctors to use heroin, because all opiates have the effect of expanding the bronchial tubes. Crowley's brain was destroyed, how ever. He should have been given 417"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"adrenalin instead, which is more e ffective in expanding the tubes. In Cefalu, Crowley used opium as well as cocaine, cannabis and heroin. The freemason Karl Kellner founde d Ordo Templi Orientis in 1895. After his death in 1905, the leadership was taken over by the news- paper magnate Theodor Reuss. 0T0 claimed to be the heirs of the Knights Templar. The order also bega n to practise ritual magic orgies (mainly those members who had attained the 9th degree). One of these members was Rudolf Steiner. In 1902, Kellner founded the German section of the Memphis-Mi sraim Rite together with the theosopher Franz Hartmann and th e occultist Heinrich Klein. Crowley became a freemason of the 33rd degree (Scottish Rite) in Mexico City in 1900. He was also a freemason of the 97th degree in the Egyptian Misraim system, which contains 90 common and seven secret degrees. Later, Crowley also worked for the British intelligence service MI5. He died of an overdose of heroin on 1 December 1947. His book \"Liber Legis\" (\"The Book of the Law\") revealed many of the secrets of magic. \"Mein Kampf\" includes many ideas and thoughts derived from Crowley's \"Book of the Law\". In 1912, Crowley came into contac t with OTO, and became a mem- ber the same year. He took the magic name Baphomet, the deity worshipped by the Knights Templar and the Illuminati. He became the leader of the British lodge Mysteria Mystica Maxima. In 1904 Crowley had begun referring to hims elf as the Beast 666. When the Grand Master Theodor Reuss died in 1922, Crowley took over the role as grand master of the Ordo Te mplis Orientis. Many lodges and members left the order in protest. Crowley had, however, managed to take control of the entire organization. Although he himself had once been a member, Hitler banned the 0T0 in Germany in 1937 (Ken Anderson, \"Hitler and the Occult\", New York, 1995, p. 125). The 0T0 had used various methods in order to help Hitler to power. In 1907, Crowley had founded his own organi- zation, the Astrum Argentinum (A:. A:.), taking over the degree system of the Golden Dawn, from which Crowley had been excluded. 418"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"In the magic Astrum Argentinum (Silver Star) lodge, which resembled a masonic lodge, Crowley taught black magic. He took his 30 members from the Mysteria Mystica Maxima. He appointed himself Master of the Temple (Magister Templi). During the Second World War, Churchill consulted Crowley on issues of magic. After that, he began to use his famous V-sign. Hitler's first teacher of magic was a short Jewish hunchback, Ernst Pretzsche, who ran an occult book shop in Vienna. He occasionally gave Hitler food, when he wa s hungry and pawned his occult books. Pretzsche had grown up in Mexico City where his father had been an apothecary. He had studied the ritual magic of the Aztecs. After the family had returned to Europe and Ernst Pretzsche had opened his bookshop, he became acquainted with the magician Guido von List, who in his Blood Lodge claimed he could make evil spirits materialize. When this lodge was exposed, it led to a scandal in the German-speaking countries. Pretzsche told the young Hitler of black magic and disclosed the secret behind astrological and alch emical symbols (Ken Anderson, \"Hitler and the Occult\", New York, 1995, p. 75). 419"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":" Pretzsche encouraged Hitler to u se mescalin, which is found in the Mexican peyote cactus (Lopophora will iamsii) to open his third eye, the centre for clairvoyance in the brain, and thereby get access to the Akasha chronicles, where the real history of the world, all experience and all true knowledge is stored. Von List later became a member of the Thule Society. Hitler had previously practiced meditation and mind control. By taking peyote (mescaline) Hitler expo sed himself to a process he was unable to control. He also discovered his vast psychic abilities. He became a kind of medium without a spiritual centre. In the Akasha chronicles, Hitler was able to see images from the world's history as well as from hi s own previous incarnations, all according to the occultist Walter Johannes Stein who on several occasions talked to Hitler about his magical experiences. Hitler was strongly fascinated by the sacred Longinus lance, which had been an evil talisman used by German warlords. On several occasions, Hitler stood close to the lance in the treasury at the Hofburg in Vienna. 420"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"\"Baron\" Jorg Lanz von Liebenfe ls was Hitler's companion in Vienna. He published an anti-Sem itic periodical, and became Hitler's spiritual guide (Wilhelm Daim, \"The Man Who Gave Hitler the Ideas\", Vienna, 1958). Lanz was a Jewish extremist, and a homosexual. He went to Switzerland to meet w ith Lenin, whom he admired. Another Jewish friend from Hitler's youth was Ignatz Timotheus Trebitsch-Lincoln, who helped finance the activities of the young Hitler in Vienna, according to the Jewish historian Dietrich Bronder. At the front in the First World War, Hitler took extreme risks to prove that fate would not allow him to die. He received the iron cross for exceptional bravery, an award very rarely awarded. As he was an Austrian citizen, he served in the war as a volunteer. During the war Hitler fathered a son. Hitler and Charlotte Lobjoie met in 1916 in the German-occupied French town of Vavrin. They began a relationship, which lasted for almost two years. The son, Jean Loret, was born on 18 March 1918, only a few months after Corporal Adolf Hitler had left France. Later the same year, Hitler was informed of the birth of his son. In the 1930s, he wished to bring Jean to Germany to educate him, but this never happened. Jean's mother was an alcoholic, who had wo rked as a stripper in Paris, and Hitler did not want a scandal. But after the Germans had occupied France, he ordered the Gestapo to find his son. Without informing him that he was the Fiihrer's son, the Gestapo was ordered to make arrangements for him. Jean Loret wa s given a subordinate job in the Gestapo, with a very generous salary, and a private car plus fuel, which was extraordinary for a 23-year old in wartime France. In 1944, the Gestapo ordered all documents destroyed showing Jean Loret to be a collaborator, in order for him to avoid punish- ment. Jean Loret did not understand why the Gestapo was so inte- rested in him, but his mother told him the secret on her deathbed. Towards the end of the 1970s, Jean Loret turned to the historian Verner Maser, who disbelieved him at first but was convinced of the truth of his story after close investigation. He then told the story of Hitler's son in a book. Jean Loret died in 1985. His son, Hitler's 421"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"grandson Philippe Loret, is not interested in his ancestry. His sister is married to a Jewish professor. All attempts on Hitler's life failed. Maurice Bavaud, a 22-year old Swiss theology student, made severa l attempts to shoot Hitler, but failed and was arrested on 9 November 1938, when trying to leave the country by train without a valid ticket. Hitler was frightened of bad omens. On 13 October 1938, he confiscated the Longinus lance and took it to Nuremberg. On the same day when Hitler is said to have committed suicide (30 April 1945), the lance came into American hands. For a few months in 1920, Hitler took lessons in astrology from the Jewish astrologer Erik Jan Hanussen (actually Hermann Herschel Steinschneider). Hanussen later be came the national clairvoyant and official oracle of the Nazi Party. He became a party member in 1931. Hanussen also acted as Hitler's private clairvoyant. Hitler established a new academy led by Hanussen, w ho was made an honorary doctor. Joseph Goebbels took private l essons from Hanussen on the art of influencing the masses and in as trology. He became rather good at casting horoscopes. Rudolf Hess was also very interested in magic knowledge. In March 1933, Hanussen predicted: \"Hitler will end as a burning torch.\" Shortly af terwards Hanussen was murdered, all according to Hanussen's godson, Hans Mayer, who is a journalist. In September 1939, a few days after the outbreak of the war, the SS employed Karl Ernst Krafft, a famous Swiss astrologer, was able to predict that Hitler's life would be at risk between 7 and 10 November 1939. On 8 November 1939, in the Burgerbraukeller beer hall in Munich, a bomb exploded killing eigh t and injuring 63 people. Hitler had been there, celebrating with party veterans, but had left the party early in order to catch a tr ain for Berlin. He never received Krafft's warning. Hitler's personal astrologer Berger was a freemason. With the exception of Wilhelm Wu lff, who worked for Himmler, the astrologers eventually became an embarrassment for the Nazis. Their predictions were most uncomfortable. Things began to go badly for 422"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"them. Krafft was arrested in June 1941 and taken to the concentration camp at Oranienburg, where he died a few months before the German capitulation. He had recommended Rudolf Hess to fly to Scotland on 10 May 1941 to seek a separate peace treaty. Hess was delayed, and his mission failed. He was thereafter seen as a traitor. The British historian John Charmley was of the opinion that Britain should have accepted a separ ate peace with Germany after the fall of France. But there were no plans made for such a peace. And Hitler stuck to his economic policy. In the autumn of 1940, Winston Churchill had employed the Belgian-Jewish astrologer Louis de Wohl, who had escaped from Nazi Germany in 1935, to fi nd out for the British War Office, which advice Hitler's astrologers might be giving him (Jan Bojen Vindheim, \"Mysteries of the West\", Oslo, 1990, p. 145). De Wohl had predicted that Hitler's death would be violent. On 10 May 1940, Hitler had successfully attacked Holland and Bel- gium against the advice of his genera ls. Hitler's astrologer Krafft had recommended the blitzkrieg, and H itler himself had predicted the success of the action. He was also ab le to predict the occupation of the Rhineland. Operation Barbarossa, on the other hand, was carried out without consulting astrologers, which proved fa tal. Hitler had also just been taken ill. He had rejected Stalin's request for a separate peace in July 1941, and in October 1941 (Stalin wa s prepared to evacuate the government to Siberia on 15 October). Two years later, in 1943, he again rejected Stalin's proposal. Hitler did, however, wish for peace with Britain and the United States. Roosevelt, rejected the German offer of an \"honourable surrender\" in the spring of 1943. The mani- pulators wanted the war to go on until the world would more and more come to resemble Solomon's new temple, an unequalled slave- and slaughterhouse. In March 1936, Hitler told his clo sest circle: \"I go wherever Provi- dence takes me, like a somnambulist.\" It was obvious that someone 423"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"else was guiding his actions. He ofte n fell to the floor during his out- bursts. Major General, Professor Karl Haushofer, the director of the Munich Institute of Geopolitics, became Hitler's second esoteric mentor, replacing Dietrich Eckardt. Some hi storians have pointed him out as one of the Illuminati, which has been officially denied (Friedrich Paul Heller and Anton Maergerle, \"Thule\", Stuttgart, 1995, p. 46). Hess had introduced Haushofer, who was a master of magic and an expert on Oriental culture, to Hitler. In 1919, Karl Haushofer founded in Munich the occult Order of Bruder de s Lichts (Brothers of the Light or the Luminous Lodge), which later in Berlin was renamed the Vril Society (which had been named after a book by Edward Bulwer- Litton). Haushofer was a student of the Russian magician and meta- physician Georg Gurdjieff. Haushofer was also a member of the Thule Society and the masonic lodge Golden Dawn, which in 1917 was founded in Wien (among members was also Rudolf von Sebottendorf). This lodge was connected to Georg Gurdijeff. Members of the Vril Society believed that the interior of the Earth was inhabited by a highly advanced civilization (Agharti) that had access to Vril energy. According to Haushofer, Vril energy was the most powerful magic force in the universe, better known as ether energy or prana. With the help of this energy it was possible to over- come gravity. Specially designed flying machines would be able to use this energy to achieve anti-gravity. Haushofer regularly visited Hitler in Landsberg prison in 1924. He initiated Hitler into the deeper secrets of magic and advanced the idea of 'Lebensraum' (Living Spa ce). It was Haushofer who encou- raged Hitler to write \"Mein Kampf\" . Hitler also became a member of the Vril Society. Haushofer was called the greatest magician in Germany. He became known as the clairvoyant general. On the battlefield during the First World War, he correctly predicted the time of an enemy attack and pointed out the spots that would be hit by enemy shells. He predic- ted when Paris would be invaded by German troops as well as the 424"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"German reoccupation of the Rhineland and the co rrect time of Presi- dent Roosevelt's death. A Vril Society with the swastika as its main symbol exists in France today. The leader is Jean Claude Monet. Haushofer considered Tibet to be the home of the most powerful magicians in the world. He had visited Tibet a nd had come into con- tact with the Ge-lugs-pa (Yellow Hats Order), which had been foun- ded in 1409 by the Buddhist reform er Tsong-kha-pa. Haushofer was initiated in this sect and swore to commit suicide sh ould his mission fail. Because of Haushofer, Hitler began sending research expeditions to Tibet as early as 1926, in order to gain knowledge of black magic, but his intentions failed. In the autumn of 1925, Lenin's emi ssary Nikolai Roerich, a well- known freemason and artist, had trav elled to Tibet together with the chekist assassin Yakov Blumkin intending to obtain magical know- ledge for the bolsheviks. He failed. Tibetan Bon magicians joined the Nazi side to help combat inter- national freemasonry. Bon is the olde st religion in Tibet, often seen as the original and primitive religion of Tibet, full of dark rituals and spells. The priests of Bon had a potent repu tation with the common people as magicians. Th e Nazis chose not to tell them about their co- operation with freemasonry, and that the battle against the Illumi- nati was an illusion. Buddhist monasteries had warned against the secret, harmful and unnatural activities of the freemas ons. This was confirmed by the Estonian Buddhist monk Karl To nisson. In a booklet, published as early as 1923, he foresaw the Sovi et occupation of the Baltic States. After his death in Burma in 1962, he was declared to be a bodhi- sattva (a holy man), since his body did not begin to decompose for several days. The Nazi leaders had chosen to use Tibetan Bon magic as their model. They believed that Tibet wa s the original home of the Aryan people. The SS also sent out expeditio ns to the Andes. 425"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"The Tibetan magicians, who practised the original Bon religion, became known as the Society of th e Green Men in the Nazi inner circle. Towards the end of the war, on 25 April 1945, in a basement in a Berlin suburb, Soviet soldiers discovered the bodies of six Tibe- tan lamas who had committed suicid e, a practice that was permitted only in the exceptional case of magi c secrets falling into the hands of enemies. One of them wore green gloves. Later, more than a thou- sand bodies of Asian men were found wearing German uniforms, but without the usual insignia of rank. All had committed suicide. In Konigsberg the Nazis had a la boratory, Konigsberg 13, headed by SS Reichsfiihrer Heinrich Himmler, where various magic methods were studied. The Nazis wanted to use practical magic to combat the alleged enemy - international Jewry -, which also since ancient times practised magic. Himmler was very interested in geomancy, earth energies and ley lines. He believed that the SS headquarters in Wewelsburg had become a power cen tre (Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, \"The Messianic Legacy\", London, 1987, p. 203). The Soviet security police, NKVD, had a similar laboratory in Moscow where all the leaders were communist Jews. Stalin also had advisers on questions of magic. Th e Jewish astrologer and tele-path Wolf Messing was one of them. In Poland in 1937, Messing managed to predict that 1945 would be a fatal year for Hitler and his regime. At first only the Polish press wrot e about Messing's predictions, later it was related by major newspapers worldwide. When the Germans occupied Poland, they tried to find Messing. He was arrested by the Gestapo but managed to escape to th e Soviet Union, where in 1940 he predicted that Soviet tanks would occupy Berlin. In 1943, at an appearance at the opera in Novosibirsk, he predicted that the war would end between 1 and 5 April 1945 with defeat for Germany. On 9 April 1951, LIFE magazine reported that General Eisenhower, the Allied supreme commander, had told Stalin of the American intention to halt the advance at the Elbe, giving the Red Army the honour of being the first to march into Berlin. It was President 426"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Truman who prevented Eisenhower from advancing through Germany towards Berlin. After the Red Army occupied Berlin, the allies had to wait for several of months before being allowed to enter the city. After the war, the Americans left a large number of Wernher von Braun's V2 rockets to the Russians in an underground tunnel in a German mountain. Officially, the ro ckets had been \"accidentally left\" there. Himmler had reorganized the SS as a black-magic Order of Knights (Order of the Silver Star) after th e pattern of the Jesuits or even the Illuminati order. The SS had taken over some very special magic rites from the freemasons, but some ritual s were taken straight from the Knights Templar. SS members wore car efully designed black uniforms featuring an old magic symbol - silver skulls. The symbols were also found on magic rings. This was s uggested by Himmler's personal magician, the SS Brigadenfuhrer Ka rl Maria Wiligut (1866-1946), who was also known under the alias K. M. Weisthor (Nicholas Goodrick- Clarke, \"The Occult Roots of Nazism \", St Petersburg, 1993, p. 197). In 1924-1927, Wiligut had been treated in a mental hospital in Salzburg. The double S, or sun runes, resembled two lightning bolts. The leadership demanded very high standards of its members. SS officially stood for 'Schutzstaff eln' (guard corps), but the real meaning was Schwarze Sonne - th e black sun. Himmler was the grand master. The SS headquarters were at Wewelsburg Castle in Westphalia (north-western Germ any), which Himmler bought as a ruin in 1934 and rebuilt the next 11 years at a cost of 13 million marks and turned into a temple for his SS cult. The central banqueting hall of the castle contained an enormous round table with 13 throne-like chairs to accommodate Himmler and 12 of his closest associates (\"apostles\") - making, as some occult writers have pointed out, a coven of 13. Beneath this hall was the Hall of the Dead, where stone plinths stood around a stone table. As each member of the inner circle of the SS died, his coat of arms would be burned and, together with his ashes, placed in an urn on one of these plinths for veneration. 427"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Hitler and SS' chief Himmler practised black magic. Himmler's special force, or Death Head Units, practiced elaborate fraternal magic rituals. In his youth in Vienna, Hitler had subscribed to the magic periodical Ostara. In 1933, the Psychology Professor a nd occultist Frie drich Hielscher founded the Public Institute for Occult and Cultural Research - Deutsche Ahnenerbe (the German Le gacy). The advisers included the Swedish freemason and diplomat Sven Anders Hedin. The Ahnenerbe was headed by Standartenfuhrer Wo lfram Sievers. In 1939, the insti- tute became a department of the SS headed by Himmler. Nazi leaders used a pendulum to locate war ships on charts. Ludvik Straniak managed to locate the battleship Prinz Eugen that was on a secret mission. He was later ordered by the Nazis to find information about enemy troops using the pendulum on land maps. The resources available to the Ah nenerbe for occult investigation were larger than those available for the Manhattan Project (for the development of the atomic bomb). The Ahnenerbe was later joined to the Vril Society. The swastika (or fire cross), which in ancient times was a sign of happiness and luck, is the oldest most complex and most widely distributed of all magic symbols. The earliest occurrence is from Sumer (Carl G. Liungman, \"Tanketecken\", Stockholm, 1993, p. 228). 'Swastika' is a Sanskrit word mean ing 'fortune-bringing'. It occurs as a mandala in many Asian cultur es. In Europe (from the Mediter- ranean to northern Norway) it also stood for fertility and rebirth, as in Sumer and ancient Egypt where, however, it was usually replaced by the Osiris or ankh cross, which was a cross with the top shaped as a circle or oval loop. Swastikas ha ve been found carved on old Jewish sarcophagi in Palestine. The sign is also known in Arabic cultures from ancient times. The swastika is a symbol of the highest god, the Sun. In Japan, it represents wealth and a long life. It also became a holy sign of Buddhism and Jainism . Vishnu worshippers use it. The symbol protected the wearer agains t negative energies among native Americans, who saw it as representi ng the circle of life. In ancient 428"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Greece it was seen as the crux gammata gammadion, made up of four (gamma). The symbol also emerges when two meander coils are crossed. A cross revolving arou nd its centre symbolizes the eter- nal movement of the universe. The first Christians also used this symbol as a fire cross. It was found in the catacombs of Rome as a symbol for Christ as the source of power in the world. In Scandinavia, the swastika was known as Thor's hammer. Muslims regard the swastika as signifying the four principal directions - Chronicler (west), Death (south), Preacher (east), Life (north) as well as the four seasons, ruled by angels. As previously mentioned, there ar e two types of swastikas repre- senting male and female, the sun and moon aspects. The fact that the reversed swastika is female is suggested by images of Artemis and Astarte, which show it in the pudenda region. In China the two versions are used to signify the forces of yin and yang (female - male). The swastika points to the four cardinal points of the zodiac, the four elements and other such of th ings. In some parts of China, the swastika was used to increase the en ergy of \"female\" talismans. It was generally a positive sign, but also the Japanese sign for the magic number 10 000 (100 x 100). There is s a certain amount of confusion regarding which version of the swastika is the most positively charged. In medieval Japan the sauwastika (manji) was used as a talisman against evil forces. Sau- vastika means \"blessing\". In India, the sauwastika was seen as a sym- bol of bad luck and suffering. This reversed swastika (sauwastika) blessed the night and glorified death and destruction. It was also the symbol of Kali, the goddess of Death, covering the dark side of life. The sauwastika is depicted in the ba llroom at the royal palace of Fon- tainebleau in France. Connected swastikas, sometimes referred to as knots of Solomon, symbolize divine unfathomability and infinity. In connection with the February Coup 1917, the dark powers of freemasonry, which had infiltrated the Russian government preparing 429"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"the overthrow of the tsardom, bega n to use a slightly camouflaged masonic swastika on the 250-ruble notes. The bolshevik leaders decided to use the magic properties of the male swastika. This symbol also o ccurs in freemasonry, according to the freemason Marcel Valmy (\"Die Freimaurer\", Cologne, 1998, p. 89). The first bolshevik symbol thus was the swastika, which was found on Red Army uniforms and on the 250-ruble note until 1922 (Akim Arutyunov, \"The Lenin Dossier Un-retouched\", Moscow, 1999, p. 453). The swastika was also found on the communist notes of a thousand, five thousand, and ten thousand rubles. In his book \"The History of the Russian People in the 1990s\", Oleg Platonov wrote: \"The primary bols he-vist symbol was the swastika, which.... the authorities wished to use as a main element on the national coat of arms.\" (Vol. I, Moscow 1997, p. 520) Under this symbol, the Red Army killed nearly 20 million people. It must be stressed that compared to the communist criminals, Hitler and his companions were minor hooligans. Hitler as a child had been influenced by the pagan swastika, which was connected to German history and which occurred in a co at of arms at a monastery in Dambach, where he sang in the boys' choir. 430"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" In 1917, the Soviet Union considered using this symbol on the uniforms of its soldiers. Hitler was, however, impressed by the magnificence of the com- munist reversed, right-angled swastika, and began using it as the Nazi symbol on 20 May 1920. The dentist Friedrich Krohn of the party leadership (who also was a member of the Germanenorden) had sug- gested using the sauwastika, which promoted health and would have brought balance and success to the male organization. It occurs in Buddhism as symbolic of Buddha's esoteric teachings, the wheel of life, but Hitler insisted on using th e male swastika. In Buddhism the female yin swastika is used for cer tain purposes to attain spiritual balance. The Thule Society was, however, mainly interested in using the male swastika. It held secret courts and condemned people to death. But fatally, the swastika did not work in the hands of these evil men. It reduced the aura of the fighting male masses. The Nazi lea- ders, however, took measures for their own security - producing power without gathering power. For the Nazis therefore, this magic symbol functioned as exploitation strength through joy (Kraft durch Freude). The Nazis, however, saw the swastika as a symbol of national renaissance. In 1935, the Swastika wi th the original German colours 431"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"(red, black and white) became the official German flag, which had been removed by the freemasons in 1848. In the 1920s, part of the American food industry, which sympathi- sed with the totalitarian tendencies in Europe, began using the swas- tika on their products (breakfast cereals, Coca-Cola, Uncle Sam soda). When Hitler spoke in public, he had the ability to spellbind his audience like a hypnotist. When th e audience made the Roman salute with their right hands, the leader received the energy they sent out with his left hand, a magic gesture. In July 1926, Hitler was standing in his car at a party convention in Weimar, Thuringen, where he had permission to speak, and as 5000 men marched past him he greeted them for the first time with his right arm outstretched (Alan Bullo ck, \"Hitler: A Study in Tyran- ny\", New York, 1961). At the First Zionist Congress in B asel in 1897, the Jewish delegates raised their right hands while chanti ng an old Hebrew psalm: \"Nay, if I forget thou, Jerusalem, so may my right hand forget its duty.\" (Johannes Hagner, \"Se, han kommer med skyarna\" / \"Behold, He cometh with the skies\", Stockholm, 1941, p. 48). Assuredly, there was magic power behind this ancient Roman salute. The Party Days at Nuremberg in 1937 were a splendid splay of ritual magic: fanfares, marches, rhythmic movements, the magic mantra greeting (\"Heil und Sieg\" was used as \"Sieg Heil\"; Hess leading the masses in reciting the mantra), handsome uniforms, torchlight processions shaped as sw astikas, powerful spotlight beams, and to top it all, Hitler's inflammatory speeches. In ancient Rome, the greeting was \"Ave!\". The masoni c lodge the Brotherhood of the Golden Dawn saluted \"Heil!\" (Anton Pervushin, \"The Occult Secrets of the SS and the NKVD\", St Petersburg, Moscow, 1999, p. 298). The Nazis took over the rituals. The Nazi Occult Bureau was closed after Hitler's assumption of power. In 1934 all prophetic activ ities, magic research and esoteric literature was officially banned or declared to be nonsense outside their own inner circle. The Occult Palace in Berlin was closed. The 432"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"astrologer Jorg Lanz von Liebenfe ls was prevented from publishing his books, although he was a friend of Hitler's from his youth. Occult knowledge seemed unsuited for the ma sses. In the Soviet Union, the communists had acted similarly. The Frenchmen Jacques Bergier a nd Louis Pauwels reported in their book \"The Dawn of the Magicians: The Fantastic Reality\" (Kiev 1994) that the Nazis sent expeditions to Tibet until 1943. In that year, Himmler sent Otto Reinz, who had a German father and a mother from Buryatya, a Buddhist area of the Soviet Union. The goal of his journey was the monastery the Ward of Heaven. The Nazis wanted a detailed drawing of the placing of the monastery buildings, since they knew that it was arranged in accordance with the magic mandala principle. Mandala means the uninterrupted energy flow between the centre and its various units, created by the centre. All the buildings placed on the hearts haped spiral were facing north. Hitler's headquarters, Wolfschauze (a Wolf's fortress) in East Prussia, was planned and built as an almost exact copy of the Tibe- tan monastery. (Adolf, by the way, means \"noble wolf\".) Some of the buildings, however, did not correspond to the original Tibetan plan. Otto Reinz considered this a weakening of the system. One of these buildings was a wooden structure wh ere a bomb exploded on 20 July 1944. The Fuhrer's bunker as well as Bormann's house was surrounded by a heart-shaped path. The allies never managed to discover this place outside Rastenburg despite their intensive attempts. Tibet was also the origin of the numerous magically charged camouflage patterns used by the Nazis for their battle uniforms. There were over 400 different patter ns. Several of these were adopted by other nations (the Americans, for instance, stole one of the patterns, calling it woodland camouflage). Since the 1980s, the Bundeswehr are using the Waffen-SS camouflage designs for their uniforms, Air Force and combat jumpsuits. After the Second World War, in ternational freemasonry regarded Tibet as a serious threat to their ev il designs. This is the reason why China was used to destroy Tibe t, which had access to the secrets of 433"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"nature. The Chinese communists laid all the monasteries in ruins and killed as many as they could of the most initiated lamas. During the Nuremberg trials no mention was made of the magic used by the Nazis, since even the victorious masonic regimes of the Soviet Union, Western Europe and the United States used their own black magic methods. In 1961, \"The Secret Book\" was printed in Munich, which Hitler is said to have dictated in 1926, but banned from publication. It is doubtful if it really is dictated by him. Nazism and Freemasonry Communist as well as national socialist ideology came out of the secret Illuminati movement. The id eologies are like two aspects of the same social doctrine. When Hitler came to power, he ordered the celebration of the First of May (the Illuminati order had been foun- ded on 1 May 1776). Fascism was of the same Illuministic branch three. The purpose was to totally shatter our traditional world, which was built on spiritual values, replacing it with materialistic quasi- values. Alfred Rosenberg was ordered to use masonic values in Nazi ideology (Helmut Neuberger, \"Freimaurerei und National-Sozialismus\" / \"Freemasonry and National Socialism\", Hamburg, 1980, pp. 62-63). The masonic lodges were enormously influential in Austrian society, Vienna in particular, at the end of the 19th century. But Hitler makes no mention of this in \"Mein Kampf\". The book reveals nothing about freemasonry. The reader has the impression that Hitler obeyed the masonic code of silence. On the whole, the book is reminiscent of the dull Soviet party literature. In the spring of 1933, the German Ministry of the Interior sent an important letter (document No. 8540 in the Special Archives) to the Illuminati, claiming that there was no longer any need for secret contacts in Germany to protect Illu minati interests. When the Nazis 434"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"assumed power, the aims of the Il luminati had been adopted by the state itself. Therefore they had no reason to continue their activities in Germany. The letter proved the Nazis and the Illuminati to have the same aim: to destroy the Old Wo rld and \"to build\" a new and bet- ter one. This is not what happened, however (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Free- masonry, Culture, and Russian History\", Moscow 1999, pp. 586-588). In June 1933, the Illuminati leader ship issued a circular to its lodges. The document reported that the Illuminati Order had been dissolved as a result of the Nazi seizure of power. At the same time the Illuminati headquarters sent a message to the police headquar- ters that the order was being reorganized to become the Illuminati World League. The reorganization had begun as early as in 1926. Lists of all Illuminati members were handed over to the German authorities. In 1932, large numbers of new members had been re- cruited (document No. 8543). Himmler was active in several organi- zations connected to the Illuminati. A new masonic lodge was founded in Konigsberg in 1934. Others had been renamed in order to em phasize the \"Christian foundation\". An overall demand to dissolve the masonic lodges came in 1935. This was a reaction to the masoni c declaration of war on Germany on 5 January 1935. On this day, the B' nai B'rith president Alfred Cohen had declared war on Germany in the name of all Jews, freemasons and Christians. The war against the German people went on even after the Wehrmacht surrender in May 1945. This declaration of war was in f act a stronger and more demanding than the previous one presented by extremist Jews and freemasons on 24 March 1933 in the British newspaper Daily Express and other major newspapers worldwide. The aim was to put pressure on the German government to force the Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Ger- man products were therefore subjec t to a boycott in connection with the declaration of war. The Jewish Chronicle demanded, on 14 December 1938, that the boycott on Germany should continue until all lodges were reopened and their assets returned. 435"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" At the same time, the German government was contacted by Zionist representatives of the Yeshiv a in Palestine, offering to end the boycott on condition that Jewish emigration from Germany to Palestine would be hastened. The negotiations were completed in May 1933 with the signing of the Ha-Avara Agreement (the Transfer Agreement). This agreement subsequently became an important factor in the birth of the state of Israel. The Zionists gave Germany more than 20 million dollars betw een 1933 and 1939, according to the agreement. The Ha-Avara agreement allowed every German Jew to emigrate, taking with him all his property and all assets, pr ovided he would settle in Palestine. The agreemen t was effective until the end of 1941, when the United States joined the war. Any Jews refusing to emigrate were sent to concentration camps. The first Zionist declaration of wa r came as early as 1932, before the Nazis came to power. The masonic powers wanted war. Declarations of war were repeatedly issued in 1939 and 1942. In Germany, freemasonr y was strongly opposed. In 1937, Joseph Goebbels arranged an anti-masonic exhibition in Munich. According to documents available today, the freemasons carried on as usual, as 436"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"proved by their internal correspondence. The Nazi leadership deman- ded that party members leave the lodges. As early as June 1934, the Nazi member Fritz Werner had le ft the Illuminati lodge. He even demanded a written confirmation that he was no longer a member. Adolf Eichmann belonged to the masonic lodge Schlaraffia (Schla- raffenland was the German dreaml and). Ernst Kaltenbrunner, later head of the Reichsicherheitshaupt amt (national security authority), explained to Eichmann the necessity of leaving his lodge, since as a Nazi he could not be a freemaso n (Hannah Arendt, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\", 1963). As Prime Minister of Prussia, Hermann Goring, said in 1933: \"Natio- nal socialist Germany has no room for freemasonry.\" He also admitted that it was Jewish money that kept the Nazis going. In the early 1930s Germany had ten grand lodges, 690 sub-lodges and a total of 70 000 freemasons. Before the war the German masonic movement was the second largest in the world. In 1934, the Gestapo would some times strike, for example when the Hohle lodge had its assets confiscated in Tilsit. The Andrea Strenua lodge, on the other hand, was allowed to legally carry on its activities in Tilsit even in 1939. The Montana lodge was dissolved in 1939 and the Irene lodge in 1940. Zur Einigkeit in Frankfurt am Main was not closed until 1941, as were a number of other lodges in Marienburg and other cities. In 1926-1935, the Grand Lodge of Germany encouraged members of the Zur Edlen Aussicht lodge in Freiburg to become members of the Nazi Party (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Freem asonry, Culture, and Russian His- tory\", Moscow, 1999, pp. 586-588). It was their duty as freemasons. In 1933, George Frommholz had left his lodge to become a member of the Nazi Party. He advanced to the rank of Truppenfuhrer in the SS, according to remaining files. In the SS, he led the Skull Brigade. In 1949, he became a freemason agai n. He was a master of the Zum Totenkopf und Phonix lodge. In 1974, Frommholz was made grand master of the United Grand Lodges of Germany (Martin Short, \"Inside the Brotherhood\", London, 1997, pp. 28-29). 437"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"In 1935, the Nazis gradually began to confiscate the archives of the masonic lodges, which were handed over to the Reichssicher- heitshauptamt and were used for various purposes. According to official information, the masonic lodges were banned together with other shady societies in 1937. In actual fact only certain of the lodges were persecuted by the Nazi s, as shown by documents of the Soviet Special Archives. The Nazi leadership wrote polite letters to various masonic lodges asking them for assistance. The lo dges were required to distribute Nazi leaflets among their members. All letters ended: \"Heil Hitler!\" All theosophical and esoteric societies, as well as the Germanen- order and the Thule Society were banned on 20 July 1937. The same year, the New Templar Order NTO (founded in 1907) was banned. Bookshops selling occult literature were forced to close. The Thule Society exists today, under the al ias Knights of Poseidon (Robert Charroux, \"Legacy of the Gods \", London 1979, p. 178). Rudolf von Sebottendorf, the leader of the Thule Society, was deported in the summer of 1934. Although Benito Mussolini expelled all masonic lodges from Italy, they continued their activities abroad. The freemasons were very disappointed as they had taken part in the famous march to Rome, and had assisted the fascists in other ways as well (Paul A. Fisher, \"Behind the Lodge Door\", Rockford, Illinois 1994, p. 223). In a 1938 speech, Hitler condemn ed international freemasonry. This, however, was only a facade, wh ich is demonstrated by masonic documents. Nazi Plans for a Eu ropean Confederacy In 1987, the German historian Hans Werner Neulen published his book \"Europe and the Third Reich: a Project of Unifying German Power Structures 1939-45\" (\"Europa und das Dritte Reich: Einigungs- bestrebungen im deutschen Machtbereich 1939-1945\"). According to 438"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"SS documents presented in this book , it is obvious that the Nazis wished to carry out the Pan-European programme conceived by the freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi, which found support in all masonic lodges in the 1920s. Count Coudenhove-Kalergi believed that the peoples of Europe would stop fighting each other and save billions, if they were united in a trade- and defence union wit hout customs barriers. This would once and for all end all social in equalities through radical measures (socialism). All roads would lead to Pan-Europe, which was not only the best, but also the only possibl e solution. Coudenhove-Kalergi saw no other way out. In 1923, his first book on Pan-Europe was printed. He thought it was everyone's wish to put an end to the wars and the social evils. According to the fr eemasons, the European federation was the only cure for the greatest dangers threatening Europe. The federation would enable the creation of a mixed race. His book \"Practical Idealism\" (1925) contains the following words: \"The future man will be a mongrel. As for a Pan-Europe, I wish to see a Eurasian- Negroid mixture with great variation in personality types... The Jews shall take the leading positions, since Provide nce has given Europe a spiritually superior race of nobility called the Jews.\" (Pp. 22 and 50.) Further masonic plans concerning th e restructuring of Europe were published in the periodical Wiener Freimaurerzeitung in September 1925 and October 1926. Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote in his autobiography: \"At the beginning of 1924, we received a telephone call from Louis Baron de Rothschild. A friend of his, Max Warburg of Hamburg, had read my book and wished to make our acquaintance. To my great surprise Warburg spontaneously offered us 60 000 gold marks, to finance the movement for its first three years... He remained seriously interested in the Pan- Europe movement to the end of his life. In 1925, Max Warburg arr anged for his brothers in the United States, Felix and Paul, to invite me for an American tour, in order to introduce me to Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch. In America, the count discussed European unity with Hoover, Kellogg, Young and Lippmann, but also 439"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"found out that American support for the unity of Europe rested on mutually incompatible foundations.\" In 1966, Coudenhove-Kalergi published the book \"Pan-Europe: 1922 to 1966\", in Vienna, where he states (p. 95) that the young generation will live in the United States of Europe. On page 103 he reveals plans to extend the European United States as far as Vladivistok. As early as 1930, the Am erican weekly magazine Saturday Evening Post published an article by Winst on Churchill under the title \"The United States of Europe\". In 1942, Churchill, then th e prime minister of Britain, stated: \"I am looking forward to a United States of Europe.\" Again in September 1946, he said: \"We have to build some kind of United States of Europe.\" In Paris, in 1948, he stressed that his aim was to establish the United States of Europe, which would be governed by one government, one parliament, one court of justice and one economic council. In May 1948, the Movement for a United Europe held their Euro- pean congress. Its le ading advocate was once again Winston Chur- chill. One of seven resolutions of the congress read: \"The creation of a united Europe has to be regarded as a crucial step towards the creation of a united world.\" By this, they meant a world government. The freemason Jean Monnet was the main advocate of a united Europe. He led the committee for the United States of Europe. Monnet was the son of a French wine merchant. He had travelled to Canada when he was 20 to work for the Jewish bank Lazard Freres. After the First World War, he took part in the Versailles peace negotiations. In 1919, he was appoint ed deputy secretary general of the League of Nations. Behind the European movement was also Joseph Retinger, a freemason of the 33rd degree. The freemasons used the threat of communism to get their way. The Nazis wanted to establish a European confederacy, modelled on the Soviet economic system. The plan was made public in 1942. They wanted a regionalised Europe. Finance minister Walter Funk published the book \"The European Community\" where he presented 440"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Goring's ideas of a \"need to extens ively unify Europe after the war\". Goebbels proclaimed: \"In 50 years' time, Europe will be united and the words \"native country\" will no longer be used.\" A secret plan existed to socialize the entire German economy, and build it on a communist (that is Il luminati) foundation. Ernst Kalten- brunner, the director of the Reic hssicherheitshauptamt, was against it. He considered it too dangerous to approach the communist system in this way. The intention was to reduce Hitler's power in the new system - making him president of the German Reich, and to extend the role of Reichsfiihrer Heinrich Himmler, who would become leader of the European confederacy. One of the ar chitects behind this project was Hitlerjugend Reichsleiter Bal dur von Schirach (until 1940). SS troops also assisted in agricultural work, according to docu- ments and photographs found in Nazi archives. The intention was to show the SS in the service of the people. The Nazis claimed to want a flexible form of socialism, a fair system that would guarantee the rights of small nations. The con- federacy would unite the European nations economically and politi- cally. It was to be a friendly soci alist society, a Volks-Gemeinschaft, ruled by libertarian socialism with civil rights for all and a common European passport. There would be no interest rates, banks and major enterprises would be nationalized, it would no longer be possible to make vast amounts of money on others, and the police authorities were to be subject to legal control. German hegemony over the other member nations would be complete ly relinquished. The original national socialist programme was to be adhered to. The expressed wish was to create the United States of Europe, where all nations would be equal (Hans Werner Neul en, \"Europa und das Dritte Reich: Einigungsbestrebungen im deut schen Machtbereich 1939-1945\"). On 15 February 1945, Propaganda Mi nister Joseph Goebbels issued a directive strictly prohibiting discrimination of other European peoples, in particular those of Slavic origin - a conversion in the shadow of the gallows. 441"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"The Nazis in other words wanted to implement a programme that would create the United States of Europe and which the Illuminati leader Giuseppe Mazzini had advo cated as early as March 1848. The SS Charter included the concept of the United States of Europe. It was the Merovingian Empire under a new name. Otto Ohlendorf, head of SD-Inland (interior security), was appoin- ted by Himmler as Graalshuter der Idee (Grail Ideologue). He came up with several ideas before the war, such as legal control of internment in concentration camps, and minority status for the Jews, which would lead to respect for the full rights of a people. This confederacy project would make it morally impossible to start a new war of brotherly destruction in Europe. In his book \"The Tain- ted Source: The Undemocratic Origins of the European Idea\" (London, 1997), the British journalist J ohn Laughland emphasized that Joachim von Ribbentrop and Joseph Goebbels viewed the future through the principle of the new or der. Goebbels wanted to abolish all borders between the nations. Eu rope's future would be ensured through mutually dependent technol ogical progress. A new monetary regime was needed to protect Europe from the competition of the rest of the world. As early as 1942, the national socialists were planning the intro- duction of a common European currency. The plan was eventually launched by the freemasons in 1970, under the leadership of Luxem- burg's Prime Minister Pierre Werner. Leading Nazis really believed in this great plan. They called it the European Economic Community (Europaische Wirtschaftsgemein- schaft), which meant a common la bour market, communications and industrial policy. The Nazis wished to make peace with the Soviet Union. The Belgian Nazi leader Leon Degrelle once asked Hitler what he would do if Stalin came to him. Hitler replie d: \"I would order that this person be given access to the most beautiful castle in Europe.\" Since the Nazi confederacy proj ect departed from the original masonic plans for a United States of Europe (interest free economy 442"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"and non-mixed nations), the United States of America wrecked all attempts to realize the ideas. Using more refined and more pe aceful methods, the freemasons within the European Union try to design the Nazi-Illuminati pro- gramme without these digressions. To claim that th e European Union is at all reminiscent of the Nazi plans for a similar reorganization of Europe, is usually considered completely politically incorrect. The German Foreign Minister Joschka (Joseph Martin) Fischer (a former left wing terrorist) at the Humboldt University in Berlin on 12 May 2000, told the European Parlia ment that it was high time to introduce a European federation. He spoke of a transition from the EU to full parliamentarism within a European federation, as the free- mason Robert Schuman had demanded 50 years earlier. This means a European parliament and a European government respectively exer- cising the legislative and executiv e powers of the federation. The freemasons happily greeted Fischer's suggestion. The EC declaration of 9 May 1950 declared that the concrete foun- dation for the future fe deration had been laid. The French Minister for Europe Pierre Moscovitch stated in the spring of 2002: \"We have to proceed towards the United States of Europe. I say united states, as we ar e talking about the European fede- ration. Many people think that the idea of a united states is a logical sequel to the introduction of a comm on currency - the euro.\" The in- tention, apparently, is to establish the United States of Europe, with all members nations turned into federal states with little power. Sinister Plans be hind the Scenes As early as 1938, President Roosevel t increased production of military aircraft from 10 000 to 20 000, and to 50 000 in May 1940. The United States was not at war, but it was preparing for war. Admiral James O. Richardson had in an analysis reached the con- clusion that it would be better for the United States, if Hitler 443"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"attacked Stalin first. It was de cided in San Diego in May 1941 that Hitler should attack Stalin and no t vice-versa. This would be more beneficial to the interests of the masonic elite. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 133). Britain had plans to occupy Norway and Denmark in April 1940. Hitler made a countermove, and oc cupied the countries on 9 April 1940. The British occupation forces were already under way. Hitler had opposed the invasion, but his naval chief Erich Raeder showed that England had advanced plans to ignore Norwegian neutrality and mine Norwegian waters. This is well told in the book \"Den nionde april\" (\"The Ninth of April\"), by Michael Tamelander and Niklas Zetterling, published in 2000. At the beginning of the Second Wo rld War, Winston Churchill had advanced plans to occupy northern Sweden in order to prevent Swedish iron ore from reaching the Germans. In a secret report dated 20 December 1939 it is claimed th at \"Swedish iron would be a decisive factor in the war, and victory would go to the side that would eventually control these vital mines\". Churchill intended to build a British naval base in Stockholm. The rest of the cabinet and the military hesitated, and the attack on Sweden was postponed several times. Hitler, how ever, intended to get there first, as he did with both Norway and Denmark. On 30 April 1945, Churchill wished at the least to prepare for Swedish military support in Norw ay in case the German occupation troops refused to surrender, when the rest of the Nazi troops laid down their arms (Dagens Nyheter, 25 May 1987). The allied had safe air corridors through Sweden throughout the war. Stalin had planned an attack on Hitler's territory (Operation Thunder), even though he had purged the best leaders from the Red Army. The attack was to have take n place on 6 July 1941. Four days later, on 10 July, the attack was to have ended. The High Command of the Red Army had already on 21 June (the day before Hitler's attack), received orders to attack Romania on 6 July 1941. The commander of this operation was to have been Marshal Semyon 444"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Timoshenko. He was supposed to have gone to Minsk on 22 June to prepare the attack, in which 4.4 million men were to have been used. But the Germans attacked first. Stalin intended to force his way through the capitalist countries like an icebreaker and occupy the te rritories held by Hitler, later to turn all of Europe over to comm unism, according to the books \"The Icebreaker\" (Moscow, 1992), \"M Day\" (Moscow, 1994) and \"The Last Republic\" (Moscow, 1996), all writte n by the defected GRU agent Viktor Suvorov (actually Vladimir Rezun). At the side of Lenin's coffin, Stalin had promised to extend the borders of the Soviet Union ( Pravda, 30 January 1924). On 19 August 1939, Stalin had already made the final decision on the coming attack on Europe (Viktor Suvorov, \"M Day\", Tallinn, 1998, p. 23). Sweden also was targeted to be occupied and sovietized. Hitler's spies had warned Berlin against Stalin's attack, and on 18 December 1940 Hitler issued order No. 18, to prepare a plan for a first strike against the Soviet Union on 16 May 1941, the Operation Barbarossa. On 11 March, the Soviet Union decided to carry out the attack on 12 June 1941 (Mikhail Meltiukhov, \"S talin's Lost Opportunity\", Mos- cow, 2000, p. 283). On 30 April 1941, Hitler changed of the date of the attack to 22 June. On 9 May, Moscow ignored rumours of troop concentrations on its western borders. On 17 May, Soviet authorities ba nned all foreign journalists and diplomats to visit the western borders of the union. After Hess' flight to Scotland, Stalin postponed the plans for an attack. On 24 May, the Soviet military command decided on a new date for the attack, 6 July 1941. On 10 June orders were given for the Wehrmacht to begin the attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June. Britain tried to calm the Soviet Union, promising to come to their aid against Germany. Stalin received information straight from Lon- don about the planned German attack. But he did not believe the reports to be true (Mikhail Meltiu khov, \"Stalin's Lost Opportunity\", Moscow, 2000). 445"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Through this attack Hitler ironically enough saved Europe from certain destruction. Some Estoni an schoolbooks already claim that Nazi Germany by attacking the Soviet Union, prevented a Soviet attack on Germany (M. Laar, M. Tilk and E. Hergauk, \"History for the 5 th Grade\", Tallinn, 1997, p. 190). Th e historian M. Laar is identical with the former Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar. In the West, the old communist propaganda lies are still being repeated. Despite the reports from his spies, Stalin was totally taken by surprise. He could not understand Hi tler's foolhardiness, waging war on two fronts simultaneously. Stalin even found it difficult to believe the reports of war. He regarded it as a provocation, just as he the previous day had disbelieved the tales by German deserters about the imminent attack. It was not until the evening of 22 June that he gave orders to resist. A common myth claims that Germ any attacked the Soviet Union without declaring war. In fact Germany declared war on the Soviet Union early in the morning, when Ribbentrop delivered a note to the Soviet ambassador. The note said that Germany was forced to attack in order to prevent a planned Soviet attack. Therefore, the free- masons kept quiet about it. One reason why Ribbentrop was hanged after the Nuremberg trials, was the false accusation that Germany never had declared war on the Soviet Union. Even Soviet historians later admitted that the note had been delivered (\"History of the Second World War\", Moscow 1973-82, Vo l. 4, p. 31). Thus, it was the Soviet Union that violated the Mo lotov-Ribbentrop agreement, not Germany. In the West, the Stalinis t lies are still accepted as truth. The so-called Black Divisions were formed from Russian detention camp prisoners, who were trained very thoroughly in Sochi on the Black Sea and sent to fight the Germans behind the lines in July- August 1941. Stalin had more than a million such paratroops at his disposal for attack purposes, more than all the Western armies together had for the same purpose. Stalin had a total of 15 000 tanks, five times more than Hitler. He also had special A-tanks (Avtostradnye tanki), which could run on 446"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"German motorways. Most of the 15 000 tanks were amphibian. The Germans lacked heavy tanks. Germany had no more than six tank di visions. Berlin lost a third of its tanks. Hitler had a total of 3410 tanks, 210 of which lacked cannons. Not one of them was amphibian (Viktor Suvorov, \"Suicide\", Moscow, 2000, p. 192, p. 299). With an army so poorly equipped, it is hardly possible to extend one's Lebensraum, evidence that this was a war of prevention. Wilhelm Canaris, head of military intelligence, never informed Hit- ler about the huge military capacity of the Soviet Union, or Hitler would never have dared to prelude the Soviet attack. According to Professor William Carroll Quigley (1910-1977), Admiral Canaris was working for the world elite in betrayal of Hitler (Carroll Quigley, \"The Secret Society that Started World Wa r II\"). Canaris had been recruited by the British intelligence service before the Nazis came to power. Hitler dared to attack mainly because of the Soviet setbacks during the war against Finland (1939-1940). Suvorov quotes Marsha ls Georgi Zhukov, Al exander Vasilevsky, Vasili Sokolovsky, Nikolai Vatutin, Ivan Bagramyan and others, who all confirmed that Stalin was prep aring an attack and not defence as was later claimed. This was the reason why Moscow's losses were so enormous - 600 000 men in the first three weeks, 7615 tanks, 6233 fighter planes (of which 1200 were lost on the first day), and 4423 artillery pieces. A large number of Russian soldiers let themselves be taken priso- ner. By the end of the first year , 3.8 million had gone over to the Germans. The Red Army simply refused to fight for communism. Most of the remaining 1.2 million were killed in action. Joseph Stalin was shocked. With the help of obstru ction troops, the commissars began to kill all Soviet soldiers reluctant to go forward. The financiers of Wall Street pa nicked and began sending all kinds of equipment to the Soviet Union as quickly as they could. In August 1941, the United States began to confer with Moscow on how Hitler's troops could most effectively be repulsed. Hitler was unable to plan 447"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"his operations, since he was ill at the time, \"courtesy\" of Dr Morrell. The United States meanwhile continued to give the Nazis military and economic aid, but on a smaller scale. Aid Continued During the War The financial elite in the United States kept supporting Germany even during the war, which they themselves had caused, and then provided a \"solution\" - the division of Europe into two ideological blocks. They intended for this disaster to go on for as long as possible. The Senator and high-ranking fr eemason Harry S. Truman, who became vice-president and later president of the United States, explained the situation after Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union on 24 June 1941, in The New York Times: \" I f we see that Germany is winning, we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning, we ought to help Germany. And that way let them kill as many as possible, alt hough I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances. Neither of them think anything of their pledged word.\" At the time, Truman (1884-1972) was not only a freemason of the 32nd degree, he was also grand master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri (1940-41). This information is available at the masonic temple in Alexandria, Virginia. Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, but it became a very strange, pass ive and one-sided war. The free- masons were hoping that the Germ an Chancellor would annul his decision not to value the German currency in gold. According to Hitler the basis for the value of money should be work. The Wall Street bankers disapprove d. They also detested Hitler's plans to lower the interest rates and eventually to abolish them (Bruno H. Schubert, \"Free-Economy Association, Inc, USA\", Huntington 1972). Hitler tried to persuade the British Prime Minister Neville Cham- berlain to act against the conspira tors and sign a peace agreement 448"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"with Germany. Chamberlain accept ed. The press then initiated a violent campaign against him, forcin g him to resign as prime minister in May 1940, to be replaced by Winston Churchill. Neville Chamber- lain left the government finally in October 1940. On 1 August 1940, Gustavus V of Sweden turned to the British monarch George VI offering to act as mediator. But Prime Minister Churchill opposed all further negotiations. London would have nothing to do with a peace treaty, unless Germany returns to the old economic system. The negotiations with Hitler broke down. The bankers threatened to go to war unless the situation was returned to normal. Not until 6 June 1944, the United States and Great Britain opened up a second front by the invasion of Normandy. Meanwhile, various capitalists carr ied on their business with Hitler. In 1941 alone, the Ford factories in France made a profit of 58 mil- lion francs on the products they managed to sell to the Germans. The White House was aware of this but di d everything to hide it from the public. In March 1942, Royal Air Force bombed the Ford plant at Poissy, France. A subsequent letter from Ed sel Ford to Ford General Manager Sorenson about this RAF raid commented: \"Photographs of the plant on fire were published in American ne wspapers but fortuna tely no reference was made to the Ford Motor Company.\" In any event, the Vichy government paid Ford Motor Company 38 million francs in compensation for damages to the Poissy plant. This was not reported in the American press, since the general public would not have appreciated such ne ws (Josiah E. DuBois, Jr, \"Gene- rals in Grey Suits\", London, 1953, p. 251). DuBois asserts that these private messages from Ford in Europe were passed to Edsel Ford by th e Assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long.

The Jewish historian Ladislas Farago, at the time working for the American intelligence, agreed: \"Hitler's submarine war against British-American shipping during the winter 1942-1943 was a success thanks to the help he received fro m Rockefeller.\" (\"The Silent War\", Stockholm, 1956, p. 77). In 1940, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon) had six tankers under Panamanian registry, manned by Nazi officers to carry fuel oil from Standard Oil refineries to the Canary Islands, a refuelling base of Nazi submarines (Antony Sutton, \"How the Order Creates War and Revolution\", Bullsbrook, 1985, p. 64 ). A report from Intelligence at Fifth Corps in Columbus, Ohio, on 15 July 1941 stated that the Nazis had sunk no Standard Oil ships. German submarines sank 3000 Amer ican ships. Standard Oil also supplied fuel for the Luftwaffe. According to a FBI report from 1942, 20 per cent of Standard Oil's en ergy production went to Germany during the war. Standard Oil owne d and extracted oil in German- occupied Romania. The chairman of the Harriman-Bush Company, Karl Lindemann, had permission to underwrite Standard Oil cheques for the benefit of the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had officially allowed trading with the enemy on 13 December 1941, when the \"General License under Section 3(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act\" was signed. The document was also signed by the Jewish freemason and Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau, and Solicitor General Francis Biddle. Morgenthau acted in the Nuremberg trials to safeguard American interests. On 14 March 1985, the Swedish daily Aftonbladet showed that the bankers Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg also had worked closely with the Nazi regime by lending large amounts of money to IG Farben. Two Dutch historians, Gerard Aalders and Cees Wiebes, spent six years searching for evidence of this. A contract was signed between the Nazis and Wallenberg in 1939, effective until 1944. During this 450"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"period, Jacob Wallenberg visited Germany on repeated occasions to negotiate with Hitler's government. IG Farben shaped Hitler's foreign policy, as confirmed by Georg von Schnitzler, an IG Farben board member: \"IG Farben is basically r esponsible for Hitl er's policies.\" In the United States, Wallenberg acted as a front for several companies owned by the German indu strialist Robert Bosch. After the war, when the agreements were discovered, the Americans con- fiscated the companies but the money was mysteriously returned to Wallenberg. Gerard Aalders told Aftonbladet: \"How they got their money back from the United States remains a secret.\" The Stockholms Enskilda Bank acted as a front for Bosch, Krupp, IG Farben and other major enterprises in Germany during the Second World War. The Wallenberg bank he lped them, among other things, by pretending to buy their foreign subsidiary companies (Gerard Aalders and Cees Wiebes, \"Affarer til l varje pris\" / \"Business at Any Price\", Stockholm, 1989). The Wallenberg family also collabor ated with the Soviet leadership. This was disclosed by the former chief spy in Scandinavia, Yelisei Sinitsyn, in his book \"The Resident Witness\" (Moscow; 1996, p. 260). He related how the Wallenbergs, during the Second World War, made sure that the Soviet Union regul arly received high quality ball bearings and military supplies. Without this addition the Soviet Air Force would have been in serious trouble. Almost every night, Soviet planes landed at Swedish airfields with the permission of the Swedish government to transported reinforc ements to the Soviet aircraft factories. The Swedish government also delegated to Raoul Wallenberg in Budapest the task of looking afte r Soviet interests. But because Raoul Wallenberg also co-operated with the German and American intelligence services, and protected other interests (among them those of Italian fascists and useles s entrepreneurs) he was arrested, brought to the Soviet Union and executed by poison injection. After the Yalta conference Churchill declared: \"We know now that we have a friend (Stalin) whom we could trust.\" This was said to 451"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"mislead the western opinion. The freemasons were well aware that Stalin was no more trustworthy than Hitler. These powers knew exactly what would happen to the Easter Europeans before Stalin gained access to the new territories in Eastern Europe. It has been claime d that Winston Churchill coined the expression 'the Iron Curtain' on 5 March 1946 at Westminster College, Fulton, Missouri. This is not the case. In fact, it was the Nazi Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goe bbels, who in the newspaper Das Reich of 25 February 1945, used the e xpression for the first time. In the article \"The Year 2000\" (pp. 1-2) he described the European situation after a possible German defeat. His assumption was that if Germany were to lay down arms, a ll of Eastern Europe would be occupied by the Soviet Union in ac cordance with the Yalta Agree- ment. He wrote: \"An iron curtain fa lls across a vast territory controlled by the Soviet Union. Behind it, the different peoples will be butchered. The Jewish press in London and New York will probably st ill applaud it.\" Goebbels assumed that Germany w ould be divided according to the Yalta plan, one part becoming communist. He stressed that the victors would create all kinds of myths about the war. Eventually, in the year 2000 Europe would be united in one single union. The forces that helped Adolf Hitler to power are still pulling the strings behind the scenes. This is why all the embarrassing facts about the American financiers have not surfaced until now. The United States has the ultimate re sponsibility for the appearance of communism as well as national socialism on the political arena. After the Second World War, 226 931 Germans were put on trial charged with crimes against humanity. Originally, 3 596 000 persons were to be tried, but for practical reasons this was not done. Very few communist murderers have been tried in the former communist world. The communists after all did not let their overlords, the financial elite, down. The Polish communists initiated the largest operation of ethnic cleansing in history - the expulsion of more than twelve million German nationals from the German eastern provinces. 452"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Prime Minister Winston Churchill said as early as 1944 in a House of Commons debate: \"In our opinion, the most satisfactory and lasting method is expulsion. It will get r i d of racial mixing which leads to endless conflicts... it will be clean.\" Thus the intention of today's mixing of peoples is not an expression of solidarity (a masoni c term) but the creation of endless conflicts, which can then be used by the masonic leaders to further their criminal interests. We are obviously living in a very barbaric world. The situation has emerged because of our lack of judgement. But eventually it will prove impossible to carry on with th e lies, evil acts and injustices. Sooner or later this system will also break down. Holocaust Hysteria In March 1916, The Daily Telegraph reported that Austrians and Bulgarians had gassed 700 000 Serbs. After the war, no one believed this story anymore. It was admitted to be just war propaganda. The American Hebrew on 31 October 1919 published a propaganda article under the headline \"The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!\" In the article, it was claimed that during the world war because of epi- demics, starvation and \"holocaust\", six million Jews might have succumbed. Later everything turned out to be war propaganda. This information was being spread during and just after the First World War. According to Ben Weintraub, th e figure six million has a great cabbalistic significance, which is why it is important to maintain it whether it is correct or not (\"The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism: Keystone of the New World Or der\", Toronto, 1995, p. 12). In 1933, there were 5.6 million Jews in those areas later to be controlled by Germany ( The New York Times, 11 January 1945). Orthodox Jews in their holy book the Talmud have grossly slandered the Romans by claiming that Emperor Vespasian \"in the 453"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"town of Bethar killed four hundred thousand myriads innocent Jews\". A quite impossible figure si nce a myriad supposedly was ten thousand! In another place in the Talmud (Gittin 58a, p. 269), it is stated: \"Sixteen million Israelite school children were wrapped in scrolls and burned alive by the Roman soldiers in Bethar.\" Almost everyone has accepted the official version of what hap- pened during the reign of national so cialism. As the reader realizes, great many of such stories have proved to be myths. High-ranking masonic politicians have made credible gross forgeries, especially that of the attempt to systematical ly exterminate all European Jews. One of the purposes of this myth was to make all criticism of the Jews impossible in the future. There were to be automatic com- passion with the Jewish people, so as to facilitate for Jewish extre- mists to commit all the crimes they wished. The Israeli magazine News from Within (No. 5, May 1995) stated that the Zionists have used the su ffering of the Jewish people to attain certain political goals. Ther efore the facts have been mani- pulated and they have refused to help their own people. Michael Warschawski said the following in the magazine: \"The feeling of being the eternal victim has made it possible to a large degree to suppress all feelings of empathy fo r the suffering of others and all feelings of guilt for the victims of the injustices committed by the state of Israel.\" Moshe Zuckerman revealed in the same magazine that Israel is using the holocaust to brainwash the new generation. School children in Holland have become so effectively indoctri- nated by the holocaust propaganda that they are convinced that there no longer are any Jews in the world. This was told by a spokesman for the Jewish Museum in Amsterdam in June 2000. The political editor of the Swedish Daily Dagens Nyheter, Svante Nycander, wrote the following on 18 April 1992: \"How then can a reasonably knowledgeable person be su re that the Holocaust really took place? ...If only one version of a historic event is allowed, people have no strong reason to believe in its truth. A claim requiring the protection of the law, one would suspect being a myth.\" 454"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"The holocaust during the Second World War is still \"a proven fact\", even though the absurd witness accounts contradict natural laws and human logic. There are, however, those that question the official version. The first proponent of Holocaust doubter was Alexander Radcliffe, a Scottish politician who claimed in late 1945 in his magazine Vanguard, that the holocaust was a Jewis h invention. This statement was taken from The Truth About the Jews, a pamphlet Radcliffe had published earlier in which he also speculated that the British govern- ment was actually controlled by the Jews. In 1947, the French writer Maurice Bardeche claimed in his second book, \"Nuremberg or the Promised Land\" that at least part of the evidence surrounding the concentrati on camps had been falsified and that the deaths of those interred there were mainly due to starvation and disease. Bardeche was also the first to contend that no Jews were gassed, since the so-called gas chambers were used for dis- infections. The Swiss Paul Rassinier was the ne xt important dissident to arise. Rassinier was himself a concentrati on camp survivor. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 for his activi ties with the resistance (which included smuggling Jews into Switzer land) and spent the remainder of the war in Buchenwald and Dora. In 1948, Rassinier published \"Crossing the Line\", which was the fi rst in a series of books intending to show that the claims of most concentration camp survivors were exaggerated, and that the inmates entrusted with running the camps were the real culprits of the cam p horrors, not the SS. In his book \"The Drama of European Jewry\" (1964), Rassinier argued that the claim that gas chambers were u sed to kill Jews was nothing more than an invention created to serv e the Zionist government of Israel. Though Rassinier died in 1967, his work was later collected and published posthumously in 1976 under the title \"Debunking the Genocide Myth\", bringing this French concentration camp survivor's theories to a new generation of doubters. 456"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"In May 1945, Austin J. App, a professor of English literature at the University of Scranton and LaSalle College in Missouri, claimed that the atrocities that took place in th e concentration camps were legally justified in accordance wi th the rules of warfare. In 1946, App used statistics to show that six million Jewish deaths at the hands of the nazis were quite impossible. By 1949, in a letter to Time Magazine, App had calculated the number of Jewish deaths at 1.5 million. In 1973, App pub lished \"The Six Million Swindle: Black-mailing the German People fo r Hard Marks with Fabricated Corpses\", where he laid out his eight \"incontrovertible assertions\" that demon-strate that the figure of six million Jewish deaths is a gross exaggeration. The German judge Wilhelm Staglich revealed the bluff in his book \"The Auschwitz Myth\" / \"Der Ausc hwitz-Mythos\" (Indiana, 1984). As a result he had his pension reduced and lost his doctoral degree. The authorities referred to a law of repealing academic titles from 1939 - a law signed by Adolf Hitler himself! \"Dissecting the Holocaust: The Gr owing Critique of 'Truth' and 'Memory'\" (Capshaw, Alabama, 2000), edited by the chemical engi- neer Ernst Gauss, contains the results of chemical analyses making it perfectly clear that all claims of gas chambers for the mass killing of people in concentration camps is total nonsense. The book is banned in Germany. Norman C. Finkelstein, professor at City University of New York and the son of two Jewish survivors from the Warsaw ghetto and concentration camps, has written \"The Holocaust Industry\" (London, 2000), where he claims that all this commotion leads to anti- Semitism and benefits neo-nazis and revisionists. The American Jew David Cole e xposed the holocaust hoax in Auschwitz, which he visited in Se ptember 1992. Cole talked to the head of the museum Dr Francizek Piper and reached the conclusion that it was all fiction. His docum entaries are very thought provoking. Cole felt that lies only harm the liars. Extremist Jews started to threaten him and he disappeared without trace. 457"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"The French Jew Jean-Gabriel C ohn-Bendit in 1991 expressed his doubts in an essay about the gas chamber stories. He was im- mediately the subject of slander. Ian J. Kagedan, spokesman for th e Canadian B'nai B'rith lodge, wrote in The Toronto Star on 26 November 1991: \"The Holocaust is to be the Keystone, or fundamental pr inciple, of the New World Order.\" The 66-year old French civil engineer Henri Roques in May 1986 received the highest grade on his doct oral thesis at the University of Nantes in Brittany. He claimed that gas chambers did not occur in the German concentration camps. According to him, the gas cham- bers is a myth. Roques had worked on the thesis fo r 20 years and read practically everything written about Hitler's concentration camps. After inter- ference from Jewish organizations, Roques subsequently lost his degree. The Polish Professor of History, Dariusz Ratajczak, in 1999 wrote in his book \"Dangerous Topics\" that the official number of Jewish vic- tims in the Nazi concentration camps is grossly exaggerated. He maintained that the eyewitness accoun ts lack credibility and that gassing of Jews never took place . Ratajczak said that the \"gas chambers\" shown to the public were never used as such. He was sacked from his post at the Univ ersity of Opole and banned from teaching anywhere in Poland for three years. President Eisenhower admitted that the Nazi concentration camps were \"prisons for political prisoners\". When the Jewish organizations in the United States, Great Britain and other countries in 1933 started a boycott that inflicted enormous economic damage on Germany, Hitler began to make anti-Jewish laws. The Jews were considered a secu rity risk. The Zionists wished to provoke Hitler to impose harsher an ti-Jewish measures in order to hasten Jewish emigration to Pale stine.

Du ring the military campaign in the east, German troops, so-called Einsatzgruppen, murdered many Jews. But it is not true that there was a plan to physically annihilate all Jews and that there were gas chambers for killing people in several concentration camps. Also the number of victims has been exagge- rated. The war offered the nazis an opportunity to force trough \"the final solution of the Jewish question\" . Hermann Goring on 31 July 1941 wrote to Reinhard Heydrich about his intentions: \"As a supplement to the task, which was entrusted to yo u in the decree dated 24 January 1939, to solve the Jewish question by emigration and evacuation in the most favourable way possible, given present conditions, I herewith commission you to carry out all necessary preparations with regard to organizational, substantive, and financial viewpoints for a total solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in Europe... Further I commission you to promptly present a draught concerning the practical preparations for the final so lution of the Jewish question.\" (Raul Hilberg, \"The Extermination of th e European Jews\" / \"Die Vernich- tung der europaischen Juden\", Fisc her Taschenbuch Verlag, 1990, p. 420) The Wannsee Conference in Berlin on 20 January 1942 that accor- ding to the myth, decided to exterminate the Jews was actually about relocating them, which also is clearly evident from the pro- ceedings of the meeting. We have all got so used to these lies in connection with the holocaust hysteria that we have trouble accepting the facts of the real circumstances. We ought to ask ourselves how anyo ne can be so cruel as to lie about the holocaust. Apparently this has been the case. A large amount of hard facts will easily strike down the lies behind he holocaust myth. During the war there were 14 large and several smaller con- centration camps. In addition to that there were 500 so-called labour 459"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"camps each having from a few hundred to more than 1000 prisoners. The Austrian camp Mauthausen was notorious for its inhumanity. There were strict rules for SS offi cials in charge. Karl Koch, com- mandant in Buchenwald, was shot for corruption and murder. Her- mann Florstedt, the ill-reputed commandant in Majdanek, was hanged before the assembled prisoners. On 4 June 1937, SS Gruppenfiihrer Theodor Eicke reported in an internal memorandum that SS Obersc harfiihrer Zeidler had sadisti- cally assaulted an inmate at the co ncentration camp Sachsenhausen. As a warning to other camp guards, he was degraded, discharged from the SS and turned over to the authorities. Eicke pointed out that assaulting inmates was not tolerated. Between 1 July 1942 and 30 June 1943, 110 812 concentration camps inmates died, which is showed by statistics collected by Waf- fen-SS General Oswald Pohl for He inrich Himmler. In August 1943, the total amount of camp prisoners was 224 000, and one year later there were 524 000. The Swiss educator Jurgen Graf w as struck by the many absurdities in the official version of \"the holocaust\". Therefore he compiled all available material into a book, \"The Holocaust on Trial: Eyewitness Accounts versus Natura l Laws\" (\"Der Holocaust auf dem Priifstand: Augenzeugenberichte versus Naturgesetze\"). The book is very convin- cing in its factuality. He states: «Apart from the last chaotic months of the war, the worst period in the camps was the summer and autumn of 1942. During these few months more than 300 people di ed in Auschwitz everyday in typhoid fever. The disease also claimed its victims among the SS guards. Within the Auschwitz complexes most deaths occurred in Birkenau, three kilo- metres to the west of the main camp, which had became a hospital camp. During certain periods more people died in Birkenau than in all other camps together. This \"death camp\" where probably 60 000 to 80 000 prisoners succumbed, mostly to diseas e (there were also executions and murder!), later became the legendary \"extermination camp\", where accor- ding to \"historians\" between one and four million people were murdered. 460"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"To burn the corpses of victims of disease, there had to be crematoria, and to store the bodies before cremation there had to be morgues and specially constructed cellars, which legend later turned into \"gas cham- bers\". Even the shower rooms became, at least partly, \"gas chambers\". And the division of the prisoners into able-bodied and non able-bodied became \"the selection for the gas ch ambers\". Thus was born the most fateful lie of our century, the Auschwitz lie.» There are historical parallels concerning the death rate at similar detention camps. At the Union prison camps Douglas and Rock Island during the American Civil War, th e monthly death toll was 2-4 per cent, and in the Confederate pris on camp at Andersonville 13 000 of 52 000 captured Union soldiers died. During the Boer War the British incarcerated roughly 120 000 civilian Bo ers as well as tens of thou- sands native Africans, out of which every sixth died. Neither the prisoners of war in the American Civil War nor the ones of the Boer War were deliberately killed; almost all died of epidemics. The death toll can be compared to that of Dachau (84 % survived) and Buchen- wald (86 % survived). How can anyone trust the Zionists, when they already during the First World War lied about this ma tter? The Zionist propaganda after the First World War claimed that six million Jews had died as a result of famine, epidemics and holocaust. Then shortly after the Second Wo rld War there appeared different versions of the holocaust. Which of these is one supposed to believe? Stefan Szende (Ph. D.), a Swedish Jew of Hungarian descent, wrote in his book \"The Promise Hitler Ke pt\" (New York, 1945), about Belzec concentration camp: \"The trains coming into Belzec loaded with Jews were driven into a tunnel in the underground premises of the execution building. There the Jews descended and had to leave their belongings... Every day trains full of Jews arrived from Germany, Austri a, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland, France, and the Balkans... They were brought into huge halls capable of holding several thousand people. These rooms had no windows, were completely made of metal and had floors that could be lowered. 461"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"The floors of these halls, with thousands of Jews, sank into a water basin, which lay beneath - but only far enough so that the people were not entirely under water. When all the Jews on the metal plate were in the water to over their hips, electrical current was sent through the water. After a few moments, all the Je ws, thousands at once, were dead. Then the metal plate was raised out of the water. On it lay the corpses of the murdered victims. Another shoc k of electrical current was sent through, and the metal plate becam e a crematorium oven, white hot, until all the bodies were burnt to ashes. Huge cranes again lifted the floor and emptied the ashes. The smoke was led out through large factory chimneys. That was the whole procedure. As so on as it was completed, it could start up again. New batches of Jews we re constantly being driven into the tunnels. The individual trains broug ht between 3000 and 5000 Jews at a time, and there were days on which the Belzec line saw between twenty and thirty such trains arrive. Modern technology triumphed in the Nazi system. The problem of how to exterminate millions of people was solved.\" Szende's book was recalled and destroyed, when later the gas chamber version was chosen. Facts about extermination of the Jews was published as early as 1942 in the Zionist-controlled newspaper like The New York Times. The main purpose of this horror propaganda was to emphasize the necessity of establishing a Jewish homeland. The American historian Arthur R. Butz examines in his book \"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century \" (Ladbroke, 1976) how the fraud of the century originated. His conclusion: \"The gas chambers are post- war fantasies.\" In The New York Times various extermination methods, besides the gas chambers, were described. On 7 February 1942, there were tales about \"blood poisoning stations\" in occupied Poland, and on 30 June 1942 about \"a shooting house\", where thousands of Jews were shot every day. These versions were ab andoned already before the end of the war. Then came the steam death chambers that even turned up at the Nuremberg trials. 462"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Here are a few more examples: The Jews were killed in electric ovens... The Jews were murdered with heavy current in electric sho- wers and then turned into soap. This version is from Simon Wiesen- thal... The Jews were killed with quick lime and diesel fumes... At the Belzec trial in 1965 a Germ an court settled for the version where the Jews were killed with Zyklon B, which through a pipe system was brought into the shower rooms. The court thought that after a few weeks one switched to diesel fumes. Apparently it took the stupid SS men a couple of weeks to realize that it was impossible to get the zyklon grains into the pipes. Besides, the SS did the reverse in other camps and went fr om diesel fuels to Zyklon B, all according to the holocaust hysterics... There is, however, no proof for the murder of 600 000 Jews in Belzec - not a single German documen t. No mass graves have been found, nor the ashes after 600 000 murdered and burned to ashes. The gas chambers are nowhere to be found. In January 1995, the French newsmagazine L'Express reported that Auschwitz staff now admitted that the gas chamber known as Krema I had been erected in 1948 by the Polish communist government for benefit of the foreign tourists. Fred Leuchter had already revealed the deception in 1988. There is evidence that all the g as chambers were built after the Second World War by Soviet and Am erican soldiers as well. On the aerial photographs taken by Ameri can reconnaissance planes during the war, no such buildings can be seen. Also in Poland it has been admitted that the gas chambers were built after the war. The allied troops found in Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, and Dachau in addition to piles of dead bodi es and walking skeletons, tens of thousands of seemingly healthy and well-nourished prisoners, of which hardly ever any pictures have been shown. On the other hand, there are plenty of forged photogr aphs, among those paintings pre- sented as photographs.

It was horrible to drag the bodies to huge dikes used as mass graves.\" ( Goteborgs-Posten, 30 July 2000) There was not a word of any gas chambers or any holocaust. These original testimonies are therefore of utmost importance. In 1990, the Soviet Union made th e Auschwitz death lists available to the International Red Cross. They cover the period from August 1941 to December 1943 and contain 66 000 names. The number of victims of typhoid epidemics, measles , old age, and shootings during the years 1935-45 in Auschwitz amounted to 73 137. Of these 38 031 were Jews. The death rate was at its peak in 1942 and 1943. From 1935 to 1945, a total of 403 713 people died in the Nazi con- centration camps {The New York Times, 3 March 1991). Less than half were Jews, since these in many camps only consti- tuted a small minority (in Auschwitz the Jewish part of the prisoners was towards the end almost 80 per cent). West German Chancellor Konrad Ad enauer stated in 1953 that during the Second World War 170 000 Jews succumbed. This infor- mation was given by the West German government's Press and Infor- mation Bureau (Presse- und Info rmationsamt aer Bundesregierung). It is true that commissars, that is communist political propaganda officers, often were liq uidated immediately after their capture. Most of these commissars were Jews. The Jews were also heavily represen- ted in the partisan movement, which is evident from Soviet sources. Several Jews were shot that were neither commissars, partisans nor hostages. They were shot \"just to be sure\". For these mass murders there is no excuse - but it does no t justify all the li es of mass exter- mination in gas chambers.

At the same time the red Czechs took the opportunity to kill almost 40 000 civilian Germans in actions of revenge between 8 and 25 may 1945. The mob also took part in the slaughter. The Americans and the French deliberately let over a million German prisoners of war die of st arvation and diseases. Many were executed without due pr ocess. Hundreds of thousands of Germans were killed by communist mobs shortly after the war. At least one hundred thousand nationalist French were killed by communists after the war. No one has condemned th is mass murder. During the years 1945-1950 as many as nine millio n Germans died because of the Morgenthau Plan, which prescribed a systematic reduction of German industrial production capacity. It wa s a planned mass death. Two high-ranking freemasons, Truman an d Morgenthau, bear the respon- sibility. This was a high price for the Germans to pay, because Jewish Nazi leaders let 170 000 other Jews die during the war in order to frighten the rest to emigrate to Palestine. This plan was approved by Roosevelt and Churchill at their meeting in Quebec, Canada, in August 1943. The masonic leaders counted on that the implementation of the Mo rgenthau Plan would have meant that between 20 and 30 million Germans died. In the 1255 communist concentrat ion camps in Poland, Jewish commissars ravaged like hysterical baboons: they tortured and murdered 80 000 ordinary German s without remorse. The Jewish journalist John Sack described this in his book \"An Eye for an Eye\" (New York, 1993).

But this is physically impossibl e. No sane person would install a crematorium in the same building as a chamber, where people should be killed with an explosive gas. Zyklon B is not highly explosive, but because of the latent explosion risk from the zyklon-satiated bodies, such a procedure would have been suicidal insanity . The gas chamber would have been blown up and th e whole camp gassed, including the SS personnel. In addition, the doors to all \"gas chambers\" open inwards, making it quite impossible for the special command units to enter these chambers full of dead bodies. According to witnesses they also smoked cigarettes in the midst of an explosive gas. In Auschwitz-Birkenau the cremator ia were on the floor above the alleged gas chambers. The only connection between floors was a single elevator. The elevator could take at most four bodies plus the conductor, who thus had to run fi ve hundred times up and down bet- ween the gas chambers and the crematorium and without pause handle zyklon-infested bodies in an environment heavily dosed with Zyklon B gas. It is claimed that about 2000 people were gassed at a time. Zyklon (hydrogen cyanide) is a very poisonous gas that kills even in small amounts when inhaled but also at skin contact. It is claimed that special command units worked without gas mask or protective overalls. If so they would have died within a few minutes. The cremation of a body takes in most modern crematoria one and a half hours and it was no faster in 1944. In six hours 15 ovens could burn only 60 bodies, 1940 out of 2000 would have been left over. Modern crematoria can burn as many as 23 bodies per day and per oven.

The holocaust hysterics do not want to know about the eva- cuations of Soviet Jews that took place after the German invasion and that is proved through Soviet files, and they deny the flight of the majority of Polish Je ws to the Soviet Union. All Jews that the Germans relocated to Russia and that remained there are counted as murdered. The victims of the holocaust also include those Jews that died during Stalin's deportations and those in Soviet labour camps, as well as Jewish Allied soldiers who died in battle or during the emigration to Palestine. In January 1945, Auschwitz prisoner Elie Wiesel was afflicted by a bad foot and was unable to work. He received medial treatment while the Red Army quickly advanced. Th e healthy prisoners were eva- cuated together with the retreating Germans, the sick could stay if they wished. Even though Elie Wiesel and his father were sick, they voluntarily joined the Germans, who according to Wi esel even threw babies and pushed adult Jews into large fire pits. Each and every one of the \"survivors\" claims that he made it through because of a miracle. They are, on the other hand, living proof that there never was any holocaust. The German Federal Republic has paid out more than 120 billion DM to Israel and the Zionist organizations and to individual Jews. Most of the money has been paid as fines for freely invented gas chambers to a state that at the time of the alleged genocide did not even exist.

How is it possible then that of the alleged murder of millions of people in gas chambers there is no proof except witness testimonies and admissions under torture by presumed perpetrators - not a single document, no bodies, no murder weapons, nothing? According to the 1939 census, ther e were over 3 millions Jews in the Soviet Union.

After this conflict the United States was able to dominate the Western Hemisphere and take control of many islands in the Pacific. During the First World War, Pres ident Thomas Woodrow Wilson and his close associate Edward M.

The German government issued warnings in all New York newspapers that anyone crossing the Atlan- tic on the Lusitania did so at his own risk, since the ship was carrying ammunition. The British Admiralty, in a secret memorandum of 10 February 1915, gave instructions on how to camouflage a ship carrying ammunition, making it look like a cargo ship.

This was revealed by George Morgenstern in his book \"Pearl Harbor: The Story of the Secret War\" (Costa Mesa, 1991). In July 1941, Roosevelt also blocked all oil deliveries to Japan. The American blockade was an outright declaration of war (Eric D. Butler, \"The Red Pattern of World Conquest\", Melbourne, 1985, p. 52). The US Secretary of State, the freemason Dean Acheson, was given the mission of inducing the so-called freeze of Japanese trade, which would inevitably have defeated th e country.

This provided a suitable excuse for taking part in the Second World War. J. Edgar Hoover preferred to employ freemasons. Admiral Robert Theobold's book also refers to the secret Japanese messages concerning the planned attack. They were decoded and sent to the White House. President Roosevelt was not concerned that 2237 Americans were killed in connec tion with the Japanese attack. He received the pretext he wanted to start a war, killing even more people. In 1942, more than 110 000 American citizens of Japanese origin were placed in ten concentration camps (among them Manzanar in California), where many of them died.

In order to provoke the Korean War, the masonic Grand Master Harry S. Truman followed the same pa ttern. First, the US forces were deliberately moved out of Korea in mid-1949. According to Professor Bruce Cummings, Secretary of Stat e Dean Acheson made a speech on 12 January 1950 before the National Press Club in Washington, where he made it clear that South Korea was no longer a part of the US sphere of interest in Asia. The British historian Paul Johnson did not understand anything, and thought it ill-considered (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", New York, 1983). Of course, it was a well-considered speech.

The Korean War had begun, the war which the US political leaders had no intention of winning. Five-star General Douglas MacArthur was made supreme comma nder over US and other units fighting under the UN flag. The Chinese communist dictator Ma o Zedong had sent his troops to the Yalu River. When MacArthur ga ve the order to bomb the bridges to prevent the Chinese troops getting across, Truman revoked the order (William T.

Soviet aircraft were also used in the fighting. General MacArthur was far too succ essful in his eagerness to crush the communists. He was able to throw the communists out of South Korea, and intended also to overthr ow the North Korean regime, and to bomb North Korean bases and the Chinese airfields. This did not suit Wall Street. General MacArthur eventually managed to push the communists across the Yalu River back into China. President Harry Truman ordered the US Navy (Seventh Fleet) to prevent Chiang Kaishek from attacking the Chinese mainland. Prior to this, Truman had denied Chiang Kaishek's request to join with his anti-communist troops in the battle against the North Koreans and the Chinese Red Army. \"That there was some leak of inte lligence was evident to everyone.

Even the Soviet-Estonian encyclopaedia admits that Mac-Arthur was discharged because of his intention of extending the war to the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Korean War lasted three years. The Unit ed States lost 37 000 men killed, and 106 000 wounded. The UN lost 14 000 and South Korea 350 000. China, however, lost one million soldiers and North Korea 1 650 000. One in three Amer ican prisoners of war in North Korea died as well. The Korean War gave enormous profits to the US arms industry. Not until 27 June 1953 did the combatants sign a separate peace treaty. The United States was always able to look after \"its\" interests, even if the communists disagreed. Stalin was not happy about Iran, when negotiating with Roosevelt in November-December 1943. He was unwilling to remove his troops from northern Iran. Roosevelt then explained to him that the interests of Washington demanded that the Red Army withdraw from Iran six months after the end of the war. Stalin delayed this until the spring of 1946, when President Truman presented him with an ultimatum, threatening to use force if necessary. In April 1946, Stalin agreed. A similar ultimatum could well have been presented to the Kremlin concerning Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, but Wall Street wished otherwise. If the masonic interests demanded it, various states were \"deli- vered\" to the communists. When the anti-communist General George 484"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Patton, against the will of the Wh ite House, pushed into Czecho- slovakia, Truman was furious and demanded immediate withdrawal of American troops from that country. Patton obeyed the order reluctantly. Large numbers of fright ened Czech intellectuals watched the American troops as they withdr ew before the onslaught of the Red Army. Patton demanded the use of arms against Moscow. He was subsequently murdered in West Germany by an American special agent ( Spotlight, 22 October 1979). The British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery also acted against the will of Truman and Eisenhower by saving Denmark from the Red Army in the spring of 1945. The red resistance movement had already seized control of the coastal town of Bogense. With the tacit support of the Danes and Mo ntgomery, the Germans quickly finished off the reds, and then surrendered to the British on 5 May 1945. On 9 May, the Red Army invade d Bornholm, the large isolated Danish island in the Baltic. The Al lies could no longer deliver Den- mark to Moscow, however. It would have appeared just too strange in the eyes of the public. The Germans intended to move some of their troops to Bornholm and to surrender there to the British. They were unwilling to surrender to the Russians. The Br itish neglected to send anyone to receive the surrender. The Red Army took the opportunity to at least sever Bornholm off from Denmark. In Copenhagen, no one reacted to the distress calls coming from the island. On 7 May 1945, at 12.40 p. m. Soviet planes began bombing Bornholm. The towns were destroyed. In R0nne, 90 % of the houses were damaged. Nex0 suffe red up to 95% damages. Many Danish people were killed. Copenhagen was informed but Danish Radio kept silent about the events on the island. Eventually a journalist managed to get to Swed en on board a fishing boat. From Ystad in southern Sweden, he sent a report to the Danish press about the Soviet terror on Bornholm. On ly after the publication of this report did Danish Radio wake up. 485"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"On 9 May, Soviet troops arrived on Bornholm, where 150 front soldiers immediately began to plu nder, rob and steal. They were particularly keen on watches. They then began to rape the women. The Soviet military leadership es tablished a communist dictatorship. Eventually more than 8000 Soviet soldiers were stationed on the island, drinking and committing acts of violence. A few of the worst vandals were executed, however. The Soviet military, which claimed they had come to defeat the Nazis, had no intention of leaving the island. The local population was concerned, and painted all h ouses black. The islanders were beginning to hate the Soviet Union. On 16 March 1946, the first rumour s were heard that the Russians might leave the island. On 5 April, th e last of the NKVD soldiers left Bornholm. This was the same day that the Soviet troops withdrew from northern Iran. The masoni c elite had second thoughts about Denmark. It later became known that as early as 23 April 1945, a Soviet people's commissar had demanded th at the Red Army be allowed to take Bornholm. On 24 April, orde rs were given that the Bornholm operation should go ahead, and on 4 May the time had come to act. General Ivan Batov let the Danish major Holger Jorgensen copy certain documents, when after many years, he paid a visit to Born- holm. It was Batov's soldiers who had occupied the island. When the Indo-Chinese Communist Party seized power in all of Vietnam in August 1945, the financiers of Wall Street were pleased. The conservative French head of gov ernment, Charles de Gaulle, who felt a certain responsibility towa rds Vietnam as a former French colony, intervened, and in September 1945 he tried to overthrow the communists in the southern part of the country. This irritated the United States that demanded that France interrupt its actions to get rid of the communists in January 1946. France was forced to recognize the \"democratic\" Pe ople's Republic of Vietnam. As the communist terror intensified, the French government ignored Washington and in Decem ber 1946 initiated new attempts at 486"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"overthrowing the communists. The French were so successful that in 1949, the Republic of Vietnam was established in the southern part of the country, ruled by the Emperor Bao Dai. But the French expeditionary units failed to remove the communists from the whole country. The French surr endered in 1954, after the fall of the jungle fortress Dien Bien Phu. In accordance with the Geneva agreement, France was made to withdraw its troops from Vietnam, which was then divided. The freemasons abolished the empire in the south in 1955. The US Saigon Military Mission moved more than one million North Vietnamese to the south in 1954-55. 957 000 were flown to South Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands were persuaded to walk. They lacked food and money and therefore turned into gangs of bandits who stole what they needed, while being susceptible to the red doct- rine, which was created and served to them by the super-capitalists together with their poverty. American \"political expe rts\" called these bandit gangs \"rebellious forces\", who should be fought. This transport operation was related by Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, former head of special operations, on Radio Free America on 13 April 1955. Beginning in 1955, the United States was delivering arms to the Republic of Vietnam in order to \"s top\" the spread of communism in Asia, according to the programme signed by President Truman in 1950. The freemasons wanted to begi n to fight against problems they themselves had caused. They wanted war in Vietnam. In 1961, communist activities inte nsified. The United States sent 300 military advisers to Vietnam. The year after, they sent 10 000. On 20 December 1960, the communists founded the FLN (the National Liberation Force). Their aim was to ta ke back the territory lost to the French. The Soviet Union gave them all conceivable assistance. Communist aggression against the Republic of Vietnam began in August 1964. A day or so later, a gigantic fraud was enacted in the Bay of Bac Bo, aimed at giving th e United States a reason for ente- ring the war (the Gulf of Tonkin incident). The American destroyer Maddox opened fire on a stormy and empty sea, with no enemy ships 487"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"in sight. The next day, the plan was to retaliate against North Viet- nam, even though the destroyers never suffered an enemy attack. This was told by the fighter pilot Jim Stockdale, who was present at the time. As early as 7 August 1964, President Lyndon Johnson got the authority from Congress to use American troops against the commu- nist attack. In March 1965, American troops landed in South Viet- nam. In the autumn of 1965, the United States involved other countries in the conflict. In spite of an ever-increasing American presence, the communists kept pressing further south. At the end of 1968, 543 000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam. According to the Soviet-Estonian encyclopaedia, Soviet support to the communists in the north covered 70 % of the cost of war. In 1973, Moscow announced that this was not due for repayment. The United States merely intended to extend the conflict, and US played a foul game. Robert McNama ra (CFR), Kennedy's secretary of defense at the beginning of the Vietnam War and later head of the World Bank, openly admitted that the United States never really tried to win the war. It was a disaster for millions of people. When the communists seized Saigon, the Secretary General of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Le Duan, said that the standard of living in South Vietnam must be lowered. He stressed that the people in the south had \"achieved a standard of living too high for the country's economy\". This would mean the opposite of a happy and civilized life. In January 1977, there were already 200 000 political prisoners in Vietnam (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", New York, 1983). On 18 March 1969, pressurized by President Richard Nixon's Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, the United States launched an attack on Cambodia with B-52 bombers from high altitude in order to \"demolish the NLF bases\" there. Each of the planes dropped some thirty tons of bombs. The intensive bombing went on for fourteen months. More sporadic attacks continued until 15 August 1973, when 488"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"the US Congress pushed through a stop. In total, 540 000 tons of bombs were dropped on Cambodia. In his book \"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\" (2001), the journalist Christopher Hitchens presents evidence that Kissinger is liable to prosecution for the instig ation of murder in Santiago (Chile), Nicosia (Cyprus), and Washington D.C., war crimes in Vietnam, the bombing of Cambodia, massacres in Banglad esh in 1971 and as well as geno- cide in East Timor in 1975. This has not yet been done. Prince Norodom Sihanouk was no longer able to control the situation in Cambodia, where many areas had become effective bases for the communists. General Lon Nol subsequently carried out a coup d'etat, overthrowing Prince Sihanouk with the help of the CIA on 18 March 1970. In April of that year American and South Vietnamese troops were let into Cambodia to \"save the country from commu- nism\". In this way, Lon Nol, w ho had appointed himself \"marshal\", forced \"the Khmer Republic\" into the war in Indo-China. Close to two million peasants fled to the capi tal, which already had one million inhabitants. The Finnish investig ating commission estimated that American warfare in Cambodia had cost the lives of at least 600 000 people. In May 1970, American troops entered Laos as well. The American military equipment for Lon Nol's regime was insured by the national Soviet insurance agency (Gostrakh), according to Chinese sources (\"Soviet Foreign Polic y: Social Imperialism\", Chinese Embassy, Helsinki, 1977, p. 10). The same source states that Czecho- slovakia manufactured arms for Lon Nol in a factory inside Cambodia. At the same time, Peking supported the Red Khmer, while Moscow stood behind the Vietnamese red terrorists, who according to Gary Allen, also received arms from the United States. Soon, many of Lon Nol's supporters realized that they had been shamelessly used, and joined the democratic movement behind Sihanouk. Thus the communist Pol Pot Kmae-kroh movement was helped to power on 17 April 1975, indirectly by the United States and directly by China. Pol Pot (actually Saloth Sar) renamed the country Kampuchea (the original name Cambodia was taken back 489"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"after the fall of the communist regime in 1989). This was the beginning of an unequalled reign of terror. On the Thai border were 6000 men belonging to the khmer-serei guerrilla, which represented democracy. They did not receive any aid from the United States. On the other hand, 25 000 Red Khmer terrorists continuously and secretly received Western aid, according to a British documentary, \"Cambodia the Year Zero\", by the Australian journalist John Pilger. Between 1975 and 1979, some two million people were killed in Kampuchea (of a population of eight million), under the motto of Pol Pot: \"Keep them - no gain. Extermin ate them - no loss. We will burn away the old grass, so the new will grow.\" The operation had been planned two years before by a group of ideologists belonging to the political lodge Angka Loeu (The Higher Organization). Their aim was to implement all communist Chinese principles at once (in China itself it took 25 years). Everything from the past was to be destroyed and annihilated. Angka Loeu consisted of a score of intellectuals (teachers and bureaucrats). Of the eight leaders (Khieu Samphan, May Mann, Ieng Sary, Nuon Chea, Son Sen, Pol Pot and others), five were teachers, one a university professor, one an economist and one a bureaucrat, according to Paul Johnson. All had studied in France in th e early 1950s, and there become members of the French Communist Party and freemasons, learning from the leaders of the Martinist Order that the use of violence was good for society, a \"truth\" eagerl y propagated by the radical left- wing freemasons. Kenneth Quinn, of the US State Department, had received infor- mation about the plans of Angka Loeu, and wrote a report about the planned mass murder, dated 20 February 1974 (\"Political Change in Wartime: The Khmer Krahom Revolu tion in Southern Cambodia 1970- 74\", American Science Association, 4 September 1975). The plan stated that \"individual members of society must be mentally re- constructed\" and that \"the traditional foundations, structures and forces, which have shaped and governed the life of an individual must be torn down, using terror and other means\". After this, the 490"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"individual would be \"rebuilt in accordance to party doctrine, replacing old values with new ones\". This reeks of freemasonry. The American leadership did not intend to interfere with such a plan. One does not to disturb one's masonic br others when they follow inter- national instructions. The carnage in Cambodia began on 17 April 1975, when the Red Khmer, young indoctrinated peasan t soldiers entered the capital Pnomh Penh, the home of three million people. The violence began at 7 a. m. with attacks on Chinese shops. The first murders were committed at 8. 45. At 10 a. m., th e soldiers opened fire on everyone they saw in the streets, in order to cause panic, so that everyone fled the city. All hospitals were evacuated. Rockets were fired towards any house showing signs of movement. In the evening, the water was turned off. No officers were in sight. The intellectual freemasons who had planned these evil deeds, to build a society without cities or money, did not appear. The Red Khmer took the women and small children to the killing fields. All ties of friendship were banned. Only dark clothes were allowed, brightly coloured clothes were re garded as expressions of indivi- dualism. This was typical of the masonic humanism that spread from France to other parts of the world. The lead ers of the Revolution (all free- masons) had declared, in 1793: \"We will rather turn all of France into a graveyard than fail.\" (Guy Lenotre, \"The Mass Drownings in Nan- tes\", Stockholm, 1913, p. 157) Compassion with the victims was regarded as criminal ( ibid, p. 153). The masonic leaders wanted to be rid of the royalists and the enemies of the people, whom they regar- ded as \"superfluous mouths\". Among the victims were women and children. The mass drownings in the Loire River were called \"floods\", and were organized by the Common Welfare Committee (13 members, all freemasons). The Red Khmer had learned much from this \"revolutionary\" terror imposed on the French by Jewish freemasons. 491"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"In April 1976, the leader of An gka Loeu, Khieu Samphan, became head of state and was replaced as chief of government by another fanatic middle class \"revolutionary\", Pol Pot. Pol Pot often had his victims buried alive. He gave orders to torture 20 000 women and children to death. In all, 90% of the intel- lectuals were murdered. The Red Khmer even assaulted villages in the neighbouring countries. On 28 Janua ry 1977, the Red Khmer killed the inhabitants of three Thai villages, before burning their houses, according to a Reader's Digest article of January 1979. Khieu Samphan admitted to an It alian journalist in August 1976, that one million \"war criminals\" had died, according to Paul Johnson. In a quick invasion the Vietnam ese forces defeated Pol Pot, and occupied Kampuchea on 25 December 1978. On 7 January 1979, a new regime was installed under Heng Samrin, who received Soviet aid (with the help of the United Stat es). On 11 January the People's Republic of Kampuchea was proclaimed. The Red Khmer continued to receive aid from the West. During the following years, Pol Pot was still su pported by the United States and China as well as their allies, among them Thatcher's Great Britain. Although the Red Khmer had ceased to exist in January 1979, its members were still allowed to represent Cambodia in the UN. In 1981, the high-ranking freemason Zbigniew Brzezinski, Presi- dent Carter's national security adviser, declared: \"I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot.\" He admitted that the United States \"tur- ned a blind eye\" to the fact that China sent arms to the Red Khmer via Thailand (John Pilger's article \"They Supported a Mass Mur- derer\"). This was the same Brzezinski, who in 1979 had openly admitted that \"the world is changing under the influence of forces ungover- nable by any government\", according to Paul Johnson. Pol Pot's activities in exile had been secretly financed by the United States since January 1980. The extent of this aid - 85 million dollars between 1980 and 1986 - was shown by a letter to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Re lations. The CIA ensured that 492"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"humanitarian aid went to the Red Khmer bases. Two American aid workers, Linda Mason and Roger Brown, later reported: \"The US government insisted that the Re d Khmer should receive food...\" (John Pilger) Following American pressure, the World Food Program sent food valued at 12 million dollars to the Thai army, to be delivered to the Red Khmer. \"Between 20 000 and 40 000 of the Red Khmer soldiers received this aid\", according to Richard Holbrook e, who was an assistant secretary of state at the time. The food convoys were paid for by the Western governments. The senior officer of the Red Khmer prison camp was the notorious mass murderer Nam Phann (the right hand of Pol Pot), known to the aid workers as the Butcher. The former Deputy Director of the CIA, Ray Cline, paid a secret visit to the Red Khmer operative he adquarters. Cline was at the time President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser. Until 1989, Britain's role in Cambodia remained secret. Simon O'Dwyer-Russell, foreign correspondent of The Sunday Telegraph, revealed then that British SAS un its trained Pol Pot's units. They were all veterans of the Falklands War, commanded by a captain. Later on, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that this kind of training had been taking place at secret bases in Thailand for more than four years. Pol Pot was assured by his masonic masters that he would never have to face charges of crimes ag ainst humanity. This promise was officially made in 1990. The UN presented a \"peace plan\", in which all mention of genocide had been omitted. The UN Commission on Human Rights voted down a resolution dealing with \"atrocities of a genoci dal character, committed in parti- cular when the Red Khmer were in power\". The prime movers behind this concession were the United States and China. The UN com- mission decided that its member states no longer would \"trace, arrest, deliver or prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity in Kampuchea\". Governments were no longer under 493"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"obligation to \"prevent those responsi ble for acts of genocide in 1975- 78 to return to power\". This is not what they say of the Nazis. The Peking gangster regime, together with the US and British governments, supported Pol Pot's so ldiers and supplied them with modern arms, which enabled them to execute their raids of terror into the country from neighbouring Thailand. On 25 June 1991, the British government finally admitted that the SAS had secretly trained Pol Pot' s \"resistance movement\" since 1983. The Guardian wrote that \"the SAS training was a criminally irresponsible and cynical political act\". When the Red Khmer were welcomed back to Phnom Penh by UN officials, the Australian general John Sanderson, in a filmed inter- view, refused to condemn the Red Khmer as responsible for the genocide. A Cambodian lawyer pointed out: \"All foreigners who have been involved must be put on trial... Madeleine Albright, Margaret Thatcher, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush.\" His ambition was to prosecu te them and make them explain to the world why they had supported the Red Khmer. But that is not likely to happen. In 1998, Khieu Samphan asked his countrymen to forget the past to enable the country to look fo rward. The Western masonic leaders would also feel better, if Cambodia failed to come to terms with its past. CIA used the confusion around the Vietnam War as a cover for large-scale drug trafficking whol esale from the so-called golden triangle. This was revealed by Professor Alfred W. McCoy in his thorough investigation, \"The Politic s of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade\" (New York, 1991). The drugs were sent to the United States inside the bodies of dead soldiers. Meanwhile, Wall Street had decided that all of Vietnam should be delivered to the communists. This intention was announced by Presi- dent Richard Nixon on 22 January 1969. He called it \"vietnami- zation\" of the war. In August 1969, the United States began to 494"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"withdraw its troops, while Wall Street at the same time increased its aid to the communists, who were us ing Cambodia and Laos as their bases. Laos was in the hands of the communist Pathet Lao. On 29 March 1973, the US brought its last troops home from Vietnam, and in April 1973 all of Vietnam was communist. A dreadful reign of terror began, which the Western press has kept quiet about. With the help of Moscow, communist Pathet Lao took all of Laos in June 1975. On 2 December 1975, Laos was declared a people's demo- cratic republic, ruled by \"proletarian dictatorship\". Soviet sources (among them the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia) admitted that the Vietnam War was a \"collision between two diffe- rent world systems\". This was exactly what Wall Street had in mind. In Vietnam, 58 022 Americans died, while 300 000 were wounded and 2300 went missing. In addition, two million Vietnamese died, and 554 000 boat refugees invaded the ne ighbouring countries. The cost of the war was at least 150 billion dollars. Due to its useless economic system, Vietnam began a national programme of growing and selling opium to pay its debts to the American banks. This was revealed by a defected politburo member, Hoang Van Hoan, with the help of classified documents. In 1984, Vietnam's foreign debt ran to 3 billion dollars (Wall Street Journal, 8 March 1984). Mao Zedong also delive red drugs to the Mafia in the United States (Asian Outlook, Taipei, January 1973, p. 13). On 14 July 1958, the masonic soci alists, headed by General Abdul Karim Kassem, seized power in Iraq. King Faisal II was brutally exe- cuted. Iraq became a masonic repub lic, even though the lodges were closed. The Iraqi socialist dictator Saddam Hussein, who had come to power in July 1979 and started to execute freemasons, did not march into Kuwait, a former Iraqi provin ce, on his own initiative in 1990. It was the American Ambassador to Ba ghdad, April Glaspie, who on 25 July 1990 tricked Saddam Hussein into believing that the Kuwait issue was not vital to America, if he wanted to take the northern part of Kuwait. Saddam Hussein trusted the Americans, since Presi- 495"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"dent Ronald Reagan's administration had secretly supplied Iraq with information and arms during the wa r against Iran. The United States initiated a decisive aid programme to Iraq in 1982, after American intelligence had announced that there was considerable risk that Iraq would be defeated by Iran. Via Egyp t, the Iraqis received tanks, heli- copters, and equipment for their nu clear energy programme and sub- stances for the producti on of biological weapons (Newsweek, 23 September 2002). Eventually, the United States blew up Iran's oilrigs, attacked its patrol boats, and even killed 290 Iranians by shooting down an Iranian passenger plane. A few weeks later, Iran ceased all hostilities. Teheran was afraid of an American attack. It was Rockefeller who had encour aged Iraq to wage war on Iran. The Iran-Iraq War went on from 1980 to 1988, and cost more than 650 000 lives. Iraq lost 150 000 soldiers, Iran lost 500 000. On 31 July 1990, Assistant Secret ary of State for Near Eastern affairs, John Kelly, testified to C ongress: \"The United States has no commitment to defend Kuwait and th e US has no intention of defending Kuwait, if it is attacked by Iraq.\" Eight days after April Glaspie's conversation with Saddam Hussein, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi troops invaded and occupied Kuwait. Trans- cripts of the meeting was published on 1 October 1990 in Time Maga- zine. This was followed by the secretary of state's fit of rage against April Glaspie. But it was too late . No one took the State Department denial seriously. In March 1991, April Glaspie was questioned by the Senate Com- mittee on Foreign Relations, where she admitted that the conver- sation with Saddam Hussein had really taken place. The United States used similar tactics to set a trap for the Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The American ambassador, as well as the British and Soviet am- bassadors, left Kuwait two days before the attack.

The aim of the United States was for Saddam Hussein to kill 300 000 Arabs living in the delta marshes of southern Iraq, who were in the way of the oil companies. The United States tried to involve the UN in a military inter- vention to liberate the emirate, thereby increasing the pressure on Saddam Hussein, but they were met with initial resistance against Operation Desert Storm. The atmosphere changed, however, in Octo- ber 1990, when a Kuwaiti nurse and a surgeon from Kuwait City, in tears before a human ri ghts commission, told of how the Iraqi bar- barians had gone berserk in the hospitals of the occupied capital. They had crushed the incubators, throwing the newborn babies on the floor and letting them die there. The tale caused indignation all over the world and made a decisive contribution to the cause of those promoting a military intervention against Iraq. The lies were exposed in March 1992. The story about the incu- bator killings had been invented by an advertising agency in New York, which had received 20 million dollars from the exiled emir of Kuwait. The man who had testified was not a surgeon, and the \"re- fugee girl\" was the daughter of a Kuwaiti diplomat. Both had been made to practise their \"eye witness statements\" for days, and had received English tuition specifically for that purpose. Operation Desert Storm cost one billion dollars a day. The allies, led by the United States, killed so me 500 000 Iraqi soldiers, accor- ding to former Attorney General, Ramsey Clark. He admitted in Stockholm on 5 December 1991, that the allies had annihilated an entire Iraqi division moving north after the ceasefire of 26 February 1991. Thousands of soldiers were buried, alive or dead, in the trenches. According to the rules of war, wounded enemy soldiers must be given medical treatment.

The water supply system was destroyed. Although th ere were pictures taken of the 150 000 charred bodies of Iraqi soldiers, it was never shown on tele- vision. Civilian casualties were estima ted at more than 25 000 during the bombing war, but that number was multiplied later due to the sanctions. 250 000 Iraqi children under five years of age had died by August 1991. By May 2000, half a million Iraqi children had died, according to Hans von Sponeck, senior UN official in Iraq in 2000. His job was to carry out the punishment of millions of innocent people. According to the Australian journalist John Pilger, American and British aircraft have bombed Iraq on an almost daily basis for the period 1997-2001. The press has ignored this, except when President George W. Bush bombed Iraq on 16 February 2001. During the summer and autumn of 2002, George W. Bush began to prepare a new attack on Iraq, aimed at \"overthrowing\" Saddam Hus- sein. His real intention, however, was to destroy OPEC and take over control of oil prices and the main oil fields. George W. Bush has personal interests in oil production. The intention of the United States is to create chaos in the Mi ddle East, according to Mo Mowlan, Tony Blair's former secretary for Northern Ireland, as reported in The Guardian. She claims that the idea of Iraq being a threat to world peace is a fabrication. The ulterior aims are entirely different, pur- sued under the pretext of the so-called war on terrorism.

I mean, that is more chil dren than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?\" Albright replied: \"I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.\" In this situation, refugees appe ared who were to destabilize the Western world under the label 'the multi-cultural society'.

At first, the British Ministry of Defence denied this ou trage, but presented with the evi- dence they claimed that NATO has a right to defend itself. Pre- sumably the children and their sheep constituted a serious threat to NATO and EU. Almost half the vict ims of the Iraqi bombings have been civilians. In the war against Iraq, depleted uranium was officially used for the first time in armour-breaking missiles. These caused radiation injuries in the American soldiers as well. A group of specialists, who examined 17 war veterans, were able to show that two thirds of them had uranium in the urine as well as in the bones. 67 per cent of the children born to 251 Am erican veteran families after the Kuwaiti war were deformed in various ways: they lacked eyes or ears, their fingers had grown together, or they had breathing problems. When a projectile containing uranium explodes, intense heat is emitted, and a large portion of the ur anium is pulverised. That is the dust that American and British - as well as Iraqi - soldiers inhaled. But depleted uranium does not contain U 236. Depleted uranium is a low-grade radioactive heavy metal (2.5 times heavier than steel) obtained as a by-product when enriching uranium 235. French scientists drew another conclusion - these missiles must have contained atomic waste (uranium 238), which is more highly radioactive. A one-day exposure corresponds to a yearly dose. This type of uranium causes a slow death of cancer, incurable kidney damage and immune deficiency diseases. This explains why Pentagon and NATO have issued threats against those scientists who came too close to the truth.

The lead contained in the warheads of target-seeking missiles was replaced with uranium 238 to incr ease their density and thus their mass. Penetrating power is thereby increased when the missile hits a tank. Uranium 238 is a by-product obtained when enriching nuclear fuel. Eric Hopkins stated in The New York Times on 21 January 1993, that the United States had pollut ed Iraq and Kuwait with more than 40 tons of uranium. He stressed that the Iraqi troops did not have access to such a substance. Almost half the country is polluted with radioactive dust, and large areas of arable land are destroyed. Pentagon claims that depleted uranium has a very low radiation effect. But when the United States tested this inhumane weapon in New Mexico, the military feared that the groundwater would be polluted. Not until July 2002 did it become known that the Americans had polluted Iraq with close to 800 tons of depleted uranium (that is atomic waste). Andres Brahme, professor of medi cal radiation physics at Karo- linska Institutet, Stockholm, afte r the war visited hospitals in southern Iraq with children with very severe deformities, such as only one eye in the middle of the forehead. He believed the defor- mities were caused by s ubstances in the depleted uranium, which had spread as clouds of dust after the explosion. The Americans and the British also used the devastating FAE (Fuel/Air Explosive) bombs against Iraqi troops. These bombs of 1000 kilos contain an ethylene-oxide aerosol and cause a tremendous overpressure (roughly 70 atm.), destroying virtually everything within an area of 5000 square me tres. There are also 7500 kg FAE bombs.

On 13 February 1991, George Bush admonished: \"The military and the Iraqi people can take it into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein to resign, so that Iraq can join the peace-loving nations. We have no dispute with the Iraqi people...\" This provocation was as false as that which, via The Voice of America, was aimed at Hungary in the autumn of 1956. Then also an oppressed people were given false hope of an American intervention. President Bush encouraged the Kurds to revolt. The Shiite Muslims believed that Bush's provocation was a serious token of US support and began revolting in southern Iraq. Following this, General Norman Schwartzkopf gave the Iraqi army a free hand to drown the Shiite rebellion in blood. The United States could not allow Saddam Hussein to fall. The ITV documentary showed an inte rview with Laurie Mylroie, one of the leading analysts in Washington, who had seen transcripts of the ceasefire negotiations. According to Mylroie, on 26 March the United States made a decision intended as a signal to Saddam Hus- sein to crush the rebellion. General Schwartzkopf encouraged the Iraqi army to use helicopters. The sa me day, the United States made clear that Iraqi helicopters would not be shot down, even when flying over allied troops. From Washington it was explained to Schwartzkopf that the helicopters we re taking part in an operation aimed at overthrowing Saddam Hussein. Of course, no such thing was to happen.

Houses and cr ops were bombed with napalm and incendiary bombs. Those who survived were forced to leave. Thanks to US encouragement, Saddam Hu ssein managed to kill seven per cent of the local population. No one condemned this mass murder. The documentary showed a little girl saying that US and Britain regard those who kill people as murderers. She asked: \"Saddam killed my father. Why is he not seen as a criminal?\" It was revealed that the so-called blockade was a fraud, since Iraq rebuilt 80% of its arms industry wi th foreign aid. Saddam Hussein's position was strengthened by the sanctions. The US State Department refused to answer the reporter Michael Woods about its Iraqi policy. At the end of the documentary, the real motive behind the mass murder was exposed. The French companies ELF and Total and other international corporations, intended to begin extracting oil in the area after getting rid of the marshland Arabs and draining the area. Any Arabs who tried to remain there were to be killed. The masonic psychopaths thrive on the suffering of others. The Kuwaiti government subsequently gave former president George H. Bush and his sons Neil and Marvin \"fat\" deals. In his book \"Two Faces of George Bush\" (Dresden, N. Y., 1988), Antony C.

Scott Ritter, an American Marine and arms inspector who had worked for Unscom since its inception in 1991, claimed in an interview with The New York Post (December 1998) that the round of inspections in Iraq only had one purpose - provoking a new war. In other words, Richard Butler's report on Iraq was a bluff. President Bill Clinton wanted an excuse to launch an attack.

The American oil company Conoco pl ayed a decisive role in con- nection with this. In exchange fo r military support, Aidid agreed to give Conoco monopoly to the oil pros pecting. Later, the Hawale clan leader Ali Mahdi signed a \"preliminary agreement\" with Conoco that once again was given prospecting rights after the war. It was then decided to get rid of Aidid, who was presented by the propaganda as the devil incarnate. Conoco belongs to the masonic family DuPont, who took part in the financing of the Soviet Union as well as Nazi Germany. The assets of Eleuthere and Samuel DuPont increased from 83 million dollars to 308 million dollars during the First World War. The editor-in-chief of the It alian financial newspaper Il Globo-Oro 12, Enzo Garretti, revealed that behind the Somali operation were, except for the oil magnates, also the finance companies Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers (the la tter has also lent money to the Swedish government). Garretti wrote: \"The shadow of Wall Street lies over Somalia.\" The same shadow also lies over the European Union. It is at the same time the shadow of freemasonry, since Wall Street has always served the interests of internati onal freemasonry, which among other things dictates a drastic reduction in world population. For this very reason, hundreds of armed conflicts have been stirred up after the Second World War.

These short wars took place (8 Octobe r 1912 - 30 May 1913) between the Balkan Union and Turkey. From 29 June to 10 August 1913, Bulgaria fought against Serbia, Greece, Mont enegro, Romania, and Turkey. Bulgaria lost a large part of its territory in the war. The Illuminati member Alexander Parvus (Israel Helphand) acted during the Balkan wars of 1912-1 913 from Saloniki in Greece as financial adviser to both the Turkish and Bulgarian governments. He came into contact with the powerful masonic organization in Saloniki, a city with 70 per cent Jewish population. His arms deals made him immensely rich. The main force behind him was Count Giu- seppe Volpi di Misurata, who he lped Parvus in his business and masonic contacts. Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia united to form a new kingdom on 1 December 1918. Later, during the Second World War, British agents helped overthrow the Yugoslav government led by Dragisa Cvetkovic, on 27 March 1941. The Serbian King Peter II fled, ironically, to London. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia had been crushed. The new leadership, headed by the freemason and General (head of the Air Force) Richard D. Simovic, at once initiated co-operation with Stalin by signing a Friendship Tr eaty as early as 5 April 1941. During the entire the Second World War, London heavily supported Tito, later helping him to power with Churchill playing a key role. Tito's closest associate was the Jewish fr eemason Mosa Pijade. According to Zivadin Simic, one of the leaders of the secret police, Tito was also a freemason. After the war, Tito rece ived an enormous amount of aid (150 million dollars) from the West ern countries in order to establish communism. Without this aid, Tito 's regime would have fallen. Meanwhile his crimes were kept secret. The United States alone secretly contributed 35 billion do llars between 1948 and 1965. This was revealed by an expert on in ternational law, Professor Smilja Avramov, in an interview with the Serbian newspaper Politika Ekspres (16 January 1989).

The contri- butions from Western private bankers were an even better kept secret. The British freemasons, and above all the Illuminati, one of whose fronts was the British Institute of International Affairs, also helped the Albanian communists to power, giving them all conceivable mili- tary assistance. In 1990, the freemasons began to act to force Serbia closer to the EU by making this self-supporting c ountry entirely dependent on the outside world. This stubborn, indepe ndent people were to be forced into submission through a war, according to Illuminati procedure. In May 1991, the US State Department began to organize disturbances in the Balkans. The United States stopped all aid to Yugoslavia, a measure that also hit all the separate republics, and vetoed continuing the IMF loans. A promised credit of 1.1 billion dollars was frozen, and with that all the expected foreign loans of a total of 3.5 billion dollars, which were tied to the IMF loans. This was a move typical of inter- national freemasonry. One creates problems only to offer one's own \"excellent solutions\". In one single blow, George Bush administration threw Yugoslavia into a vortex of tota l economic breakdown with dramatic conse- quences for the entire region. As early as 1989, Yugoslav inflation was over 250 per cent ( Hamburger Abendblatt, 27 January 1989). In June 1991, on a brief visit to Belgrade, the US Secretary of State and freemason James Baker assure d the Yugoslav President Slo- bodan Milosevic that the United States was \"in favour of Yugoslav territorial integrity\", whose disintegration actually had been accele- rated by the American decision to stop all credits.

Under these circumstances, and because of the exaggerated Ser- bian show of force, Croatia and Slovenia, which had until a few months previously been willing to remain in a loose federation of Yugoslav republics - with a common economy, a customs union and a common defence in case of military aggression - decided to declare independence. Milosevic interpreted Baker's statement as a green light from the United States for him to use arms if necessary against Slovenia and Croatia. President Bill Clinton and the Br itish and French governments acted consistently as freemasons: they implemented a total destabili- sation of the region and all of Europe. It was said in the Croatian pre ss that all the trouble in Yugoslavia had been planned by Lawrence S. Ea gelburger, an assistant secretary of state in President George Bush's administration, by Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis (a fo rmer prime minister); and by Hans van der Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, who afterwards became a leading official of the European Un ion. All of them were freemasons. De Michelis was a member of the masonic P2 lodge. In 1995, he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The United States, Germany and Israel were secretly flying in arms to Croatia and Bosnia from the beginning of the war. Maintenance and transport were planned and ex ecuted by American forces, units of the French Foreign Legion and UN troops in Sarajevo. Britain has always been behind the events in the Balkans. Before the Balkan wars, British agents carried on underground activities wearing the innocuous masks of press correspondents. Umberto Pascal explained in the Executive Intel ligence Review (2 July 1993, No. 26, p. 30) that the Balkan crisis in the early 1990s was controlled by British freemason ry, which secretly supported the Serbs while inciting a confrontation between Serbian Muslims and Croatians, thus preventing them from finding their own solutions. 506"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"On 16 July 1993, the Croatian newspaper Danas exposed the insi- dious role of the British in the Bo snian conflict.

They claime d to be volunteers in the Croa- tian battle against the Serbs. On closer examination by the police, the group leader tried to stop the investigation by offering bribes. The mercenaries were ordered to leave the country. The BBC turned the event into a scandal, which received great attention in Croatia. A few months later the TV-station Sky News broadcast a docu- mentary about the British mercenar y Norry Phillips, who a couple of years earlier, had gone to Croatia to train their soldiers. At the same time he sold arms to the Muslims, and did everything in his power to make the troops under him fight against them. Other British military \"instructors\" were also instigating fights between Croatians and Muslims. When the fighting started in Mostar between Croatians and Muslims, Norry Phillips went over to the Muslim side. The British were often in comma nd of these fighting units, which never took part in a single action against the Serbs. These British \"instructors\" were controlled by MI 6, the foreign section of the British intelligence service, which in turn is controlled by British freemasonry. The MI 6 emblem features a triangle with the all-seeing eye on top. The freemason Lord Owen, the \"mediator\" in the Bosnian conflict, did everything he could to prevent punitive measures against Serbia at the beginning of the conflict. British journalists were quick to cable out the first pictures of massacred people but \"forgot\" to inform the press that both the Croatian and the Moslem perpetrators were led by British agents. In addition, the reports were exaggerated. Under the communist rule of Tito, Albanian Serbs were harassed in Kosovo.

S ecret masonic actions drove the Serbs into a new war, and indescrib able misery, by allowing the CIA agent Osama bin Laden (agent name Tim Osman) to incite another extensive confrontation, this time in Kosovo. Members of the Kosovo Liberati on Army, KLA, locally known as U?

The Washington Times reported that members of former Mujahedin in Afghanistan were recruite d to fight for the KLA, were controlled by CIA. It was the US government that supplied the Albanian terrorists (KLA) with arms. The Jewish US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (B'nai B'rith) said to the KLA: \"If we get the black and white situation we need, you get ar ms. Otherwise, you get none.\" Various actions against Serbia were also organized by US Secretary of Treasury Robert E.

Officially, th e aim was to make Kosovo inde- pendent. President Bill Clinton pl anned the bombing of Serbia as early as August 1998. Th e Bilderberger group held a meeting in Por- tugal on 3-6 June 1999, where Kosovo was very thoroughly dis- cussed, according to a statement by Carl Bildt at a public meeting in Stockholm, held shortly befo re the EU election in 1999. Tearing Kosovo away from Serbia served the interests of the world elite. During the Second World War, these powers totally ignored the Baltic States. The British masonic-controlled World Review in June 1942 published an interview with the British Ambassador to Moscow, Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, by Edward Hulton. The Marxist freemason stated: \"The Baltic States - Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia - must belong to the Soviet Union. They have for a l ong period of time been an inseparable part of the tsardom without anyone ever thinking it would be wrong for them to belong to tsarist Russia.\" If they really had wanted to get rid of President Milosevic, the freemasons would have tried to eliminate him. But they had other plans. They wished to destroy nationalist Serbia. According to Kjell Magnusson, political scientist at Uppsala Uni- versity, the Rambouillet Peace Ag reement (dated 23 February 1999) was a manipulation. He wrote: \"Appendix B stipulates that Serbia shall not only withdraw from the province of Kosovo, which will be placed under NATO control, but Serbia shall also relinquish sovereignty of its entire territory.\" In other words, NATO wanted bases inside Serbia, something that Milosevic could not allow.

It was an impossible ag reement. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright assumed that neither Yugoslavia nor Russia would sign anything containing these de mands. She got the pretext she needed, that is the black and white situation she was after. As early as 23-25 April 1999, Tony Blair, Robin Cook, and James Robertson wished to push through a decision to use ground forces against Serbia. They failed. Pentagon had already ordered 9000 Purple Hearts from Craco Industries in Texas ( New York Post, 28 May 1999). In a speech on 5 May 1999 Romano Prodi, president of the Euro- pean Commission, stressed that the EU had to have their own military force for use in this kind of situation. In November 2000, the media reported that the EU force of more than 100 000 men would be established in 2003. NATO began bombing Serbia on 24 March 1999 (also a symbolic date: exactly 66 years earlier, on 24 March 1933, the Jewish masonic leaders had declared war on Germany in the Daily Express and other newspapers worldwide), and they continued until 10 June. It turned into an unequalled disaster. More than 20 000 civilians died. NATO aircraft dropped ten tons of bombs containing uranium on Kosovo, as well as eight other areas in Serbia and Montenegro, as reported by Radojko Pavlovic of the Natural Science Institute in Belgrade. NATO denied the charges at first. But the evidence is clear: NATO used illegal ammunition, radioactive waste (U 238). This constitutes a crime against humanity. British Prime Minister Tony Blair was in part responsible for this war crime.

More missiles containing uranium may have been used. Unless the bombed areas are cleaned up, it will take 4. 5 million years before the uranium is safe. The British pilots showed their cynicism by writing \"Happy Easter\" on the bombs dropped on Easter Night. The banned splinter bombs were also referred to as \"peace bombs\". Russia, meanwhile, was not permitted to sell effective anti-aircraft missiles to Serbia. The freemasons hid thei r terrible crimes by claiming that NATO protects the interests of the smalle r nations. But the EU turned has out to be an organization of war, far from the peace project announ- ced by the insidious propaganda. The bombing war cost a total of 10 billion euros and was aimed at the entire Serbian economy and infrastructure. It was also a military failure, since only relatively unimpor tant targets were destroyed, according to U.S. News and World Report. No more than 26 destroyed tanks were found (the propaganda figure is 449). This may, however, have been the purpose, since it was only a political crime. According to the freemason George Soros, the bombing of Serbia annihilated the national boundaries of Eastern Europe (Financial Times, 8 July 1999). The country was made even more dependent on the criminal economy run by various rivalling gangs, which are in turn controlled by the Sicilian Mafia.

NATO ran out of bombs, and the war on Serbia came to an end. Afterwards, NATO yielded on all points in order to appear victorious. The Serbian army was given a few extra days to withdraw from Kosovo, which was allowed to remain part of Yugoslavia. But the KLA was initially allowed to keep their weapons, in breach of the agree- ment. After the arrival of the KFOR \"peac e-keeping\" forces, the Albanian terrorists ruined more than 50 Serbian Orthodox churches. As a result of the NATO's strategy , the entire region was destabi- lized. The Balkan war also lined the pockets of those who stole enormous amounts from the EU and NATO funds to pursue pyramid games in the stock exchanges of the world. In September 2000, Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Javier Solana (all members of the Bilderberg group) were symbolically put on trial in Belgrade charged with crimes against humanity. On 21 September 2000, the verdict was passed: Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac, and Tony Blair were each sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. The Belgrade court found them guilty of war crimes, and issued an order for their arrest. NATO partly destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 (hitting the homes of certain journalists, who were to be punished for criticizing NATO). Mistakes can not be made two or three times in a row - three missiles were fired against the embassy. The United States also wanted to destroy radar equipment being tested at the embassy by the Chinese. Bombing a civilian train could never be a mistake, especially if the pilot returns for a second round. The United States claimed that as a result of all the assaults on the Albanians, Serbia had lost its claim on Kosovo.

Freemasonry had gained another victory. Drugs are now freely pouring through the Balkans into the EU countries, in particular the West and North, including Sweden, where Albanian gangs from Kosovo operate, bringing in large quantities of brown heroin. Drug trafficking was made easier by the Balkans being a war zone. One of several causes of the conflict was the struggle for the drug routes. Kosovo-Albanian gangs acquire the heroin from Turkey via a terror organization called the Grey Wolves or the communist terror organi- zation PKK, or straight from Afghanistan. Albanian criminal clans run the heroin market in Scandinavia. The Swedish police have confirmed links with ethnic Albanians in 80 per cent of the seized heroin, suitable for smoking. The clans mainly come from the Kosovo. The police have been able to establish links between the heroin rings and the KLA. The drugs are smuggled from Afghanistan via Turkey into Europe through Kosovo. The gangs then invest the drug money in pizza restaurants and shops in Sweden. The Albanian gangs and the PKK co-operate with the new Italian Mafia the Sacre Corona (with headquarters in Puglia), in trans- porting drugs into the EU via Italy. The PKK, which receives arms from Kosovo, has a number of heroin laboratories in Turkey. The PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, controlled the flow of drugs.

Retinger, a freemason of the 33 rd degree, also took the initia- tive to the European Community and the Council of Europe. He was for a united Europe. He had unlimited access to the president of the United States. In 1955, the Bilderbergers discussed the need to create the European Community (EC). Eighteen months later, the Treaty of Rome was signed, and the EC was a fact. The steering committee of the Bild erbergers, which consists of three times thirteen 13 (39) members, also decides which leading politicians that have become usel ess and need to be replaced. On 12-14 May 1989, the Bilderberger s met in La Toja, Spain, where it was decided that Margaret Thatcher should be removed from her position as prime minister of Great Britain, because of her \"refusal to relinquish British sovereignty in fav our of the European super state that would begin to appear in 1992\". She was therefore regarded as an enemy of the New World Order. The information was leaked and published in the Americ an opposition newspaper Spotlight. It turned out to be correct. During her term in office, she was removed by her own people, the British Conservative Party. This coup was staged by the freemasons to pave the way for the United States of Europe. During the 1980s, the freemason Romano Prodi was a member of the Bilderberg steeri ng committee. In 1999, he was appointed president of the European Commission.

Other ECB board members, who are also Bilderbergers, include Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Ottmar Issing, and Sirkka Hamalainen. While on tour through the Eastern European candidate countries Romano Prodi said that an extended EU will witness many cases similar to the treatment of Austria. The bigger the EU grows, the more such actions are to be expected. In the Latvian capital Riga, Prodi emphasized: \"We cannot allow the member countries to make their own decisions on which parties w i l l form their governments. They will have to harbour the same values represe nt as we. Therefore strict rules, such as were applied in the case of Aust ria, will be equally applied to the other EU countries. This is in accordance with the new reality.\" ( Zeit- Fragen, Zurich, 21 February 2000, p. 3) Prodi should have said that the is sue is the New World Order. In other words, every election result is determined by the threat of sanctions from the authoritative EU leadership. On 18 November 2002 (under the sign of Scorpio), the EU Commission announced that the ten new member states would be admitted on 1 May (the sacred day of the Illuminati order) 2004. One in every three EU decisions is in reality invalid. The rules specify that a third of the 732 memb ers (earlier 626) of the EU Parlia- ment must be present. In the autumn of 1999, the attendance was lower than that 20 per cent of the votings. The decisions are nevertheless adhered to. The EU is breaking its own rules. What is this kind of power worth? A ruling by the European Court in the spring of 2000, declared that the freedom of speech might be restricted, if it is aimed against the purposes of the EU. The restrict ions also include property rights and the right to belong to or vote for any party of choice.

The new internationalism is referred to as mondialism or, more frequently, globalism, the purpose of which is a New World Order and a world government.

In a speech to the World Affairs Council in Boston on 6 January 2000, Patrick Buchanan, the American Reform Party's presidential candidate, took a stand against these mondialist or globalist plans. He declared that he was prepared to lead a mass revolt against the ruling elite of the nation and the media, because of their continuing support of the New World Order. \"Whose side are you on?\" asked Buchanan the assembled journa- lists and plutocrats. In his speech, he blamed the two-party system, the government and the corporat e elite for promoting a world government. He emphasized: \"Loyal ty to the New World Order is disloyalty to the Republic.\" He as sured his audience that the battle between patriotism and globalism has begun in one nation after another. According to Buchanan, the freemasons are the prime pro- moters of globalism. He has told j ournalists that he is also fighting against freemasonry. Buchanan quoted from the novel \"The New World Order\" (1939) by the socialist and freemason H. G. Wells: \"Countless people... will hate the New World Order... and will die protesting against i t...\" Buchanan replied to this: ''Well, Mr. Wells, we are your malcontents. But we're not going to die protesting your New World Order, we're going to live fighting it... This, then, is th e millennial struggle that succeeds the Cold War: It is the struggle of pat riots of every nation against a world government where all nations yield up their sovereignty and fade away. It is the struggle of nationalism against globalism, and it will be fought out not only among nations, but within nations.\" Buchanan dreamed of a republic th at has regained lost freedom and sovereignty, a na tion that does not go to war unless it is attacked or its vital interests are threatened or its honour violated.

A world in which there is a very real prospect of a New World Order.\" Patrick Buchanan's speech was not reported by the major American media. Not even The Boston Globe mentioned the speech, according to the opposition newspaper Spotlight, which later was shut down by the authorities. In the United States there are song s that reveal the real aims of the New World Order and the evil deeds committed by freemasons in the name of the planned system. The protest singer Carl Klang's CD \"Extremist\" contains the song \"Blinded by the Lies\", which begins with president Bush's statement about his vision of the New World Order on the horizon. The singer complains: \"How can I convince you, when your ears refuse to hear? Your eyes refuse to meet with mine , they glance away in fear.\" How can the situation be explained to someone whose senses are mani- pulated and therefore is unable to understand anything? Klang asks how it is still possible to bear the pain: \"Have your eyes been blinded by the lies? Yes, your eyes are blinded by the lies!\" he asks and replies in his song. He wonders: \"How can I control this poisoning of the soul?\" The other songs are called: \"We Want this Country Back!\", \"I am the Resister!\", \"Rock Them in Their Ivory Towers!\", \"It's not over un- til we win\", \"I am the Unknown Soldie r\".

All traditional moral and aesthetic values are disregarded a nd various abominations are foste- red in all spheres of life. Authorities put ideologies first and human dignity last, which leads to deterioration in the quality of life. There is much talk about our standard of living, but nothing is done to change the conditions of our lives so that our health, family life, personal relationships and creative opportunities are improved and our knowledge of reality widened - everything that characterizes the qualitative and spiritual purpose of human life. The fundamental principle of the Austrian natural scientist Viktor Schauberger (1885-1958) was that we ought to copy nature rather than trying to 'correct' it through various acts of interference. His thought was that we ought to base our technology on implosion, inwardly spiralling motion of energy, contracting towards the centre, as opposed to our present day technology, which is based on ex- plosion, outward movement, expansive and moving in a straight line. The implosion technology reaches the realm of antimatter and thus the constellation of gravity. Viktor Schauberger started out as a modest forester with no academic schooling but with a good knowledge of biology, physics and chemistry. He had an excepti onal feeling for and understanding of the movements of water in nature, and used his observations to draw up new basic ideas of hydrodynamics, which initially made him the target of contempt in academic circles. One of his ideas was that water is the blood of nature. Schauberger wrote: \"Our technology is deadly. Apart from a ter- rible waste of coal and oil, which have more vital roles to play in nature than to be burnt up in madly working machines, this techno- 523"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"logy also leaves excrement, wast e products that poison and pollute our entire living space.\" The worst example of today's technology is nuclear power, achieved through splitting atoms. The implosio n engine requires no fuel. Its energy comes fro m nature. Only air and water are needed for it to work. The principle of impl osion is a creati ve motion, while present-day technology is ba sed on a destructive motion. Undesired Inventions The freemasons do not permit this natural technology . Far too many highly useful inventions have been stopped. The freemasons are willing to kill to stop the devel opers of natural technologies, and they persist in telling lies to the effe ct that there are no alternatives. Leading freemasons have succeeded in blocking the antigravity engine, which was developed in th e United States as early as the 1950s, and which would have made fuel-driven cars and airplanes redundant. This engine would enable us to build our own \"flying saucers\". The masonic leaders hide this vital knowle dge and feed us disinformation with the sole purpose of harming us. 524"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"In the early 1900s, the Spanish inve ntor Julio Pinto Silva designed a train that was fast, quiet, energysaving, environment-friendly and safe (Trainlin), but no one wanted it. Independent experts consi- dered the Trainlin a sensation du e to its linear engine, which in- cludes the rail itself as part of the engine. The engine creates a mag- netic field, which together with the tracks propels the train. There is no need for any power transmission by way of driving shafts or switches. The train, consequently, is extremely quiet, flexible and efficient. Pinto Silva was of the opinion that the socialists were most hostile to the new train, in spite of the fact that it was the cheapest and the best. In any normal society such a natu ral invention would have been warmly welcomed. In the world of greedy freemasons such inventions are rejected. Many more highly useful inventions could be men- tioned. Hulda Regehr Clark (PhD, ND), author of the famous work \"The Cure for All Diseases\" (San Die go, 1995), has found a simple method of curing non-hereditary diseas es, including AIDS. Her recommen- dation is to avoid exposing the body to extremely toxic solvents and to remove parasites from the body. She has helped people in many countries to cure themselves of serious diseases. She has been threatened with legal proceedi ngs. On 20 September 1999, she was arrested in San Diego and sent to Indiana, where she was charged with practising medicine without a licence. Most of the patients at her clinic were dying but improved under her care. The American investigating journalist Ed McCabe has recommended and encouraged many seriously i ll patients, including those who are HIV-positive, to undergo treatment with increased body levels of oxygen. The authorities were not happy about his helping large numbers of people, and in order to put a stop to him in 1997, faked a tax violation, which may send him to jail for 17 years, in addition to paying a 250 000 dollar fine. He was not helped by the fact that he was able to produce massive documentation on a number of AIDS patients who, following oxygen 525"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"treatment, had become HIV-negative. Ed McCabe was jailed and treated as a very dangerous criminal. Dr James Boyce, who administered similar treatment, was also im- prisoned on fabricated charges. Doctors who really help sick pe ople are persecuted. But doctors who diagnose wrongly, causing serious damage or even killing their patients by incorrect treatment are simply reprimanded. This is standard procedure in a society r un by freemasons. In 1991, Dr Joel Wallach stated that American doctor s kill 300 000 patients each year through lack of knowledge and negligence. When the masonic-controlled Food and Drug Administration (FDA) realized that too many cancer pati ents recovered thanks to B 17 the vitamin was banned in the United States. This influenced food administration authorities in other countries with the consequence that today, vitamin B 17 is illegal in the whole world, classified as dangerous and toxic. In 1974, Dr Stewart M. Jones of California was prosecuted for having treated his cancer patients with laetrile, vitamin B 17 (G. Edward Griffin \"World without Ca ncer: The Story of Vitamin B 17\", Westlake, 2000, p. 22). The same authority, the FDA, had previously banned vitamin B 12, which is essential as the most important nutritive substance for the nervous system. Today everything may depend on this vitamin, which keeps our nervous system (brain and nerves) balanced. Smugg- ling of vitamin B 12 became so widespread and protests so loud that the FDA relented and legalized the vitamin. But the FDA is still withholding information about the properties of B 12. The public at large, therefore, has no idea of the efficiency of B 12 in curing mentally ill people including those suffering from senile dementia and depression. The European Union, in February 2001, banned close to 300 vitamins and minerals from July 2005. Fourteen Danish physicians, among them the radio doctor Carsten Vagn-Hansen, Claus Hancke and Bruce Philip Kyle, demonstrated to the Danish health care authorities 526"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"the importance of preventing and cu ring diseases with the aid of natural nutritive substances. They ar gued that Denmark should resist the criminal EU directive. These doctors mean that the EU directive may have very serious consequences for public health and the cost of medical care in Denmark. Many so-called educated people have committed enormous atro- cities, for which they have been publicly acclaimed. In 1949, Egas Moniz received the Nobel Prize for medicine for inventing lobotomy. The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet admitted, on 10 December 1995, that \"it would not occur to any psychiatrist in his right mind today to drill a hole in the cranium of a patient and cut the nerves to the frontal lobes of the brain in order to try to cure the patient from a psychosis\". The freemasons have ensured that one of the greatest geniuses, Nikola Tesla, has been almost for gotten. He invented the light bulb (which Edison stole), alternating cu rrent, neon light and radar. With the financial support of John Jacob Astor he built a very advanced laboratory in the Colo rado Mountains. He experimented with wireless transmission of electric power and succeeded, among other things, in lighting lamps and driving small en gines at a distance of 20 to 25 kilometres from the laboratory. After his death on 7 January 1943, his room at the St. Regis Hotel in New York was searched by FBI agents, who opened his safe and emptied it of all documents (John J. O'Neill, \"Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla\", New York, 1944). All the inventions, which would have made our lives easier, have been stopped. The freemason who prevented us from benefiting from Tesla's environment-friendly inventions was J. P. Morgan. Does it not seem strange that alt hough there has been an enor- mous development in some areas, the internal combustion engine we use in our cars has not changed at all in a hundred years? There have been some useful suggestions, to be sure, but the masonic companies have made sure that we do not have access to environ-mentally sensible cars. 527"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"The latest example is a car that runs on compressed air.

The inventor Guy Negre has been threa- tened with murder, since the capita list freemasons would lose billions of dollars if such a new, enviro nment-friendly car became a reality. This can not be allowed to happen. The freemasons have no objections to our dying as a result of the greenhouse effect caused by the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Vaccination Injuries The masonic booklet \"In Gold and Sky Blue\" (Turku, 1992, p. 25) states that \"the freemasons were pioneers and promoters of vacci- nation\". Actually, it was the freemas on and physician, Edward Jen- ner, who in 1796 began to promote 'preventive' vaccinations, a fact, which the freemasons are proud of (John Hamill, Robert Gilbert, \"Freemasonry: A Celebration of the Craft\", London, 1998, p. 128). Edward Jenner was a member of th e Faith and Friendship Lodge No. 270 in Berkeley, England ( ibid, p. 235). Jenner's publications plainly show that he was well aware that having once had a disease did not make a person immune. Neither do vaccinations. Yet he advocated something that was totally un natural and highly dangerous. Dr Viera Scheibner (Australia), the world's leading expert on vacci- nation injuries, has discovered a connection between the triple vaccine against diphtheria, whoopi ng cough and tuberculosis and sudden infant death syndrome, wh ich has now been scientifically proved. Many children have become crippled for life. Many children become autistic s oon after their vaccinations. Accor- ding to a survey in California, published in March 1999, autism has increased by 273 per cent in the last ten years. In 1999 alone, 1685 new cases were registered (\"Autism '99: A National Emergency\", Yaz- bak, 1999). In Maryland, autism in creased five folds in the same 528 "},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"period. One child in 149 has developed autism. Warnings against this correlation have been heard since a number of years, but ignorant doctors continue spreading the myth s that vaccinations are entirely harmless. The truth is that vacci nations are the cause of a large number of deaths and disabilities at a high cost to the taxpayers. Viera Scheibner has written a book titled \"Vaccination: 100 Years of Orthodox Research Shows that V accines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System\" (Mary-bo rough, Australia, 1997), which demonstrates the ways in which we have been tricked and harmed. You can not prevent a headache by taking aspirin, according to Dr Scheibner. No one in his right mind would do that. Vaccinations make as little sense. The pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the vaccines, are the real winners. Up to 80 per cent of all vaccines used for children are made by laboratories controll ed by the masonic Rockefeller family. Professor Antoine Bechamp (1816-1908) is still virtually unknown. He received no grants for his resear ch. Bechamp's main interest was the influence of microorganisms on the human body. He emphasized the fact that as long as we eat ri ght and live right, the bacteria will serve us well. Where there is an imbalance, many vital minerals are lost from the cells, and virus and bacteria begin to attack the weakened cells. Bechamp proved that all living cells contain small granules, called microzymes, which have unique enzy matic properties and an oscil- lating movement. Their presence in blood is needed for the formation of scabs in the case of wounds. Micr ozymes can survive temperatures of up to 300 degrees Celsius, and th ey remain long after the death of the host organism. They can develop and grow and generate bacteria (Antoine Bechamp, \"The Blood and its Third Anatomical Element\", Philadelphia, 1911). Bechamp believed that diseases develop in the body, when the interior condition and the natural ba lance are sufficiently disturbed and the electric tension in the cells is reduced. A healthy cell has a 529"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"voltage of between 60 and 100 mV, while that of a cancer cell has 20 mV. This was discovered by Dr Robe rt Becker in the 1920s (Robert Becker, Gary Selden, \"The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life\", New York, 1985). Another French scientist, Loui s Pasteur (1822 - 1895), claimed on the other hand, that all microorgani sms, both inside and outside the body, cause diseases and must therefor e be controlled by the use of vaccines. He received enormous gran ts. Support of this claim was an opportunity to make vast amounts of money while harming people. Pasteur's main source of money was the Paris Rothschilds, in particular Gustave Rothschild. The freemasons' intensive propaganda has made Pasteur a household name. On his death bed (for someone raised in a Catholic country, a most important moment), on 28 September 1895, he retracted his erroneous, simplistic theory with the following words: \"The microbes are nothing, the environment is everything!\" The freemasons did no thing to advertise this funda- mental truth. In the field of medical microbiology, Pasteur's theory still the basis for combating bacteria with penicillin and other antibiotics. In the early 1900s, a number of pr ominent scientists and patho- logists swallowed millions of infectious cholera bacteria in a despe- rate attempt to change the minds of the ruling elite of their society. Nothing worse came of it than mild diarrhoea although the active bacteria were proved to be already active inside the scientists. The elite were unwilling to take notice, since they had a vested interest in the control of microorganisms by the use of vaccines. The medical profession has no interest in checking the facts behind the official statement that vaccinations are most effective. The truth is that the material available in medical literature clearly shows that vaccinations can be to tally ineffective in preventing disease, while vitamins and minerals are reliable in that respect. Ignorant members of the medical profession claim that vacci- nations are the main explanation for the low rate of disease today. Statistics show, however, that the decline in the rate of infectious 530"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"diseases started before the big vacci nation campaigns in the 1900s. In addition, the common children's diseases are in no way harmful but are in fact necessary steps on the way to developing the immune system. Vaccinations have also caus ed a considerable increase in the occurrence of polio after many years of steady decline. In the United States today, vaccinations are the sole cause of polio. Alternatives to vaccination, which have been proved to be harmless and effective, have been available for many years, yet this information has been suppressed. Public health care work ers are jeopardizing the health and welfare of individuals by main taining the myths of the vaccines. Following her thorough investigation of medical literature on the subject of vaccination, Dr Viera Sc heibner concluded: \"There is no evidence whatsoever of the ability of vaccines to prevent disease. On the contrary, there is a large body of evidence of their having serious side effects.\" The Swedish Medical Product Agency (Lakemedelsverket) has not recognized a single side effect from children's vaccinations in the last decade. In the same period, howeve r, a number of pharmaceutical companies have paid millions of dollars in compensation to 20 Swedish children seriously injured by vaccines. In the United States, thousands of cases of side effects of the triple measles, mumps and rubella vaccine have been recognized in the last few years. The federal fund for vaccination injuries has paid out a total sum of 800 million dollars to 1400 families in the same period - exclusively families with the financial means to pursue a court case, and in possession of th e necessary information to enable them to make connections and find support in the medical literature. Their children were healthy, developing as they should, until the time of their vaccinatio n, after which they became feverish or coma- tose or started havi ng convulsions. Their condition then became chronic, and some of them developed autism. After the First World War, in 1918 - 1919, when inoculations began against the Spanish flu, at least 25 million people died worldwide (India counted over 12 million dead, Italy 400 000, Sweden 38 000). 531"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"The countries that were unable to afford the American vaccine (Greece, Egypt) were spared. In those countries, no one became ill. The name 'Spanish flu' comes fr om the fact that Spain, which stayed neutral in the First World War, had no censorship and no inte- rest in covering up the damages of the epidemic, while the powers at war kept the effects a secret. The real country of origin of the Spanish flu was the United States, where soldiers hade been incuba- ted against possible infectious diseases. More than 500 million people were infected. Vaccinations have claimed millions of human lives, and still the vaccination programmes continue. President Clinton admitted that the tetanus vaccine that was sent to the third world caused steril ity in large numbers of women (The Idaho Observer, October 1999). In his book \"Emerging Viruses: AI DS and Ebola - Nature, Accident or Intentional\", Dr Len Horowitz demonstrated how the US Depart- ment of Defense, in the early 1970s, tried to create a successful biological weapon. The weapon they managed to create is today known as AIDS. Cynically, the name AIDS (Acquired Immune De- ficiency Syndrome) clearly states that it is a case of acquired immune deficiency. How was it acquired? Through vaccination. Official documents show that HIV-infected polio vaccine was administered to large numbers of people in Africa before the outbreak of the epi- demic. According to official information, 30 million people had died of AIDS by the spring of 2004. At this time, 38 million people are infected with HIV worldwide. In 2002 alone, 5 million people were infected. Dr Horowitz demonstrat ed, using a number of documents, how HIV was given under the cover of vaccine against hepatitis B to a large number of homosexual men in New York and San Francisco, who then became responsible for the spread of AIDS in America. Harmful vaccines are continua lly being sent to developing countries in an attempt to combat malaria.

Measles vaccine has been shown to cause paralysis. One child became blind and spastic after receiving the triple diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus vaccine that contains a number of toxic substances, among them aluminium. The child's cerebrum was severely damaged. The vaccination injuries were recognized. Children have acquired chronic rheumatoid arthritis, symptoms of dementia and multiple sclerosis, and some have even died following vaccination. During the Gulf War, experiment al vaccines were used on the American soldiers. War veterans claim that of the children born after the war, one in three had congenita l deformities or other injuries. The soldiers had no chance to refuse vaccination. This Gulf War Syndrome is similar to AIDS in that it breaks down the immune system. So far there is no cure. In their book \"Vaccination: The Silent Killer\", Ida Honorof and Elanor McBean point to the enormous damage caused by vaccines. Dr Guylaine Lanctot, the Canadi an author of the bestselling book \"The Medical Mafia\" (Coaticook, 1995), wrote in the Canadian medical journal Medical Post: \"The medical authorities keep lying.

The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet (17 May 2000) claimed that painkillers containing the active substance DXP cause 200 deaths each year in Sweden. Sin ce the 1970s, thousands of people in Sweden have died from taking this subs tance. The Medical Products Agency (Lakemedels-verket) is still not interested in any alternatives.

Hoechst, Bayer and BASF, all pharmaceutical companies controlled by freemasons, are leading the intern ational efforts to stop health information on vitamins and other natural methods of treatment. There is a reluctance to admit that most common diseases are the direct result of vitamin deficien cies, and consequently possible to prevent by natural means. Healthy people are considerably more resistant to manipulation than the unhealthy. Every physical disease originates in an emotional imbalanc e, which is, of course, individual in its scope. For this reason, the pow er elite make sure that we are poisoned through various synthetic additives to our food. Certain substances, which are added to foods tuffs, are more easily avoided. The general public is already awar e that the use of sugar leads to caries, heart disorder and diabetes. Sugar uses up the body's supplies of minerals. Healthier alternativ es are honey, and unrefined cane sugar. Replacing sugar with refi ned and toxic chemicals such as aspartame, is a totally pointless ex ercise. Aspartame dissolves into methanol (which can cause blindness ), formaldehyde (a neurotoxin) and formic acid (a highly corrosive liquid found in the poison of ants). Aspartame was accidentally discover ed in 1965, wh en the chemist James Schlatter of the C. D. Searle Company was working on a cure against abscesses.

The company, which manufactures aspartame is Monsanto, control- led by Robert Shapiro (chairman and chief executive), a high-ranking freemason and member of the Bilderberger Group. Monsanto has moved its international section from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brussels. Every attempt to ban the use of aspartame has failed. Opposing the destructive masonic international network has proved too difficult. Charlotte Erlandsson-Albertsson, professor of medical and physio- logical chemistry in Lund, Sweden, in a contribution to the discus- sion on the artificial sweetener aspartame (Dagens Nyheter, 19 May 2000), claimed that aspartame constitutes a health risk and stressed the importance of removing or considerably reducing the use of this substance as a food additive. She re mains the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Aspartame kills brain cells, according to one study made at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. In particular, the areas of the brain affected by aspartame are those connected with our ability to learn. In the United States, half the population uses large quantities of aspartame. More than 3000 food products contain aspartame, among them all so-called light drinks. It was prohibited for a short time only. The forces that wanted to keep the substan ce on the market were far too powerful, and aspa rtame was soon permitted again. In contrast, the authorities did ban the use of Stevia in Sweden, a Japanese plant that has been used as a natural sweetener for many years. Stevia has no side effects. The reason for the ban was simple: Stevia might win over aspartame. Aspartame is also an ingredient in magnesium hydroxide, a magne- sium compound available over the counter. Magnesium compounds 535"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"without aspartame, on the other ha nd, require a doctor's prescrip- tion. Aspartame is also sold as Nutra Sweet, Canderel and Equal. By insidious means, we are forced to consume various drugs. In his book \"Between Two Ages\" (New York, 1970, p. 10), the freemason Zbigniew Brzezinski states that in the new technotronic era, the intention of the elite is to extend their mind control to include biochemical means. The new dictatorship is preserved by means of modern technology. In January 2001, the Belgian masonic-controlled government repealed the ban on smoking cannabis and marijuana. \"A survey of the substances classi fied as narcotics in Sweden shows that nearly 100% of these were or iginally used for medical purposes before being introduced as substances of addiction.\" (Borje Olsson, \"Narkotikaproblemets bakgrund\" / \"The Origin of Narcotics Problem\", Stockholm, 1994). Up to 200 000 Swedes are addict ed to tranquillizers and anti- depressants. The cost of this widespread addiction is estimated at between 280 and 700 million dollars per year. The solution would lie in large doses of vitamin B 12. Large numbers of children in the United States and Europe are walking around in a zombie-like condition, forced by the medical profession into using amphetamines. Saturated fats are a health hazard and a cheap option for the food industry. They are now used also in chocolate, as opposed to the earlier use of unsatu rated fats. Proctor & Gamble, a company controlled by the international fr eemasonry, has introduced the synthetic fat Olestra on the market . Internal company research shows that it can cause gastric problems. Natural fats provide protection ag ainst cancer and infections, and contain fat-soluble nutrients such as carotenoids and vitamins A and E which play an important role in the fight against infections, cancer, diseases of the heart and liv er, and prostate ailments. Proctor & Gamble's research cl early shows that Olestra lowers the body's supplies of fat-solubl e nutrients by blocking the absorption of fat. 536"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Olestra may increase a vitamin A, D, E and K deficiency, which in turn may cause osteoporosis, weaken ing of the immune system, heart disease and other problems. Proctor & Gamble were aware of Olestra being a health hazard but marketed it regardless. The carotenoids lutein, zeaxatin, and beta-carotene contain vital cancer-blocking substances, which al so counteract eye diseases such as macula degeneration (impaired vision). Olestra lowers the carotenoid content by some ten per cent, which may lead to an increase of 390- 800 cases of macula degenera tion per year in the United States alone, not to mention its possible world wide effects. The body's supplies of carotenoids are considerably lowered when as little as 3 grams of Olestra are consumed daily. This is the amount contained in a handful of potato chips. Information on the amounts needed to lower the cont ents of fat-soluble vitamins is classified. In 1989, the Batelle Research Institute in Columbus, Ohio, showed that fluoride is a highly carcinogenic substance. The research was commissioned by the National Cancer Institute in the United States, but the results were suppressed. Ther e is no research available to support the theory that fluoride prev ents caries. The idea that fluo- ride protects tooth decay is a myth. It is also a great misfortune. Sodium fluoride causes a 50 per cent rate of tooth deterioration and increases the number of children with Down's syndrome by 12 per cent as well as the number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease. At the same time the Swedish press carry on their false propa- ganda: \"Daily fluoride rinse saves bad teeth.\" As early as before and during the Second World War, German scientists discovered that if neurot oxin sodium fluoride was given to human subjects, they became passive and compliant. The reason is that sodium fluoride damages the contact between the brain and the cortex. In 1939, scientists in Ber lin produced sarin, a nerve gas that contains fluoride. 537"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"In 1940, Soviet authorities began adding fluoride to the water in their concentration camps with the purpose of inducing psychic dis- orientation in their political prisoners. In 1942, Germany was the world's largest producer of aluminium. The waste product was sodium fluori de, which was used on prisoners in the concentration camps. Aluminium plants produce a giant surplus of sodium fluoride. ALCOA (Aluminium Company of America) was founded by Andrew W. Mellon (1855 - 1937). He was the head of the Mellon National Bank, and Secretary of Treasury between 1921 and 1932. A. W. Mellon became a freemason in Pittsbu rgh, Pennsylvania, in 1928. In 1947, the ALCOA lawyer Oscar Ewing was appointed director of the Federal Security Agency (FSA). He used his influence there to initiate the fluoridation of drinking water. IG Farben, which started this research, continues under other names. Their subsidiary Crest manufactures toothpaste. Sodium fluoride, which is toxic, is now an ingredient in most brands of toothpaste. The public, however, is not aware th at teeth can be protected by calcium fluoride, which is non-toxic. The authori ties have no interest in making this information available. In his book \"Recipe for Health\" (\"Recept pa halsa\", Stockholm, 1990, pp. 104 - 112), the Swedish Professor Olof Lindahl reveals the fluoride fraud in the chapter headed \"Fluoride Poisoning\": \"Our faith in the beneficial properties of fluor ide is, in my opinion, one of the greatest medical errors of our time. In actual fact, the dose level of fluoride, which is recommended (1 ppm ), is extremely harmful over time. 1 ppm (part per million) equals one part fluoride for every million parts water, or 1 mg fluoride in 1 litre of water. A document released in the United St ates establishes definitive proof that fluoride is a cause of bone cancer. This is likely to lead to a ban on all fluoride additives. The majority of dentists as well as the public believe in this dangerous fluoride propaganda. 538"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Fluoride is a powerful enzyme toxin. Enzymes are the body's lubri- cants, facilitating all chemical re actions. Without enzymes, the entire metabolism comes to a halt, life processes slow down and we die. Bad and damaged enzymes cause general impairment.\" Lindahl stresses the fact that th ere are several thousand enzymes in the body, each of which controls its own specific chemical reaction. 1 ppm of fluoride, the recommended dose in drinking water, reduces enzyme activity by 50 per cent or more. Fluoride ad- versely affects the genetic contents of the DNA, and degenerates and weakens the connective tissue. A number of tests on animals have shown chromosome damage in the sperm production. Lindahl stated: \"In humans as well, there is a connection with the congenital condition of Down's synd rome (mongolism)... In ordinary cells... the risk of cancer is in creased. The fluori de propagandaof the mid-1 900s is an example of the eas e with which the medicalestablish- ment permits itself to be tricked by pseudo-scientific propaganda and erroneous observation.\" The authorities, however, are not yet prepared to admit that fluoride is a dangerous enzyme toxin that damages the genetic make- up, the individual cells and the entire metabolism. But even the glossed-over official statistics clear ly show that the incidence of allergies in children has increased substantially. The myth that fluoride in low dos es is safe was created by the scientists who worked on the nuclear bomb programme. All evidence of the health risks was censored by the American Atomic Energy Commission, referring to national security. The documents relating to fluoride as a health risk have been totally ignored by the media. Unfo rtunately, fluoride is also present in pesticides, with the result that it finds its way into the human body via fruits and vegetables. It is also present in a number of medicines. Fluoride impairs our ability to see connections and lowers the level of intelligence, damages brain cells, promotes accumulation of radio- active substances in the body and causes bone cancer. 539"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"In 1988 Dr Joel Boriskin, chai rman of the National Committee on Advice on Fluoridation, recommended that elderly people with a hearing impairment use 1500 mg of fluoride daily. What he \"forgot\" to mention was that 1500 mg per day is a lethal dose. As early as in the 19 th century it was known that amalgamate is a highly toxic and harmful substance. In spite of this, it is still frequently used in dental repairs. This harmful method for repairing teeth was developed by the French dentist Auguste Taveau (a freemason) in Paris in 1816. In 1833, when the French Crawcour br others, who were also freemasons, emigrated to the United States, th ey soon introduced the new dental compound there. The Cr awcour brothers were two ruthless impostors, lacking all knowledge of dentistry, medicine or toxicology. The American Society of Dental Su rgeons banned all use of amal- gam in 1843, threatening to expel any member who used it. Nevertheless, Green Vardiman Black (1836-1915), a dentist and pro- fessor and a prominent freemason in Chicago, standardized the manufacture of amalgam in 1895. The Swedish physician Bengt Fredin has demonstrated, using guinea pigs, that mercury is deposited in the liver, kidneys and brain after only two fillings (B. Fredin, \"Studies on the Mercury Release from Dental Amalgam Fillings\", Stockholm, 1988). There is plenty of evidence ava ilable of patients who have lost their health as a result of amalgam fillings. The same toxin is regar- ded by environmental health auth orities as highly dangerous in sewage water. Dental repair material containi ng mercury, on the other hand, was considered harmless by the health care authorities - but only for the patients. For the dentists, amalgam constituted an occupational hazard, according to \"The Great Medi cal Book\", published in Helsinki in 1973. It looks like someone was deliberately trying to harm us. In the United States, nearly a billi on dollars has been paid out in damages to patients poisoned by mercury in tooth fillings in the last few years. 540"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Those who have many amalgam fillings and who regularly use chewing gum, increase the levels of mercury in their blood, urine and exhaled air, three-fold compared with those who do not use chewing gum. Chewing gum releases mercury, as has been demonstrated in various studies. The gum also contains aspartame. Mercury is used as a preservative in medical preparations, such as vaccines for animals as well as for human use. The authorities have consistently claimed that there is no danger involved. It appears that the freemasons are interested in the degeneration of the rest of humankind. There have been cheerful reports in the press: \"Growing numbers of childr en are diagnosed with learning disabilities\", \"One in ten Russians born with defects\", \"One in ten American teenagers has tried to co mmit suicide\", \"Young people feel bad\", \"Research scare: today's youth are like fifty-year olds\", \"Lack of sleep causes premature ageing\", \"Drugs common among young\", \"Eight in ten sixteen-year olds dr ink alcohol regularly\", \"Physical state of Swedes worse\", \"Researchers claim TV makes children aggressive\", \"Coffee behind panic attacks\", \"No help for burnout suicide patients\", \"Increase in suicide rate among the young\"... Our use of synthetic foodstuffs has other harmful consequences as well. Additives in our food and othe r artificial substances absorb negative ions, causing a surplus of positive ions. An imbalance is established, which is uncomfortable for the body. The Fohn wind in Bavaria is another example of a positive ion surplus. Polyester is a harmful substance used in the manufacture of cloth. Natural materials such as cotton, wool and linen are the best. Synthetic dyes and paints are bad. Natural calcium paints are better for indoor painting. Calcium counte racts energy disturbances. Plastic and other artificial materials attract dust through static electricity, making the use of plastic furniture unwise. Colours affect us with their molecular frequencies. A dark blue colour in a natural fibre material is beneficial for the kidneys. Yellow is good for the spleen. During the Middle Ages, colourful clothes improved self-respect and increased individuality. The peasants wore 541"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"grey clothes. The grey suits of to day were the work clothes of the medieval foresters, which were adopted by the puritans. The new elite tended to imitate the look of the subservient classes. For certain purposes, for instance in sports, it is important not to break the flow of energ y. This is why athletes generally wear one- piece tracksuits. Sorcerers, and late r jesters or clowns wore one-piece costumes. The masonic clothes are in one piece as well, as are the garments worn by priests. Thus the flow of energy, especially the vital kundalini energy flowing alo ng the spine, is uninterrupted. The energies are also balanced with other one-piece items of clothing, such as a woman's dress. Damaging Phenomena Today, our food contains secret toxins. Common flour contains enough herbicides to kill plants when a little flour is mixed in with the soil. There are no maximum leve ls for modern in dustrial chemi- cals in drinking water. Tens of th ousands of substances are circu- lating in our environmen t, of which scientists have no knowledge at all. More and more bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. If this deterioration continues, many of the medically treatable infectious diseases may have very serious co nsequences, according to prominent experts. The complicated rules of the Europe an Union lead to a decrease in the variety of seeds available to ho usehold growers. Many previously available vegetable se eds are banned. Experts mean that the EU's arguments for the rules ensuring se ed quality does not hold up. Old varieties of vegetables, traditiona lly grown in Sweden, which have not so far been banned and are not formally owned by anyone, run the risk of disappearing altogeth er. In Sweden, the ban includes mainly seeds of old vegetable varietie s. 'Finnish Red' is a kale variety at least 100 years old, originally from Estoni a. Red kale was common 542"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"in Swedish kitchen gardens in the 19 th century, being hardier even than the green varieties, according to Land magazine. It is now banned. As a matter of course, al l the best varieties are banned, while the inferior ones are permitted. Growers are also forced to pay a high registration fee for every variety of seed, something that many cannot afford. Large numbers of sensible growers ignore the ban, however, and there is a flou- rishing black market for seeds. The EU has managed to ban se ed varieties that through the centuries have been developed by na ture or by growers to withstand the varied local climates from the North Cape to the southernmost tip of Sicily, from the Atlantic to the inland climate of Central Europe, from the Alpine heights of 2000-3000 me tres, to sea level. According to the EU, we only need one green and one red variety of apples. The corporation Monsanto has tr ied to acquire a monopoly on seeds that have been genetically ma nipulated to produce plants that kill their own seeds the following y ear. This perverse death techno- logy (also called 'terminator techno logy' by its critics) would make it impossible to take viable seeds from fully grown plan ts, and growers would be forced to buy new seeds each year from Monsanto, a keen supporter of the former Soviet Uni on. Monsanto worked extensively with the Communist Empire. At the same time, an area of 7.6 to 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Scotland a nd Wales) is being eliminated worldwide every year. A further 10 million hectares is adversely affected or destroyed secondarily. Each year, 16 000 hectares of the tropical forests of the Earth disappear, eventually causing an ecologic and economic disaster. Over-exploitation in the form of incorrect farming methods and water extraction in uns uitable areas, over-gra zing and trampling by cattle, and draining low-lying as well as higher land all contribute to a yearly loss of arable land an average of 70 000 square km or more. In the years between 1945 and 1985, the deserts grew by over 9 million square km, an area the size of the United States. South of the 543"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Sahel, at least one million squa re km of productive land has been turned into desert (an area the size of Egypt). The stupidity behind our aid to the developing countries has increased the desert areas, as pl ains have been transformed into badly eroded, sterile land. Due to l ack of vegetation, soil and water have disappeared. The drying-out process is accelerating and over increasingly large areas the earth is becoming sterile. In 1977, the UN adopted a plan to stop the grow th of deserts, which was never implemented. It would have require d 4.5 billion dollars annually for 20 years to reach its objective of stopping the desiccation of the land. The American scientist Lester Brown (Worldwatch Institute) has estimated a yearly loss through erosi on of 23 million tons of topsoil. In the mid-1900s, the Earth had 3500 billion tons of topsoil. By this reckoning, the soil will last anot her 130 years or less. Between 1950 and 1973, the demand for grain was doubled. By 2000 it had doubled again. Millions of tons of soil are deposited by the wind in rivers and lakes. Above all, there is a loss of soil in the developing countries as people chop down trees for firewood. In the beginning of the 20th century, 30 million different species lived on Earth. In 1993, there were 15 million left. Between 1900 and 1980, one species of mammal was disappeared every year. In the 1980s, humans wiped out one species every day. Some scientists estimate that 30 species are dying out every minute - as if other forms of life had no right to grow and develop. Concerned biologists suspect that there most likely have existed plants recently that are now extinct, before ever having been discovered.

Positive, higher frequencies increase the level of oxygen in the cells (disharmonious music lowers the oxygen level). The soothing music of Vivaldi, Bach and othe r classical composers lowers the cholesterol levels and regulate the blood pressure. It is vital that the electric charge in the cells is rais ed. Hardrock music produces harm- ful vibrations, inferior and disharmonious pictures disturb our inner harmony. The media reinforce negative energi es. Many films glorify violence and sex. (Men become weaker in terms of energy, since they lose large amounts of minerals and vitami ns by having sex too often.) The American doctor Judith Sachs ad vocates: \"Get well from sex!\" The more harmful the ideas are, the wider is their impact. How many people are aware that very l ong ago, the Chinese recommended abstinence from sex before energy -demanding races and battles? In the West, this has been totally ignored until ve ry recently. Only now have we discovered the usefulness and sense of this recommendation. All living cells are dependent on electromag netically transmitted information from other cells and fr om the central nervous system in order to function. In th is way, virus-infected, sick cells are able to transfer their symptoms to non-infected cells. Even a very weak magnetic current can transform blood cells in frogs into bone tissue. A weak, pulsating magnetic field th rough the brain leads to an im- paired ability to solve problems a nd reduces the ability to react. An incorrect electromagnetic pulse can k ill, paralyse or mentally affect people in a way similar to that of neurotoxins. Our bodies use a certain electric current to re gulate the healing of wounds. This current goes from the brain, through th e motoric nerve system and back through the sens ory nerve system. Anaesthesia blocks these currents. In an expe riment on salamanders, the body- current was blocked by a counte r current through the brain. The animal fell asleep, bu t woke up as soon as the opposing current was turned off.

More Effective Weaponry Instead, the ruling elite started to use new methods to harm people. During the Second World War, microwave technology was developed. In the 1970s, this development was speeded up with a powerful leap from an effect of 1 MW to 1000 MW. Particle and fusion technology was established. Both the Soviet Union and the United States had access to a powerful microwave cannon, able to interfere with or damage electronic equipment but also able to be used against humans. Today, Israel, Japan, France, Great Britain and other leading nations possess this weapon. Masonic scientists ha ve developed a high-energy microwave pul- sator (HPM), a special microwave gene rator). A laser pulse of a couple of thousand kW at a certain frequency is able to destroy a large number of robots. According to scientists, HPM can operate within a limited area with a very large number of pulses in the microwave range (1-100 GHz). The pulse effect decreases with distance. Many countries are defenceless. It woul d be too expensive. The weapon is fired at the speed of light. It can be fired secretly, the shots being invisible and inaudible, and it is very difficult to establish if one has been hit by microwaves. It could prove difficult to survey the threats and to prove who is responsible. Pulse weapons emit antiwaves, whic h disable body molecules of a different electromagnetic grouping. Humans may experience hearing impairment at a range of a few kilometres. HPM weapons can interfere with ne rvous systems at a range of 30 km. For space-based systems, the range can be enormous.

Microwave ovens are an additional source of danger, as are, of course, mobile telephones. Microw aves cause leukaemia, vertigo, vision impairment, brain tumours, DNA mutation and other symp- toms. The ruling elite also has access to radio frequency weapons, with ranges from a few Hz up to several GHz, and which are either space or land based. There are hand weap ons, the size of a briefcase, for use in attacks at close range, as well as mobile systems transported on lorries. There are tactical ba ttlefield weapons, ground-based or airborne, with a range of up to 20 km. Strategic radio frequency weapons have an ability to wipe out the population of entire cities, at least equal to that of nuclear weapons (but without causing the material devastation). Radio frequency technology has led to weapons of ma ss destruction more lethal than nuclear weapons. Land-based stra tegic weapons can be aimed at targets below the horizon. The effects of radio frequency wea pons can be compared with that of neurotoxins, which are lethal in very low concentrations. They destroy the sensitive electromagnetic interaction within the nerve tissue. Their main target is the central nervous system and the brain. The frequencies used for electromagnetic weapons extend far beyond the actual radio wavelengths. The lower frequency range, below that of the infrared, is designated as radio frequencies. Laser weapons as well have a devastating effect. Of course, biological weapons have been developed further as well. At peace negotiations during the Fren ch and Indian War 1755-1760, British officers distributed blanke ts poisoned with smallpox to the Indians. This caused an epidemic, which led to their surrendering. Great Britain is conducting experi ments with heat weapons armed with thermo baric ammunition.

It has been revealed that on 11 September 2001, what is known as termit plasma bombs were used to destroy the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center, after the two aircraft had hit the towers. These plasma bombs are only available to the United States and Israel, not to terrorists. Shortly be fore the collapse, several powerful explosions are visible on an uncensored video film.

When we understand this, we can see that the freemasons are the enemies of mankind. The freemasons are like a virus that has entered into the weakened cells of society, taking over it, and ruling it. The freemasons are responsible, morally and legally, for many evil deeds, and will sooner or later be formally judged as well. The day will come when these evil groups will be banned entirely as a threat to mankind. Their negative symbols should be destroyed. The freemasons think they have a ri ght to be above the law, which makes them even more dangerous. Another Nuremberg trial has ne- ver come about, since a masonic brother cannot condemn the out- rages of his comrades, committed in the name of communism and socialism. Worldwide, more than 80 000 books have been published about freemasonry. An independent analysis is lacking, however. This book has attempted to meet this need. In a sense, we deserve to have these masonic leaders ruling us, since we have so far not prot ested enough. Through our thoughtless acts, we have created the conditions for the evil of freemasonry. We have also pretended, in the eyes of our fellow men to be good. Now the freemasons are doi ng the pretending for us. We are responsible also for what we have neglected to do, in connection with the criminal activities of the masonic elite. Our spiritual level has been too lo w.

Thus they lack the 550"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"authority to alter the world we live in. A democratic society has no need for secrecy. The Church is mostly to blame, not having allowed other types of spiritual life. When in the 18th century, the freemasons began to advocate their pseudo-sci entific doctrine , ignorant people were easily fooled. In non-Christian countries, the spread of freemasonry was less effective. In particular, it wa s resisted in Buddhist countries. These unnatural doctrines have s upported the useless - as well as most of the useful - idiots who have sold their souls to international freemasonry. These spiritually in competent people have had the chance to wreak havoc and block th e way for the gifted, who could make their own way. In a normal spir itual society, this is impossible. The masonic socialist fantasy favo urs the misfits, those souls that only survive at the cost of the able ones. The socialist society of beggars and slaves is a crime agai nst nature, since it is a backward rather than forward moving society. A socialist society is therefore the ideal place for the parasites to justify their atrocities, which need a social body for their survival. The elite makes use of their inferior \"brothers\", only to discard them later on. They are but tools that know little of the world or of freemasonry. The freemason fanatics claim to be building a better world for us all. In fact, they have ruined the traditional world. They have built their world on corpses, plunder, theft, and lies. This has never worked. Lies lead to a dead end an d are sooner or later exposed. The satanic evil of the freemasons is abysmal. There are no excuses for the violent deeds committed by these masonic criminals. In addition, the socialists advoca te the building of a New World. During the 1990s, a periodical, The Builders of World, for youth was published in Sweden. It preached the ideas of the freemasons. We let ourselves be deceived by mutually exclusive slogans such as freedom, equality and brotherhood, which the masonic henchmen, the socialists, continue to propaga te.

The philosopher Giordano Bruno showed as early as in the la te 16th century, that a society based on equality is an impossibility. We never could nor di d we want to expose their shameless lies and their conspiracy. Many non-freemasons deny this obvious plot and defend these criminals.

When our so-called experts make erroneous statements on important issues, there are two alternatives - e ither they are lying or they are simply ignorant. Both alternatives are equally frightening. Since the masonic leaders do not wo rk in accordance with the laws of nature, their activities do not improve our quality of life, on the contrary. The masonic leaders have blood on their hands, and their lips speak lies. They give the impression of confused and unbalanced persons, spiritually severely dise ased. Their psychopathic characte- ristics, social paranoia and unfounded belief in being the chosen ones have caused terrible suffering to all mankind. Is it not time to end this foolishness? Only those who are spiritually and morally retarded or total degenerates, rob, kill, and steal from their fellow men. When these underdeveloped or brain-damaged individuals intend to build a \"better world\" for non-freemasons, we are in deep trouble. It is high time we begin to offer some resist ance against the tyrannical power 552"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"of the hardened and unscrupulous m asonic criminals. With the help of the truth, we will be able to disarm the power of freemasonry. Therefore, it is our duty to thoroughly expose their fraud. Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303) pointed out: \"Those who keep silent seem to agree.\" Those who do not interv ene to stop crime are legally co- responsible for the crime. When we are strong enough, spiritually and morally, to be able to independently create a stricter social order and more just and sen- sible laws, the power of freemasonry will collapse. In today's world, Buddhism still stands for true goodness and free- masonry for camouflaged evil. Freemasonry would never have succeeded in its battle against hu manity, if it had not hidden its evil nature behind a mask of goodness. All Buddhist thought is offensive to the freemasons. Only they and their henchmen, communists and socialists of various kinds, have fought Buddhism (for instance in the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Tibet). Usually, spiritually developed people have never had any objecti ons against this philosophy of goodness. Freemasonry is the opposite of spirituality. Step by step, the freemasons have lowered our moral values. They appear angelic, despite of their efforts to hide their cloven hoofs. The evil acts of the freemasons ar e permitted by the laws of karma. If we had not deserved the crimes of these \"noble\" gentlemen, we would never have suffered them, according to Buddhist philosophers. Karma is a natural law, which regulates all deeds. It ensures that energies released by certain actions , sooner or later return to their origins. The bigger the deed, the longer it takes for the response to occur. The only exception is when a person begins to make amends for his evil actions. All evil deeds rebound, bringing exactly the same suffering as that of the victim. Th is is illustrated by the Buddhist \"Dhammapada\": An evil deed, when done, does not - like ready milk - come out right away. It follows the fool, smouldering like a fire hidden in ashes. 553"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge, for it cleaves his head and destroys his innate goodness. There is also collective karma, which affects larger groups such as organizations, lodges, movements, nations, or the entire world. The freemasons may rest assured that - although the inferior, ignorant brothers may be innocent of evil - all freemasons will be struck by the reactions of karma when the time is ripe. No member of this evil community will be able escape. Evil is rewarded with evil, as well as the opposite. \"Dhammapada\" explains: As long as evil has yet to ripen, the fool mistakes it for honey. But when that evil ripens, the fool falls into pain. It is therefore unders tandable that the fr eemasons have been allowed to commit only as much evil deeds as our collective karma would allow. This is largely depe ndent on our attitude. If we allow our authorities to behave outrageously, we ther eby create conditions for new atrocities. No one protes ted when the mad emperor Caligula appointed his horse to be a senator. It only led to more pain caused by new horrors. Today we allow th e insane acts of the freemasons, and we do not even want to know the purpose of their deeds. A few thousand masonic assassins and executors cause suffering to millions of peop le, although these people wish to escape their suffering. This is their karma. Most of the time, these people have themselves created the conditions that enable evil men to hurt them. The Russians did not want to expose Lenin's evil nature, and the Germans did not understand th e evil intentions of Hitler. This unpleasant situation can only be changed through the ex- pansion of people's awareness. At times, hard and bi tter experiences like these may be needed before we begin to learn. We must see the perverted form of mate rialism to realize that the materialist path leads to evil and from there to the abyss. 554"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Mephistopheles told Doctor Faustus: \"I am a part of the force that causes evil, but this time I commit ev il under the pretext of universal happiness.\" The freemasons have committed them selves to just such a task with the help of communism, national and international socialism and other ideologies. And most of us have been betrayed. How much longer? \"Dhammapada\" says: Fools, their wisdom weak, are their own enemies as they go through life, doing evil that bears bitter fruit. One does not have to be a bodhisattva (a holy person) to wish to learn from our common mistakes. Anyone would, if they have the will. The ones behind all the destructiv e phenomena described in this book are a group of brutal Jewish extremist masonic leaders and bankers, who consider themselves chosen to transform the world according to their perverted notions. Their basis is a racist \"book of wisdom\", the Talmud, which emphasizes that \"only the Jews are children of God, and all other people are children of the devil\" (Berachoth, fol. 47 b). Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh is of the same spirit. In The Jewish Week (26 April 1996, p. 12) he asked rhetorically: \"If a Jew needs a liver, can you the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to save him? The Torah would probably permit that.\" Happily, there are Jews of a mo re humane character, who strongly oppose the racism of the Jewish extremists. Examples are Morton Mezvinsky, professor of histor y at Central Connecticut State University and Israel Shahak of Israel, retired professor of organic chemistry (who died in 2001). Othe rs who have come forward are Professor Henry Makow and the journalist Israel Shamir. There are many passive opponents in Israel. International freemasonry, with the help of socialist useful idiots, has transformed the Kingdom of Sw eden to the \"Soviet republic\" of 555"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Absurdistan, where even the laws ar e used selectively. The socialists have started to call their nationa list opponents \"lice\". (See my book \"Soviet Influence in Sweden\".) This attitude is purely of masonic origin. Anyone, who does not think like an orthodox socialist, is forced to hide his true opinions to make a career in Sweden. It is necessary to lie to get ahead. This was also the case in the Soviet Union. In Sweden there is authoritarian democracy, where dissidents are seldom heard. Freedom of speech is strictly limited. In the Soviet Union this was known as socialist democracy. Only politically correct views are allowed. People are so deeply taken in that they find it hard to orientate themselves. All confrontations with reality cause enormous suffering. The socialists are above all hurting the intel- lectuals. Journalists are only allowed to report those facts considered \"politically correct\". The authorities are free to treat the citizens as they see fit. We do not need horrible music th at shrinks the aura, junk food damaging our health, or the tasteless, ugly clothes advertised and marketed by masonic companies. We do not need their computer games for six-year olds, lured into imagining the most brutal murders. We do not need chewing gum with violent pictures of a child bleeding out of its mouth, the brain pouring out through a hole, and the intestines fl owing out from its stomach. The socialists and liberals are keen proponents of the multi- cultural society. What does this mean? The Jewish writer Umberto Eco suggests to us in the press: \"We should quite simply get used to the idea that we will soon be living in a totally new culture. And it will be Afro-European.\" He \"forgot\" to mention that this \"culture\" means lack of culture. From this soul-less \"culture\" are born ingratitude and respect- lessness, and the demand for native pe ople to integrate, rather than the immigrants (or migrants as the term is now). Aftonbladet (28 July 2000) urged its readers: \"Get yourself integrated, whitey! Or shut up!\" This is the opinion of an immigrant woman in a \"multi- 556"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"cultural society\". In other words, her aim was to destroy Swedish national culture by forcing Swedes to forget their Swedishness. This fits very well with the European Union demands for a ban on natio- nalist parties. Incompetent journalists distorting the facts are now a serious threat to society. Certain Swedish red and \"liberal\" journalists made a great fuss about a purported racial crime in the Stockholm area on the New Year's Eve 1999, but they \"forgot\" to mention that it was a young Swede defending his girlfriend against several immigrants, killing the most aggressive attacker. The Swede received a prison sentence. Defending oneself or those closest is no longer permitted in Sweden. Lord Ampthill, deputy grand master of the Grand Lodge of England, stated at the Internati onal Masonic Club meeting in London on 1 November 1910: \"Freemasonry includes many journalists, who have been given virtually unlimited power.\" (Recht und Wahrheit, No. 3-4, 2001, p. 16) The masonic sadists are only happ y to watch conflicts between different ethnic groups, which they often have caused themselves. At the same time, the masonic elite is using films and propaganda to make us used to the idea that worse is to come. We cannot see reality as it is, unl ess we understand that there is a secret political network running the show from behind the curtains. The conspirators admit to their insidious plans in the original documents. Most of us, however, ignore the facts. This has made the 20 th century into the masonic century. These dark forces continue to lead us to destruction through their secret activities. It is high time to fight against the cynical myths of those in power, myths that are eagerly defended by the social democrats - the most ignorant but also the most dangerous of the watch dogs of freemasonry. Our entire lives are built on myths of various kinds. The most blatant myth claims that there is no conspiracy from the financial elite and the freemasonry. 557"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Honoured reader, do not put your belief in either those in power or the author of this book! Find out for yourself who may be right or wrong! Either we expose the fraud of the new world builders, or they will destroy us. Hopefully the author of this book to some extent has managed to make visible the darkness of freemasonry. Until people have seen through the architects of deception, they will continue being deceived. The more uncertain the non-freemasons are in the world, the more certain seems to be the success of the freemasons. Many readers have claimed that by reading my book \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\", they found the magic key they had been lack- ing, the key to open the doors to our political and cultural reality. Perhaps this new book will further wi den the horizons of the reader. The Swiss Philosophy Professor A. Me rcier, secretary general of the International Associations of Phil osophers, has expressed the present dead end of science and culture in the following words: \"Science has become aggressive and is trying to take a leading position in the intel- lectual sphere. It goes forth and seeks a monopoly, through its irrespon- sible neglect of everything different too easily. Since people miss art that is thought-provoking, profound, intuitive and genuine, they turn tosub- stitutes, even to drugs and pornogra phy, thus trampling all wisdom... Instead of celebrating science and cred iting it with what it lacks, we should further that process, which will enable us to recreate spiritual balance in the world of today.\" This book may help the reader to understand more easily the spiritual crisis de scribed by Professor Mercie r. Only after we have managed to break the magic of freemasonry through effective counter-measures, will we be able to escape from of the spiritual bog where we find ourselves. In Geneva in 1977, the Iroquois representative Hau De No Sa Nee stressed that \"spirituality is the highest form of political con- sciousness\". The masonic society only provides us with false hopes, harmful lies and vast inequities. The freemasons have no reverence for life. The 558"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"masonic elite has consistently stuck to the principle: to save the world, you first have to destroy it. Officially, the Swedish Order of Freemasons has a number of good intentions such as pe rsonality development, fellowship and brother- hood, and love of mankind. The reader may discover some very diffe- rent intentions based on the facts given in this book. One of the foremost proponents of Illuminati ideas was the Ameri- can political journalist Walter Lippm ann (a member of the Fabian Society, freemason). He has poin ted out the prin ciples leading forward the New World Order. When the public no longer could be controlled by the use of violence, the freemasons found a new method in the art of democratic pretence. They wish to standardize us making us ignorant and meddl esome outsiders, the confused masses, to make us believe in our leaders, those \"r esponsible men\". They want the masses to be spectat ors not participants, and this they call a democratic society. Rather than harassing people, th e masonic politicians use more sophisticated methods to manufacture consent. It used to be called propaganda. In a democratic society, this insidious propaganda is needed as never before. As early as the 1750s, the Scottish philo- sopher David Hume pointed out that power lies in the hands of the people and if the people were to un derstand this, the rulers would be in trouble. People must not realize that they have power, therefore their opinions must be controlle d. A more free coun try needs more control than a more vicious one. In the Soviet Union it did not matter if people did not believe in the propagan da. Dissidents could always be sent off to work camps. In more free countries, dissent is a dangerous thing, where people have the chance to act. When force can no longer be used, and more pe ople participate, the authorities become dependent on consensus. This is no longer a secret, as Noam Chomsky stated in an interview for Swedish Educational Television (UR) on 7 November 2 002. He stressed that the media have an un- critical belief in the current ideolo gy. He said: \"Every honest journa- list ought to try and find out the truth and spread it.\" 559"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"This is particularly important in the ostensibly normal masonic society, since most peop le are blunted and live in a state of con- sensus trance. Convincing propaga nda does not usually leave any room for alternative thinking. The freemasons want to control a nd manipulate mankind in a more effective way. In December 2002, the US Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) approved a proposal to begin injecting ID-chips into human bodies to supervise the population. Applied Digital Solutions is the company that has developed VeriChip, the size of a grain of rice and emitting a radio frequenc y of 125 kHz, which can be received at a distance of a few yards. With the help of modern technology, people carrying the chips can be monitored by satellites. The chip is injected into the body with a tool similar to a syringe. In the Spanish capital of Madrid, the intention is to supply all newborn children with an electronic chip, provided the parents agree. The chip contains informa tion about the child as well as the mother. The information is based on the fingerprints of the baby and its mother. It is injected under the skin at the wrist. The excuse for this procedure is that there is a risk of mixing up the children or of kidnapping. ID chips make it possible to iden tify the bearer by storing name, photograph, fingerprints, address, o ccupation, criminal record, tax debts and other information. The microchip can be used to induce shock, disturbed behaviour, excitement and other effects. 7mm chips are already placed under the skin of soldiers and government couriers. The key number of the microchip, as well as cash dispenser cards and bar codes is 666 - the secret code of the Illuminati. The freemasons are exercising an insidious power over people. Their surface gloria disappears, however, for those who become acquainted with the means the freem asons use to reach their goals. By their deeds we shall know them. The masonic elite has released terrible diseases, horrible suffering and devastating accidents from Pando ra's box. Hope remains, but evil can never accomplish good. 560"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"The conspirators, their followers and persons groping around in a deep state of consensus trance ar e not interested in any of the evidence that might legally bind the freemasons to the conspiracy. This book should enlighten a normally developed person. There is plenty of evidence of masonic acti vities against humanity. Here are a few more macabre examples of boastful confessions. In 1910, the French masonic periodical L'Acacia admitted:\"We have undermined, thrown down, erased and d estroyed - often i n a blind rage - to enable us to b u i l d at some time something more tasteful and stable. Since our surroundings are in ruins becau se of our activities, it is truly high time that we learn the trades of builders and become true free- masons.\" The Grand Master of the Grand L odge of France, Georges Marcou, stated in a letter to the members: \"Freemasonry shall rule the world over and from its immortal principles, inherited from one generation to the next... will be b u i l t a stable foun dation, the basis of amore perfect ideal society...\" (As declared at th e Grand Orient of France Convention in 1929) In 1991 Hans Tietmeyer, freemas on and president of the German Central Bank, explained: \"The common currency of Europe will force the people to abandon their independent fi nancial and wage policies.lt is an i l l u s i o n that the member countries would be able to keep their independence with a common tax policy.\" The freemasons present themselves as wise and honest bene- factors. It is however out of th e question that a wise and honest person would become a freemason. A member of a masonic lodge can not at the same time be wise and honest. If he is a freemason and intelligent, he can not possibly be hone st. This is particularly true of the communists. I have never met a communist who was also honest and intelligent. They are either dange rous or so-called useful idiots. Wherever the freemasons beat thei r drums, kingdoms are ruined and blood flows. By spreading despair, the freemasons satisfy their sick fantasies of founding a world republic without nationalist roots. When the different masonic groups fight each other, humanity suf- 561"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"fers. Masonic psychopaths no longer ki ll people in such numbers as they once did, but instead have attempted to turn us into useful zombies, biological robots too sick to concern ourselves with any- thing but our own problems, unable to bother about the wider issues of society. Usually, the freemasons have been successful. Most people have not yet realized that freemasonry is something of the past. They have not understood that if you act without public support, failure is certain and where great power is involved, mistakes will be disastrous. In the world of the freemasons, everything is virtual, reality is distorted. Most people see a dove as a symbol of peace, but for the Illuminati it portrays their godde ss Semiramis (originally Shammu- rama, queen of Babylon). The masonic goddess of liberty, on an island in the Seine in Paris (Ile St. Louis), where Jacques de Mo lay was executed, and the copy of it which was presented to Ne w York in 1886, are images of Semiramis holding a torch. For the public, the torch is a symbol of freedom, but for the freemasons it means control and manipulation. The main slogan for the freemasons in Pennsylvania is now: \"Share the Light!\" ( The Pennsylvania Freemason, No. 1, 2002, p. 3). This book showed how the freemasons are doing that. The Illuminati wish to be free and independent. The more freedom the freemasons acquire, the more enslaved are the non-freemasons. In order to entrap people, the freem asons have to maintain that they are the angels of light and that all talk about their evil intentions is nothing but expressions of a sick imagination. In most countries, deception has always been considered a horrible deed. The Chinese freemasons, headed by President Yuan Shikai, banned the world's oldest newspaper, King Bao, after seizing power in Feb- ruary 1912. King Bao played an important role in the history of Chinese journalism. It was founded in the year 400 and was published for more than 15 centuries without interruption ( Dagens Nyheter, 11 August 1912). This is how the freemasons defend culture and traditions! 562"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"It was characteristic that the French high-ranking freemason Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who was made heir to the Swedish throne by King Charles XIII, on his left arm had tattooed the words: \"Death to the king!\" The Swedish freethinker Lars Ad elskogh has point ed out: \"The ignorance of the people is the strength of the rulers.\" In other words, the less knowledge we have, the more power to the free- masons. Professor Charles Tart wrote: 'That humankind has fallen into the insanity of consensus trance and lost touch with our tr ue possibilities and functions is a tragedy.\" The writer George Orwell has stat ed: \"Speaking the truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.\" It seems that the masonic elite has an inkling that their time will soon be over. In the mid-1980s, I predicted in my talks that the Soviet Union would fall in the early 1990s. Only a few people took this seriously, but it happened. I now note that accord ing to the laws of karma, the freemasons have already been h it by one blow after a nother. This has all intensified, beginning from th e middle of the present decade. According to the Maya calendar, the present dark era will end on 21 December 2012. We will then move towards brighter times, when there is no place for the freemasons. We can be rid of this criminal movement. Free masonry is, as we have seen, politi cal as well as traditional criminality. When the evil of international freemasonry reache s its critical mass, freemasonry will be destroyed from within. This is a law of nature.
