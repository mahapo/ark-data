In the writing of this volume, also, the Rothschild family have brought no influence of any kind to bear ; my aim has been to portray without prejudice or partiality the tremendous part which the House played in the events of the nineteenth century . Original documents and letters that had been intercepted have occasionally afforded par- ticularly illuminating revelations ; although, in the case of extracts from some of the letters, it is necessary to bear ir~ mind that the originals were probably carefully altered by the Rothschilds themselves, with'the deliberate inten- tion of making upon persons like Metternich a definite impression such as would assist them in carrying out their plans . Seen in this light they are no less instructive and characteristic of the methods of the House than the more ingenuous documents that undoubtedly constitute a large proportion of those used in this work . I must again point out that I cannot claim to have dealt with the subject exhaustively ; but it has perhaps been possible, by means of the many thousand documents that have been collected, to present a series of varied but relevant pictures-which, in their surprising and gro- tesque effect, should give some idea of the nature, the work, the aims, and the power of this House during the nineteenth century . The Epilogue which appears at the end of the book of course makes no claim to continue the treatment of the subject on the same lines ; it merely attempts to bring out one or two of the more striking moves executed by the V"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vi \t Foreword House of Rothschild on the political chessboard during the sixty years leading up to the present day, moves which show how the House, in spite of growing difficulties, van- ishing influence, and the powerful competition of younger and richer firms, has endeavored until the most recent times to maintain its position, to influence international policies, and, although with diminishing success, to drive them along the path which corresponded to the interests of the bank .

It required the active intervention of the English branch, as being the least affected, to save the situation . Solomon had hastened to Paris from Vienna, and he and James were staying together at the actual scene of action . The most important task, that of endeavoring to maintain peace, had to be left to them . It was essential that Austria and France, whose large loans the brothers Rothschild had just irrevocably committed themselves to taking over, should be induced, in spite of the conditions in the French capital, to maintain peace, in order that the large quantity of loan certificates still lying in the Rothschild safes should rise in value and circulate again amongst the public . The brothers naturally endeavored, wherever possible, to relieve themselves of responsibilities which had become onerous in the depressed condition of the market . A suit- able occasion arose in connection with their business with Prussia, where the last transaction, the conversion of the sterling loan of 1818, 1 negotiated by the Prussian financial representative, Rother, was not to be concluded until October 8, 1832 . This was a case where they could set"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild to work to secure the cancellation of a deal which could only have been profitable under really favorable condi- tions, and in the actual circumstances was bound to result in loss, owing to the impossibility of placing public securities on any of the markets of Europe . Nathan accordingly decided that it was essential that he should recover his freedom of action in that quarter . With this end in view, he determined, without letting Berlin know what was in his mind, to secure the good- will of the Prussian treasury officials by meeting them in an important matter, as a special mark of his confidence . In connection with the loans concluded in 1818 and 1822 with the House of Rothschild, Prussia had deposited securities 'with the London bank in the form of mortgage deeds and debentures, which Nathan was not required to return until many years later, when the amortization of the debt had proceeded according to plan . Nathan provided these in September, 1830, perfectly realizing that at a time when nobody would accept them, the cer- tificates did not constitute a particularly valuable security, while Berlin would be favorably impressed by Nathan's returning them so soon, and long before he was obliged to do so . His action produced the desired effect . Rother, who was president of the Seehandlung Bank, wrote to his king in great enthusiasm saying, \"It is only the great confidence which Rothschild feels in the Insti- tute, which your Prussian Majesty has entrusted to me, that has led the banker to take this step .\" Rother did not miss this opportunity of indicating to his sovereign that he had himself rendered a valuable service . He empha- sized the fact that Nathan's action was \"all the more praiseworthy, as showing a special desire to be accommo- dating, having regard to the critical nature of the general situation .\" s But Rother was soon to perceive why Nathan had been so friendly and obliging ; for, toward the end of November, 1830, Solomon's son Anselm came to Berlin on Nathan's behalf, in order, if possible, to secure the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of 1830 \t 3 complete cancellation, or at any rate the substantial mod- ification, of the conversion agreement concluded with the Prussian government on February, 25, 1830 . Although the ground had been well prepared, it was impossible for Rother, after taking so much credit with his sovereign for the satisfactory conclusion of the agree- ment, suddenly to suggest that it should be canceled . For weeks he discussed the matter with Anselm, who brought all his powers of persuasion to bear to induce Rother to accept the Rothschilds' proposal . In mid-January Rother reported on the matter to his sovereign,' pointing out that the banking firm of Nathan Rothschild in London had been placed in an unfavorable position, through recent political events, with regard to the agreement which had been concluded in much more auspicious circum- stances . 5 \"In consequence of the financial stringency from which the whole of Europe is suffering,\" wrote Rother, \"Baron Anselm, who is still here with full powers to act on behalf of the firm, has been putting forward with growing insist- ence various proposals for the partial cancellation, or modification, of the terms of the agreement made here on February 25, 1830 . In view of the circumstances, how- ever, there can be no question of the complete or partial cancellation of the contract, such as the firm desires, and I believe that in the course of our written and verbal nego- tiations of the last month I have succeeded in persuading Baron von Rothschild that such a procedure would not be consonant with the honor of his House .\" These were fine words, but in his heart Rother had already accepted the Rothschilds' point of view and their proposals, which amounted to leaving a balance of £i,85o,ooo of 5% securities unredeemed, and post- poning to a later date their conversion to a 4 .% basis . Rother followed this emphatic statement with an entirely contrary recommendation, contriving so to gild the pill for his sovereign as to make it seem a positive advantage"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild for Prussia not to take her stand upon the letter of the contract . \"It is desirable,\" Rother further reported to his royal master, \"that these proposals should, if possible, be ac- cepted, since, in view of such future financial transactions as are under present conditions inevitable, it appears to me to be of the utmost importance to your Royal Maj- esty's finances that the Rothschild business firm should be granted every possible assistance that is consistent with the credit of the State ; and the conversion operation under discussion would obviously involve them in such heavy loss as to produce a state of acute tension . If Nathan Meyer von Rothschild's firm were to be compelled strictly to observe the dates laid down in the contract, in spite of the unfavorable conditions now obtaining, it would necessarily endeavor to sell the new 4% bonds at any price in all markets, and thereby deal a severe blow to our public credit . Our experience has taught us that financial transactions in which the von Rothschild firm act not as intermediaries, but as opponents, are apt to fall through ; and schemes entered into with men of no sub- stance, such as we unfortunately find on our Bourse here, result in nothing .\" Rother was then sold out as hopelessly bankrupt, and the exchange was depressed, whereby the Rothschilds so seemed to lose their heads that, as he cried, \"the family will have to reconcile themselves to a diminution of their wealth by three million thaler on this one transaction alone, unless business in public securities revives-a pos- sibility which appears to be exceedingly remote in view of the growing general uncertainty . \"The House of Rothschild, or rather its principal negotiator, Baron Solomon von Rothschild of Vienna, really did regard this business (at the time) simply as a matter of honor, as, even if things had gone as well as they possibly could, there was no profit to be made out of them . I cannot but regret that, as a result of the con-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of 1830 \t 5 cessions which he made, this excellent man should now have to suffer the reproaches of most of the members of his family .\" Thus, in spite of his opening words, Rother supported the Rothschilds' request, as he feared a \"damaging breach\" with the firm . King Frederick William, who had unqualified confidence in Rother, and understood noth- ing about financial matters, concurred in his recommen- dation . Anselm Rothschild perceived that there was reason to hope for far-reaching concessions, and suddenly increased his demands accordingly . He was now unwill- ing to accept any of the restrictions to which Rother had wished to subject his proposals ; and he actually began to modify some of his first proposals in his own favor, this being attributable to the influence of Nathan, who had not entirely approved of leaving the matter to the youthful Anselm, who was then only twenty-seven years old ; and at the beginning of March he sent Carl Roths- child, who was staying at Frankfort, to his assistance in Berlin . Rother was now exposed to the joint attack of a senior and a junior Rothschild, and their persistence was gradually reducing the fortress to a state where it was ready to capitulate . At the same time, in order to support his brother and his nephew in their arduous struggles in the interests of the firm, Meyer Amschel wrote from Frankfort to the Prussian finance minister, Count Lottum 11 : \"I hope that Finance Minister von Motz, of blessed memory, who knew me, gave your Honor a not wholly unfavorable impression of me ; and I hope that, never having had the opportunity of direct personal commu- nication with your Honor, your correspondence with my firm here and your other relations with them will have afforded adequate proof of my true manner of think- ing . Your Excellency will be aware that since we have enjoyed the privilege and good fortune of entering into honorable business relationship with the Prussian gov-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild ernment our efforts have been tirelessly directed to de- voting to it our best services and our whole possessions, uninfluenced by any private considerations . Though the most recent transaction has, by reason of the violent events that have shattered peace and order in many parts of Europe to their foundations, failed as yet to lead to a successful issue, so that we have to suffer not merely the disappointment of failing to carry through an opera- tion, but also have to bear a considerable loss, yet we are able to rest in the firm conviction that we can face God and the world as honorable people as far as our business methods are concerned . The decision in this, our just cause, which has been exhaustively discussed by my brother and nephew, is, according to their letters, soon to be taken . \"In taking the liberty to submit my request that the settlement of this matter may be expedited, I would excuse myself to your Excellency on the ground of the prevailing unsettled conditions, which involve me in in- numerable tasks, to attend to all of which is difficult and almost impossible to me, in view o f .m y age and failing health . I am therefore exceedingly desirous for the speedy return of my brother Carl, who has obeyed the urgent summons to go to Berlin . I regard him as my right-hand man, and find it hard to be without him . I would there- fore submissively beg your Excellency, so far as in your power lies, most kindly to assist in carrying out the wishes which I have expressed ; I cherish the firm conviction that the settlement of our business will be effected in such a manner as is to be expected of the just and loyal nature of the Prussian government . . . .\" In consequence of this letter and the constant efforts made by the two Rothschilds at Berlin, Rother finally decided to report to his sovereign that the alleviations previously granted by the king at his suggestion did not appear to be adequate . \"They make such a point,\" wrote Rother, \"of the risks to which they would be exposed"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of 1830 \t 7 in carrying out the contract of February 25, 1830, and of the loss which they would probably suffer even under the modified terms, and they find that they are so ham- pered in all their financial dealings, by the prejudicial reactions resulting from it, that they are aiming at secur- ing complete relief from the contract, and the definite fixing of the sum which they shall be called upon to sacrifice in return .\" The brothers were offering to pay a fixed sum of money' as compensation, provided that they could be entirely liberated from the obligations of the contract, though on the understanding that they should be permitted immediately to take up the business again, \"if circumstances should take a sufficiently favor- able turn to make such a course of action appear desirable to them .\" Rother advised the king to accept these further demands of the Rothschilds . \"It is only just,\" he wrote, \"not to demand greater sacrifices from this firm than is absolutely necessary in order to achieve the advantages which the state expected to achieve through the conver- sion transaction .\" He also suggested that it would not be an easy matter to force the House of Rothschild to carry out their obli- gations under the contract if they should obstinately re- fuse to do so, notwithstanding the damage to their busi- ness prestige . Moreover, such a struggle would last a long time, and would bring discredit upon the country's financial administration . He therefore recommended that all the Rothschilds' demands should be agreed to, but suggested that it should be made a condition of any new agreement that their offer should be accepted only if they undertook to participate in a further loan transaction, subject to conditions which should be discussed, and which should be adjusted to the prevailing state of affairs . It is true that Rother fully realized that such a loan transac- tion could be carried through only under entirely differ- ent conditions . \"Recent political events,\" he wrote to the king,\" \"and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild the financial stringency prevailing in all great European states, make it almost impossible at present to obtain sub- stantial sums on loan by the methods adopted hitherto . . Through the recent French loan of January, 1830, and the conversion from 5 to 4% of the Prussian debt contracted in 1818, in which latter transaction they asso- ciated a number of other banking firms with themselves, involving them in enormous losses, the von Rothschild banks have entirely lost their credit in transactions of this kind . They could not now find anybody to associate themselves with them in such a transaction, and although their wealth, even after losses estimated at 17,000,000 gulden, is still very considerable, they lack the cash neces- sary for transactions of this kind, since their property, which consists of bonds of all the European states, can- not at present be turned into money on any bourse . The Rothschild banks are therefore now refusing to take over any large loans direct, seeking, as in the case of Austria, to deal with them on a commission basis, and while they will make advances on account, they proceed to sell the newly created bonds at exceedingly low prices, thus dam- aging the States concerned .\" Nevertheless, Rother meant to try to carry through a new transaction with the Rothschild bank, involving an amount of several million thaler,a in return for bills on the Prussian treasury running over a period of years . As he himself states, he wished, in spite of all his misgivings, again to deal exclusively with the Rothschild banks, since in his opinion the Berlin banks were \"not strong enough to carry through such big transactions .\" This solution pleased the Rothschilds exceedingly . Whilst they were yet unable definitely to bind themselves to such an obliga- tion, as they realized that their business was suffering from temporary embarrassment, they did not say no ; they referred Rother to one of the other brothers (a practice they had often found useful), namely, Solomon in Vienna . They said that he would have the final decision in this"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises o f 1830 9 new transaction . There was the possibility that conditions might improve in the meantime, in which case it would be exceedingly pleasant to carry through an important deal with the state of Prussia . They were genuinely grateful to Rother . Through his decisive influence with the king he was worth his weight in gold to them . Without the Rothschilds having to bind themselves definitely to carry out the new transaction, the king agreed to everything .\" The contract of February 25, 1830, was canceled. on the payment of the penalty men- tioned above, and Rother was given a free hand and plein pouvoir to conclude a new agreement for advances with the Rothschilds, when it should be judged that a suitable time had come . Thanks to Rother's powerful support, Nathan's plan of relieving the firm in that direction had succeeded. This relief was very substantial, and with regard to the Prussian government's wish for further transactions, the Rothschilds really did mean, as soon as they saw their way clear, to apply any free cash to that purpose . They would appear to be showing their grati- tude in a practical way, and would, at the same time, be able to do a profitable bit of business . The news of these events came as a great relief also to James Rothschild, who was struggling in Paris to main- tain peace ; he was at the storm-center, and the rentes, which had fallen so sharply after the July revolution, and of which his firm held such a large quantity, were still suffering from the internal and external political dangers that threatened the new throne . Up to the present things had gone quite well . Practically all countries, in- cluding Austria, had acquiesced in recognizing the new king . The tsar had held aloof longest ; but the danger of military intervention by Europe, openly directed against Louis Philippe's usurpation of the throne, had been averted . Baron von Prokesch wrote in his diary\" on Decem- ber 17, 1830 : \"It is all now a question of ways and means,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"io \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild and what Rothschild says goes, but he won't give any money for war .\" When rentes began again to rise a little, the political situation again became disturbed, as the Paris revolution had affected Italy . In the Papal States, and in the small states of central Italy, popular indigna- tion broke out against the intolerant and inquisitorial suppression of all liberal sentiment . Early in February the Duke of Modena was driven from his country ; the end of the temporal power of the Pope was proclaimed at Bologna ; and even Marie Louise was forced to flee from her pleasant retreat at Parma . The exiled monarchs successfully begged Metternich for military assistance from Austria, while the rebels looked to France for help . They failed, however, to secure more than Platonic support in that quarter . Although France indulged in emphatic diplomatic threats, Louis Philippe was secretly exceedingly averse from entering upon hostilities which would have brought him into con- flict with one of the great Powers, which had only just recognized him . James Rothschild supported him to the utmost of his powers in his efforts to avoid such contre- temps . He remained on guard in Paris, feeling the pulses of, the king and his ministers, and sent his brothers and nephews in all quarters of the globe his terse, character- istic reports of the political condition of affairs . \"Rentes stood at 59 .25,\" he wrote, on February 14, 1831, just after news of the risings at Modena and Bo- logna had reached Paris .\" \"I am satisfied, since I find ministers all for peace, and I hope that matters will come right . The king wants peace . . . . I know that when trouble broke out in Italy, Marshal Soult wanted to take up a position on the frontier, but the king was so much opposed to this that he never mentioned the matter again ; even if Austria had intervened in the Modena affair, nothing would have happened, for it is realized that Austria would have been perfectly right in doing so, as he [Louis Philippe] is too weak . No one wants anything"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"weathering the Crises of 1830 \t II but peace, whatever they say ; we are tensely awaiting news from Italy, as we have none .\" That was what James always hungered after-news- and to get it earlier than anybody else . This was partic- ularly important just now, when one had to estimate the influence upon the bourse of any possible military inter- vention by Austria in Italy . \"We are free from worry just now,\" James wrote two days later\" to his brother Solomon, who had returned to Vienna, \"but it is not easy to judge what things will look like this evening, although everything seems settling down, and it is to be hoped that we shall be at peace again . It seems that things are not so bad in Italy . I beg you, my dear Solomon, if Austria should decide to inter- vene with regard to the Papacy, to let me know at once, as such action is certain to react unfavorably upon rentes ; the war minister told me yesterday that it would be very serious if that were to happen . Such an event might have grave consequences .\" Solomon carefully extracted these sentences from his brother's letter, to show them to Metternich, so that, in considering the question of intervention in Italy, the chancellor should realize that such action would produce a menacing reaction in France . The Rothschilds' interests were bound up with those of the bourse in the elimination of any new inflammable material, so that it was natural that they should view with dismay the appearance of a new bone of contention in Italy that appeared likely to endanger the peace hitherto maintained, contrary to Met- ternich's expectations . Yet they could not fail to appre- ciate the fact that Metternich's inveterate hatred of every- thing that was revolutionary, or opposed to the principle of legitimacy, was a more powerful factor than their in- fluence . Disregarding France's threats, Metternich sent Austrian troops across the Po to march against the rebels . This naturally produced a panic in London and Paris . Nathan in England, who had latterly been constantly"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild suffering from illness, took a much more serious view of the situation . He had no regard for the Paris ministers, least of all for the prime minister, Laffitte, the ruined banker, who had the hardihood to guide the financial destinies of a kingdom like France, after having signally failed to manage his own affairs . He expressed himself freely in a letter to his brother :\" \"Quotations have weakened because of a rumor on the stock exchange that France has declared war on Austria . I was with [name illegible] this evening, and he said, `Who can trust the French? They change every day .' Then I went to Bulow, 16 and he said : 'Rothschild, I be- lieve your brother in Paris is being misled, for the king and his ministers never keep their word ; they change every day . They write to Talleyrand 16 here . Prussia and Russia write in a friendly way, and do not want war ; the French, however, must decide for war . . . . They write this unpleasant letter to Talleyrand, who is afraid to show it, and says he hasn't had a letter .' \"In fine, they will probably carry on with intrigues until they are ready to declare war . I maintain that it is almost impossible to keep the peace unless these people destroy one another in their own country, and Laffitte, who no longerhas influence, falls from power . Ouvrard 17 has had considerable purchases made on his account ; we shall probably have better news from Paris to-morrow . \"Herries here says that Peel 18 will certainly be asked to join the ministry, that Wellington will become foreign minister, and that, unless France gives way, he is con- vinced that the British army will go to Germany . \"It would be as well for you to tell the king that he must hold himself aloof, and not trifle with England, for she is not to be trifled with . I shall go and see Talleyrand tomorrow . England has no faith in your ministers, who want nothing but revolutions, in which old Lafayette, 19 and I know not who else, assists . Your king and his min- isters have only to show that they don't want war : they"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of, 1830 3 must not change their tone from day to day . Go to the king and tell him that Peel, Palmerston, and Wellington are coming into power .\" By these last words Nathan wished to convey to his brother that the Tories would probably take the helm again in England, and that that country, therefore, was also unlikely to tolerate the support of revolutionaries in Italy or elsewhere . James, however, had received an exactly contrary report regarding developments in Eng- land from an influential French quarter . He was assured that, on the contrary, the Liberal prime minister, Grey, would remain in office with his ministry, and carry his reform bill . This view of the situation naturally gave the government in Paris more confidence, and caused it to harden in its attitude toward the conservative Powers, such as Austria . The bourse, sensitive as it was to any suggestion of war, reacted to the chilly atmosphere . \"Rentes have fallen a lot today,\" James reported to Vienna, 20 \"because there was a rumor that there would be a reform in England, and that a revolution would break out there, and that Austria had declared war ; as a matter of fact, I believe that the fact that eighty thou- sand more troops have been, or are to be, called up, and that France adopts a milder tone with Austria, indicates that Austria's intervention will not matter . England being in the position I have described, people will say here all the more emphatically . `We trust Austria will not inter- vene .' Sainte-Aulaire 21 left today with most pacific in- structions . He is to tell the revolutionaries that France is absolutely determined that Italy shall remain as she is, and Sebastiani and Laffitte are as friendly as they can possibly be . But what is the good of talking if people act the opposite . Laffitte sent for me, together with Perier, 22 Humann, Aguado, 23 and the treasury officials to see whether an operation could be arranged . He speaks confidently of peace ; if he wanted war he would not have called us together .\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"14 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Laffitte's ministry was, however, already at its last gasp . The financiers had been called in to discuss the idea of saving the French treasury at the last moment by the sale of state forests . Louis Philippe had, however, already withdrawn his confidence from the prime minister, and secretly offered his portfolio to another financier, Casimir Perier . The news which had leaked out to those who were in the know had produced a favorable reaction on the bourse, as it had long lost confidence in Laffitte . The name of Perier was as music to the ears of James Roths- child . It meant the control of affairs in France by a man who was both his personal acquaintance and his intimate business friend, and with whom he had for years dis- cussed everything affecting business or politics . De- lighted at the excellent prospects for the future, he has- tened to let his family know the good news by a special courier MY DEAR BROTHERS : 24 I am sending a courier because rentes have risen ; the three percents here closed at 53 .20, because it is generally stated that Perier will enter the ministry . I was talking to Perier this morning, and he says he will accept office only on condition that he, and not the king, is really first minister . He does not want war . I said to him, \"I am convinced in my heart that the foreign Powers are not thinking of attack- ing France, and that our good prince is doing all he can for peace . . .\" Now, my dear Solomon, you must see that if my friend Perier takes office his ministry is supported, for thirty-two million people making a revolution are a danger to all countries . \"And,\" Perier said to me, \"if people want to do something for the king they should try to give France a piece of Belgium ; that would really strengthen the king's position, but he does not press for it .\" He said to me . \"If the others will do something, we will keep peace forever .\" And now, my dear Solomon,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of 1830 \t i5 I have been seeing Perier daily for six months, and he said to me today, \"You are not making efforts for France alone, but for the whole of Europe, and you can count on my never telling you a lie .\" He is a very excellent fellow . . . .

The business men are all in agree- ment about the loan here, and I shall go with them, because I don't want to be out of it ; we can't say yet what will happen, but I am confident because of Perier, as, if we have war, he will suffer losses on his properties and factories ; for that reason I believe in peace . . . * I have had a long conversation with Soult today ; he too says, \"We ask for nothing better than to dis- arm as soon as all the armies cease from threatening us . . . .\" When we are certain of peace abroad we shall have peace at home . Perier told me that he would keep the present Chamber, and not dissolve it . . . for he can count on this Chamber . It's not cer- tain yet about Perier, for until I see a thing in the Moniteur I don't believe it . In Austria things certainly did not look like peace . The revolutionary risings throughout the world so terri- fied Metternich that, in spite of Austria's financial diffi- culties, he pressed more and more obstinately for ex- tensive military preparations .

In any case the possible gain on exchange, and the 2% commission on such a substantial amount were not to be despised . Things certainly did not look like peace, for when Austria began to arm, France naturally followed suit . It would have been difficult to say which was in the worse condition financially, but they spent money lavishly on their military preparations . In these circumstances it was particularly important to learn what kind of ministry was to be finally constituted in France . James in Paris was still anxious about his friend Perier, whose ministry was not yet assured .

He said to me, \"Nothing is settled yet, because I must have a talk with the king and explain to him that I will not take office as a war minister but as a peace min- ister, so that we can get the question of intervention properly settled ; for if Austria intervenes in the Rome affair I will not go to war .\" On news arriving that Modena had been occupied by the Austrians on the 6th, Sebastiani said to me, \"We shall certainly maintain peace .\" Now, if their inter- vention had mattered he could not have said this to me .

The position is dreadful . I shall probably send you a courier if any- thing new occurs . Yours, JAMES . James determined to throw all his influence into the scales to place Perier in the saddle . He spared no effort . He went to the king himself, and urged him to ask Perier to join the ministry . He pointed out that he was exceptionally competent and industrious, that he had pacific views, was well versed in financial matters, and was devoted to his country . Casimir Perier was actually called upon to form a min- istry on March 13, 1831, and James had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts crowned with success . In the interests of his house he had to fight for peace in Paris, as Solomon had to at Vienna, and the appointment of Perier, if it did not imply final victory, at any rate constituted a consid- erable success . He immediately reported the good news to his brothers and then turned his attention to the mar- kets, observing their reaction to this event .

Now, my dear Solomon, you are in a better posi- tion to judge, and I beg you to get this matter cleared up, I went to the king and said to him, \"My family and all my property are in France, so that I am not likely to mislead your Majesty or to lull you into a false sense of security, inducing you to believe that foreign Powers want peace when they really intend war-and on whose account? I am convinced that the Powers wish to restore order in Italy, and .feel that they cannot stand by and do nothing, when the house is being fired under them (sic) . If your Maj- esty will take Perier into the ministry, your credit will rise and everything will improve .\" Now, you see, the changes have been made . The king is going to the Tuileries, and the ministry is to make a speech proclaiming its principles .

Nathan also wrote from England to say that that coun- try, in spite of the ministry, which was Liberal and favored reform, would not merely refuse to encourage France in warlike undertakings, but would actually take drastic action if she did . \"Our government,\" Nathan wrote to Solomon, 28 who in turn hastened to pass it on to Metternich, \"has taken very strong measures against France, and these should make a very good impression throughout Europe ; that is to say, if France does not remain quiet, but takes action against the other three Powers, we shall join the three Powers, but if the other three Powers take action against France, we shall join France .\" It appeared, therefore, that England, too, wished to maintain peace . The name of the new French prime min- ister was a guarantee for the maintenance of peace throughout the world, and his first public statements in the Chamber showed that he stood for the principle of non-intervention . James sent a further enthusiastic report to his brother about these statements in the Chamber . A French loan was again being discussed ; James wanted to take part in it again, and the prospects of the loan were essentially dependent on the general political situation .

I have spoken to Werther 3° and Apponyi today ; they are exceedingly pleased with Perier's speech, and believe that their governments will certainly make every effort to strengthen the new cabinet, and Werther, who always looks on the worst side, is now quite optimistic . I therefore ask only one question- shall we maintain peace or not? If France carries out what she says, and having regard to Perier's char- acter I am sure she will, I do not see why we should not soon be disarming, and revert again to peaceful conditions . I would therefore urgently beg you, my dear Solomon, not to leave Prince Metternich any peace as to the importance of strengthening the ministry here, and pester him to maintain peace, which is so necessary to Europe, the prince alone having the power to maintain it . He knows you and realizes that you are a candid and honorable fellow, who always acts aboveboard, and that all the reports which I have sent you for his information have proved to be well founded . Yesterday morning Sebastiani 31 was in a rage, and would not permit the Austrian intervention .

This all sounded very fine, but meanwhile the Austrian troops had advanced in Italy . They were not content to occupy Modena and Parma, but marched on Bologna in pursuit of the provisional government of Modena . Bologna had also revolted, and shaken off the Papal yoke . Everyone hoped for assistance from France, but this was not forthcoming ; the Austrian troops entered Bologna, and the Papal rule was restored . This was naturally very unpleasant, both for the Paris peace ministry, which stood for the principle of non-intervention, and for James . James did everything to allay the indignation which was flaming up in Paris, and to prevent any hasty action being taken . As I have already written [James reported to his brother at Vienna a2], people here were furious when the Austrians entered Bologna ; it was not so much the occupation itself as Maison's 33 statements ; he has reported his conversations with the prince, which, it would appear, were exceedingly heated . It seems that the prince definitely said to him that they would not occupy Bologna until they had learned the result of the negotiations . That is what at first made Sebas- tiani so furious ; however now, thank God, everything is much better. Yesterday, the note was drafted which is to be sent to Austria .

I shall see that this is left out . If the prince will consider the position of the gov- ernment here, I am confident that we shall have peace, for the cabinet here is making every effort to that end . Now, my dear Solomon, do what you can to help ; the prince will see that I have truly de- scribed Casimir Perier's character . If that excellent man remains in sound health, he will act like Villele, and entirely follow out his methods, but he must have the prince's support . I hope that his Highness will be so gracious as to give you more favorable instructions, such as I can use with reference both to Casimir Perier and also to the king . Everything now depends, my dear brother, upon ascertaining whether Austria is prepared to say, \"Things are quiet in Italy now : we are evacuating Roman territory, and shall arrange a conference in Rome to which all ministers will be invited, with a view to reestablishing Italy's position\" ; this will de- cide the question of peace or war . I beg of you to answer me on all these points, for in eighteen days the loan comes up, and I want to know where I stand . France continued to be Platonically indignant about the invasion of Italy . Now that the rebels had been every- where suppressed, James felt that if only Solomon suc- ceeded in persuading Metternich to exercise greater moderation, to withdraw his troops, and to settle the questions in dispute, more particularly in the Papal States, by means of a conference of ambassadors, much would have been achieved ; they would then have reason to hope that the peace of Europe would not be disturbed,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Weathering the Crises of 1830 \t 23 at any rate through the Italian trouble . But Italy was unfortunately not the only center of disturbance . Bel- gium, who after the July revolution had freed herself from her unnatural union with Holland, was also strug- ling to maintain her independence, and hoping for French assistance . The eastern Powers, led by Austria and Russia, looked askance upon this revolutionary movement too . Metternich would dearly have liked to send troops into Belgium and Poland, as he had done into Italy ; but this would have made war with France inevitable . England, who was not prepared to see a coun- try so close to her islands under the rule of France or anybody else, proved a determining factor in this matter . The Conference of London, which dealt with the ques- tion of Belgium's independence and her king, induced France to modify her demands with regard to Belgium, and the Perier ministry were more ready to agree to these concessions. The French gave up their suggestion of plac- ing the son of Louis Philippe on the throne of Belgium, and proceeded seriously to consider Prince Leopold of Coburg, the candidate proposed by England . How- ever, Belgium would not concur in the boundaries which had been fixed for her, or on the question of Luxem- burg . Metternich was pleased by France's moderation, and James and Solomon were no less so . The government in Paris had sent a note to Austria which as James put it, 84 \"was happily phrased\" ; he expected that when it reached Vienna Metternich would be pleased with it . James hoped that the confidence which Metternich had in Casi- mir Perier would be further justified, and that the Bel- gian affair would pass over without seriously endanger- ing peace . Things certainly did not look well in Belgium . The news from that country sent the 3 % French rentes down to 46.70 on April i, 1831, a fact which James sadly re- ported to his brother Solomon . Paris wanted the Austri- ans to evacuate Papal territory as speedily as possible ."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"2¢ \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The prospects of peace varied from day to day, and James was anxiously watching the political barometer, and the reactions of the sensitive bourse . At the beginning of April reassuring news was received from Italy and Belgium ; although it was not justified by the facts, French rentes immediately rose in value . \"I have just been with Perier,\" James wrote to his brother in Vienna, on April 9, 183 1,\" \"and he said to me, `I am sorry to see rentes rising so much, because things are still very unsettled . Apponyi's dispatches could not be more satisfactory, but one cannot help wishing that the Austrian forces would evacuate Italian territory as speedily as possible . Yes, my dear Rothschild, we must show that there is confidence in us abroad too ; come and see me tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, and we will discuss the matter at length . We desire and intend peace . Do reassure Prince Metternich on this point . The news from Belgium is not too good ; they are unwilling to accept the protocol of the loth, and would rather go to war . I will not stand aloof, but will act with the Allies ; this question, which may be an occasion for war, must be settled, and we are doing our best .' Now, my dear Solo- mon, I believe that rentes may rise to 6o, but they might fall again, because the situation is absurd . The signa- tures for underwriting rentes at ioo% are coming in strong, but how can the total of 120 millions be reached?\" Metternich did, in fact, give way in Italy, because he did not, after all, want to endanger Perier's peace min- istry, which might have been succeeded by a chauvinistic one . There was a powerful anti-war party within Austria too . It enjoyed the support of the Archduke Carl, as well as that of Metternich's opponent, Count Kolowrat, min- ister of the interior, and of Baron von Kiibeck, who kept pointing out the acute financial distress resulting from this continued military expenditure .

Metternich also was not uninflu- enced by the fact that the considerable hopes which he had had of Russia were not being realized . The Russians, against whom the Poles were putting up a stiff fight, made hints to Prussia and Austria in April, 1831, that they should join in the campaign against the Poles, and such was Metternich's affection for the con- servative tsar that he was for a time inclined td lend a sympathetic ear to these suggestions . He tried to adum- brate this idea at a ministerial conference\" at which Count Kolowrat was present, but Solomon Rothschild had already heard of this scheme, and realized all the diplomatic complications involved . He was on good terms with Count Kolowrat too ; now that his intimate friend Metternich was contemplating a line of action that did not fit in with his plans, he went straight to Kolowrat to warn him against the Russian adventure, and to beg him to use all his influence against it at the conference, with the result that Kolowrat, who welcomed any opportunity of opposing Metternich, spoke emphatically against it . Metternich's attitude at this time led Baron von Kiibeck to make the following remark about him,'\" : \"Prince Metternich is an absolute weathercock, constantly veer- ing between Tatistchev [Russian ambassador at Vienna] and war, and Solomon and peace .\" Belgium continued to be a center of unrest . The Bel- gian Congress refused to have anything to do .with the Luxemburg question, or any of the other provisions of the protocol January 20, 1831 . A few hot-blooded orators were for throwing down the gauntlet to the rest of Europe, and the Dutch collected a menacing army, on the northern frontier of Belgium . Louis Philippe was represented at the Belgian regency by a special envoy, General Belliard, and the reports which he sent were dis- turbing . The effect was soon felt in Paris . \"Rentes,\" James wrote to Vienna on April i 1, 1831, 88 \"had risen-the 376 to 59 and the 517 o to 89 .

This is all due to Belgium, and General Belliard, who has returned from Brussels, having re- ported that the Belgians are determined to march into Luxemburg, to go to war with the whole world, and not to give way on any point ; their heads having been turned largely by Poland's attitude to Russia . \"Perier and Sebastiani both tell me that they mean to stick to the Allies, and will not let the Belgians force them into war, but people here are afraid that the gov- ernment may not be strong enough to restrain the nation, and that war may be the result . \"I must tell you, my dear Solomon, that I immediately read out your letters to Perier, lest it should be said that Austria withdrew her troops from Italy on receiving a note from France ; and he was very pleased .\" The Belgian problem was still a difficulty, and was to lead to further dangerous crises and complications . The French ministry, however, felt that it was much more secure, and it had the best possible reason for sat- isfaction, for the 120 million loan, which had scarcely seemed a practical proposition at 70, was actually being issued at 8i .5o . \"The Company,\" reported James, 39 \"yesterday took over the loan at 84 (this means 8i .5o for the public) at the repeated requests of the government .

Unfortunately the Polish affair is some- what going to the heads of the French, but it does not affect Perier, whom I saw early today, and who was absolutely delighted after yesterday's meeting of the Chamber, in which he carried his electoral law by a majority of three hundred . The session is now closing, and we shall have a general election .\" Nathan was not so happy . He was troubled about Bel- gium, about Portugal, where Don Miguel was giving trouble, and about Grey's reform bill . He, too, was of opinion that everything would turn out all right, \"but,\" he said at the end of his report, 41 \"unfortunately every trivial political occurrence upsets the business com- munity .\" Nevertheless, the Belgian problem seemed to be on the verge of settling itself, through the choice of that clever prince, Leopold of Coburg . He was the candidate favored by England, and was looked on with more favor by France since he had become the suitor of the French king's daughter . \"I am very pleased,\" James wrote to Vienna on June 2, 18 3 1,\"' \"that we can now have the satisfaction of sending you better news .

Herein lay the seeds of a first-class European complication . Sebas- tiani, the French minister for foreign affairs, said to Rothschild at this time ; 43 \"Try to prevent Austria from arming so openly and intensively .\" The Brussels deputies had traveled to London in order to discuss the detailed conditions regarding the assump- tion of the government by their newly elected king . They were still unwilling to recognize the decision of the con- ference, in accordance with which Luxemburg and Lim- burg were to be alloted to Holland . Nathan Rothschild immediately called on the delegates in London, and learned from them that they had instructions to offer to Holland a monetary indemnity for leaving these two territories to Belgium . For on this point the Belgians re- fused to yield . James in Paris took a wholly favorable view of the situation . His view was that the Coburger was not a parti- zan, either of England or of France, who would gladly have Belgium in her pocket . The most important thing, after all, was that the 3 % rentes stood at 60 .70 and the s% at 89, i .e ., somewhat higher . His only anxiety was that the reinstated Duke of Modena who was carrying out an extreme policy of revenge and reaction, should again become a source of trouble . \"In any case, everything is very uncertain,\" wrote James .\" \"Rentes are rising and falling five points at a time, and we must keep our heads .

He proceeded to Brussels in accordance with his promise, although he could count only on Eng- land and France, and was assured of the hostility of the eastern Powers and the King of Holland . The course of events, which appeared to be converging on a satisfactory conclusion, was gratifying to James as establishing the success of the conservative ministry, \"my ministry,\" as he called it, when writing confidentially to his brothers . The Chamber had just been dissolved, and the country had been asked to express its opinion through an election . The result was an unqualified success, and the new Chamber contained a large majority in support of the ministry . \"This result is all the more remarkable,\" Count Ap- ponyi wrote to Metternich from Paris, \"since the gov- ernment refrains from making any attempt to influence the electors . Baron Rothschild, qualified elector in the department of Seine-et-Oise, who controls fifteen to twenty votes in respect of his property at Ferrieres, told the ministers that he was prepared to use his influence with his people against the election of General Lafayette . They thanked him for his offer, but asked him to refrain from doing so . To act thus at a highly critical moment implies no small faith in one's lucky star .\" 4a \"I have the satisfaction, my dear brother,\" James wrote to Solomon, 46 \"of being able to regard the course of events much more calmly, according to all the informa-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"3 0 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild tion I receive, and I have every reason to hope that the horizon, which is still dark, will shortly brighten .\" James spoke in terms of the highest praise of Perier's ministry, although he fully realized that the ministry had to con- tend with bitter foes at home, and had to deal with passions, ambitions, and vanities . Up to the present, how- ever, he said that it had fought loyally and worthily for general peace and harmony among the Powers, which constituted the main interests of the French nation and the whole of Europe . \"Our ministry,\" James wrote, \"will derive great strength from the satisfactory solution of the Belgian problem . Anarchy in Belgium provided our anarchists with a field of operations from which they could pre- pare the ruin of France ; and now we see Belgium settling down and organizing herself . . . . Prince Leopold will soon arrive to take possession of his throne . Peace will be established in Belgium, and disorderly elements will be firmly dealt with . At the same time we have to reckon with the fact that there will be an opposition of iso members, some of them clever and eloquent, others full of ambition and cunning . They will be bold and enter- prising, and, having the benefit of unlimited freedom of the press, will be supported by their insolent and per- fidious journal . They will give the ministry no quarter, and we shall have to wait and see how events will de- velop .\" James had every reason not to feel entirely r eassured . i n spite of all the promising indications . The main crisis in Belgium was still to come, and involved the danger of a mighty conflict between the eastern and western Powers . King Leopold's arrival at Brussels was more than the Dutch could stand, and on August 2, 1831, they gave notice that the armistice was at an end, and marched on Belgium with a strong force .

Good-by, my dear brother, don't worry, the world is not going under . I feel satisfied that the Chamber will get over its foolishness .\" To James's great satisfaction the rumors of a change of ministry came to nothing, Perier remained in office, and succeeded skilfully in allaying the indignation of Austria and Prussia, from whom immediate military in- tervention was generally feared, by the declaration that the troops would be recalled home as speedily as possible . The Conference of London also intervened at once, and with energy, on behalf of peace . As early as the 5th of August, James wrote to say\" that the whole world be- lieved that the difficulties in Belgium would speedily be ended by the strong and prompt measures that had been taken . \"Yesterday's alarm on the bourse,\" he continued, \"that Prussia would send troops to the assistance of the Dutch, has entirely passed, and, on calm reflection, one cannot but realize that Prussia is, of all Powers, least in a position to demand war, and has done most to avoid it .

It is, however, to be hoped that, when the King of Holland sees the British fleet and the French army, he will give way .

Prussia decided against intervention, and Metternich was restrained from military adventures by the elements in his own country which were opposed to such distant expeditions, by an outbreak of cholera at Vienna in August, and last, but not least, by Solomon Rothschild's constant admonitions against military inter- vention . Joint action by France and England had effec- tively checked the King of Holland, and the final solu- tion of the Luxemburg and other territorial problems had been deferred to a later date . For many more years these constituted a bone of contention between Belgium and Holland, and resulted in a crisis some years later, to which further reference will be made . The most im- portant thing for the House of Rothschild was that the general European war was avoided, in spite of these, and any subsequent, revolutionary disturbances . The two states whose loans the brothers Rothschild car- ried in their portfolios did not become involved in any warlike adventures on a large scale, and the small mili- tary operations they undertook were soon over .

He had always done what he could do to assist in maintaining peace, his methods dis- playing the most consummate ingenuity . James had been positively everywhere . He was to be seen in the rooms of the king and of the ministers, in the political salons of the capital as well as on the bourse, and at the meetings of industrialists and business men who controlled the economic life . He was always the advocate of peace and discretion . The House of Rothschild as a whole had really reason to be thankful to him at that time . It was largely due to his efforts that the House was able to meet all the due claims made upon it, even at this difficult period . At the beginning of the year 1832, the crisis in the firm's fortunes-which began with the July revolution -might be regarded as weathered . An important asset contributing to this result had been the unique position which James had so rapidly achieved at the court of the French king, and among those whom he had called in to assist in the government . The French prime minister often told James, before anyone else, of important meas- ures of the French government, and, for instance, repeat- edly informed him of the substance of a royal speech to the Chamber the day before it was delivered .\"' The credit of the House of Rothschild had suffered only tem- porarily ; the difficult times were now over, and the repu- tation which the firm enjoyed for solidity and financial power, even under the most adverse conditions, was again secured throughout Europe ."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II \"The Road to the King of Financiers\" T HE avoidance of a first-class European crisis, and the relief afforded by the gradual recovery of rentes, made it possible for the House of Rothschild again gradually to enter into loan transactions with states and private individuals, subject, it is true, to special precau- tions and limitations . As early as the middle of May, 1831, Solomon and Carl Rothschild proceeded to put into ef- fect the arrangement for making advances to Prussia, which had been promised when times should improve, on the cancellation of the old agreement . A contract was entered into for gradually providing an advance of 3,000,- ooo thaler, and 500,000 were immediately paid to the Preussische Seehandlung on account . At that time Prussia was as sadly in need of money as Austria, for although war did not result, both states had embarked upon ex- pensive military preparations . This was especially true of Austria . As early as February, 1831, that country, instead of realizing an expected surplus, had already incurred a deficit of 22,000,000 gulden, as the result of extra military expenditure, and in the course of the year this sum in- creased to, roughly, 85,ooo,ooo gulden, in consequence of the additional expenditure on armaments that Metter- nich kept demanded . As KU beck, who sharply criticized Metternich's action, put it, there was no way out, except by \"the road to the king of financiers .\" The four banks, under the leadership of the House of Rothschild, gave Austria a loan of 30,000,000 gulden at a discount of zo%, but made it an express condition that they should be 34"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 35 relieved of any responsibility 1 in the event of war . The Rothschilds thereby achieved a double object : on the one hand, they secured a piece of business which would be profitable under peace conditions, and, on the other hand, made wise by their former experiences, they ob- tained an insurance against the war policy of Metternich, which they disliked ; for this clause would, on a declara- tion of war, immediately deprive the chancellor of the advantages of the loan . This, however, did not satisfy Metternich, and he racked his brains for a means of obtaining ready money . He remembered the ao,ooo,ooo francs which in 18i5 had been set aside out of the French war indemnity for the purpose of building a German federal fortress, and which had been left on deposit with the brothers Rothschild at 3Y2% interest . The money, however, belonged to the whole German Federation, and not merely to its leading members, Austria and Prussia . But Rothschild was a confidential banker of these two states, and they both had an interest in obtaining cash . They soon came to an arrangement for taking the money into their own control, on the pretext that, in spite of repeated demands, the Rothschilds had not provided any security for the considerable amount involved . It suddenly became ap- parent that general conditions were such that the credit even of the most firmly established businesses could be easily undermined, and that the Rothschilds could pro- vide security only in paper, and not in tangible effects, as they were not possessed of any . The two \"administer- ing\" states therefore felt that they had no alternative but to take the money into their own control . There was one serious difficulty about this : they did not wish to say anything to the Federal Diet about it, as objections might be raised . It was therefore arranged that the Rothschilds should apparently keep control of the money as hereto- fore . The Rothschilds understood the position perfectly, and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild exploited it for obtaining favorable counter-conditions . The transaction was concluded ; Austria and Prussia each received half the money, while the Rothschilds remained debtors to the Confederation, and Austria and Prussia guaranteed the payment to Rothschild only if the neces- sity should arise . In actual fact, it was not until the year 1846 that they repaid these moneys to the federal treasury . In addition to their transactions with government, the House of Rothschild was receiving numerous requests for loans from private persons, especially the Vienna and Frankfort branches, which received applications from the higher German and Austrian nobility, so many of whom were heavily in debt and living beyond their means . Prominent among these were the requests of Prince Paul Anton von Esterhazy, Austrian ambassador in London, who was a great-grandson of Haydn's famous patron, and notorious for his extravagant manner of life . He had inherited the expensive and magnificent passions of his equally extravagant father, but he was the special favorite of Chancellor Metternich . As a result of his enormous expenditure, which was the talk of the whole of London, he fell more and more heavily into debt, and had to have recourse to loans which, in the end, seriously imperiled even his colossal inheritance . In June, 1831, Metternich decided to approach Solo- mon Rothschild, and begged him for advice regarding the financial settlement of Esterhazy's affairs . He natu- rally meant that Rothschild should grant a further loan, and remarked that the prince's brother-in-law, the Prince of Thurn and Taxis, might stand security . Rothschild replied to Metternich that he felt that, having regard to the discredited state of the Esterhazy family property, it would be exceedingly difficult to negotiate a mortgage on it, in spite of the guaranty of the Prince of Thurn and Taxis . \"My humble advice would be,\" Solomon wrote,' \"that, as the Prince of Thurn and Taxis seems to have the noble desire to lend a helping hand to his brother-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" 37 in-law, he should decide to make the loan himself . . . . My firm at Frankfort-on-Main, which for many years has had the honor of having dealings with the House of Thurn and Taxis, would carry through this business with all the more enthusiasm if his Highness should request us to do so, because it is particularly devoted to all the parties interested .\" Although the Rothschilds always endeavored to be of service to important families, this reply shows what cau- tion they exercised . They contrived, however, so to treat those who applied to them that they felt under an obliga- tion to the House, even when it did not fully meet their wishes . This is well illustrated by the introductory words in a letter written about this time by Prince Esterhazy to Solomon Rothschild .' \"As your friendly feelings to my House are well-known to me,\" the letter ran, \"and as you have accepted my invitation to come and see me and have shown your sym- pathy in my financial affairs, and have also assured me of your readiness to assist me and my son with your advice and help, I cannot but feel grateful to you . You are well known for your exceptional qualities, and your only pleasure is to do good and be helpful, so that I can- not but hope for the best .\" Rothschild dealt with this letter, as far as Metternich was concerned, by assuring the writer that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to collaborate in the settle- ment of the Prince Esterhazy's affairs, with the approval of Prince Metternich . Rothschild hardly ever did any- thing of this kind without first obtaining a definite state- ment from Metternich, as in that way he had a kind of additional insurance if anything went wrong . As a general rule, proposals sponsored by Metternich were always fa- vorably considered by the Rothschilds, for, while they were rarely losers by any \"accommodation\" they granted, they nearly always followed it up by asking a favor for themselves ."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The Rothschilds had long been handicapped by the fact that, while as foreign Jews they were tolerated at Vienna and in the monarchy's territories-and through their riches and ingenuity they had won access even to the highest circles-yet they were subject to certain hamper- ing restrictions imposed upon the Jews . The most serious of these was that Jews were not allowed to acquire any real property within Austria . Solomon Rothschild was still living in the hotel Zum Romischen Kaiser, although it is true that he and his clerks had taken over the whole hotel . Besides, during the crises of the July revolution they had been seriously embar- rassed by the fact that their enormous property consisted almost entirely of paper securities, the value of which was far too dependent upon the vagaries of the bourse, and upon war and rumors of war . Solomon pondered on a way out of this difficulty, and it was not long before he approached Metternich with another request . As was his practice in such cases, Solomon began by enumerat- ing the services which his House had performed for the state of Austria . MOST GRACIOUS CHANCELLOR, ----A When his Majesty, the Emperor, by his letters patent of the year 1822, was pleased to elevate me and my brothers to the estate of hereditary barons, we felt that we could flatter ourselves that we must, situated as we were then, have given some proof of our devotion to the sacred person of his Majesty and the most noble House of Austria, in order to have deserved his gracious notice . As we look back upon the time that has since elapsed, and call to mind the various services which in the intervening period we have had the good for- tune to be called upon to render to the Govern- ment, we feel that, without being immodest, we may ourselves bear witness to the fact that we have not merely continued to be worthy of the favors so gra-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 39 ciously conferred upon us in the past, but have per- haps also earned some further claim upon the grace of his Majesty the Emperor . Your Highness, under whose benevolent auspices it has mainly been our good fortune to exercise our activities in his Majesty's service, has had a special opportunity of appreciating the value of any services we may have rendered . I shall therefore refrain from wearying you with a lengthy repetition of facts, but shall confine myself to the simple statement that, in all major operations undertaken by the Treasury during this period for establishing the credit of the State by measures that were both wisely and boldly conceived by the Treasury, the part played by us was always of relatively great importance, since we applied all our resources to insuring their success . The Treasury is also well aware that at the most difficult times I have always been ready to devote my best efforts to his Majesty's service . Finally, your Highness is alone in a position graciously to esti- mate the extent to which my House may, apart from its commercial activities, through its other connec- tions, have been in the fortunate position to render useful services to the Imperial Government . . . The request that I am now venturing to make on behalf of myself and my brothers is that we should be most graciously permitted to purchase estates and other real property within the boundaries of the Aus- trian monarchy . I am well aware that this request is contrary to the provisions of the law . His Majesty may, however, of his grace, make exceptions in indi- vidual cases, and I feel that, if your Highness will represent to his Majesty in a favorable light such circumstances as may speak in our favor, your kind intercession should not fail to prevail upon the most benevolent and most just of monarchs to grant our humble petition . Our hope 'that this request may be granted is strengthened by the fact that in putting it forward"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild we are not influenced by the ambition of achieving greater prestige, our sole object being one that his Majesty must regard as being perfectly legitimate, namely, to convert a part of the wealth with which a kind Providence has blessed us into a form in which it will be remunerative whatever vicissitudes may befall us, and whatever may be the fate of the rest of our property, so that we may be able to lease at least a part of it firmly secured to our successors . We further desire, if his Majesty should grant our request, to be permitted to create entailed estates in respect of the properties to be purchased, these to be heritable only in the direct male line of each of the five brothers of the family Rothschild . . . . We feel we should not altogether refrain from pointing out that the Government will find the grant- ing of our humble request to be not wholly inconsis- tent with its own advantage, since it cannot regard with indifference the possibility of attracting con- siderable capital sums to the country which will become subject to taxation ; and it must be keenly interested to see landed property passing into the hands of owners who command the means . . . through the control of greater capital resources, of producing beneficial effects upon trade and industry . This request was entirely opposed to the current law ; it involved the making of another exception, which was bound to provoke considerable dissatisfaction among other Jews, for it was certainly not proposed to grant this to them all . Metternich was strongly in favor of grant- ing it, as the Rothschilds proposed to acquire property in Austria to the value of several million, and he felt that they would be more under his control if they had such considerable real property in the country, but it was necessary first to consult several other departments . As was so often the case, this request was pigeonholed, and in the end it fell into the background owing to the cholera"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 41 epidemic, which reached Vienna at the beginning of summer, and spread in an alarming way . This disease, which was a particularly serious menace in the condition of medical science at the time, had 'ap- proached the city from the north . The first cases oc- curred in the middle of August, and produced a positive panic among the ruling classes at Vienna, especially as the emperor's personal physician, Stifft, who was the supreme authority in health matters in the monarchy, had given an assurance that the illness would never reach Vienna, and did not admit that it was infectious 1 The helplessness and ignorance of the doctors was absolutely indescribable . All doctors in the government service were compelled, against their convictions, to accept Stifft's view .' But when, to the discomfiture of the emperor's physician, the first cases occurred at Vienna, the imperial family were thrown into a state of complete panic . The majority of the members fled to the provinces, while the emperor and the rest of the court cut themselves off com- pletely at Schonbrunn from the rest of the world . Count Kolowrat, Metternich's rival, took refuge at Ischl . Gentz's intimate relations with the Rothschilds had lately developed into the habit of a daily conversation . When, however, on August 1 4, after a visit to his be- loved Fanny Elssler, he called on Solomon Rothschild at the Romische Kaiser, as his custom was, to discuss politics and business, he was told that the baron had left Vienna the day before on account of the cholera, and had left his manager, Goldschmidt, in charge . Metternich alone showed on this occasion, as usual, that he was not affected by panic, and that he was a man of personal courage . He remained quietly at Vienna, and availed himself of the opportunity of getting everything into his own hands, and stealing a march on Kolowrat . Kolowrat's flight had provoked the emperor's displea- sure, but it required an official letter from the emperor to bring him back to Schonbrunn . He immediately op-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild posed Metternich's policy again, asserting that the po- litical unrest and financial difficulties which Metternich occasioned by his eternal military expenditures were, to- gether with the cholera, proving the ruin of Austria . Under these conditions it would have been untimely to have put forward the Rothschild petition, and it there- fore remained in its pigeonhole . During the next few months, business was more or less at a standstill at Vienna . Carl Rothschild at Naples, how- ever, was engaged in carrying through a loan transaction which was completely in harmony with Metternich's po- litical system, and which is specially noteworthy, having regard to the position of the borrower . The spiritual head of the Church, the Pope, was to follow the example of so many monarchs and princes of Christendom and contract a loan with the Jewish House of Rothschild on behalf of the Papal States . The various risings in the Papal States, which had followed upon the July revo- lution, and had necessitated the intervention of Austrian troops in order to reestablish the temporal power of the Church, compelled the Holy See to take precautions against the repetition of such occurrences . This too called for military expenditure, and Metternich advised it ; but a great deal of money was required, and the papal finances were at that time completely disorganized . It was im- possible further to increase the burdens of taxation upon a discontented people ; the only way was to have recourse to a loan, and this was not an easy matter . Various quar- ters were sounded, but always without success . There- upon, two ladies of the high nobility, who were devoted to the Holy Father, were commissioned to find means of obtaining such a loan .' They were the Duchess Bassano in Paris, and the Countess Stephanori in Rome . On her list of financiers to be called upon, the duchess in Paris found the name of James Rothschild, while the countess in Rome found that of Carl Rothschild of Naples, who at that time was constantly traveling between Frankfort"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" 43 and Naples . The countess wrote to ask him to come to Rome to discuss a financial matter of the highest im- portance . Carl guessed what it was about ; he wanted, first to discuss the matter with his brother in Paris, and he also preferred to conduct the first negotiations, if any, by letter, in order to prepare the ground in advance . He therefore put off his journey to Rome . The Austrian minister at Naples, Count Lebzeltern, who was in con- stant personal touch with Carl Rothschild, reported to Vienna that the Pope was obviously in great financial difficulties, and that Carl Rothschild did not show any keen desire to lend his money to the Pope . He had there- fore been thinking of a way out by which the business could be carried through by substituting for the Papal States, Naples, as being a more reliable debtor . The king- dom of the Two Sicilies had long wished to acquire the principalities of Benevento and Ponte Corvo, which be- longed to the Papal States . Carl Rothschild proposed that Naples should purchase these from the Pope, and that he should advance the purchase price to the state of Naples . The Holy See, however, would not agree to this, on the ground that it could not surrender any portion of the territory of 'the Patrimonium Petri without breaking its oaths. There followed a period of intensive negotiations between Carl Rothschild, Naples, and the Papal States ; but it was easy to see that Carl Rothschild was playing for time, and waiting for the political situation in Europe to clear up, and for generally peaceful conditions to return . \"He shows,\" observed Count Lebzeltern, 7 \"little in- clination to make his firm solely responsible for a busi- ness of such importance, and one that, in view of pre- vailing conditions, involves so much risk .\" Metternich was dismayed by this report . He was exceedingly anxious to provide the Pope with the means necessary to reestab-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"q-¢ \t The Reign o f the House o f Rothschild lish in the rebellious provinces what Metternich called \"authority, order and peace .\" The chancellor therefore decided to make a personal appeal ; he invited Solomon to his house, and explained to him the importance which Austria attached to the conclusion of the papal loan . Metternich begged the banker to use his influence with his brothers, especially with the one at Naples, so that they might make every possible effort to carry the matter through . He also instructed Count Apponyi, in Paris, to take similar steps with regard to James . James was, at the moment, negotiating with the Roman Banker, Torlo- nia, who had traveled to Paris, and who had offered to take up half the loan, since the House of Rothschild would not deal with the whole amount . Apponyi went to the two bankers, and made proposals in accordance with Metternich's instructions . The final result was that the Pope received his loan from the two bankers jointly . James reported this to Apponyi with great delight . \"From the start,\" he wrote,' \"we were exceedingly anx- ious (empresses) to see our name associated with the flotation abroad of a loan for the Roman State . The fact that your Excellency sponsored it, and that we were in- formed that Austria was interested in its conclusion, merely served as a strong additional spur to us in our efforts to carry the matter through (embrassions chaude- ment cette affaire) . We are happy that we have succeeded in settling this matter, and we doubly congratulate our- selves, as we are simultaneously carrying out the inten- tions of His Holiness's Government and the wishes of the Austrian Government .\" t Nevertheless, James had misgivings . He feared that the Papal States would not punctually carry out their obligations with regard to interest payments, and urged Austria to exert pressure upon the papal government in his direction . \"When we undertook this loan, thereby assuming a very heavy responsibility to the public, who will associate"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 45 our name with this business, we naturally counted upon the fact that the Holy See would appreciate the impli- cations of the responsibility we have undertaken, and the extent of its responsibilities, and the degree to which its credit will depend upon a strict and punctual perform- ance of its obligations . It would be absolutely impossible for it to obtain any further credits or any further assist- ance whatever abroad if it were to fail in any way in carrying out its obligations with the utmost punctuality .\" The reason why James was worried was that there were rumors current that, in the case of former loans, the papal government had, on occasion, suspended interest payments . James emphasized the fact that punctual pay- ments were the life-blood of credit, and that they alone would make it possible in future, in a case of necessity, to obtain new money . James further turned the situation to account by calling attention to the condition of his Jewish coreligionists in Roman territory, expressing a hope that their conditions would be improved as a result of the loan. He stated in conclusion that the fact that Austria . had given his House a kind of moral guaranty that the Papal government would conscientiously observe its obligations, had given him the confidence necessary to invite other capitalists to take part in the scheme ; and he did not omit to convey the usual impression-that an arrangement which, after all, involved a substantial profit for his firm, constituted a political favor for which the Rothschilds were entitled to the gratitude of the states concerned . Solomon, who was still staying at Munich, which had not yet been visited by the cholera, expressed his satis- faction to Metternich at the conclusion of the arrange- ment . \"As your Highness,\" he wrote to the Chancellor,' \"has shown so much interest in the welfare of the Roman State, and has seen fit to concern yourself particularly for the loan, it will give me especial satisfaction if the arrangements work smoothly, now that the matter has"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild been settled, so that confidence, contentment, peace, and tranquillity may be firmly established in the Roman State .\" The loan enabled the papal government to raise a small army of a few thousand men for the better security of its temporal power ; but the affair aroused considerable comment in the Christian world, especially when Pope Gregory XVI received Carl Rothschild in audience on January io, 1832, conferred upon him the ribbon and star of the newly founded Order of St . George, and per- mitted him to kiss his hand instead of his toe . And yet Rothschild did not even have himself baptized in return . Baron von KU beck noted these occurrences in his diary, with some extremely malicious comments .\" The much- dreaded wit, critic, and journalist, M . G . Saphir, might well have exercised his sharp tongue upon them . Saphir had made his position impossible in most of the places where he had lived and written ; at Pesth . Berlin, and Munich . He made so many enemies by his pointed and satirical style of writing that he was forced, as a result of assaults and unpleasantness of various kinds, to leave one town after another, and consequently soon found himself in material difficulties . He was an ugly little man with sharp features . His bald head had but one wisp of flaming red hair, which gave him a faunlike appearance .\" He wrote with extraordinary facility, and his output was considerable . He was insanely vain, and violently persecuted anyone who showed him ill-will . When he had money he spent it recklessly in giving most magnificent parties . Rothschild and Sina often footed the bill for such en- tertainments, for the very good reason that it paid better to have him as a \"dear\" friend than as a cheap enemy . The drain, however, grew irksome as time went on, and Solomon Rothschild began to wonder how the fellow, who was always short of money, could be provided for, and at the same time muzzled .

When, toward the end of 1831, .Saphir again came to the banker, and complained of his lack of funds, Rothschild put this proposition to him, and asked him to state definitely whether he would agree to the condition that he should devote his talents to the good cause-i .e ., Metternich . Saphir asked for a short time for consideration, and next day sent a letter to Rothschild clearly outlining his position \"With reference to our conversation of yesterday,\" he wrote, 12 \"there may be a certain advantage in my putting my ideas into writing, as some of them, if put verbally, might convey the suggestion of flattery . . . .

He was moved to tears when he heard your High- ness's kind opinion . \"I feel I must say that the request in Herr Saphir's letter that the arrangement should be made to apply over a certain period is not unreasonable ; in my opinion, two to three years should be sufficient to try the experiment, and at the end of that time one could further consider how he could best be made use of . If your Highness should be pleased to grant him a couple of thousand gulden a year, so that he could draw five hundred gulden quarterly, as he has no means and his business involves a certain amount of expenditure, I believe that he would not have been acquired at too high a price, and he him- self would be satisfied . If your Highness is prepared favorably to consider this suggestion I should be glad to have your decision at an early date, as, owing to the cholera, I cannot foresee how long I shall still remain here [in Munich] .\" Metternich agreed to take Saphir into his service, and proposed first to offer him fifteen hundred to two thou- sand gulden for a year, on probation . Saphir asked that the period should be extended to three years, and Roths- child successfully supported his request . Thus Saphir secretly entered the service of the Austrian government, for the matter was at first kept a secret between the three"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 49 persons concerned . His readers were certainly much astonished by the changed note in Saphir's writings, but Rothschild was highly pleased with what he had done . He had achieved a triple object : first, he had secured a substantial salary for a period of some years for a fellow Jew with dangerous gifts, who had been a constant drain on his purse ; secondly, he could show Metternich that he had gained a redoubtable writer for his cause ; and thirdly, he had secured himself against possible attacks in that quarter, as he could reasonably count on Saphir's gratitude . About this time Rothschild succeeded in rendering another important service-a personal one . In 1831 the chancellor had married his third wife, the beautiful and vivacious Countess Melanie Zichy-Ferraris, whose family were often embarrassed owing to their extravagance . The Emperor Nicholas of Russia, who had known the Zichys since the Congress of Vienna, lent her four hundred thou- sand francs, which he converted into a present on Metter- nich's marriage . However, a special arrangement had had to be made, which was carried through jointly by Roths- child and Eskeles . 14 Solomon Rothschild thereby earned the gratitude of the chancellor's wife, and he also loaded her with presents and flowers on every possible occasion . It was through her that the Jewish baron achieved his unique position in exclusive Viennese society . . It was not only at Vienna that the social rise of the Rothschilds was so marked . Nathan was invited to the best houses throughout England, and James's quite ex- ceptional position at the court of the new king, Louis Philippe, was most clearly marked by the conferring upon him of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, the Knight's Cross of which he had held since 1823 . The magnificent balls and banquets which he gave to the leaders of society at his splendid palace in Paris helped him to consolidate his position . On one of these occasions an unpleasant incident occurred, which caused the heir to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"5o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild the throne, the Duke of Orleans, to be quite unjustly annoyed with James Rothschild . While, with the help of England, Louis Philippe was consolidating his posi- tion abroad, he was far from being so successful with society in Paris, among whom the legitimate nobility had a great deal of influence . As Baron Hugel, who was in Metternich's confidence, wrote from Paris, there was a kind of opposition of the salons ; and those families who had remained loyal to the exiled king went so far as to carry on secret correspondence with their relatives who had left the country with Charles X . These 'emigres in- trigued throughout the world, and made special efforts to induce the eastern Powers to make war on Louis Philippe, in order to place Charles X on the throne once more . The legitimists in Paris made satirical remarks about the people who swarmed about the new king and the heir to the throne with a view to securing good jobs, and the opposition paper, La Mode, published a drama a clef, \"De la Comedic de la Cour des Oiseaux,\" in which all these adventurers were represented as hens in a farmyard, flocking around the Grand Poulot, as the Duke of Orleans was called . From this time onward the heir to the throne was always known by the nickname Grand Poulot . The Duke of Orleans was present at an informal gathering in James Rothschild's house . This gave an opportunity to a certain young Monsieur de Blancmenil, the son of an ardent legitimist who would not go to court, of saying to a fellow-legitimist in a voice loud enough for the Duke of Orleans to hear, \"Why, here comes the Grand Poulotl\" This apparently harmless remark was aimed at the close connection between the new royal House and the Jew banker . It was overheard by adherents of the new regime, and one of them came forward on behalf of the prince . Heated words ensued, and the Duke of Orleans at once realized what was happening . Two of his adjutants went to the young men to demand an explanation . They assured"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 51 the adjutants that they had no wish to offend the duke, and had not thought that he could overhear their remarks, and the matter was then dropped ; 15 but the heir to the throne never went to James Rothschild's house again, in spite of all the efforts that Rothschild made, and all the invitations he sent him . Meanwhile, anxiety was still felt over the Belgian problem, which was far from being finally settled . The independence of that state had not yet been recognized and there was still reason to fear that warlike compli- cations might arise . On account of the cholera, Solomon Rothschild had not yet returned to Vienna, and his busi- ness was being carried on by his confidential manager, Leopold von Wertheimstein . Austria had, meanwhile, issued a further loan of 50,000,000 gulden, in which . the Vienna branch of the House of Rothschild participated . Solomon wanted to travel from Munich to Paris via Frankfort in order to take general stock there of the position and undertakings of the firm . He wanted to bring his Paris brother some cheerful news . He therefore wrote to Metternich from Frankfort : 16 \"Your Highness is aware that we have subscribed a quarter of the last loan of 50,000,000, and have also pur- chased securities on the bourse in order to maintain the price of Metalliques, that we are carrying through other important financial operations, and that we are also ne- gotiating new ones .

He had to make use of an amanuensis, as he suffered from severe rheumatism in the region of the eyes ; but this did not prevent him from thoroughly in- vestigating the situation in Paris . \"During my stay in Paris,\" he wrote to Metternich, 18 \"I have seriously occupied myself with the study of the internal condition of France, and have arrived at the sat- isfactory conviction that the government grows stronger every day . In any opinion, the opposition in the country consists only of certain newspapers, the kind of opposi- tion which is not to be taken seriously . All decent people are supporting the present ministry, and seeking to main- tain tranquillity ; the former kind of popular outbreak (emeutes) is out of date, and, however much and how- ever violently the opposition papers may write, they will not be able to start them again .

At the same time, trade will expand in all directions, and we shall have a firm and settled government, such as we have been accustomed to in the past . Such a happy consum- mation, however, can be achieved only provided that the speedy settlement of all points of dispute between Belgium and Holland is assured . . . . There is con- fidence in the present ministry ; it is, of course, unpleas- ant to have to admit that peace is dependent entirely upon a single individual, but this will adjust itself in time, when the necessary stability has been achieved . It is reassuring in this connection to note that the king is abso- lutely devoted to M . Perier . Your Highness's well-known judgment is such that, on perusing this letter, you will be able to appreciate how far the views I have expressed are sound, and it will be a cause of great satisfaction to me if I shall prove to have presented the position adequately .\" Solomon deliberately painted things in rather rosy colors, for the French cabinet was, in point of fact, actually considering a counter-move to the further inter- vention of Austrian troops in the Papal States .

It was not in the least gratifying to Metternich to be called upon again to play the role of papal police- man, but on January 28, 1832, the Austrians again occu- pied Bologna . This was a serious blow to Perier's peace ministry . All Perier's enemies immediately protested that such action was an attack upon the honor of France, and Perier was forced, at any rate as a matter of form, to make a display of armed force in the Papal States, for, after all, the risings following upon the July revolution had all counted on the support of liberty-loving France . A French squadron accordingly sailed into Ancona, and landed troops there to occupy the town and the citadel . Metternich strongly protested against this action, but there was no serious intention, either in Paris or Vienna, of making it a casus belli . French troops were simply to remain at Ancona until the Austrians had evacuated the Papal States . The powder magazine had very nearly been fired, but Metternich was less anxious for war than usual . As he could not rely on Prussia, or count with absolute certainty upon Russia, which was so distant from a possible theater of war in the west, he might have been left to make war alone . Nevertheless, the Rothschilds feared that he might go to war ; and Solomon and James continued their efforts in Paris to eliminate this danger as far as possible . They again did everything in their power to stamp out the smoldering embers, as is indicated by a long and positively poetic effusion of Solomon's, who was particularly skilful at flattering the chancellor .\"\" MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE I How rightly your Highness appreciated my feel- ings in favoring me with the letter containing the glad news of the safe delivery of your most honored lady .

I should have liked ere this to have allowed my- self the privilege of sending your Excellency a few lines from here, but unfortunately my eyes have been troubling me so much that I have been forced to give up even the most pleasant occupations .

Politics here are proceeding on the same lines as ever . As your Highness has so rightly observed, Perier made a great mistake in his action at Ancona ; this is attributable not so much to a lack of honor as to weakness .

The specter of cholera appreciably spoilt the pleasure of Solomon's stay in Paris . He had fled to Munich from Vienna on its account, and the mysterious disease had now pursued him to Paris . During the beginning of April, 1832, about thirty thousand people developed cholera in the French capital, and about half of these died of the disease . Those elements which were hostile to the government and to the king exploited the excite- ment produced by the outbreak to cause fresh disturb- ances . During the night all the street corners were pla- carded with the following notice, which the astonished Parisians read next day : 20 HOW TO CONQUER THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC Take three hundred heads of members of the Paris Chamber, particularly including those of Casimir Perier, Sebastiani, d'Argout, Louis Philippe and his son ; roll them over the Place de la Revolution, and the air of France will be cleansed . A JULY SOLDIER . The royal family and the ministry, however, displayed heroic courage on this occasion . The Duke of Orleans and the prime minister even visited the cholera victims in the hospital . This was to prove fatal to Perier, who contracted the disease a few days after his visit to the hospital, and died . James and Solomon Rothschild were affected, not merely by the personal loss, for the event was of profound importance to their political and finan- cial schemes . The brothers were overwhelmed wi t a Y"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild of the frightful plague . Solomon took refuge in one of his brother's country houses near Paris, a fact which seri- ously limited his political activities -and the scope of reports to Metternich . While Solomon and James were adjusting themselves to the new position resulting from Perier's death, Nathan in England was also experiencing a time of internal political stress . Since March, 1832, the reform bill, which was so widely to extend the franchise and to abolish an- cient abuses, had been the center of interest . Lord Grey was determined to carry it, in spite of the bitter opposi- tion of the Upper House . This could only be done through a mass creation of new peers, to which the king refused to agree, with the result that the prime minister resigned on the 9th of May . The Conservative Duke of Wellington, who was opposed to reform, was indicated as the man to form the new ministry, but the country was passionately aroused in favor of the measure . At this critical juncture we find Nathan Rothschild again com- ing to the fore . On May 12, 1832, when Wellington's candidature was the burning subject of the hour, he went to a friend of the duke, Mr . Arbuthnot, and poured out his heart to him. Nathan feared that on the fall of Grey's Liberal ministry, which in foreign affairs had always supported France against the eastern Powers, a Conservative ministry under Wellington would act with the latter, and possibly give them a free hand against France . This would have meant the outbreak of the much- dreaded Continental war . Nathan, therefore, made every effort to bring Mr . Arbuthnot to his point of view, and to persuade him to use his influence with Wellington in the interests of peace . 21 \"My dear Duke,\" Mr . Arbuthnot wrote, \"Rothschild has been with me . He came to tell me that if you let it be known, as soon as you meet Parliament, that, whatever may be your own opinion of Reform, you are resolved IiiA't .4,isappoint expectations which are so greatly raised,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 59 and that your determination also is to do your utmost to preserve the peace of the world, you will surmount all your difficulties . He says that among the monied men there is an alarm lest there should be such an opposition to all Reform as would cause commotions ; and he adds that the foreign Ministers-he instanced Talleyrand, Weissenburg, and Bulow-are in great anxiety lest the King of Holland should be led to expect such support from the new Government as would lead to war . \"He assured me that the general feeling was that you would surmount your difficulties if men's minds were tranquillised as above stated, and if, having the reins in your hand, you were resolved to keep them . \"He is determined, he said, to keep up the Funds to his utmost, and he is confident he will succeed .\" It was, however, a false alarm, and Nathan's interven- tion became unnecessary ; for the masses . the name of Wellington stood for the collapse of reform ideas, and the result was that a storm broke out throughout the whole country, such as put any possibility of a Welling- ton ministry out of the question . King William IV was made personally aware of the bitter feelings of his people, for mud was thrown at his carriage in the streets of London . Reluctantly he was forced to yield to the will of the people, and Grey's ministry was recalled to office, whereby the passage of the reform bill was assured . As the ministry remained in office, all fear of a change in the trend of Britain's foreign policy vanished, and the danger of war was averted . Nathan could again devote himself to his business ; and he had once more shown himself capable of dealing with a critical situation . The reform bill was finally passed by the British Par- liament on the 4th of June, a fact which made a profound impression throughout the world . Austria, too, had been anxiously following the vicissitudes of western politics, and Metternich, whose sentiments were very different from those of the Rothschilds, felt the passage of the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"6o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild reform bill as a personal defeat. But internal problems soon diverted his attention, especially the eternal finan- cial embarrassments of the state . The last Metallique loan of so,ooo,ooo had scarcely been issued when a further loan was contemplated . Metternich sorely missed Solo- mon Rothschild . It was impossible to discuss politics and finance as comfortably with Leopold von Wertheimstein as with his sympathetic, supple, and experienced friend, Solomon . Wertheimstein faithfully reported to his master in Paris what was happening at Vienna . He told him that Sina and Geymuller had latterly been selling Metalliques to an alarming extent, and that he had misgivings as to their maintaining their price, and was also thinking of selling . He also reported to Solomon regarding Metter- nich's wishes for a further similar loan . Solomon replied to him at great length . His words were a serious warning . Indeed, they constituted practi- cally a rebuke to Austria's leading statesman \"That Sina and Geymuller are constantly selling,\" he wrote, \"is a matter of indifference to me . It is better that these gentlemen should sell out now that we are still in the month of June, so that the Metalliques, will come to be held more and more by solid people . . . . What I do not regard with indifference, however, is that Austria should issue a further Metalliques loan during the year 1832, which God forbid . You know that, taking the sum of our holdings of Metalliques at Frankfort, Paris, Lon- don, and Vienna-that is, the holdings of the four banks which really constitute one bank-the total amounts to several millions . Now, you cannot ride two horses at once ; if our firm were forced to sell . what price could we expect to get? . . . We should be forced to realize our Metalliques, whether we wished to or not . What would the capitalists and the commercial world say to the issue of two Metalliques loans in one year, when the payments in respect of the first loan are not due to be completed until December? Such action might"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 6i produce a sharp fall in Mitalliques . The government would not be able to get further loans at a low rate of interest . A blow would be dealt at the credit of Austria's finances, and the government would fail of achieving its object . \"I therefore repeat that, if it is essential to get money, it is much better to issue treasury bills, and get in twelve millions of silver for the bank, as on the former occasion, a procedure which costs the government hardly anything and provides it with money for six to eight months . Moreover, what would the public say to a new loan? `There will be war-there must be war, as Austria is issuing another loan .' Even if we were not forced to sell, as we should be, prices would fall sharply, and Austria's credit would be severely damaged . \"I instruct you, my dear sirs, to submit the whole con- tents of this letter to Prince von Metternich and Count Kolowrat, as it is my duty to inform them of my opinion and conviction as to what would happen if there were to be even a whisper of a suggestion that another loan should be issued this year . . . . In any case, tell Prince von Metternich from me that the government here is making every possible effort to maintain peace and to suppress subversive propaganda . The Government has gained in strength as the result of recent events, but the European Powers must endeavor to establish it more firmly still . . . . What are the opposition papers doing? On account of the handful of troops which have been sent to Tyrol, on account of the disturbances, they are daily preaching war between Austria and France in their papers. The Ailgemeine and the Augsburger Zeitung are largely to blame for this . Prince Metternich should rap the Augsburger Zeitung over the knuckles, and have the other view presented in the Beobachter . . . .The Aus- trian embassy here will report on yesterday's Review .

No further Metal- lique loan was issued in 1832, and it was not until the following year that the four banks again subscribed a similar loan . The two secretaries, Wertheimstein and Goldschmidt, to whom Solomon's letters were addressed, were having a difficult time . All foreign Jews at Vienna had to apply every three years for the renewal of their \"toleration .\" In the case of Goldschmidt, this regulation had been ignored by the authorities, and they had allowed him to remain with Solomon Rothschild without interference . Only the Rothschilds did not abuse the privilege, as they did not wish to solicit tolerance, nor to be conspicuous on the lists of tolerated Jews . As, however, Solomon Rothschild's absence was protracted, the officials began to take up the question of Goldschmidt . Solomon there- upon submitted a petition to his Majesty to obtain tolera- tion for his secretary, and especially begged Metternich to support his request . \"Your Highness,\" the letter ran, 23 \"is in a good position to judge how far Goldschmidt may be deserving of his Majesty's favor, for you have known him over a period of years, and I am able to testify in the strongest terms to his exceptional usefulness and loyalty, as well as to his high moral character . I would therefore regard it as a personal favor to myself if his Majesty would be graciously pleased to grant the request of my secretary, since I often have occasion to be absent from here for some time, and to give my manager authority to act on my behalf . . . . Solomon also emphasized that Metternich would"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Casimir Prier"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 63 thereby earn the lifelong gratitude of an honest man, and the chancellor did actually support the petition . The loss of the French prime minister, Perier, pro- foundly affected the political scheme of the House of Rothschild . In Austria they suffered the loss of a friend which they felt no less acutely . Frederick von Gentz died on June 9, 1832 . It was to him that the Rothschilds largely owed their position with Metternich, and therefore in Austria generally . Since Gentz was venal and easily accepted money from the whole world ; including foreign states, they had found him easy to deal with . Metternich knew what was hap- pening, but he turned his blind eye to the situation, as the master of style, whose writings were as distinguished for the clarity of their thought as for their moving pathos, was indispensable to him . The older Gentz grew, the more extravagant he became . Rothschild fully appre- ciated the treasure that he had in Gentz, the chancellor's right-hand man, who was the first person to deal with any important dispatch . At the beginning of their asso- ciation the Rothschilds allowed him to win in specula- tions on the bourse, but they soon dispensed with this polite fiction, and supplied him with considerable sums, finally definitely appointing him agent of the firm, with an annual salary of ten thousand gulden . 24 In return for this, Gentz was required not merely to send them regular political reports when Solomon was away from Vienna, but he also frequently wrote political memoranda which were circulated to the five brothers . It was obvious that he used secret and official information for this purpose . He also often conveyed news to the Rothschilds which Metternich wished to become known in this way . As the years passed, the Gentz-Rothschild association had grown more and more intimate, and toward the end of his life the privy councilor's diary records almost daily that he has been with Rothschild, dined with him, transacted some profitable business with him, or sat with him in his"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild box at the theater . The last years of Gentz, who at the age of sixty-seven was seized with a violent passion for Fanny Elssler, a girl in the early twenties, were divided between services to the chancery, to the Rothschilds, and to the spirited actress . Any payment that he received was easily spent, as he took to Fanny Elssler everything that he could possibly spare . We constantly find in his diary passages such as the following : 26 \"I was with Fanny from seven until eleven ; I brought her substantial pres- ents-a hundred ducats and four hundred friedrichdors- and spent an evening with her that was worth more than `all the gold of Aurangzeb .' )) 26 Gentz's constant request for cash finally became too much even for Rothschild, although he was prepared always to help him out and give him presents . In the course of time he began to ask for securities and make conditions, and on one occasion he purchased from Gentz his silver dinner-service in a moment of acute embarrass- ment . 27 Gentz was also constantly compelled to ask the Rothschilds to grant him advances on account of his sal- ary from the Austrian treasury . In these matters Gentz showed a supreme contempt for the world in general, setting himself completely above ordinary morality ; and a remark made by the Emperor Francis about his rela- tions with Fanny made no impression on him at all, since, as he put it, he did not bother about the sovereign 2 8 Spe- cially characteristic is a letter from Gentz 29 to Metter- nich about an advance of Rothschild's in respect of a gratuity which he hoped to receive from the state . \"After your Highness's recent kindness to me,\" the letter ran, \"I would not venture to trouble you with fur- ther requests .if my need were less pressing . . . . I have asked Rothschild to advance me 4,500 gulden, being the amount granted to me by his Majesty at the beginning of 1829, until such time as your Highness may succeed, by your kind recommendation, in obtaining for me a sim- ilar gratuity in respect of the current year .

Presum- ably he intends to submit my letter to you, and a single word from your Highness can determine the success of this step, which I have taken at a time of extreme pres- sure, and the failure of which would deprive me of my last hope .\" Gentz admitted that there was apparently a striking contrast between his manner of life and his bitter com- plaints ; and that it might be possible to conclude either that he was unforgivably frivolous or that he had less to complain of than he alleged . Gentz assured the chan- cellor that the lighter side of his existence was the result of a deliberate attempt to dull the sorrows of his spirit and to conceal from others how ill he was faring . Gentz begged the prince not to withhold a helping hand from him in his difficulties . \"There is only one more thing I would ask,\" he wrote, \"and that is, that you will not let Rothschild know that I have prepared your High- ness to expect his application . This might affect his con- fidence in me, and I shall be delighted for him to have the credit of having successfully arranged this by his own efforts .\" The letter is practically an epitome of Gentz, reveal- ing the frivolous hedonist and extravagant spendthrift, showing how this highly gifted man, with his supple and sympathetic nature, who at the age of sixty-eight lived careless as a child, and loved like a youth, was indispen- sable both to the mighty chancellor and to the acute and powerful financier . He was dead now, and the Rothschilds had lost an intimate link with Metternich and the foreign office, as well as a priceless source of information .

The Belgian problem was still unsettled . The King of Holland continued to resist, and maintained the occupa- tion of the citadel of Antwerp . As no solution was in prospect, England and France were forced in 1832 to consider the means by which they could bring pressure to bear upon Holland . The eastern Powers, however, would not cooperate . The tsar, who had repeatedly helped to emphasize the opposition between East and West in the Belgian problem, was ominously inclined to support the King of Holland . The French finally decided on military intervention, and took possession of Antwerp on behalf of Belgium, while the British sequestered Dutch shipping . It was obvious that the King of Holland definitely intended by some means or other to regain Belgium . His brother-in-law, the King of Prussia, did not wish to proceed against him by force of arms, but neither did he wish to be drawn into a war of indefinite duration on his account . The tsar was more inclined to contem- plate war . He was unable to forget that Louis Philippe, who ruled only by grace of the Revolution, was the father-in-law and protector of the newly fledged King of Belgium ; and, besides, he was much inclined to listen to the supporters of the exiled King Charles X at Prague, who did all they could to urge Petersburg to war . These French legitimists were naturally the most bitter enemies of the House of Rothschild, which, after the July revolu- tion, had at once gone over with flying colors to the camp of Louis Philippe . The Duke of Blacas, who was staying with his king at Prague, received reports from all quar- ters as to the state of the legitimist cause ; his letters were carefully copied by Metternich's police, and thus reached the chancellor at the same time as the persons to whom they were addressed . They often contained bitter words about the Rothschilds, who supported peace, and applied their money to maintain it, whereas the cause of the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Financiers\" \t 67 emigres could be served only by the eastern Powers de- ciding to let loose the dogs of war . The British Tories and their bankers, who also favored war, and hoped for Russia's military intervention, sent a representative to St . Petersburg to offer Russia a loan for this purpose . While passing through the Hague, the envoy gave a legit- imist agent called Cordier some interesting side-lights on the attitude of the Rothschilds in political matters . \"They have fallen,\" he said, \"to prodigious extent under revo- lutionary influences, and the bonds with which they have bound the monarchs are fatal to them .\" 3° The Englishman's principal source of information was the Paris banker Ouvrard, who also had legitimist deal- ings and who was filled with concentrated hostility to the Rothschilds . Another emigre simultaneously reported from Frankfort\" that the Russian loan had been con- cluded with the firm of Hope, although England and France, and the bankers that supported them, with the House of Rothschild at their head, had put every pos- sible obstacle in that firm's way . The emigre's report clearly revealed whither the hopes of such circles were directed . \"The object of this loan,\" the report ran, \"leaves no doubt at all as to the firm determination of the Emperor Nicholas to declare war next spring .\" Cordier also reported as to this X6,ooo,ooo loan,\" and expressed the hope that Russia would now set things going . It was true that Rothschild, who had been bought by the two revolutionary governments, had succeeded in frustrating the earlier negotiations, and thereby delaying everything, but in the end their intrigues had been brought to naught . Cordier stated, indeed, that Roths- child had had the \"shamelessness\" to say quite openly on the London Stock Exchange that he knew how to bridle the sovereigns, as he controlled them all through his purse . In the end, the legitimist Tory bankers had united, and carried the loan through in spite of him ."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68'r \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild \"This coalition,\" wrote Cordier, \"serves .a great polit- ical idea, its object being to place sufficient funds at the disposal of the sovereigns to enable them to fight the revolutionary movement, which is served by all the Rothschilds, under the leadership of the London one, and of Talleyrand [French Ambassador in London] .\" At that time General Count Pozzo, who was in the service of Russia, was staying in London, and he sup- ported the Austrian ambassador, Lieven . Nathan fol- lowed the activities of these two with grave suspicion, and wrote to his brother James in Paris about them, in his comically bad Germany .\" MY DEAR BROTHER,- I hope that you are quite well and happy .

The money for Russia had been given to no purpose, and war was avoided, although the Belgian problem still remained unsolved . In spite of all this, Solomon had succeeded in main- taining his good relations with Metternich, although Met- ternich was in the camp of the opponents of the world policy of the western Rothschilds . At times this was ex- ceedingly difficult, but Solomon was successful in main- taining the close relationship undisturbed, so that it was possible for him, as before, constantly to approach the chancellor with petitions . These generally concerned the protection of his co-religionists in the most various quar- ters of the world, but he occasionally put forward quite remarkable, and indeed comic, requests . Thus on one occasion James and Solomon commended to the chancellor a certain M . Roquirol, who had brought a fine flock of merino sheep to Vienna for sale . They asked Metternich to assist this gentleman as far as he could . \"I am taking the liberty,\" Solomon wrote, 84 \"humbly to request your Highness to put in a word for this man when there should be an opportunity for doing so, as there is sure to be in the salons of your Highness, which are the meeting-place of brilliance and fashion, for I am convinced that in no other way can M . Roquirol's venture be attended with real success .\" This was really asking rather a lot, and it is difficult"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"70 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild to understand how Solomon imagined that Metternich would make propaganda in his salons for the sale of merino sheep . Meanwhile, monetary conditions throughout the world had improved ; and the Rothschild banks had so far made good the losses incurred during the July revolu- tion that they could proceed, not merely to conclude fresh agreements for advances with Rother in Prussia, who held full authority from his king, but could also arrange to take up the loan of which they had asked to .be relieved when they were feeling embarrassed . The whole of the 5% public debt was converted to a 4% basis . Rother was delighted at the way the Rothschilds met him, because this would help to advance the credit of the Preussische Seehandlung . The brothers gave this bank a blank credit, and told Rother that he could, if oc- casion should arise, draw through it £soo,ooo from London, a million gulden in Frankfort, two to three million francs in Paris, and one to two million gulden Convention currency in Vienna . 35 Rother gave Solomon Rothschild the chief credit for all these satisfactory transactions, and as Solomon de- sired a Prussian order, he asked his king to grant him one . The court was glad to take the money, but did not want to confer an order upon a Jewish business man . Rother therefore suggested\" that, as a mark of good- will and of satisfaction with the part played by Solomon in connection with the transactions which had just been concluded, he should be presented with a handsome porce- lain vase, with a portrait of the king on it . \"I have come to the conclush n,\" wrote Rother to the finance minister, Count von Lottum, \"that, in view of the fact that all the Rothschild banks have interested themselves in the matter in question, and that Solomon incurred the reproaches of his partners for the way in which he met me over my first proposals, which were prevented by unforeseen and purely external circum-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Fz'nanc .iers\" 7 stances from being brought to a successful conclusion, any mark of appreciation shown to him alone would tend to widen the breach in the family, and that he would not derive the satisfaction therefrom that his Majesty intends .\" As a result of Rother's recommendation Solomon re- ceived a vase worth 426 reichsthaler, Nathan in London a porcelain set of the value of, 566 reichsthaler, and Amschel Meyer at Frankfort vases to the value of 5i5 reichsthaler, from the Royal Porcelain Factory at Berlin . The three brothers each wrote a separate letter of thanks to the king, expressing gratitude for the \"high proofs of his most gracious good-will\" and the \"magnifi- cent presents, which they would always treasure,\" and which they would always keep in their families as \"pre- cious heirlooms .\" Solomon expressed the hope\"' that he would in future be able to furnish fresh proof of his truly disinterested service ; and Nathan wrote\"' that the magnificent present would be an everlasting testimony for him and his to the gracious kindness of his Royal Majesty . Rother also expressed his thanks for these tributes to his business friends, 39 and took the opportunity of again calling attention to the fact that they had been able to show that they had sustained a loss far exceeding two million thaler through their efforts to save the honor of their firm . Shortly afterwards Rother secured\" a distinction for the only son of Nathan, who so far had no title . \"The eldest sons of Baron Nathan Meyer von Roths- child in London, Lionel and Anthony,\" he wrote to the king, 41 \"are financial advisers and knights of the Elector of Hesse's Order of the Lion ; only the youngest son, Nathaniel, who has also distinguished himself in his business, and has just returned from a business journey to Constantinople, which he has carried out to the satis- faction of all the Rothschild banks, as yet holds no kind"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild of title .

In this matter, too, the wishes of Rother were carried out, and all parties were satisfied . The business of the Rothschilds continued to expand . They were now lending, not only to the great Powers, but also to smaller states, such as Greece, and the gov- ernment of the Ionian Islands-these loans, it is true, being guaranteed by England and France, so that any risk was practically eliminated . The European capitals, however, still provided them with their main field of operations, Petersburg and Berlin being the only ones from which they were excluded . Vienna continued to be their main base of operations in the east of Europe . Here they were so closely bound up with the regime of the Emperor Francis and his leading statesman that any sudden change of personnel, affecting the distribution of power, might not have been a grave matter for them . Such a position was threat- ened when the Emperor Francis, who was sixty-seven years old, suddenly became seriously ill . On February 23, 1835, he was in the best of health and spirits, when he went to the theater to see a new play called \"A Poor Woman's Will .\" At a council next day he suddenly felt ill, and had to take to his bed at once . The court physician diagnosed a slight inflammation of the lungs . But so little importance was attached to it that Metternich did not cancel a ball he was giving that evening . During the night of February 26, however, the emperor's fever and pain increased, and next day he asked to be exam- ined . His physician said that this was quite unnecessary, and would only worry him, but the emperor insisted on"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"\"The Road to the King of Fz 1 nanciers\" \t 73 it . At ten o'clock in the morning the emperor wrote out his will in pencil, in a calm and settled frame of mind, in the presence of Councilor Hess and his confessor, Bishop Wagner . On February 27 his fever increased and the lung trouble grew worse . He was bled three times, the Archduke John observing in consternation that the old man would be so weakened by the letting of blood that he must inevitably succumb . The emperor's brothers-the archdukes Joseph, Carl, and Ludwig-urged a general consultation, to which the most famous doctors in the capital be called in, but the king's private physician, Baron Stifft, would not hear of it, and became quite rude . As the emperor's condition grew steadily worse, everybody at the Hofburg abso- lutely lost his 'head, according to the statement of the Archduke John . They wanted to call in Dr . Gunther from the hospital, but no carriage was to be found, so the emperor's personal attendant went off on foot to fetch him, and returned with him on foot, which took two hours . On February 28 he was bled for the fourth time . Metternich was at first highly perturbed at the news from the Hofburg, but, after a conversation with Bishop Wagner, he was quite calm . The Archduke John noted Metternich's attitude in his diary, observing that Met- ternic'h's first alarm was due to the fact that he feared that the emperor's will would mean his fall . When, how- ever, the chancellor heard that the will had been made with the assistance of Bishop Wagner, he felt reassured . The Emperor Francis died at a quarter to one in the morning of March 2 . He left a will charging the heir, Ferdinand, who was physically and intellectually un- developed, to rule, but \"not to make changes .\" In all the more important matters he was to take counsel with the youngest brother, the Archduke Ludwig ; finally, and this was the most important point, he bade him place the same confidence in Metternich, his most loyal servant and friend, as the Emperor Francis had placed"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"74 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild in him, and to make no decision affecting public affairs or persons without first consulting him . It was significant that the youngest brother should be recommended as the adviser and representative of the Emperor Ferdinand, who was incapable of properly per- forming his duties himself, when the clever and highly gifted elder brothers, the Archduke Palatine Joseph, the Archduke John, and the Archduke Carl, the victor of Aspern, were still alive . The fact was that, as Metter- nich stated, the will was drafted in the chancellor's of- fice, and the Archduke Ludwig was mentioned because he would do what the chancellor wished and was easy to direct . Count Kolowrat, who was the most pronounced opponent of the chancellor, and the most notable man who succeeded him in that office, was unmentioned and passed over. Metternich actually had the last paragraph drafted as follows \"I hereby name \t as the man whom I most emphatically commend to my son as a loyal counselor, worthy of his fullest confidence .\" He did not, in fact, insert his own name, for Bishop Wagner was to see that Metternich's name was written by the emperor in the blank space, as was, in' fact, actually done . This meant that, in view of the new emperor's in- capacity to rule, and the insignificant talents possessed by the Archduke Ludwig, through the elimination by the will of all the other archdukes and statesmen, Met- ternich was fully secured in his position . \"It is well known,\" Kiibeck 43 wrote in his diary on March 3, \"that the emperor's illness has made him feeble-minded . He understands nothing of what is being said to him, and is prepared to sign anything that is put before him .

Count Apponyi praised the House of Rothschild for their courage and firmness, praise which was not really deserved, for they were act- ing merely in their own interests . \"I must admit,\" the ambassador reported from Paris, \"that the attitude of the House on this occasion . . . has contributed in no small measure to maintaining confi- dence among the public, and to checking ungrounded and unnecessary panic .

Things happened as they had foreseen . Securities rose in value, and they prospered more exceedingly than ever . For now things actually ran much more smoothly than under the Em- peror Francis, who in many matters-especially in the case of new discoveries, such as the railway-opposed even Metternich's advice and wishes with a rigid veto . 75"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III The Rothschilds and the Earliest Railways T HE first application of rails, and therefore the basis of modern railways, takes us back to the seventeenth century . At that time, especially in England, wooden rails were frequently used in mines, in order to bring to the surface more quickly and easily the trucks that had been loaded with coal ; but it was not until 1793 that Benjamin Outram, an Englishman, developed the idea of substituting iron rails for wood, whereupon the ways came to be known after his name, Outram-ways, and later, tramways . It came to be realized that a horse drawing a load on such rails was eleven times more effective than on an ordinary road, and accordingly, as early as the twenties of the nineteenth century, such ways were built, especially in connection with coal- mines, by means of which heavy loads could be drawn by horses to the nearest waterway . Since Fulton's steamer, Clermont, had made her first successful voyage on the Hudson River in 1807, the idea of applying the newly discovered steam-engine to the propulsion of ships had been successfully developed, and George Stephenson, who was originally a smith in a mine, conceived the idea of using the machine which had hitherto been ap- plied only at sea to the propulsion of trucks on dry land . He installed in his mine the first steam-trucks . They were of his own manufacture ; and then, in 1825, with the assistance of several far-seeing capitalists, he built the first railway in the world on which locomotives were run . This ran from Stockton to Darlington, and its main purpose was to carry coal from the Durham coal fields . 76"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Earliest Railways 77 Stephenson had to fight against enormous opposition, against petty private interests, even against contempt and ridicule . A man called Nicholas Wood, who held a dis- tinguished position as a \"railway expert\" at the time, actually stated : \"I should not dream of telling everyone that the ridiculous expectation, or rather prophecies, of the enthusiastic speculators could possibly be realized, and that we shall see steam-coaches travelling at a speed of twelve, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty miles an hour . Nobody could do more harm to the prospects of build- ing or generally improving such coaches than by spread- ing abroad this kind of nonsense .\" But as early as September 27, 1825, when Stephenson's railway was opened, a train capable of drawing eighty tons was running at a speed of ten to fifteen miles an hour . At first the means of locomotion on this rail- way was mixed . Horse-power was used as well, the horses being harnessed to help on a slope . The speed of trains was paralyzed by the fact that there was a law en- forced requiring that a postilion should ride fifty yards in front of the locomotive to warn people of the ap- proaching monster . Nevertheless, unreasoning prejudice was unable to block the advance made by a man of genius . The achievements of the Stockton-Darlington rail- way, considerable for those times, became generally known, and led to no less than eighteen new concessions for railways being granted, including the railway from Liverpool to Manchester, which was the next to be con- structed . The only locomotives on it were Stephenson's ; he had won the prize with his \"Rocket\" in the steam- coach competition of October, 1829, at Rainhill . All doubts were silenced after the opening, on September i 5, 1830, of the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, which marked the commencement of an era of intensive profit and industry for the two sister cities, and therefore also ,of success for the undertaking itself . The enormous de- velopments opened up by the new discovery were now"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild first generally recognized, and from this year dates the general extension of railways throughout the world . Like so many others, Nathan Rothschild had followed Stephenson's experiments with interest, but also with a good deal of skepticism . At any rate, he was determined not to venture a farthing on an undertaking which not only the general public, but also highly respected and competent men, declared to be a wildcat scheme . He too was of opinion that the horse, which could travel any- where, could never be effectively supplanted by a ma- chine . He was, therefore, quite pleased to see such firms as Glyn, Halifax, Mills, and Co .,\" as well as the in- experienced provincial bankers, risking their good money in such highly speculative ventures . He was acting in exactly the same way as other big banks such as Baring & Ricardo, who also avoided having anything to do with them . When, however, Stephenson's successes be- came more and more pronounced, and after the con- struction of the first and second railway in England, a positive railway fever seized the country . Innumerable companies were being formed for new railway schemes, and Nathan, who had followed these developments closely, although taking no part in thcm, came to the conclusion that this new discovery offered incalculable opportunities for profit, which his House must not be allowed to miss . In England it was certainly rather late, as there were already so many people in the field ; but on the Conti- nent, where his brothers lived, the situation was different . Nowhere on the Continent was there a railway carrying steam-engines . There were only here and there a few short sections of horse tramways . Here was a field for the enormous resources of his House .

His suggestions made a special impression upon Solomon Rothschild in Vienna . This was partly due to the fact that another highly gifted man, who might indeed be called a genius, had called Solomon's attention to the tremendous possibilities in railway construction on a large scale . This man was Franz Xavier Riepel, professor at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute, and special expert in min- ing . He had worked for many years in the Witkowitz iron-works . Witkowitz lies close to the enormous coal- basin between Moravian-Ostrau and Karwin . The iron- works had grown up there because of the convenience of the neighboring coal fields, as it was impossible to carry coal for any distance at that time owing to the inferior and expensive methods of transport . Riepel's idea was to follow England's example and transport the coal by rail- way to the great waterway of the Danube? On looking into the matter further, he thought it should be practi- cable also to carry large consignments of salt from Wieliczka in Galicia on the railway, and for this purpose to build a railway from Bochnia, southeast of Krakow, right in the northeast of the monarchy, via Moravian- Ostrau and Briinn, to Vienna, a distance of about sixty miles . Riepel found a wholesale merchant called Samuel Wie- dermann, who was in close business relation with Solomon Rothschild, particularly interested in the idea . Wieder- mann, perceiving that Riepel's schemes could be realized only with the help of a great financial power, introduced Riepel and Solomon Rothschild, just at the happy mo- ment when Solomon had received the encouraging re- ports and suggestions from his brother Nathan in Eng- land . As Riepel sketched out his ideas, Solomon got a vision of enormous sums flowing into his coffers, through making all the valuable ores easily available, and arrang-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"$o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild ing for their easy transport, and for that of the important raw material, salt, to the capital . He took up the scheme with enthusiasm, and immediately decided to take the first tentative step towards putting it into effect . At the beginning of 1830, Solomon, having heard what Riepel had to say, sent him and Leopold von Wertheimstein to England to find out all they could about the actual railways there . They were to ascertain on the spot how they were built and managed, with a view to applying the experience so gained in building the projected rail- way to Galicia . In later years Solomon Rothschild expressly empha- sized the fact that the principal credit for the idea of the Nordbahn was due to Riepel . \"It is a satisfaction to me,\" he wrote to the head of the treasury, Count Mit- trowsky,$ \"and I feel I am but doing my duty in taking this opportunity of expressly putting on record the fact that it was Professor Franz Riepel, of the Polytechnic Institute, who, in 1829, first adumbrated the wonder- ful idea of the Galician Railway, and discussed it with me, with the result that I decided to have the neces- sary preliminary work done for forming an adequate esti- mate of the undertaking from a technical, commercial, and financial point of view, in order that, if it should appear to be adequate for the purposes for which it was intended, I might be in a position immediately to pro- ceed with the carrying out of this truly national project .\" The two delegates devoted particular attention to the Liverpool-Manchester Railway, which had just been fin- ished, and sent a detailed report upon it to Solomon Rothschild . On this Solomon decided definitely in favor of the construction of the big railway in Austria, and went so far as to suggest the idea of carrying it right through Austria by extending the railway of Bochnia- Vienna to Trieste in the south, i .e ., to the Adriatic Sea . Solomon Rothschild intended seriously to proceed with the preparation for the construction of the railway, when"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Earliest Railways 8 the sudden outbreak of the July revolution in France upset all these plans . Solomon himself wrote at a later date in this connection : 4 \"The political difficulties that arose in 183o and the disturbances that followed, with their exceedingly depressing effect upon trade and indus- try, forced me to my great regret to postpone to quieter times, more favorable to such undertakings, the carry- ing out of this scheme, although it had been definitely decided upon .\" This was not unnatural, for during the period immedi- ately after the revolution the House was fighting for its very existence, and it took years for things to settle down again and recover themselves . It was not until 1832 that the position of the Rothschilds had so far improved that, jointly with two other firms, they took over the un- successful business of a horse tramway from the engineer Zola, father of the famous novelist, which operated be- tween the Danube and Lake Traun . Meanwhile, a veritable railway fever had broken out in England . Everybody was engaging in railway con- struction, and, as soon as Nathan saw that the position of the House was becoming consolidated again, he ad- vised his brother to take up the scheme once more . Solo- mon thereupon arranged to have the whole route over which the railway was to be constructed examined by expert engineers under the direction of Riepel, with a view to ascertaining the best line . The result of these in- vestigations was to establish the fact that by this means \"the greatest and most distant provinces of the Empire could be brought into closer association with one another and with the capital, and entirely new combinations, hav- ing their effect upon industry, commerce, politics, and strategy, would result .\" 6 On April, 15, 1835, at the suggestion of Metternich, who was in a position, in view of the ineffectiveness of the new Emperor Ferdinand, to assure the banker in advance that his application would be granted, Solomon"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"82 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild decided to put forward his official application for per- mission to construct a railway, first from Bochnia to Vienna .

They proved that the human respiratory system"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"84 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild could not stand a speed of fifteen miles an hour . . . .

Neverthe- less, Drohsdick's opinion was in favor of granting the petition .? \"The construction of a railway,\" he minuted, \"to tra- verse three provinces from Vienna as the central point of Austrian commerce . . . would be a matter of such very exceptional service to the State from the commer- cial point of view, and, through his considerable personal resources, his vast credit, and his extensive connections, the banker Rothschild is so exceptionally suited for form- ing a Public Company, that there could not be any ob- jection in the general interest against . . . granting a con- cession for this new railway undertaking, and permit- ting the applicant to form a Company .\" Whatever motives malicious critics may allege to have produced this favorable opinion, and the support of the government machinery which Metternich controlled, it was a noteworthy deed so warmly to supply a scheme which most experts and public opinion generally con- demned, and which was to be the starting-point of a sys- tem that would revolutionize the world . The administrative system functioned most readily in accordance with the wishes of Metternich and Kolowrat, for the Emperor Ferdinand was nothing but a signing machine, and in this case these two statesmen were of one mind, the Archduke Ludwig being as usual more or less a cipher .

Solomon suggested that the postal administration should be indemnified by the payment of a lump sum . This question was also sent to Baron von Drohsdick for his opinion, but on this occasion he was not so far-seeing,- for he minuted as follows : 9 \"Baron von Rothschild has not expressed the intention in any of his suggestions of carrying letters on this railway ; this would appear to be an entirely different kind of business, and outside the actual scope of the undertaking . For this reason there is no occasion for entering into negotiations for compensa- tion .\" In the end the postal question was settled by a com- promise limiting the right to carry mails, and the Con- cession Decree of March 4, 1836, was drawn up .\" The most important provisions were those laying down that even after the expiration of fifty years, for which period the concession was granted, the House of Rothschild"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild should continue to be assured of absolute ownership in the railway ; and that the concession should cease to be effective if one mile of the railway should not be con- structed within two years, and if the whole railway be- tween Vienna and Bochnia should not be completed within ten years . Thereupon Riepel and Heinrich Sichrowsky, one of the most active collaborators in the railway scheme, were sent on another visit to England to ascertain what prog- ress had been made there since the year 183o . Solomon Rothschild succeeded in obtaining a year's leave for Riepel, who was indispensable to him, from his duties at the Polytechnic Institute, undertaking to pay the full salary of a substitute . The next step was to raise the capital of twelve million gulden Convention currency, which was estimated to be required for building the sixty-mile railway . Twelve thousand shares at a thousand florins were issued, Roths- child retaining eight thousand shares, partly for his own account, and partly for issuing to the numerous appli- cants who had come to him direct . Only four thousand shares were offered for public subscription ; among the subscribers were some of the most important financiers -of Vienna, such as Biedermann, Eskeles, Geymuller, and Sina .

On April 25, 1836, the first general meeting was called, at which Solomon stated that he would hand over the entire concession to the company . Rothschild made it a condition that he should always have full access to any information affecting the company's affairs, that he should be indemnified for the expenses he had incurred, amounting to 12,652 florins, so kronen, and that loo free shares should be issued to the most deserving of those who had collaborated in bringing the scheme into being .

On October ig, 1836, Solomon summoned a further general meeting, the third, at which the shareholders were asked to decide upon the plain issue whether the construction of the railway should be commenced forth- with, or whether the company should go into liquidation, in which case Baron von Rothschild would simply re- possess himself of the concession which he had transferred to the company, and personally defray all expenses in- curred up to that date, in so far as they should exceed the amount of 57,000 florins .

On the return journey there was a collision, which was the first railway accident in Austria . Gradually the government officials became rather more easy . At first, in order to obtain a ticket, it was necessary to secure a permit, or passenger card, from the police on the previous day ; this had to be viseed at Deutsch Wag- ram, the temporary railway terminus, and personally sur- rendered to the police after the return journey . 27 On the opening of the section to Brunn these restrictions were abolished . The cost of constructing the railway did very substan- tially exceed the estimates which had been made at the time . Pereira was proved right, for the building of the railway as far as Leipnik, forty-two miles, or about two- thirds of the total length, alone consumed 2,400,000 more than the 14,000,000 gulden originally subscribed, and it was only the advances made by the House of Rothschild that enabled the further construction of the railway to proceed .

There, too, the public and the press raised the most absurd objections to the idea of railways . \"The fire from the engine,\" several \"expert\" articles asserted, \"would set forests and crops on fire . The noise of the trains would make the neighboring country houses and properties un- inhabitable, and drive mad the cattle pasturing in the vicinity of the railway .\" There were, however, a few progressive and far-seeing engineers who actively and enthusiastically advocated the idea of building a passenger railway in France, which up to the year 1835 had not had one . Prominent among them was Emile Pereire, who was of Portuguese origin, having left that country on account of the persecution of the Jews . He belonged to the school of thought which had been founded by the philosopher and first socialist, Count Saint-Simon, and had started as a journalist in collabora- tion with his brother Isaac .

The \"toy\" was, however, sanctioned, and the Paris- Saint-Germain railway was opened on August 26, 1837 . Its success soon proved what a good idea it was, and the Chambers, which had in 1835 rejected a scheme for build- ing a railway by the state, were made to look foolish . Thus in Paris, too, the Rothschilds were taking the lead in railway construction . In the case of the second passen- ger railway, however, they did not have things all their own way . The railway in question was that between Paris and Versailles, and the idea of this railway occurred simultaneously both to Rothschild and to Fould . Smile Pereire, who was in Rothschild's service, built the rail- way on the right bank of the Seine, the famous Rive Droite, the concession for which was granted in 1836, while it was completed in 1839 ; Fould financed the rail- way on the left bank of the Seine . The two railway com- panies became bitter rivals, and the rivalry extended to other fields in which the respective financial powers were engaged . Finally James Rothschild succeeded in obtaining the concession for constructing and developing a northern railway in France, and this gigantic undertaking made very heavy claims on the financial resources of the Roths- childs in the forties . On July 21, 1845, the opening of the French Northern Railway became possible . In the middle thirties Nathan was keenly engaged in railway construction in Belgium .

In this case the undertaking, which at its very commencement required i 5o,00o,00o francs capital, was carried out by the state . A large proportion of this money was raised, through the Rothschilds, in 1836, 1837, and i840, with the result that the small state of Belgium secured a lead in railway construction, as is even now evidenced by the fact that, in proportion to her area, Belgium has a con- siderably greater railway mileage than other states . These first railway undertakings of the Rothschilds were succeeded in the years that followed by others which it would take too long to enumerate . We shall see how, later, they retrieved the opportunity they had missed of getting the Southern Railway of Austria into their hands . As is proved by their attitude to the first railways in England, it was not prophetic foresight or a love of prog- ress that led the Rothschilds to embark upon the first railway ventures on the Continent ; the preliminary suc- cess that had been achieved in England had proved that substantial profits might reasonably be realized else- where . Yet, although the Rothschilds were guided in this instance, as always, by business considerations, they were indisputably the pioneers on the Continent of one of the most daring and revolutionary discoveries of the human spirit, which has contributed more, perhaps, than any other to the cultural progress of our times, and has played the most important part in promoting understanding be- tween the peoples ."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne T HE Rothschild wealth had been preserved intact throughout the disturbances of the July revolution . Indeed the credit of the firm was more firmly established than ever, and it was seeking investment for the enormous capital sums it had accumulated . While his brothers in France and Austria were engaged in big railway schemes, Nathan was looking out for further extensive loan opera- tions that would be in harmony with the main lines of British policy . Prominent among the states that needed financial assistance was Spain, which was at this time involved in most difficult political complications . Since the year 1823, when a Bourbon and reactionary France had intervened in Spain in order to reestablish the absolute rule of King Ferdinand VII, who had been overwhelmed by revolution, conditions in the two coun- tries had completely changed . When, after the July revo- lution, Charles X was exiled, and the constitutional King Louis Philippe was placed upon the throne of France, Ferdinand VII found himself deprived of French sup- port . A further difficulty was the dispute that developed in the royal family at the beginning of the thirties, about the succession . King Ferdinand VII had no children by his first three wives ; his fourth wife, Marie Christine, the beautiful Neapolitan, presented him with two daughters . In Spain, however, succession was recognized only through the male line, so that Don Carlos, an absolutist, with views as conservative as those of Metternich, was the heir apparent . 107"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"108 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The queen persuaded her husband to promulgate a Pragmatic Sanction declaring women, and consequently their daughters, entitled to succeed . Don Carlos, however, did not recognize this measure as valid, thus starting the long dispute about the succession . As Don Carlos, the Pretender, was a declared adherent of the old regime, the young queen proceeded to look to the liberal party for support on the death of her husband in September, 1 833 . The whole of Europe took sides in the dispute . In accordance with their general policy the more lib- eral western Powers aligned themselves on the side of the queen, whose adherents came to be called Christinos . They showed considerable reserve, however, and little inclination to intervene directly . The absolutist eastern Powers, and especially Austria under Metternich, took the side of Don Carlos . At the beginning of the year 1835 things did not look too well for Queen Christine . The Carlists had made progress, and in January there had actually been a revolution . So great was the indig- nation in the capital at Austria's attitude that the court did not even go into mourning when the Emperor Fran- cis died on April 11 . Ministries constantly changed and the struggle continued . Both sides engaged in this internecine struggle needed troops and money . The latter was generously forthcoming from various Powers, but it was also wasted in a most lavish manner . Since 1823 loans to the extent of nearly three billion reals had been issued . Soon official sources no longer sufficed and private banks had to intervene . They endeavored, however, to hinder the granting of credits, according to the political tendencies of their vari- ous governments, to the party whose cause they did not favor .

It is true that the fact that the brothers were simul- taneously settled in the principal capitals of Europe, and were able to take concerted action on any matter, was, as we have seen, one of the principal reasons for the rise of the House, as one brother always kept the others in- formed of what was happening . They were all in a strong position to obtain reliable information, as they were able in the course of administering the property of influential persons in the various countries to establish connections whereby they always could obtain the most recent and authentic news without any suspicion of bribery . Sometimes, however, this cosmopolitanism also in- volved them in difficulties ; and in this particular case there was a natural difference of opinion between the five brothers . Nathan was in a particularly awkward position since England was most inclined to intervene actively . Although France had joined the so-called Triple Alli- ance, concluded on April 22, 1 834, between England, France, Spain, and Portugal-the Austrian ambassador in Paris had received the first news of its conclusion from James Rothschild, to whom Nathan had sent a courier'- Louis Philippe had no desire to pull the chestnuts out of the fire and to intervene actively in Spain on behalf of the liberal Queen Christine, as Louis XVIII had done on behalf of the absolutist King Ferdinand VII . The liberal policy forced upon Louis Philippe through the manner in which he had attained power was really most distasteful to him . He was not a constitutionalist from conviction, and privately felt that it would be ex- ceedingly difficult to secure his throne in France against the wishes of the eastern Powers and without their sup- port . Moreover in the strictest secrecy of his own heart he cherished the hope of marrying the heir to the throne, the Duke of Orleans, to an Austrian archduchess . James Rothschild, who was in constant touch with the monarch and his most intimate advisers, knew the king's attitude,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"no \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild and therefore wished as far as possible to keep himself financially out of the Spanish hornets' nest . It is unnec- essary to observe that the Vienna, Frankfort, and Naples brothers, who were farther from the scene of action, and entirely under the influence of Metternich, wished to have nothing whatever to do with Spain . At that time the five brothers constituted a single firm ; the action of any one of them affected all the rest, and herein lay the possi- bility of conflict . In spite of all considerations against such action Nathan had two very good reasons for wishing to make a loan to Spain, i .e ., to the Queen Regent Marie Christine . He would be acting in accordance with the wishes of the British government, and it would work in conveniently as part of a large scheme he was planning, which prom- ised to be an excellent piece of business . There were only two places on the continent of Europe where quicksilver was produced, while overseas sources were practically negligible . The two sources were the quicksilver mines of Idria, which the House of Rothschild had purchased from the Austrian government and worked, and the quicksilver mines of Almaden in Spain, the products of which constituted an important revenue for Spain . A concern possessing both quicksilver . mines would have established a monopoly and would be able to control the price of the metal . Such was Nathan's scheme, and he was now endeavor- ing to obtain the concession of the Almaden mines from Spain in return for the financial assistance she was always needing, with a view to working them intensively . These mines had been owned by the Fuggers in the sixteenth century, and the idea appealed to Nathan of further em- phasizing the similarity between the position and influ- ence exercised by that house and by his own . Nathan sent his son Lionel to Madrid to carry out his plans . In agreement with the queen regent the Spanish gov- ernment had decided to auction the right of working the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne iii Almaden mines, which at that time yielded only 16,ooo to i 8,ooo hundredweight of quicksilver at 37 pesetas per hundredweight, offering a lease of about five years, in order that the productivity of the mines might be in- creased by the expenditure of foreign capital . Offers were to be sent in to the finance minister under seal and then examined . The House of Rothschild employed their old tactics . They offered 5 reals more than any other offer which should not exceed 54 piasters the hundredweight . The .Spanish government was especially inclined to give the lease to the House of Rothschild because Lionel had come with an offer from Nathan to lend the government i5 million francs at a low rate of interest, and this offer had been gratefully accepted . Moreover, the Spanish govern- ment much preferred dealing with the powerful firm of Rothschild, with its world-wide connection, to dealing with the small native banks which were financially weak . The Rothschilds had shown an uncanny instinct in hit- ting on the figure 54 ; for the highest offer, which was made by the Spanish Bank of Zuluete, was exactly 54 piasters, and the Rothschilds, having offered 5 reals more, were indicated as persons who should get the contract . A solemn agreement was accordingly signed on Febru- ary 21, 1835, by Lionel Rothschild and the Spanish finance minister, Count Jose Maria Toreno, and the agreement also bore the signature of the queen regent, Marie Christine . To mark the occasion Lionel was made a member of the Order of Isabella the Catholic . Toreno had passed an adventurous life . At the time of the first Napoleon in i 8o8 he had carried through the memorable alliance between Spain and England against the mighty Corsican . He was a man of liberal leanings, and advocated freedom of the press, the abolition of the Inquisition, and the dissolution of the innumerable spirit- ual Orders scattered over Spain . He was therefore forced to leave Spain when the reactionary King Ferdinand VII"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"112 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild returned, and lived for a long time in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of James Rothschild, but fell out with him, probably owing to the refusal to grant a loan . On the death of King Ferdinand VII he was recalled to office by the queen regent, and made finance minister on June i5, 1834, thus attaining a position which was of the very greatest importance to the House of Rothschild, even though it intervened in Spanish affairs only through Nathan's branch . This fact did not at the time prejudice the quicksilver mine agreement because Toreno needed the money for the state . Indeed Lionel had on May 27, in accordance with the usual custom of the House, asked for and obtained cer- tain modifications of the agreement in their favor, the most important of which was that the Spanish govern- ment should renounce a right to terminate the agreement at the end of three years in return for a slight increase in the price per hundred . The Rothschilds agreed to pay 55 piasters per hundredweight, and all alterations in the con- tract were accepted on June 4, 1835, the Rothschilds hav- ing brought pressure to bear on various important persons, not neglecting the civil list of the queen, to which they are said to have contributed 500,ooo francs, the queen being in very straitened circumstances at the time . 2 The transaction was profitable to both parties, for, by virtue of the monopoly which they had achieved, the Rothschilds were enabled to sell the mineral, which cost them 55 piasters per hundredweight, at 76 and even at 8o in London . This naturally yielded a very considerable profit, and everything was done to increase output, a fact from which the Spanish government also benefited ; and it took advantage of the position constantly to ask the House of Rothschild for advances on account of the quicksilver royalties . Nevertheless Spain's financial position grew steadily worse owing to the interminable civil war and maladmin- istration .

James, however, had no political reasons for lending money to Spain, and the quicksilver business had been satisfactorily settled . Toreno's request was therefore refused, a fact which made him indignant, not only with James but with the whole House of Rothschild . Meanwhile Toreno suc- ceeded in arranging the loan with Ardouin, another banker, but on very unfavorable conditions . The course of the negotiations had further revealed to the Rothschilds the exceedingly unsatisfactory condition of Spain's finances . The four brothers on the Continent, who had anyhow resented Nathan's action in advancing 15,ooo,ooo, became anxious about their money, and reproached their brother . It was finally decided to bring every possible pressure to bear on the Spanish government to repay it . This aroused Toreno's hostility to the full, and he made every effort to put obstacles in the way of the repayment of the money by the Spanish government . In the end, and at the cost of much effort, the Rothschilds succeeded in recovering part of their money in cash, and part of it in the very doubtful bonds of the Ardouin loan . They man- aged to do this, however, by the simple process of buying the obstinate finance minister . The man certainly proved expensive ; he got 1,300,000 francs as a first instalment, and a further 300,000 francs in the course of the negotia- tions, that is, a total of 1,6oo,ooo francs . After thus recovering the money which they had lent to Spain, the brothers had a discussion in Paris at which they expressed their rage and indignation at the attitude of the Spanish government, and particularly at the con- temptible ingratitude and unscrupulous avarice of To- reno .

In order to settle these risky Spanish transactions,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"114 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild which had been far from going through to the satisfac- tion of all the brothers, James Rothschild went to see Nathan in London ~t the end of May, 1835, intending to take advantage of this opportunity for negotiating with a business friend, Don Juan Alvarez y Mendizabal, in matters regarding Portugal's public finances . While he was there they received the alarming news that Martinez della Rosa's ministry had been forced to resign on the question of Franco-British intervention, and that the new prime minister was none other than the notorious Count Toreno . Nathan was terrified by this appointment, al- though the bad news was modified by the fact that Toreno meant to ask Mendizabal, who was friendly to the Roths- childs, to take office under him as finance minister . The appointment of Toreno, and the wretched condi- tion of the public finances, as well as the unfavorable military position with regard to the Pretender, Don Carlos, made Nathan nervous about all his commitments in Spain, including the highly profitable quicksilver mines . If Don Carlos were to come into power it would be the death blow to all the interests in Spain of Nathan as being the supporter of the queen regent and her lib- eral adherents . He therefore made great efforts at this time to secure the armed intervention of England and France in Spain . However, all that he was able to per- suade the governments to do was, in the case of France, to place the Foreign Legion at the free disposal of the queen, and in the case of England to raise a volunteer regiment, despite the protest of the Tories . Nathan actively assisted in recruiting the volunteers, which with- out his money would have been impossible .

Nathan was not aware that he had a powerful enemy in von Hummelauer, who often reported direct to Vienna in the frequent absence of the indolent ambassador, and thus had gained the ear of Metternich . Nathan generally called at the Austrian embassy on Sundays and would talk to von Hummelauer if Ester- hazy was away . On hearing of the expected fall of the Spanish ministry, and that Toreno would probably be- come president, he called at the embassy showing every sign of alarm and distress . He stated emphatically that it was clear from a letter his Paris brother had sent him, that if the eastern Powers should prevent France from intervening in Spain, Louis Philippe would be finished, and dethroned within a few weeks if not days . Von Hummelauer's view was that this was absolutely incon- sistent with the reports from Paris, but he felt that Nathan was in a position to speak with such authority that what he said could not be entirely ignored . More- over, James also being present in London indicated that the two brothers were taking important decisions . Prince Metternich had received information from the most various sources to the effect that the House of Roths- child was supporting with money, not his candidate, the \"Legitimist' and reactionary Don Carlos, who was fight- ing the queen regent, but the Queen Regent Christine herself, who had been born of the foam of the revolution ; in addition to all this he was now told that James had actually traveled from Paris to London in order to lend considerable financial aid in support of England's mili- tary expenditure on behalf of Queen Christine, in order that Spanish securities might rise in value .

He wrote a lettre parti- culiere to the count, explaining his suspicions of the brothers Rothschild, and instructing the ambassador to find out what the position was . Count Apponyi took the bull by the horns . Although he must have realized that he was scarcely likely to get a complete explanation in this way, he simply called on Solomon Rothschild to ask him about the matter . Ap- ponyi's report on the meeting is exceedingly interesting, although Solomon can scarcely have revealed to the am- bassador the fond de sa pensee g When Apponyi explained to him that Metternich was uneasy regarding the policy of the House of Rothschild in Spain, Solomon Rothschild at first expressed his pain- ful ful astonishment at such apparent mistrust regarding the attitude of his House in relation to the financial side of the Spanish question . He most solemnly protested his sin- cerity and his good faith, and assured Apponyi that pre- cisely the converse was true, and that the rumors that were current were entirely unfounded . He followed this up with the somewhat far-fetched assertion, told to the count under the \"seal of the strictest secrecy,\" and promptly retailed by him to Metternich, that Nathan, the head of the London branch, had allowed himself to be persuaded by the entreaties of his wife Hannah, daughter of the English banker Cohen, who had herself been brought into the matter by a complicated process of intrigue, to advance about 16,ooo,ooo francs to the Spanish government . The four brothers had highly dis- approved of this operation and regretted it, but they had inevitably been involved in the transaction, since they were all partners and jointly responsible for the actions of any one member of the House .

Thousands of holders of Spanish securities lost two-thirds of their property, but the Rothschilds made far more out of it than the amount of the gratuity -en pots de vin, as Apponyi put it-with which they had bribed Count Toreno . \"Tell Prince Metternich,\" Solomon Rothschild went on to say to Apponyi, \"the House of Rothschild has done all this for vengeance, and if Don Carlos is successful he will largely have the House of Rothschild to thank for it .

He wanted, even without having cleared up his accounts and put his affairs in order, for which he did not feel sufficiently calm, immediately to leave for Frankfort .

He felt the enormous power wielded by the House of Rothschild, and what a misfortune and a stupidity it would be to expose oneself to the risk of incurring its vengeance. There were certainly many more innocent than guilty among the victims, but Count Apponyi had grounds for satisfaction, since the fall in Spanish securi- ties had naturally affected Count Toreno's prestige, and the queen regent, Marie Christine, and her system, which was so vigorously opposed by Apponyi's supreme chief, the all-powerful Metternich, had suffered a serious blow . \"Is it possible for a banker,\" Apponyi asked, \"to take vengeance in any other way, having regard to the numer- ous innocent victims of such an operation ; and are we justified in complaining of the effect produced by this operation upon one of the most important political ques- tions of our time?\" Meanwhile Metternich had also received reports from von Hummelauer in England, and Esterhazy had re- ceived, more particularly through the Austrian ambassa- dor in London, various items of information compromis- ing the House of Rothschild with regard to its Spanish policy . Esterhazy asked Nathan and James to come and see him, and questioned them on the matter . They natu- rally did their best to allay the ambassador's fears . James wrote a letter from London on June 23, 1835, containing the following passage : s \"We had a long conversation with Prince Esterhazy, and it is clear that Pozzo does not love us .

One fact was clearly estab- lished ; namely, that the London Rothschild stood for the same liberal views as the British government, and that was the essence of the matter . Von Hummelauer trusted Nathan no farther than he could see him . \"For,\" he wrote a little later,\" \"even if Nathan had entirely disposed of the Spanish affair, I should not regard this as any real guaranty for his con- duct in the future .

He has struck me ever since I have been here as so completely disingenuous and so cheap in his motives that I am convinced that he will always plump for the side on which there is anything to gain, and that if offers should be made from the revolu- tionary party he would not hesitate to accept them .\" On receiving these complaints from the London em- bassy, Metternich protested to Wertheimstein, the Vienna manager of the House of Rothschild, and he duly re- ported on this to Solomon in Paris and to the two brothers in London .

He said that he was bound to report the fact that Nathan had at one time spoken in favor of inter- vention in Spain, on the ground of news which he had received . from James in Paris . Nathan was exceedingly embarrassed, for he was unable to deny this in front of his Paris brother . \"James's astonishment at my statement,\" von Hum- melauer reported,? \"was no less than my surprise, when James emphatically gave me his word that he had written in a precisely contrary sense to his brother, that is to say, against intervention and not in favor of it . He had actually pointed to the possibility of Louis Philippe los- ing his throne as a consequence of intervening, and not of refraining from intervention . Everything leads me to the conclusion that this statement of James should be fully believed since it entirely agrees with everything that one has heard from Paris, and accords with the general spirit and well-known public sense of the head of the Paris branch, and with the fact of his exceptional rela- tions with King Louis Philippe .\" Solomon in Paris had also received Wertheimstein's letter regarding Metternich's dissatisfaction and his re- quest for an explanation . As he was normally domiciled at Vienna, and completely dependent upon Metternich, he was naturally far more sensitive to the latter's re- proaches than any of his brothers . Solomon, who was forced to live under the immediate eye of the prince, was naturally particularly concerned to clear himself, as far as the Vienna cabinet was concerned, even if this had to be done at the expense of his brother Nathan .

I must beg you to show the letter only to the Prince, as we and N .M .R . (Nathan) are getting anonymous let- ters threatening our lives for having so much de- pressed the Spanish Bonds, and I am afraid to go out at night . This letter was characteristic in more than one respect ; it shows that the Spanish affair did really trouble Solo- mon exceedingly, and that the false position it placed him in .with regard to Metternich was so painful to him that he had even thought for a moment of separating from his brothers and withdrawing from business . It is evi- dence of the conflict of conscience from which Solomon was suffering, and of the development of a crisis in his relations to his brothers in the west . This was, however, only a passing move . Fundamentally the maxim laid down by the old father Meyer Amschel still held-\"All the brothers shall stand together in everything ; all shall be responsible for the actions of each one\"-and the desire for profit and constantly increased power for the House was greater than any misgivings or any consideration for Metternich . Solomon remembered Psalm 133 : \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity l . . . for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore .\" While the Rothschilds had at first been disappointed in Spain, they had succeeded in their principal object, the acquisition of the quicksilver mines, and the loan affair with Toreno had been dealt with adequately. By their bear operations in Spanish securities they not merely . had recovered the amount spent in bribing Toreno but had made a profit besides . The final result therefore had been, as Solomon himself had to admit, that his much abused brother Nathan had achieved a financial gain to the general benefit of the House of Rothschild ."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne 125 . So far, so good ; but Solomon wanted to ascertain who had spread the rumors which had made such an impres- sion on the imperial court of Vienna, or rather on Metter- nich . It did not take him long to find out, for he had his confidential agents everywhere ; especially he had friends whose interest it was immediately to bring in any news that might be of value . Prominent among the mischief- makers was Count Carl Pozzo di Borgo, the old bitter enemy of Napoleon, whom he had hated since they were boys together in Corsica . The count, who was seventy years of age, was at that period Russian ambassador in London . Notoriously avaricious, this seventy-year-old diplomatist had amassed a large fortune in the course of his career, but his desire for money was insatiable . He had been connected with the Rothschilds when they had been engaged in the issue of the Austrian Metalliques . Two days after he had sent the above letter to Vienna, Solomon received a detailed letter from his brother Nathan, putting him in full possession of the facts re- garding the part which Pozzo had played . He at once took the letter to Count Apponyi, and wrote another letter to Wertheimstein in Hebrew . Paris, 26th June, 2 835 . I enclose a copy of a letter from London, the origi- nal of which I showed to Count Apponyi, requesting him to write to Vienna confirming the fact that he had seen the original here . You see that Pozzo is the source of all these slanders . I may be permitted to explain to my real friends the origin of Pozzo's deep and bitter hatred of the House of Rothschild . You will remember that in connection with the Metal- liques Loan, which immediately rose to a premium of five, and then of ten percent, my brother James wrote to me at Vienna stating that Pozzo wanted to be given i,ooo,ooo gulden at the issue price . James added himself that he was counting on Pozzo getting at least half a million . You will remember that I had"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"126 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild very few Metalliques left, and why should I make a present to Pozzo of forty to fifty thousand florins, to Pozzo, one of the world's worst misers, who has had so many profitable dealings in rentes with our firm? Pozzo's suggestion was accordingly refused, James telling him that unfortunately I had none . He has since been our bitterest enemy, and makes a profit- able business of damaging us . I got my brother James to go to London to get all these accounts cleared up ; thereupon Pozzo springs the yarn that James went to London to pay the ruffians who were going from there to Spain . In the enclosed copy of a letter from Nathan regarding part of the account, the original of which has also been seen by Apponyi, you will find an item of about i,6oo,ooo, of which we had to allow Toreno and his gang to rob us in order to recover our money . I am also sending you a Madrid newspaper, which contains proof that we were against the intervention, as well as an extract from Lionel's letter, which the Count has also read . It is not interested motives that lead me to make such efforts to clear myself of suspicion in the eyes of the Austrian Cabinet . No, as God is my witness, I am actuated by love, respect, and devotion . Were I dealing only with that miser Pozzo, who, because he did not get his 500,000 florins, has become our deadly enemy, he would see how little his lies worry me . Solomon's intention was that all his remarks should be duly conveyed to Metternich so as to reestablish himself in Metternich's good graces, even if he did so at the expense of his brother Nathan . Nathan was far away and outside Metternich's range . Meanwhile the position in Spain had undergone a profound change, and this was attributable in no small degree to the influence of the Rothschilds . His over- whelming financial difficulties and the vicissitudes of the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne 127 campaign against Don Carlos had forced Count Toreno to resign in favor of Mendizabal, who succeeded him . This man, who was a Jew by race and religion, had passed an adventurous life . Having a highly developed financial sense, he had been an army contractor early in his career, and had then entered the service of the rich Madrid banker Don Vicente Bertrand de Lys, who, as we know, came to be closely connected with the House of Rothschild . It was through him that the Rothschilds made the acquaintance of Mendizabal . Mendizabal suc- ceeded in ingratiating himself with Don Pedro of Por- tugal, to whom he was able to render important financial services . In these transactions Mendizabal worked in close alliance with the House of Rothschild, which ar- ranged a loan of £2,000,000 to Portugal in April, 1 835 . Later on political reasons compelled Mendizabal to emi- grate to London, where through Nathan Rothschild he was brought into touch with members of the British government . He also speculated on his own account in Spanish securities and made a great deal of money . He still had large holdings in these securities when the Rothschilds decided to bring about the great Spanish slump . Mendizabal would have been ruined had not Nathan given him previous warning of what was going to happen . Now this very man was prime minister in Spain, a highly satisfactory circumstance for the Roths- childs, especially as James, as well as Nathan, was on the most friendly and personal terms with the new min- ister . The financial situation in Spain was certainly ex- tremely bad, and the continuing military operations against the Carlists made it necessary to go on raising money . Mendizabal made generous promises on taking office, and substantially increased the public debt, in the effort to carry them out . He was generally regarded as the agent of the most important bankers in London . The Duke of Wellington, who viewed with dissatis- faction the fact that the Liberal English cabinet sup-"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"128 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild ported the appointment of Mendizabal, went as far as to say' that he regarded the man as nothing more than a tool of Herr von Rothschild, whose duty it was to fur- ther the interests of the speculators in Spanish securities . In this matter Wellington was of exactly the same mind as Herr von Hummelauer, because in the Spanish affair Nathan had supported the political opponents of the aged field-marshal . \"Is he still your consul?\" Wellington asked Hum- melauer in 1836 . \"Yes,\" replied Hummelauer, \"but for many years all personal contact between me and Herr von Rothschild has ceased, so that relations between him and the embassy are now entirely suspended .\" is Mendizabal's government, however, satisfied neither the Spain of the queen regent nor the Rothschilds . He kept on piling up the debt, and increased the deficit to an enormous extent . It was all very well for the Rothschilds to tell everyone that they were having nothing more to do with Spain . That was not the case as long as they were in possession of the rich quicksilver mines, and to that extent dependent upon Madrid . Nathan did not wish to endanger the suc- cess of one of his most daring business strokes through excessive harshness in dealing with his friend Mendiza- bal's constant applications for loans . His brothers, how- ever, took a different attitude as they were dependent upon Metternich, Louis Philippe, and other powerful persons . Toward the end of 1835 the Spanish queen's govern- ment approached England for a loan, and England sug- gested to France that they should jointly guarantee £2,- ooo,ooo . Nathan was asked to take a part in this loan .

If France will not agree to the proposal it is highly probable that England will give her guaranty alone, if not for the whole amount at any rate for a part . \"Under such an arrangement, my dear brother, we should be running no risk at all in my opinion, for if France and England give their guaranty it will be like the `Greek Loan .' . . . Please forward this letter at once to our brother Solomon at Vienna as I am very anxious to know what Uncle thinks of this matter .\" By \"Uncle\" he meant Metternich . It is interesting to note that Nathan was kept informed by his \"most inti- mate friend in the British Cabinet .\" He was certainly use- ful for such business . It was difficult for Solomon at Vienna to persuade Met- ternich to acquiesce again in the plan of granting a loan to the enemy of his protege Don Carlos, a loan which in any case was bound to be fruitless . For Metternich would not change his opinion, especially in a matter in- volving the fundamental principles upon which his policy was based . Solomon represented the matter as though Nathan wished to ascertain Metternich's opinion, but he sent him the extract from the letter which has been given above . The result was, as might have been expected, one of the chancellor's typical lecturing tirades . He wrote as follows in a private letter to Solomon Rothschild : 18"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"130 \t The Reign o f the House o f Rothschild Vienna, 29 December, 1835 . I have considered the letter which you have sent me with the attention which the subject obviously de- serves . You know me well enough to have learned that I never engage in speculative transactions, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to take cognizance of them . This case raises other considerations ; and your brother Nathan M . desires to know my views . These I shall express without beating about the bush as an honorable man who is well disposed to your House should . The business under discussion has two sides, a financial and a moral one . The first is no con- cern of mine. A loan guaranteed by two sea Powers is undoubtedly a safe financial transaction . You will appreciate this better than I can . If your brother wishes to make money, this is an opportunity for doing so . From every moral point of view I con- sider the business to be one of the most damnable, as I shall have no difficulty in showing . Although neither I nor anybody else, who has had experience of public affairs, would venture to proph- esy the final outcome of the Spanish Revolution, the outcome on another field is painfully obvious-I mean the inevitability of Spanish bankruptcy . What- ever may happen in that unfortunate country, its public debt cannot be met, and anything that is done in England now with reference to the Peninsula is simply putting o f the evil day, and also making the ultimate disaster more extensive . And who are the people who will be hit? They are unfortunate fathers of families, small capitalists, the value of whose Spanish securities will dwindle away to nothing ; and in order to put off the evil day, rivers of blood are being poured out in Spain, while at the head of the so-called Administration-for it administers noth- ing-is an agent of the British Stock Exchange, and the country is being systematically robbed of all the resources which might have improved its future l Such operations may bring blood money, but such"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne 131 money brings no happiness I The loan in question can serve no other purpose than to meet obligations due in London for one term ; Spain will receive not one farthing of the money . All that Spain can hope from the scheme is an extension of the deceptive appear- ance of there still being resources where there are no real resources at all, and this deception will cost much blood . I am speaking now of the national . bankruptcy which God Himself could not prevent . If your honorable House were to take over the business it would earn the curses of those who will eventually be overwhelmed in bankruptcy . A House which has won its position by very different methods from these should not be a party to such a scheme . Nathan Meyer may say that such considerations cannot affect a business decision ; this may be true where such decisions are admittedly uninfluenced by any . moral considerations whatever . I am not that type of man, and I am sure that, on reflection, Nathan Meyer will feel that neither is he . However, he wished to know my opinion, and this I frankly ex- press in the way with which you are familiar . Metternich's high moralizing made but little impres- sion on the members of the Rothschild family other than Solomon . They knew perfectly well that the imperial government had backed the absolutist Don Carlos, and that it was on its side giving him very considerable finan- cial support . It was as yet by no means evident that Don Carlos would not triumph in the end . If he had only been somewhat more energetic and decisive he might on three occasions easily have succeeded in becoming master of Spain . But even if he were to succeed, how could one lose with the guaranty of France and England? If things went wrong, well, those two states would suffer . Solomon at Vienna could always take refuge in the fact that he had loyally told Metternich everything, pointing to the difficulty of opposing the majority of his brothers,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"132 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild In any case he let them carry on with their profitable transactions . At least such was the view of Herr von Hummelauer, the enemy of the Rothschilds at the Aus- trian embassy in London . He was constantly sending hos- tile reports about the Rothschilds to Vienna regarding their Spanish transactions, and keeping everybody in a state of alarm . Thus he reported on April 15, 1836, that the House of Rothschild was negotiating with the gov- ernment of the queen regent with regard to loans, the payment of interest on old loans, etc ., that it was planning all kinds of intrigues, and more especially had lately endeavored to frustrate the banker Ouvrard's efforts to arrange a loan for Don Carlos .19 Metternich immediately asked Solomon Rothschild, who had returned to Vienna, to come and see him, and taxed him with von Hummelauer's accusation . There- upon father and son put in a detailed memorandum re- garding the financial arrangements of their House with Spain . They described Metternich's information as false, and as obviously emanating from an unreliable source . It was true that Mendizabal had suggested the House of Rothschild should grant further advances to an amount of £200,000 to £250,000 on the security of the royalties of the quicksilver mines, and a similar amount on the security of Spanish rentes . The House of Rothschild had, however, refused to do so, although the mines in the south of the country were far from the scene of action in the civil war, and therefore offered adequate security for repayment . In spite of everything this attractive sugges- tion had been turned down . Metternich should have confidence in Solomon's char- acter and word, for anyone familiar with the methods of the House of Rothschild, and who had occasion to observe the principles which had for some time governed their transactions, would inevitably come to the conclu- sion that they had no intention of extending the range"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the S'pan'ish Throne 133 of their operations, but rather wished gradually to nar- row their scope, and above all to hold aloof from such venturesome operations as could only result in unpleas- antness and bad blood . Thus the London branch of the House of Rothschild had kept entirely aloof from indus- trial undertakings such as canals and railways, which in England, more than anywhere else, had been the subject of the most unrestrained speculation . No sensible man therefore could seriously believe that the House of Roths- child would invest a large portion of its wealth in stocks which in the view of even the most zealous partizans of Isabella offered only a highly precarious security, and rested on no solid foundation . The position of the House of Rothschild was such that it could not absolutely stand apart from all transactions in Spanish funds ; its relations with the public and the nature of its business forced it to engage in them even against its inclination . Such operations, however, were essentially stock exchange transactions, and did not con- stitute real investments such as would bind the House of Rothschild to the interests of that country . \"Finally, I would take the liberty,\" Solomon's letter continued, 20 \"to observe to your Highness that all the ru- mors and on dits current about the House of Rothschild and its relations with the Spanish Government should be accepted only with the greatest reserve . They are gen- erally the result of that slanderous malice to which any- body who exercises a certain influence is inevitably ex- posed . Persons interested in speculating on the bourses -and the habit of speculating in negotiable securities is extending to all classes of society-frequently make play with the name of the House of Rothschild, and try to interpret its actions in the sense of their own operations, as this increases their confidence in making a profit .\" This memorandum, except for one inconsistency, was very cleverly drafted . The inconsistency lay in the fact that the opening paragraphs which stated that Mendiza-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"134 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild bal's offers had been refused, described them as being very attractive and fully guaranteed, whereas two pages later Spain's guaranties were described as \"highly pre- carious and unsound .\" The truth was that, in view of the fact that Spanish securities were falling away to noth- ing owing to the civil war and the maladministration, the Rothschilds were really not at all anxious to invest too much money in the country except under the guaranty of states such as France and England . But having regard to their position in the quicksilver mines, which they did not wish to sacrifice at any price, they had to exer- cise a certain restraint in this matter, and were therefore compelled to engage in certain transactions . Von Hummelauer in London continued to send Met- ternich in Vienna reports hostile to the Rothschilds . He went so far as to accuse the British government also of intrigues, and of \"capable connivance\" with the Roths- childs . \"The Ministry,\" he reported on April 26, 1836, 21 \"is to such an extent dependent upon the House of Roths- child, that it will shrink from no sacrifice of honor or profit to induce that firm to pay the interest due on the Spanish bonds May 1, in order to prevent the immediate collapse of Spain's finances which the Government could not survive .\" In spite of the pressure of the British government, however, the Rothschilds were very much disinclined to commit themselves too deeply in Spain, especially as the possibility of intervention in that country was more remote than ever . Louis Philippe in particular declared that nothing would move him in the attitude he had taken up with regard to Spain . \"Before France shall intervene in Spain,\" the king said, 22 \"it will be necessary to dethrone me . . . . \"It is said that the Rothschilds want to negotiate a loan in the Peninsula .

If Don Carlos is to be sup- pressed, this must be done by the Spaniards themselves .\" The Rothschilds did, in fact grant no further loans to Spain, and this was due in no small degree to the fact that the most powerful pillar of the five brothers sud- denly collapsed . The marriage between Nathan's eldest son Lionel and his cousin Charlotte, the daughter of Carl at Naples, had been fixed to take place at Frank- fort in June, 1836 . This further union between two blood relations was entirely in accordance with the scheme of old Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who, in order to main- tain the family unity and to concentrate the family for- tunes, had charged his children to admit as few foreign families as possible into the most intimate family circle . All the brothers met at the family home at Frankfort for the wedding, James being accompanied by his friend the great Rossini . The wedding itself was celebrated with unparalleled splendor and magnificence ; but shortly after the festivities the bridegroom's father fell sick . Nathan, the greatest financial genius of the five broth- ers, was at that time fifty-nine years old . His malady grew obviously worse, and the brothers finally called in Tra- vers, the most eminent English doctor of the day . But medical skill was of no avail, and on July 28, 1836, Na- than Rothschild, the greatest of five great brothers, died, Solomon Rothschild, who had stayed at his brother's bedside throughout his illness, forgot all that he had ever said or written about his brother Nathan, and reported the cruel loss to Metternich . 28 Filled with immeasurable sorrow [he wrote], and in the deepest despondency, I have to inform you that my most deeply loved brother Nathan Meyer Rothschild is no more .

Three days before his death he told me all his thoughts and wishes with regard to the will which he then drew up, and which I then had written out in accordance with his intentions . \"We brothers and the whole family have suffered an ir- reparable loss in his death .

I may say with a clear conscience that they will have no cause to regret this, for I have acted with true disinter- estedness as a brother and friend, and have carried through everything justly . \"The agreements between us for a further period of three years had been drawn up, embodying every point, and they were ready for signature, for we still believed that our late brother would with God's help recover .

He gave them much wise counsel, bade them avoid all evil company and al- ways to keep in the way of true virtue, religion, and righteousness . My late brother told them that the world would now try to make money out of us so that it behoved them to be all the more careful, and he remarked that whether any son had £5o,ooo more or not was a matter of indifference to him .

Thus peacefully and in full possession of his faculties our brother passed over into the better life .\" On his brother's death any resentment or indifference of opinion that Solomon had ever felt with regard to his actions melted away like snow in the sun . Everything else was lost in an overwhelming sense of family unity which is so characteristic especially of the Jewish race, and in this case had been inculcated with particular em- phasis by old Meyer Amschel, the founder of the bank . Nathan had left four sons, the eldest of whom, Lionel, became head of the London bank . Thus the third genera- tion since the foundation of the firm were coming into the saddle . In its patriarchal style, and in the tender concern that he showed for his children, Nathan's will was reminiscent of that of his father . It was very general in its terms, and particularly refrained from entering into precise details as to the value of the property left . It dealt especially with the method of carrying on the business, and the contractual relationship binding the partners for the pe- riod of three or five years . \"It is my earnest wish,\" Nathan wrote in his will, 26 \"that my sons shall carry on my business in London, that the association with the other Houses which my dear brothers direct shall be maintained, that they shall con- tinue to remain partners together, and that to this end the Articles of Association between my sons and my broth- ers shall be renewed for further periods of five years .

The government also refrained from applying too close a measure in the case of a man who had rendered it such important services over a period of years, and even in the last year of his life had succeeded in raising a loan of £is,ooo,ooo to indemnify the slave owners when slavery was abolished . The death of Nathan was a very serious loss to the House . Heyden says of him very justly in his \"Galerie beruhmter and merkwurdiger Frankfurter\" 27 that, al- though Nathan was the third son, he was looked upon as the head of the family, and the other brothers generally took his advice . He was the controlling spirit in the appli- cation of the enormous fund which they jointly possessed . Gutzkow said of him, 28 that he threw himself into all his undertakings with enormous vigor, and everything about him was on a large scale . Nathan was a splendid example of the traditions and wealth of the city . He was as much respected there as he was feared, and made upon all who knew him the impression of a man who had a positive genius for business . He himself had the great- est possible admiration for industry .

Of mas- sive build, his head set between thick shoulders, he would stand there with his hands deep in his trouser pockets, apparently indifferent to what was going on about him, but in reality observing everything very closely . Nathan would also reply in monosyllables, giving short and defi- nite instructions . He was fully conscious of his power, and uninfluenced by the flattery which his riches called forth . He had gradually come to despise mankind, having been led to this conclusion through observing the effect of the gold that flowed from his hand .\" Nathan's body was brought from Frankfort to London, and lay at New Court, his house in St . Swithin's Lane . The funeral procession on August 8, 1836, was an out- ward symbol of the enormous position which Nathan had achieved in the British Empire . The representatives of the great Powers, the lord mayor, the sheriffs, and sev- eral aldermen of the City of London followed the coffin, which was preceded by a procession of Jewish orphan children clothed in white . The whole of London had come to see the funeral procession ; the crowds were enor- mous, and it was difficult to maintain order . Such was the funeral of the man who forty years before had emi- grated from Frankfort to London as a small Jewish trader without name or position . Solomon saw to it that the event was given proper publicity . James had arranged for an article of extrava- gant praise of Nathan to appear in the journal des Debats, and Solomon arranged for it to be printed in other papers as well . He asked Gutzkow to help him in this, and Gutzkow wrote the following letter on August 12, 1836, to Kolb, the editor-in-chief of the Allgemeine Zeitung . 31 \"The Vienna Rothschild has approached me with a view to having the article on his brother, which appeared"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish Throne 1 43 on the 5th i nst . i n the journal des Debuts, reproduced in the Allgemeine Zeitung .

The tacit leadership which he had held passed to James in Paris ; in Spanish affairs the House of Rothschild henceforward paid less attention to British wishes, and confined its con- cessions to the minimum that was necessary in order to retain their hold over the quicksilver mines, which it rightly regarded as a highly profitable business . It was the more desirable that the House should cut down its Spanish commitments since Mendizabal proved a fail- ure ; he lost all prestige and Spain came threateningly near the verge of bankruptcy . To Metternich's great satisfaction the Rothschilds with- drew from financial transactions in Spain in view of the desperate condition of the country . Nathan's sons, who wished to stand as well as possible with Austria, in order to secure the consulate, declared to Herr von Hummel- auer 32 that they would have nothing further to do with the Spanish business . \"All kinds of offers,\" they said to him, \"have been made to induce us to take over the next payment of Spanish dividends, but we are determined not to do so, and\"-added one of the Rothschilds-\"it was not we who paid the earlier dividends .\" \"The earlier dividends,\" von Hummelauer commented on this, \"were always paid out of the loans floated by the House of Rothschild ; debts were met by further borrow- ings without the House of Rothschild advancing its own cash .

Mendizabal had resigned in May, 1836, and the summer brought further successes to Don Carlos ; indeed, there was a rising in the immediate neighborhood of the castle of the queen regent . The constitution of 1812 was accepted under duress, and the queen at times meditated flight . The constituent Cortes met on October 24, 1836, amidst circumstances of general confusion . Don Carlos, however, had failed to turn these favor- able circumstances to full account, and Espartero, the general of the Christinos, actually succeeded in Decem- ber, 1836, in inflicting a severe reverse upon him . In the first half of March, however, a concentrated attack by the Christinos failed . Metternich was constantly watching the attitude of the Rothschilds to Spain with grave mistrust, and asked Apponyi to report on it . The latter, instead of referring to persons who had other sources of information, gen- erally asked James Rothschild himself, or accepted the statements of a political charlatan and paid informer called Klindworth, whose reports were only too fre- quently untrue. In March, 1837, Apponyi had another dis- cussion with James Rothschild in which the latter said that the yield of the quicksilver mines had been enor- mously increased, and that the Rothschilds were being asked for an advance of 2,000,000 francs on account of royalties . He said that their Madrid agent was pressing for the acceptance of this proposal, and begging that James Rothschild, who paid the expenses of the Spanish legation in Paris, (amounting to 8o,ooo francs a month) out of his own pocket without ever receiving a refund, should not cease these payments .

June saw a further change in the fortunes of war, and for a time Don Carlos was actually planning to advance on Madrid . In May and June, 1837, he had substantial successes . This produced a panic in the Paris branch of Rothschilds, where it was feared that \"these devils, the members of the Cortes\" would make difficulties about the Almaden mines . Rothschild thought he could come to an understanding with them, but if Don Carlos were to be victorious everything would be lost . At the end of June the French prime minister was dining with the panic- stricken James Rothschild, and remarked on that occasion to Baron von Hugel, who was acting for Count Ap- ponyi, 33 \"Rothschild is entirely preoccupied with the losses that he expects to incur, and he is particularly anxious about his quicksilver mines, which he says Don Carlos will take from him . These people are simply after money, and forget everything else when their interests are at stake .\" A little later Mole reported, with reference to James, that since he had got involved in the Spanish affairs he had not been the \"Rothschild d'autrefois .\" 34 Solomon, who was then again staying in Paris, stated definitely that no one, and he least of all, would ever again lend the government at Madrid a single sou . Metternich's resentment against the Rothschilds kept increasing, although he still handled them with velvet gloves . Metternich's police intercepted a letter from Lionel in London to his uncle . 35 Lionel spoke of the highly unfavorable impression which had been created by the news that Don Carlos had crossed the Ebro, stating that British consols and Spanish securities had both fallen sharply, and that the whole outlook was exceedingly gloomy .

Toward the end of 1837 Spain was again engaging the anxious attention of the brothers as the Cortes, at the instigation of the Rothschilds' rivals, was questioning the validity of the quicksilver mines contract, and of the vari- ations which had been made in it . Weisweiller, the Rothschild agent at Madrid, made every effort to main- tain the legal validity of the contract . The firm of Zulueta, which had at the time competed with the House of Rothschild for the contract, based its objection on the fact that the latter had at the time offered only 5o, sub- ject to the proviso that if anybody offered 54 they would pay 55 .- Such a procedure had, however, been irregular . The Rothschild agent also called in the assistance of the English and French ministers to the Spanish gov- ernment, who both made representations on behalf of the House of Rothschild . The Spanish ministry also rep- resented to the Cortes that the quicksilver contract was an important and useful one to the Spanish state . \"However that may be,\" Count Apponyi reported with reference to the effect of this contretemps on James Roths- childse \"he appears to be in a state of the most extraordi- nary excitement at this attempt of the Cortes to deprive him of a business which at an approximate estimate must yield him an annual income of from one and a fourth to two million francs . He will no doubt in the end be guided by the direction in which his interests lie, and will find roundabout means at the sacrifice of a certain amount of money to secure a business which is a source of such con- siderable profit to his House .\" It was also current gossip in Paris that the quicksilver agreement had not gone through without a certain amount"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Marie Christine, Queen of Spain"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds and the Spanish' Throne t¢9 of money having passed under the table, and that the House of Rothschild were now threatening disclosures ; so that a friendly solution would appear to be in the in- terest of both parties . In the end an agreement was reached by increasing the amount payable to the Spanish government in respect of each hundredweight of quick- silver raised, and by granting new advances on royalties . Apart from this, after the death of Nathan the Roths- childs had practically nothing more to do with Spanish loans, except under French and English guaranty, and in such cases Metternich was always advised . In March, 1838, the secret agent Klindworth, whom Count Apponyi was using to an increasing extent, again stated that the Rothschilds were negotiating for a further Spanish loan . Metternich again asked Solomon what this meant, with the result that James went to see Apponyi in a state of high indignation, asking him to inform his chief of the falsity of this rumor about the loan . \"Baron James von Rothschild,\" Count Apponyi re- ported, 40 \"who has undoubtedly foreseen that rumors of financial transactions would come to my knowledge, has given me the most formal assurance that he not only has refused to take part in any loan in favor of the Spanish Government, but also has declined any financial opera- tion, the object of which would be to raise money for Spain . He most positively denies all imputations of this nature, and asked me to inform your Highness of this most formal declaration by him . Baron Rothschild has expressly and spontaneously instructed me to give your Highness his word that he will never engage in a loan to the Spanish Government without first being authorized to do so by your Highness .\" Thus Metternich felt that through his obstinate insis- tence he had at last succeeded in stopping further pay- ments of money being made at any rate by the House of Rothschild to the government of the queen regent,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"15o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild while he himself was constantly supplying Don Carlos with money, and was also obtaining support for him from the states allied to Austria .

He was forced to flee from Spain and no longer menaced the Rothschilds in their posses- sion of the quicksilver mines . Nathan was justified ; the valuable quicksilver mines remained in the family's possession, and became a source of very considerable profit . The House owned them until the year 1863, when they were again taken over by the Spanish government .

After railways they turned their attention to steamships, and here again Solo- mon Rothschild profited by what could be learned in Eng- land, and by the British example, calling into being in other countries such as Austria the concerns that he found flourishing in Great Britain . This was indicated by the very name of the big Austrian steamship line in which Solomon interested himself financially . Lloyd was the name given to the shipping company by the shipowners and insurers of men and merchandise who met and did business in the London coffee house owned by Mr . Lloyd . The new Austrian undertaking which came into being in 1835, largely with the assistance of Rothschild capital, was given the same name . At that time the possibilities of steamships were hardly understood, and they were used only for passenger traffic . One of the first memoranda sent in by the Austrian Lloyd to the government 1 contained the words, \"steamers never can and never will become freight ships\" ; and this view was at that time also shared by Solomon Roths- child .

There was scarcely any undertaking of importance in the monarchy in which the Rothschilds were not finan- cially interested . The Vienna authorities, wishing to com- memorate through some permanent memorial the new emperor's accession to the throne, hit upon the idea of constructing a large aqueduct from the Danube to the upper suburbs of Vienna,' as the very dry summer had occasioned a great shortage of water . Rothschild and Sina were asked to help with this scheme too, the former contributing 25,000 florins . As time passed, the Rothschilds' wealth became incon- ceivably vast, and Vienna society, otherwise exclusive, was so dazzled by it that it began to fete Solomon, and admit him to its circles . Metternich and the next most powerful man in Austria, Count Kolowrat, were often to be seen dining with the banker . Kiibeck relates that many people were annoyed with him on that account, and notes the following incident in his diary \"A few days ago Count Kolowrat was dining with Rothschild the banker . Some people of his own position in society told him that this was giving offense . `What would you have had me do?' he said . 'Rothschild attached such enormous importance to my coming that I had to sacrifice myself in the interests of the service, as the state needs him .

Thereupon Count Kolowrat replied, `Very well, give me the thousand florins for a poor man who needs help, and has applied to me .'

Count and Countess Sainte-Aulaire, the Maltzahn woman, the old Princess Marie Esterhazy, the Princess \t , Madame Chorin- sky and Madame Sedlnitzky, Clemens and I were at the dinner, which was excellent .

Long before the death of his brother Nathan Solomon wanted to obtain some official position for his son Anselm, who lived at Frankfort ; and his idea was that Austria should create a consulate-general at Frankfort, where none as yet existed . Solomon approached Metternich on the matter, emphasizing that the office would be unpaid, naturally an important consideration . Metternich in- quired of Baron von Handel, the minister-resident at Frankfort, whether it was desirable to create a consulate- general there, and whether in that case Solomon's son would be a suitable person for the office . Handel answered both questions in the affirmative . With regard to the candidate, he wrote : a \"Baron An- selm von Rothschild combines with the riches, credit, and influence of the House to which he belongs, all the moral and intellectual qualities that make him a suit- able person for filling this office . I venture to guarantee that no objection to such an appointment will be raised by the senate of the free city of Frankfort, especially since Baron Carl von Rothschild [Anselm's uncle] has been appointed his Sicilian Majesty's consul-general here .\" He added that \"only such a person could be appointed to the position as possessed the intellectual qualities and the necessary means to carry out the office with due dig- nity, there being no emoluments of any kind connected with it,\" and in view of this consideration Anselm was duly appointed .' The senate of the free city of Frank- fort, on being officially informed of the appointment, ex- pressed itself as satisfied with it, subject to the following limitations \"The Israelite citizen, Baron Anselm Solomon von Rothschild, is hereby recognized as Imperial and Royal Austrian Consul-General, subject to the reservations that this in no way affects his position as an Israelite citizen of this Free City, and that he will continue to be in the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t ISS future as he has been in the past, subject to the laws and jurisdiction of this Free City, and to the authorities here .\" 7 Anselm wrote to Metternich in terms of most respect- ful gratitude, stating that he was well aware that he owed the appointment entirely \"to Metternich's gra- cious support, and to his powerful influence .\" 8 Matters did not proceed so smoothly with regard to the appointment of Lionel in London, about which Na- than had expressed such heartfelt wishes on his death-bed . During the latter part of Nathan's period of office, vari- ous complaints had been received, more especially from the mercantile authorities at Trieste, accusing him of in- difference in the performance of his duties, and sug- gesting that \"Baron Rothschild finds it impossible to transact the business of the Austrian Consulate in addition to his other affairs, or else finds such business exceedingly irksome .\" s Such objections were already being made when Na- than's death made the problem of the Austrian consulate- general a very real one . Solomon's pathetic request, sent from his brother's death-bed, had left Metternich com- paratively cold, for the chancellor had several grievances against Lionel Rothschild . It had been he who, acting under his father's instructions, had remained at Madrid to carry through financial transactions with the queen regent, of whom Metternich so greatly disapproved, and Who had indeed been the active agent of the policy of the House of Rothschild in Spain, where it supported the Liberal Christinos instead of supporting Metternich's protege, Don Carlos . Metternich therefore delayed the appointment and asked for information regarding the \"personal qualities of the said Lionel-as to his age, his knowledge, his capacity, his morals, his position in the London branch of the Rothschild Bank, and his future prospects .\" All that Metternich really wanted to do, however, was"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"i56 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild to cause Lionel a certain amount of uneasiness, and he had made up his mind to give the department concerned, which was considering the appointment of another per- son, instructions to favor Lionel . \"In view of the important position,\" his note to the department ran, 10 \"which the House of Rothschild holds in the financial, scheme of the civilized world, the appli- cation in question certainly seems to deserve favorable consideration, as otherwise that House might become in- different, or even hostile, to Austria's interests .\" Meanwhile the report asked for from the London em- bassy arrived, having again been drafted by Herr von Hummelauer, who was so ill disposed to the Rothschild family . 11 The said Baron Lionel Nathan von Rothschild [the report ran] seems to me to be rather old at thirty [he was actually twenty-eight] .

His connections will also be such as he has formed on the Stock Exchange . These general considerations . . . which I have already ventured to adumbrate in previous reports, tend to the conclusion that an Austrian Consulate-General in London in the hands of the House of Rothschild, or of any other firm of a similar nature, could never adequately carry out the requirements of Austrian trade interests .

He was carrying out the instructions of his chief, and was not a free agent : nevertheless this fact stands against him and his House . In the inevitable course of their development, the affairs of the Peninsula have reached a point where the State is on the verge of bankruptcy . Your High- ness is aware of the speed with which Spanish and Portuguese public securities have been falling within the last few weeks .

Von Hummelauer therefore proposed that this man should be permanently secured to Austria's interests . 12 A little later von Hummelauer sent in an addendum to his philippic against the Rothschilds . He had been making inquiries among several business men about Na- than's sons, and naturally did not get a particularly good account of the Rothschilds from their rivals . He now hastened to transmit these reports to Vienna . \"The young people's conduct,\" he wrote, \"is such that Nathan's heirs have created an exceedingly unfavorable impression . They are so blatantly purse-proud as to have offended the old business friends of their father by their rudeness, and I have heard many of them express themselves very strongly on this matter . The reputation of these young people in commercial circles here is therefore just now very much to their disadvantage .\" is Von Hummelauer therefore proposed that if it was desired to appoint a Rothschild as consul-general in Lon- don, another consulate should be created at Liverpool, to be independent of London . \"British commercial circles,\" the charge d'affaires stated, \"would regard the London Consulate as a matter of form, and thus the unfavorable impression which would undoubtedly be created through conferring the Consulate on one of the Rothschilds' sons, would be modified .\" This caused the authorities at Vienna to defer the appointment, and the departments consulted as to what should be done . The position was rendered more diffi- cult by the fact that Metternich had often encouraged Solomon Rothschild to believe that Lionel would be appointed . When time passed and nothing was done, Wertheimstein wrote to Metternich on Solomon's behalf, reminding him of his promise, and suggesting that all that was necessary was to appoint a consular official to assist the consul . \"Baron Lionel von Rothschild,\" Solomon's secretary"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"16o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild wrote, 14 \"would be delighted to pay such a clerk an annual allowance suitable to the higher cost of living in London, thereby proving the value which he attaches to inheriting the confidence which the Austrian Government showed in his late father, and which was always a source of pride to the Rothschild family .\" The matter was finally dealt with by compromise . Lionel was appointed acting unpaid consul-general, after he had given a verbal assurance to the charge d'affaires in London that he would use his best endeavors to support the consular official, who was appointed simultaneously . For the Rothschilds the important thing was that to the public this solution conveyed the impression that their bank still enjoyed the confidence of Austria . The Rothschilds were just at this time endeavoring to improve the position of Jews in general and therefore of themselves in particular . In 1833 the Jews had, at the suggestion of the House of Rothschild, sent in another petition, asking for the free right of domicile, and to be allowed to engage in the sciences, arts, and trades, as well as to acquire and own real property . 15 As the years passed without anything being done, a petition was sent to Metternich on July 17, 1835, asking him to use his in- fluence in favor of this petition . The Rothschilds felt they must assist in the endeavor to secure this general exten- sion of Jewish rights, as special exceptions to the laws had often been made in their favor . Thus they had re- ceived a special mining concession for the coal mines in Dalmatia and Istria, as well as for the Istrian quick- silver\" mines, although for nearly three hundred years Jews had been excluded from such activities . The authorities continued to delay taking any action to alleviate the lot of the Jews, and Solomon Rothschild accordingly sent Metternich a further emphatic request for assistance . \"Your Highness,\" he wrote from Paris, on January 9, 1837, 18 \"will forgive my taking the liberty of making"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 161 a special appeal to you on a matter which is of the very deepest concern to me . \"This matter, my dear Prince, is one that concerns the destiny of my co-religionists . It concerns the hopes of so many fathers of families and the highest aspirations of thousands of human beings . I would commend it with all my heart, in complete trust and confidence, to the favorable consideration of my most gracious Prince . I cherish no more sacred desire than to see the destiny of my co-religionists improved . \"I shall not weary your Highness with many words, and rely confidently on the gracious assurances that your Highness has so often given, that you wish to be a be- nevolent protector and a kind helper to my co-religion- ists . Knowing your Highness's wise and paternal senti- ments, I hope with full confidence, that all our wishes will be granted by a prince to whom the welfare of all classes of humanity is sacred, and to whom the help- less have never appealed in vain .\" On receipt of this letter, Metternich arranged for a conference of ministers to be summoned to discuss the Jewish problem . The conference registered the follow- ing opinion : \"Under the prevailing conditions of the time, it is undoubtedly in the interests of the Govern- ment that the Jews should be accorded some improvement in their condition, and some extension of their rights . But we feel that it is absolutely essential that due regard should be had for the general circumstances of the pres- ent day, and even for prevailing prejudices, so that the public may not suddenly draw the conclusion that full emancipation of the Jews is contemplated and that the Government intends to put them on an equality with Christians .\" It was accordingly decided that the \"tolera- tion\" tax should be maintained, but that the emperor should have discretion to grant Jews permission to own houses in Vienna, but that this discretion should apply to houses only, and not to any other kind of real property ."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"162 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Thus the Rothschilds, who were still living as tenants in the Hotel zum Romischen Kaiser, were enabled to ac- quire a house of their own . But Solomon also used his influence with the chancel- lor to secure better conditions for the Jews outside the boundaries of Austria, more particularly in Italy, where Metternich was powerful . Modena was a case in point, where the duke had, on March 22, 1831, in consequence of certain disturbances that had occurred, imposed upon the Jews a contribution of 6oo,ooo lire, and restrictions on their liberty . Solomon's manager, Goldschmidt, took advantage of one of the duke's visits to Vienna, to ask him,\"' on behalf of Solomon, to rescind these oppressive and unjust decrees . Even in the year 1833, the Papal States again attempted to apply the idea of completely shutting off the Jews from the Christian inhabitants in cities ; they were again to live within walls separated from other inhabitants . At Solomon's request Metternich intervened in this connection, and it was due to him that this humiliating regulation, as Solomon called it, was not generally applied . \"Thousands whom you have thereby made happier,\" Solomon wrote to Metternich, \"are praying to heaven to bless you for your action .\" In 1838, Solomon again heard from Jewish firms in Ferrara that further measures of oppression had been planned there . \"The lament that has gone up from those who are threatened by such a regulation,\" Solomon wrote to Met- ternich,\"I \"and my natural sympathy for the oppressed, especially when they are my helpless co-religionists, has led me on this occasion again to venture most urgently to appeal to Your Highness's clemency and magnanimity, that you may be graciously pleased, as you were in 1833, to use your powerful influence, through the Austrian Em- bassy at Rome, to induce the Holy Father to countermand the publication of this threatened decree against my un-"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 163 fortunate co-religionists, and induce the Papal Govern- ment to adopt a milder and more tolerant attitude . I hope that I may succeed, with my weak words, in touching the heart of your Highness, which is so sensitive to the wel- fare of humanity .\" Such requests were particularly difficult to refuse, when Solomon had just spent large sums on public and benefi- cent objects, and this was the case now, for in March, 1838, the towns of Ofen and Pesth had been visited by a terrible flood . On that occasion Solomon Rothschild wrote as follows : 19 \"Actuated by human and, I would venture to say, entirely patriotic feelings for Austria, I offer to place the services of my House absolutely at your disposal, in case your Majesty should be pleased to com- mand that somewhat more extensive financial measures should be taken to ameliorate the lot of the victims .\" In his petition to the emperor, 20 Solomon asked him to accept his loyal offer, \"as bearing some slight testimony to the unshakable loyalty and unchangeable devotion which I and all my House feel for the sacred person of your Majesty, and the whole of the Imperial Family .\" Amschel Meyer at Frankfort also arranged a concert to benefit the victims, at Solomon's suggestion, at which solos were sung by Carl Rothschild's brilliant and charm- ing wife, as well as by the Countess Rossi . The position of the Rothschilds in the countries of their adoption was by now such that they were absolutely bound up with each country's weal or woe . Their political influ- ence was even greater in France than in Austria . A result of this was naturally that they made enemies . Among their foes in Paris was that arch-spy Klindworth, who sent Count Apponyi regular reports regarding the situa- tion in Paris, in return for which he received payment . \"A proof,\" this man reported on January zo, 1838, \"of the extent to which the Rothschild influence in this coun- try goes, may be found in the fact that last week, when one of my French friends went to Rothschild's office, he"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"164 . \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild found General Rumigny there, the King's adjutant in matters to do with the Bourse . Rothschild has his own system . Lacking intelligence and understanding of affairs, he uses the compelling power of money . In all the Min- istries and in all the Departments he has his creatures of all ranks to bring him every kind of information .\" Klindworth denied that James had any political judg- ment, and expressed the opinion that he was very friendly to Austria, but very unfriendly to Prussia . In contrast to his position in Paris, he had never been recognized by Berlin society, while some members of his family had actually been insulted there . We know today that these opinions were frequently erroneous, and, like thousands of later reports from the same man, they showed how little credit is to be given to such venal informers . Nevertheless, this man's reports were enthusiastically accepted at the time, and until late in the seventies a high price was paid for them and they were often believed . Klindworth, who was very avaricious, may have been ill disposed to the Rothschilds through having had a re- quest refused, or they may have failed to invite him to their magnificent parties . Invitations to the hotel in the Rue Laffitte were eagerly sought after, where everything was done on a scale of unparalleled magnificence, which was intended to make up for any lack of birth and breed- ing . After the death of Nathan, to whom great display was not congenial, these magnificent parties became usual with the London Rothschilds too . They were given in the beautiful park at Gunnersbury, and over five hundred invitations would be issued . The Duke of Sussex, Prince George of Cambridge, the Duke of Somerset, Welling- ton, foreign princes and diplomats, and the most exclusive members of London society were to be found there .

Nathan had attached no value to externals, and had never during his life used the title conferred on him by the emperor, since it was a foreign one . Lionel on the other hand, immediately took steps to obtain the king's permission to use the title, which permission he received in June, 1838 , Moreover, times had changed, and the advertisement which the House of Rothschild had shunned in the past was now very useful . The banquets had their value from this point of view, and, in addition, illustrations and propaganda articles were brought into play . One of the cleverest ideas was a handkerchief manufactured in enor- mous numbers, with Nathan's portrait printed in colors, and bearing the following inscription in four lan- guages : 22 \"He was distinguished both for his business capacity and enterprise, and also for his generosity and love of humanity .\" On the handkerchief were also set out the loans made by the House of Rothschild to the various states, giving the amount in each case . The hand- kerchiefs were made by a manufacturer in London and sent to the Vienna wholesale merchants, Josef Boschan, who applied to the chancery and to Solomon for permis- sion to sell them in Austria . In the midst of their commercial and social activities, the Rothschilds did not forget to direct their particular attention to the advances in applied science . The exploi- tation of new discoveries before they were generally known gave opportunities for profit quite as important as in the case of loans and of financial transactions ."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"166 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild There was, for instance, a M . Fourneyron, \"discoverer of the turbine, a hydraulic machine,\" who succeeded in getting James interested in his invention . James not only supported the inventor in France, but also gave him a letter of recommendation to his brother Solomon in Vienna, who succeeded in interesting Prince Metternich, James having written to him that the machine in ques- tion could be most usefully employed in foundries and factories of all kinds .\" Nathan's sons in England also observed the develop- . ment of steam traffic with the closest attention . \"The steamship,\" Lionel wrote on May 31, 1838, 24 \"will be of enormous advantage to the commerce between this coun- try and the United States of America . . . . Two attempts have already been made to cross the Atlantic Ocean in steamboats, namely the Sirius and Great Western of London and Bristol . These attempts have proved so suc- cessful that any doubts which may have been entertained as to the possibility of a regular service between here and New York, have been dissipated . The Sirius met bad weather and contrary winds on her voyage, but in spite of this only took nineteen days from Cork to New York . The journey is 3,800 miles and was accomplished at an average speed of 8% miles an hour . The Sirius carries boo tons and her engines have a horse-power of 320 ; 431 tons of coal and 43 barrels of tar were consumed on the journey . The Great Western took fifteen days and five hours from Bristol to New York, covering a distance of 3,220 miles, thus accomplishing the journey at an average speed of about nine miles an hour . The latter vessel car- ries 1,340 tons and her engines develop 450 horse-power ; 450 tons of coal were consumed on the voyage . \"The success of these experiments has led to the idea of establishing a regular steamboat service between Eng- land and America ; and the same Company that sent out the Sirius has fitted out an extraordinarily big ship called the Bfritish Queen with a tonnage of 1,840 and a horse-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 167 power of 5oo, with a view to her making a similar voyage . Quite a new company has also been formed with the ob- ject of building six to eight large steamers for this service . Undoubtedly within a very short time the principal traf- fic between America and England will be carried out entirely by steamers, and sailing boats will certainly be gradually superseded .\" Lionel followed with equal interest the enormous de- velopment of railways, which at the time were already beginning to carry mails, as he reported with enthusiasm . \"Since the Liverpool-Manchester Railway was opened in September, 1830,\" he added in his report, \"up to Decem- ber, 1837, 48,716 journeys have been made, and about three million passengers have been carried, there having been only two fatal accidents . . . . The engineer of the Birmingham Railway is of the opinion that most rail- ways will yield a profit of eight to ten per cent per annum .\" This last consideration was naturally the most im- portant . While the development of steamship traffic in England was making the most prodigious strides, the Lloyd-Tries- tino, the Austrian company, was in great difficulties . The House of Rothschild had invested large sums in this undertaking, and they wanted to minimize their risk . Solomon accordingly endeavored to induce the Austrian government to subsidize the undertaking, and addressed a skilful letter to the head of the treasury on this point . I have, on several previous occasions [Solomon wrote a6 ], ventured to draw your Excellency's atten- tion to this undertaking, which may truly be called a national one .

Any weakness in my presentation of the facts will, however, be more than compensated for by the strength of the actual facts and figures themselves . The present position of the Austrian steamship com- pany is such that there can be no doubt as to its future fate . If the Lloyd is to continue on the path on which it began so auspiciously, it must prove itself of real service to the most varied interests . This will only be possible if this institution is immediately granted the pecuniary, material, and moral support which the high authorities in the State have been earnestly begged to render it . If such assistance should not be forthcoming, or should be granted too late, the failure of the Lloyd will be inevitable, and the public auction of the ships will mark the sad failure of an undertaking which the authorities in the State themselves desired, and which would have certainly been an ornament to the Austrian monarchy, and would have been a source of great benefit to the State itself, and to its commerce and industry . Permit me to take this, opportunity of reminding your Excellency of the fact that before my House be- came associated with the undertaking, the Govern- ment had indicated that they were favorably con- sidering the idea of themselves acquiring an interest in it as shareholders . I may perhaps be allowed to confess to your Highness that it was especially the hope of their so doing which gave my House confi- dence in the venture, and led us to invest such con- siderable capital in it .

At the same time Solomon wrote to Metternich in sim- ilar terms .\" Rothschild proposed to advance the Lloyd 500,ooo : florins, on condition that the State should guar- antee this loan .\" Count Kolowrat opposed this proposal, and made the following comment on the memorandum \"Baron von Rothschild's proposals are most skilfully drafted, and capable of the most varied interpretations ; they are in any case calculated to insure that Baron von Rothschild shall be guaranteed against any possibility of loss, and that this shall be transferred to the State . The burden of raising the capital would fall upon the Treas- ury, as well as the invidious and tiresome task of levying execution if the Company should be forced to go into liquidation, whereas Baron von Rothschild would, nom- inally at any rate, stand before the world as the disinter- ested provider of the capital .\" 28 The problem was finally solved by granting the House of Rothschild a mortgage on the company's ships, put- ting it in a prior position to all other creditors, in return for its granting the loan . The Lloyd survived the crisis, and became a great and prosperous company . While they were acquiring all these interests in trans- port concerns, the Rothschilds did not omit to cultivate their highly profitable loans to governments . And they were more and more acquiring the habit of attaching definite political conditions to such loans . The self-assurance with which the House of Rothschild laid down its conditions, particularly when dealing with the smaller states, was particularly apparent just at this time in the case of Belgium . During the first years of his rule, King Leopold had governed his country with in- telligence and success . He recognized the value of rail- ways, which he decided to develop on a large scale, and also brought the most varied undertakings into existence ."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t t7r Although such undertakings were ultimately profitable, they required the investment of great sums of money at the start, which Belgium had to endeavor to obtain in the Paris market . This was made difficult by the fact that the Belgo- Dutch dispute, arising out of the separation of the two countries, was still not finally settled . The two provinces, Luxemburg and Limburg, which were meant to be par- titioned between the two states, remained, during the whole eight years of the dispute, under Belgian admin= istration . Their delegates came to Brussels, and whereas it had formerly been the King of Holland who opposed the decisions of the Powers, it was now Belgium that re- fused to accept a partition of the two provinces with Holland . Feeling ran so high in Belgium that the ques- tion of war with Holland was again on everybody's lips . At the time, James was staying in Rome, where, in con- nection with a loan granted to the Pope in 1837, he was bringing his influence to bear in favor of his co-religion- ists, while Solomon was representing him in Paris . Now the Belgian government approached the Paris House of Rothschild with a request for an advance of four million francs on the security of treasury bills . The money seemed to be intended for use in Belgium's military adventure . The House of Rothschild remained true to the policy which it had now followed over a long period of years ; there were a thousand reasons why it had no use for war . It perceived that, as on the occasion of the sepa- ration of Belgium from Holland, the danger of a world conflagration might arise, and for this reason Solomon replied to Belgium with a categorical refusal . \"This dis- appointment,\" Count Apponyi reported, 29 \"has greatly embarrassed the Belgian Government by depriving it of the financial resources which are essential if it wishes to pursue its provocative policy .\" The representative of the House of Rothschild in Brus- sels informed Solomon that the Belgian government was"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"172 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild annoyed . \"We do not in the least resent the fact,\" 30 Solo- mon replied, \"that the Government is somewhat angry at our refusal with regard to the Treasury notes .

We have cer- tainly given sufficient proof of our intention to support and help the Belgian Government, but our good-will nec- essarily stops short of the point of providing the rod with which we are to be beaten, that is to say, providing the money wanted to make a war, which would destroy the credit that we are applying all our energies and resources to maintain . You may tell these gentlemen what I have written freely and frankly and without mincing words .\" Solomon simultaneously sent a copy of the above ex- tract from his letter to Count Apponyi, so that Metter- nich should see how he had acted ; for Metternich had always had a prejudice against Belgium, and Solomon wished him to see how strongly he was supporting his policy on this occasion . Apponyi speedily reported the whole affair to Metternich, enclosing the extract and adding that the House of Rothschild had thereby ren- dered a new and remarkable service to the cause of peace and order, a service which he was pleased to recognize and appreciate at its true value .\" Meanwhile the Rothschilds' agent, who was called Richtenberger, was going from one minister to another . He went first to the finance minister, Count de Merode, who belonged to the war party . He did not conceal from the agent that the state was most urgently in need of money, but he made it apparent that he too did not approve of the partition of the provinces . Richtenberger next went to see Count de Theux, minister for foreign affairs, who favored the peace party, and told him of his conversation with the finance minister . Thereupon de Theux quite definitely asked him not to give the finance minister any money, and just to leave him in his"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 173 difficulties, whereat his warlike ardor, and that of the opposition party, would speedily abate . Toward the close of the conversation de Theux added that the agent should ask his House for advance authority immediately to pro- vide cash if the Chamber should come to terms, and ac- cept the twenty-four articles of the Conference of Lon- don, and thereby agree to the partition of the provinces . He said that he hoped to be able to induce the Chamber to do this . The agent was told by a friend of his who knew the position that the Belgian treasury was in point of fact at a very low ebb indeed, there being only about 4oo,ooo francs available . 32 Solomon immediately sent a copy of the letter contain- ing this information to his House at Vienna .\" \"I send you herewith,\" he wrote, \"for Prince Metter- nich's information, the exact letter which I have received from my agent in Brussels ; it will show the Prince just what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Count Merode think . They won't get a farthing from me until they give way, and before I go away I shall leave similar instruc- tions for my brother James .\" Solomon wrote to his secretary and manager to the same effect : \"I hope that Belgium will now sign the twenty-four articles, especially as they lack the nervus rerum and as long as the articles are not accepted, the Belgian Government will not get a halfpenny from us, although they have been begging for money for months . Difficult though I found it to keep on refusing, I shall feel compensated if Belgium yields and peace is restored, by the reflection that I shall have done my best to con- tribute to such a result .\" Even the King of Holland realized that the lengthy dispute should be ended . He gave London to understand that he was prepared to accept the twenty-four articles . This time Palmerston's government in England, and even King Leopold's father-in-law in Paris, were determined"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"174 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild to end the business and no longer to encourage Belgium in her resistance . The western and eastern Powers were therefore in agreement, so that the Belgian Chamber, after having delivered itself of passionate speeches, had no option but to agree to the treaties with Holland that had been settled in London . This constituted a complete victory for the Rothschild policy ; peace had been main- tained and the way was now clear for safe financial trans- actions with Belgium . King Leopold at once approached the Rothschilds for the considerable loan of 37,000,00 francs, for the purpose of railway construction on a large scale . This loan was granted by the House of Rothschild but, as Rothschild told Count Apponyi, subject to three remarkable condi- tions :\" in the event of the outbreak of war all further payments by the House of Rothschild should cease ; the Belgian government would undertake to suppress pos- sible revolutionary movement in Luxemburg ; and the 37,000,000 advanced should actually be spent on railway construction . The House of Rothschild intended thereby to insure against a revival of those ambitions which had just been renounced . Metternich was kept fully informed of all these Bel- gian matters, not only by the ambassador and the minister concerned, but also by Amschel Meyer at Frankfort, who sent the chancellor a copy of any news he received at Frankfort . Metternich had asked him also to send copies to von Rechberg, the former charge d'affaires, who had been temporarily recalled from Brussels, so that the latter might compare them with his own sources of informa- tion, and thus arrive at as accurate a picture as possible of the position in Belgium . After the satisfactory conclusion of the Belgian diffi- culties, the four brothers on the Continent, and Nathan's eldest son, met at Frankfort to discuss the general situa- tion, take stock of their present business transactions, and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones 175 consider their action with regard to the future . This was in September, 1839, just when Metternich and his wife, the Princess Melanie, were staying at Schloss Johannis- berg, whence they paid a visit to Frankfort . The three brothers, \"our Solomon,\" as Princess Melanie called him, Anselm, and James immediately called on them . The manager, Goldschmidt, accompanied the princess, and helped her with her shopping . Two of the Rothschilds, Solomon and Carl, also accompanied her, the latter hav- ing just arrived from Naples .\" Metternich invited Solomon and his wife to Johannis- berg, and they promptly accepted the invitation . All kinds of business were discussed during the visit, con- cessions were asked for, and the question of intervention was sounded . Metternich promised, among other things, to use his influence to secure rights of citizenship in Frankfort for Solomon's manager, Moritz Goldschmidt . On his return, Solomon wrote to thank the prince, ex- pressing his delight . with their \"most gracious reception at lovely Johannisberg .\" 36 Meanwhile the world situation had not become any rosier . No sooner had danger of war been banished in the West than ominous signs of trouble began to appear in the East . Mehemet Ali, the sultan's viceroy in Egypt, had usurped enormous power at the expense of his sovereign . While still formally subject to the sultan, he paid little attention in practice to his authority . Being at enmity with the Pasha of Acre, he invaded Syria, which had been allotted to his sphere of influence in May, 1 833 , Mehemet Ali next turned his attention to Arabia, but this did not please England at all . Russia and Austria, in their endeavors to protect the legitimist principle, had espoused the cause of the sultan as against his insurbordi- nate viceroy ; their sympathies were therefore on the same side as those of England . Encouraged by this fact, the Sultan Mahmud endeav- ored, in 1839, to suppress the insubordinate Mehemet Ali ."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"176 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild But the sultan's troops were beaten by the Egyptian, France alone among the Powers viewing this victory with satisfaction ; for Mehemet Ali was friendly to the French, and as France was in possession of Algiers it was to her interest to be on good terms with the powerful Pasha of Egypt . The other Powers, however, England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, wished to help the sultan in his difficulties, and signed a . treaty on July i5, i8go-the Quadruple Alliance-providing that the sultan should be assisted if necessary, but that Mehemet Ali should be allowed to keep Egypt and southern Syria only, as a hereditary kingdom under the overlordship of the sultan . That being the position, the alliance necessarily ap- peared in Paris to be directed against France, who found herself isolated from the whole of the rest of Europe . The Chambers, the press, society, and the Palace all felt keen indignation at this slight to France, and felt that her honor was at stake . Thiers, the prime minister, breathed forth fire and slaughter in his newspapers against Pal- merston, the British secretary of state for foreign affairs, and against the treaty in general . Thiers's attitude was particularly aggressive, but even Louis Philippe, who in his heart wished to maintain good relations with the Powers, was profoundly displeased with the treaty, al- though at the same time he stated that he would do every- thing possible to maintain peace . In any case, intensive military preparations were decided upon . Apponyi wrote in alarm 11 that the treaty had been taken very seriously in Paris, and that it was regarded as a matter affecting the national honor . He said that the king was sincerely anxious to maintain peace, but that the heir to the throne, the Duke of Orleans, was enormously excited, and in favor of war, and that he would support Thiers . \"The position is exceedingly serious,\" the ambas- sador reported . \"If people will play with fire, as it seems they mean to do here, a general world conflagration may easily result .\""},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Louis Adolphe Thiers"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 177 The King of Belgium was also deeply concerned at the state of affairs . He already had visions of his country, which was achieving prosperity after much hard work, becoming a theater of war over which French and Prus- sian armies would fight .\" \"He is the more alarmed,\" Apponyi ironically re- ported, \"since Baron Anselm Rothschild has informed him that the new loan which was just ready for signature, cannot be carried into effect . His Majesty intends to travel to England on the day after tomorrow, where his pres- ence, as he said to Herr von Rothschild, will be of great service at the present time .\" It was therefore to be expected that in this quarter everything would be done to insure the maintenance of peace ; and this was what Anselm had wished to convey . Anselm also wrote to his father, Solomon, who was stay- ing at Frankfort, saying, \"It is hoped that Prince Metter- nich will modify the agreement of the rsth July in such a way as to save the face of France .\" 89 At that time James, who was still away, was being rep- resented in Paris by Anselm, and Solomon feared that his young son might not be equal to a situation which was constantly growing more acute and critical . He there- fore urgently asked James to return, and decided to go to Paris himself and wait there until James came back . Meanwhile James had set out for Paris post-haste, and arrived in the French capital on August 3, 18go . This made it unnecessary for Solomon to make the journey, as James had at once sent him the following letter : 40 MY DEAR BROTHER I arrived safe and well this morning, after spend- ing some nights traveling, because I did not want to leave Anselm alone .

This communication revealed the calm business sense and strong character of James, who was not to be affected by any panic . Anselm was also much relieved that he had no longer to bear the whole responsibility alone . \"Uncle James,\" he wrote home, 41 \"arrived back here safely this morning, the fall in securities having hastened his return .

Belgian securities were unsalable . There is little news, but people are less alarmed and believe that peace will be maintained . . . . Everything depends on Prince Metternich remaining calm .\" The London Rothschilds were also on their guard . They reported that prices there were fairly firm, but that little business was being done, as everybody was anx- iously awaiting news . London was talking of a resolution to be moved in the House of Commons, that the navy and army should be strengthened . Lionel had immediately gone to Lord Clarendon, lord privy seal, who told him that he did not believe it, as England saw no reason why there should be war . 42 When James's reassuring news reached London his nephews realized with satisfaction that the \"wave of war fever in Paris\" had somewhat abated, \"The British pub-"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 779 lic,\" they reported,\" \"has no fear at all of a war, as is very clearly shown by the heavy purchases of securities that are being made by private persons .\" The atmosphere in Paris, however, was far from being as peaceful and quiet as might have been expected in view of this news . When news was received on August 5 that Prussia and Austria had just ratified the hateful treaty on July i 5, national sentiment was again aroused . \"Our poor rentes,\" Anselm reported, \"have again shown a marked decline today ; there is panic on the Bourse, news having been received that Prussia's and Austria's ratifications of the treaty have been sent in . I believe, however, that it will all come right, for I can assure you that the Government here is no longer so aggressive, and has decided for the present to cease military prepara- tions . Reports from London are also much more pacific . Uncle James is going to see the King this evening .\" 44 The king did in fact receive James on the evening of August 5 in an audience which lasted more than two hours . He complained bitterly of the Powers, saying that not only he, but his son, the Duke of Orleans, had been much irritated . Austria should not join with Russia . Why should everything be done to irritate France? He still hoped that, in the end, 46 \"Austria will deal with this complication as the deus ex machina and, through the wisdom and influence of Prince von Metternich, not merely will peace be maintained but France will be placed in a position in which she can come out of the affair with honor .\" \"Whatever may now happen,\" James concluded his report on the audience, \"I do not believe there will be war .\" 46 This strained situation was still further complicated by a perfectly unexpected event . Louis Napoleon, the eternal pretender to the throne of France, had embarked, with fifty-five followers, in a boat from England, and had landed on the- night of August 6 in the neighborhood of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"i8o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Boulogne, where a few of his supporters were awaiting him . He had, no doubt, imagined that as, when his great- uncle returned to France from Elba, so the king's troops would go over to his side now, and bring him in triumph to the capital . However nothing of the kind occurred . The king's troops marched against him ; the occasional cries of \"Vive 1'Empereur\" were soon heard no more ; the prince and his trusty followers were forced to take to the sea, where, after a short swim, they were all cap- tured . The tragi-comic adventure was over in a few hours, but it served to increase the general nervous tension in France . Nathan's sons in London strongly condemned this at- tempt . \"The affair of Louis Bonaparte's landing,\" they wrote, \"is regarded here with general disgust, as being a senseless and rather distasteful adventure . It is said to have been a Stock Exchange plot, and that there were brokers on board the steamer .\" 47 The London Rothschilds had received the latest news from Paris before this event, and they reported that the stock exchange atmosphere was quite uncanny, since those who had a carrier pigeon service, and thereby received early news of Paris quotations, had spread all sorts of bad rumors . They said Palmerston had just delivered a moderate speech on the foreign situation, and Lionel observed that Lord Palmerston's quiet and emphatic speech had dissipated any idea of war in London, and that he hoped it would show the French public the game that MM . Thiers and Guizot had been playing . Every word that any of the Rothschilds wrote revealed how anxiously and constantly they were endeavoring to do everything possible to maintain peace, as they were always fearful about their great undertaking and finan- cial commitments .

The queen's speech, as James reported, caused great dis- satisfaction in Paris, as it made no reference to France . \"Everyone here,\" he wrote, \"is very indignant, and in a most belligerent mood, so that rentes have fallen to 80 .20 . . . . This has frightened people, and we must hope that tomorrow they will be in a quieter frame of mind .\" 4' James did not fail to frequent the salons and audience chambers of influential and high personages . Having heard that the Duke of Orleans was so strongly in favor of war, he obtained an audience of him, with a view to bringing him to his own political point of view . The duke actually said to him : 60 \"We do not want a war, but if others aim at undermining the King's honor and popu- larity, and weakening him at home, then-\" James saw to it that Metternich heard all this at once, and, knowing that his letters to Solomon would be shown to Metternich, he was careful to phrase them in such a way that the chancellor would be influenced to adopt the Rothschild point of view . The duke also told James that new proposals for the solution of the eastern crisis had been sent to England, the King of Belgium acting as mediator . Both James and Nathaniel (Nathan's third son, who was still in Paris) in their letters to Solomon had of late been constantly lamenting the fact that Prince Esterhazy was not in London, since his representative, the charge d'affaires von Neumann, was a regular war- monger .\""},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"182 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Nathaniel actually wrote to his uncle saying : 52 \"I hear that Baron Neumann is in a great state of excitement, and preaching war .\" Solomon saw to it that such statements were not omitted from the copies of letters that he laid before Metternich . The guiding principle of the Rothschilds at critical times such as these was to go about as much as possible in society, and to seek out every opportunity of meeting leading statesmen, royalties, and influential society women, never missing a chance of collecting news . This is characteristically shown in a letter from Lionel to his uncle James and his brother Nathaniel . \"We had the pleasure yesterday,\" he wrote on August 22, I84o, 53 of getting your mail, and we are very grateful to you for it since, as I can assure you, we were distinctly uneasy . Consols opened at 89Y8 ; it is said that the owners of car- rier pigeons were buying ; they closed at 89/ . \"We saw all our friends, to get news, and heard that everybody was particularly pleased with King Leopold, who had contributed a great deal to reconciling England and France . We then spoke to another person of impor- tance, and she told us that everything was completely changed, including France's tone, which was quite dif- ferent from what it had been . . . . Everyone is of opin- ion that Mehemet Ali, if he does not completely give way, will at any rate make fresh proposals .

On the one hand it was obvious to him that he could not fight for Mehemet Ali against the whole of Europe . Such action would have been fraught with disaster for himself and his dynasty . On the other hand he did not wish to offend his proud and sen- sitive people, or to make himself unpopular by a public humiliation . On one occasion he gave free rein to his feelings, to the Austrian ambassador, fulminating against the Powers, who had placed him in such an awkward position . Count Apponyi was quite affected by the rage with which the king spoke . He reported that he never had seen him so violent or resentful, and that he was par- ticularly incensed against the tsar . \"The Tsar Nicholas,\" the king had exclaimed, \"has always aimed at destroying the Franco-British Alliance, and at last he has succeeded in doing so . All the rest of you crawl and shiver before him . . . I am, I must ad- mit, deeply hurt . To be left out in the cold, to be treated as a pariah and a revolutionary King, as you all treat me -can I be expected to bear that? Do you think that I have no blood in my veins? You have upset the whole of Europe, and spoilt the whole position, which I have finally managed to achieve after ten years of extraordi- nary effort .\" The king went on to say that to have isolated France through the new Quadruple Alliance was an act of un- paralleled frivolity, from the point of view of maintain- ing peace . He then endeavored to persuade Apponyi to urge his prince to get rid of the unfortunate treaty of July is . When the ambassador declared that he could not possibly take action, the king, having calmed down somewhat, assured him that he would do everything to maintain peace as long as peace was consonant with the dignity of France . The monarch pointed out, however, that circumstances might occur in which he would be forced, even against his will, to go to war ."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"184 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild This display of feeling by the king was no doubt not entirely unpremeditated, as he hoped there might be a chance of breaking up the Quadruple Alliance . At the same time he exploited the prevailing militaristic spirit materially to strengthen his neglected army, which it may well have seemed highly desirable for him to do, quite apart from the danger of war . Fundamentally, however, he was really anxious to maintain peace, and in this de- sire he was entirely at one with James Rothschild . During this critical period, the monarch relied a great deal on the wise old financier . He looked to James for sound ad- vice, and relied on him as an intermediary and a person who could skilfully bring the right influences into play ; and as their aims were identical, the monarch and the Jewish banker were often in one another's company . Their conversations were immediately reported to the brothers in the other capitals, who would do their best to turn them to good account, both politically and financially . \"Yesterday evening,\" Nathaniel reported from Paris on September 6, 18go, 64 \"Uncle James was with the King, who as usual was exceedingly cordial to him, and said that he felt so friendly towards him that he would warn him to be on his guard, as Ibrahim Pasha would very probably march across the Taurus, which would produce such complications that it would be impossible to say how the matter would end . It seems, my dear Uncle, that matters are now coming to a head, and although it is certain that there won't be a war we shall, as an im- portant person in the British Embassy here said, get so near to war that the world will be terrified and securities will of course fall . Rentes close dull, at 79 .10, there being very little business .\" The next day the outlook was still worse . \"Rentes have fallen to 76 .20,\" Nathaniel wrote that day, 55 \"there hav- ing been an emeute here in Paris in the Faubourg Saint- Antoine, where there are a mass of working people and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 185 ten times as many troops . There will probably be a little fighting, but it is generally believed that the affair will soon be over. The emeute is unfortunately not the prin- cipal cause of the fall in rentes, the political news being very bad . Fighting has begun in the East . . . . A well informed friend has just been to see me, and he said that they had had a ma-il from Vienna yesterday, from which it is clear that there is considerable indignation against the French there . . . Thiers is also supposed to be much excited, and God knows how it will all end . The news from Spain also seems to be unsatisfactory .\" The Powers had indeed begun to take military action in the East against Mehemet Ali . A joint Anglo-Turkish- Austrian squadron had been ordered to the coast of Syria . This caused great excitement in Paris . \"The prospects on the Bourse here,\" James reported on September 9, 66 \"are not at all good . All securities have fallen very heavily, and rentes closed at 73 .60, the 5 per cents at io5 .6o . . . We naturally don't believe everything we hear, but there is considerable panic, for it is a fact that Admiral Napier has taken several Egyptian ships with troops and muni- tions on board . I have seen Thiers, who in spite of all this speaks in a pacific tone, and both he and the King hope that Mehemet Ali will have recourse to the French as mediators to settle this question .\" It seemed to be a favorable moment for carrying out a plan which had long been cherished ; namely, to fortify Paris . This was interpreted as indicating warlike inten- tions, but the Rothschilds immediately learned that such a belief was unfounded . \"My dear brothers,\" James wrote with his usual quiet confidence, with reference to the government's decision, \"rentes fell when the Bourse opened, because it became known that the newspapers will tomorrow publish the fact that Paris is to be fortified .

The former has had a most friendly conver- sation with Count Apponyi, in which he told him that he should not be misled by this measure, as they would have had to carry it out in any case . \"Princess Lieven has had letters from England today that strike the same friendly note, and all the Ministers that I meet here are of the same mind . The fall in rentes has been caused by some wretched journalists who spec- ulate on the Bourse, and the public believe they are in the know .\" 67 The London Rothschilds kept besieging the French Ambassador Guizot and all the other representatives of foreign Powers, in order to get news ; at parties they always tried to get into conversation with a cabinet min- ister . One of them succeeded in discovering a friend who had just spoken to an important personage who had re- turned from Syria, having been sent there by Palmerston . They heard from a reliable source that the prime min- ister, Lord Melbourne, and Palmerston had had a quarrel, and that relations between them were strained . They also ascertained that everybody in London com- plained of the way Louis Philippe talked about English ministers, as he was alleged to have stated on several occasions that Lord Palmerston had received a large sum of money from Russia . Meanwhile the Syrian campaign proceeded . The posi- tion of Mehemet's stepson Ibrahim became more and more dangerous . The city and fortress of Beirut, which were still held by the Egyptian, were bombarded by the Allied Powers . Nerves in Paris became more and more strained .

Nathaniel, who was by now also alarmed and angry with Thiers, wrote on September 22, 1840, 69 saying \"The position is still confused and uncertain . God knows how these important questions will be solved, and how M . Thiers will get us out of the awkward situation into which his irresponsibility and his nationalistic peas- ant obstinacy have brought us . Our position is made worse by the fact that Thiers's political standing rests upon such a complicated • structure, built up of so many various elements, that it is almost impossible, and would indeed be dangerous and altogether unwise, to overthrow him ; so that we must look on quietly while this most arrogant of all parvenus gets this country more and more involved in difficulties, and us all with him through his irresponsi- bility and depraved liberalism . We must hope that things will happen otherwise and that we may look forward to a happier future .\" The position grew more and more complicated and even James, who was generally so wise and calm, did not know what to make of things . \"My dear brothers,\" he wrote on September 25, 69 \"I really don't know what to write without misleading you . I was with the King yes- terday evening and spoke to him for over two hours, and you cannot imagine how excited the good man was .

He told me definitely that a conference of all Ministers would be held in London on Monday, to consider whether th ;, proposals should be accepted . He said that Palmerston was absolutely opposed to accepting them, but that we should come as near to war as possible . I am writing you all this in detail, my dear brothers, that you may be in a position to judge the situation . The King was very angry, too, about a note from England asking why he was having a chapel built at Tunis . \"Rentes closed at 73 .60 .\" News came from Syria that Said had been taken by storm by the Austrians and British on September 26 . This naturally increased the indignation against England in Paris, as far as it was possible . James became more and more uneasy, and already believed that in the end war would be inevitable . He wrote emphatically to his brother Solomon to say that he should urge Metternich again to induce Austria to be more moderate, and to use his influ- ence with England in the same direction . \"Do tell the Prince, my dear brother,\" he wrote to him on October 5, 80 \"not to let Palmerston's hot temper run away with the situation .

Thiers added fuel to the flames, and advised the king to further military measures, to a demonstration at sea, and to other actions, most dangerous in their conse- quences . The heir to the throne, who was filled with mar- tial ardor, urged his father in the same direction . Thiers had for some time noted with displeasure the influence which the House of Rothschild exercised upon the king . It was difficult for him actively to oppose the bank be- cause he had debts, and according to Count Apponyi, he owed the House of Rothschild, too, at least 4o,ooo francs ; but the interference of the Rothschilds had now gone further than he could stand . This German Jew from Frankfort had the effrontery to bamboozle the king into the belief that the honor of France was really not involved in the distant affair of Mehemet Ali . Thiers expressed his irritation at this state of affairs . Immediately the rumor went round Paris that Baron Rothschild and other rich bankers had threatened the ministry with formidable opposition, if it pronounced in favor of war . The Times commented on this in a Paris letter . The matter was quite simple, it said . Rothschild was a financier, and therefore did not want war ; so far, so good : but Baron Rothschild was an Austrian subject, and Austria's consul-general in Paris, and a question affecting France's honor was therefore of precious little concern to him . The Constitutionnel, Thiers's paper, com- mented on this letter on October 1 2 ) 1840, 81 observing that the position was perfectly intelligible, but asking what Herr von Rothschild, the financier, and Herr von Roths- child, Metternich's agent, had to do with the French Chamber and its majority . \"With what right,\" the paper asked, \"and under what pretext does this king of finance intermeddle with our affairs? What concern of his are the decisions which France will take? Is he the arbiter of our honor? Are his money interests to be allowed to outweigh our national interests ?\""},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Igo \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The Constitutionnel emphasized the fact that it was publishing these rumors in order that, if they were true, the public might frustrate the intrigues . If they were false, Rothschild would have the opportunity of publicly denying them and of letting the country know that it was not his intention to dispose of majorities and ministries . James replied on October 12, 1840 : \"Sir, In spite of my reluctance to bring my name before the public, I can- not leave unanswered the article in your current number, wherein my name figures in a most unfavorable light . The nature of these attacks imposes a duty on me to break that silence which I am generally content to observe . How, Sir, should I proceed to refute such aspersions? I can but wonder that men who have serious matters to attend to will lend their ears to such assertions . I have never at any time encouraged opposition to the Govern- ment for the simple reason that I have never wished to play a political role . I am, as you state, a financier . If I desire peace, I desire it honorably, not only for France but for the whole of Europe, and in all circumstances . Financiers have the opportunity of rendering services to the country, and I think I may say that in this respect I have never been behindhand . If France is not my native country, it is the country of my children . I have lived in France for thirty years ; my family, my friends, and all my interests are in that country .\" The Constitutionnel published this reply, and that ended the incident . Thiers, however, felt that, without having come forward himself, he had given an adequate warning to Rothschild not to work up an opposition to the policy of the ministry . Nevertheless, events were to shew that it was Roths- child's, and not Thiers's point of view that had come to be firmly adopted by the king . In his heart the king heartily disliked Thiers as a revolutionary . Louis Phil- ippe withstood the warlike proposals of his son and his minister . He also declared himself opposed to any naval"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 191 demonstration . The warlike minister and the peaceful king finally agreed upon a kind of ultimatum to the Powers, which was, however, essentially accommodating, as it gave up all claims to Syria, and asked only that the deposition of Mehemet Ali should be revoked . England, too, did not wish to accentuate the crisis, and replied in a more conciliatory spirit . The popular feel- ing which had been aroused by Thiers was, however, not to be so quickly pacified, even if the minister had wished to do so . An unsuccessful attempt on the king's life sud- denly brought home to him the dangers near at hand, which would necessarily be much accentuated by exten- sive complications abroad . Its effect upon the king was to attach him definitely to the Conservative party, which favored peace . This party had lately increased in num- bers, especially among the property-owning classes, who feared for their lives and their possessions . The Journal des Debats, which was friendly to the Rothschilds, be- came more emphatic in its warnings . But it was not so easy for Thiers to reverse his policy . The speech from the throne provided the occasion for clearing up the sit- uation between the king and his ministers . Thiers pro- posed that in his speech he should condemn the Treaty of London, and discuss the disposition of Mehemet Ali, and the calling up in advance of the 1841 recruits . Louis Philippe refused to make any references of this kind . \"I want peace,\" he exclaimed, 12 \"and not war . I want to promote tranquillity and not to provoke and excite the whole of Europe . My military measures are precaution- ary and not aggressive .\" \"In that case,\" Thiers replied, \"we cannot possibly agree, and there is nothing for me to do but to resign .\" \"Very well,\" replied the monarch, \"I shall accept your resignation .\" Thiers acted in accordance with this hint, and the king dismissed the ministry .

Thiers ; it was a relief to me that he himself gave me the opportunity of doing so . He was the only or, at any rate, the principal obstacle in the way of the mainte- nance of peace .\" Paris and the whole world regarded as a most fortunate solution this change, and the appointment of the new ministry, which was nominally presided over by Marshal Soult, but in practice by the former ambassador in Lon- don, Guizot, who became minister for foreign affairs . In high enthusiasm the Rothschilds reported from Paris sa that as a result of the appointment of the new ministry, and particularly of the confidence inspired on the Bourse by the new finance minister, M . Humann, rentes had appreciated considerably . It was high time for a change of policy, for Mehemet Ali's stepson had just lost the powerful Syrian fortress Acre to the Allies, being forced to retire on Suez, after losing all his artil- lery . The English admiral appeared with his fleet before Mehemet's residence at Alexandria . The admiral and the Egyptian viceroy soon came to an understanding . The whole of Syria was to be evacuated, but Mehemet Ali's position in Egypt was to be confirmed . Solomon, who received the news at Frankfort, reported these satisfactory events with great enthusiasm, as indi- cating that the questions in dispute in the East might be considered as settled . It says much for Solomon's far- seeing judgment that he immediately directed his efforts to making the path for France, which had, after all, al- ready reversed her policy, as easy and honorable as pos- sible . It was still being stated that France was arming, and wanted to increase her military forces to five hundred thousand men . \"Although I do not believe,\" Solomon wrote to Vienna on December io, 184o, 84 \"that France wishes to bring war about through an emphatic demonstration of this"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Shaking Thrones \t 193 kind, war being entirely opposed to her interests, yet in my humble opinion, I consider it to be highly desirable, by satisfying French national vanity, to find some way of persuading her Cabinet to cease all further military prep- arations and thus to bring the tension and differences with foreign governments to a speedy conclusion . Would not such a solution be found by inviting France to attend the Conference in order to settle the Eastern problem jointly with the other Powers? . . . If France is an integral part of the Conference-and it seems to me that those in power in that country are merely concerned to convince the noisy element that she has again been received with honor into the European comity of nations-all reasons for fur- ther military preparations automatically cease, and gen- eral peace will be more lastingly and firmly established .\" \"Have the goodness,\" Solomon bade Wertheimstein and Goldschmidt in Vienna, \"to give his Highness the Prince a hint to this effect, when an opportunity occurs ; if he approves my suggestion, and is inclined to act on it, I have no doubt that it will produce satisfactory results .\" The advice was most timely, for Prince Metternich had just suggested that France should be asked, through diplomatic channels, to reduce her considerable arma- ments . James proceeded to advance arguments against so doing . He wrote a letter which, as usual, was meant for Metternich's perusal, in which he endeavored cleverly to persuade him out of his intention to demand a reduction in French armaments . \"My dear brothers,\" he wrote, 8 \" \" don't think there is any question of a war . The Prince is too clever not to understand the position here .

I am convinced that they will demobilize a hundred thousand infantry, but this must not appear to have been forced upon them, for after all that has happened in the Chamber the Ministry is as unable as the King to send the army away at once, as unable as they would have been to take part in coercive measures against the Pasha of Egypt . \"Be easy, therefore, as to the position here, and assure the Prince that I see too many people here to have occa- sion to fear that anything should occur which I could not and would not tell him of, as it is my duty to do .\" As James and his brothers had hoped, no further com- plications arose in the Eastern problem . The sultan and Mehemet Ali were reconciled ; the Powers of the Quad- ruple Alliance declared that the treaty of July 15 had expired, having achieved the object for which it was formed . And they made the way as smooth as possible for France to take her place again among them . The previous ten years had seen three highly critical problems arise, each of which brought Europe to the verge of a devastating war .

This was especially so in Paris, whither the most remarkable spirits of the time were at- tracted from abroad by the relative freedom of the press from censorship . The great Italian, Rossini, had given up his home in Italy and then left Vienna for the city on the Seine . He had made the acquaintance of the Rothschilds as early as the Congress of Verona, and he was a frequent visitor at James's house, being invited to the intimate family circle as well as to the banker's splendid receptions . If an artist, in addition to being famous, was also of Jewish origin, he was particularly welcome at the House of Rothschild in Paris . Meyerbeer was among those who were actively assisted and cordially welcomed . After the July revolution and the severe measures which Metternich thereupon applied in Germany and Prussia against all \"liberal\" tendencies, a number of refugees from political oppression and the censorship came to Paris ; among them was Heinrich Heine, whose great am- bition at the time was to become a protagonist of popu- lar rights, and to rise against the \"censors of thought and the oppressors of the most sacred rights of human- ity .\" 1 He felt himself to be a son of the Revolution, broke all links with Germany, and took up his permanent resi- dence in Paris, on the 1st May, 1831 . Ludwig Borne, who 195"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"zq6 \t The Reign o f the House o f Rothschild was a relation of Heine and held similar views, but who later became bitterly hostile to him, left Germany for Paris at the same time . Heine soon succeeded in arousing great interest in Paris, a portion of his \"Harzreise\" appearing in the Revue des deux Mondes, and two other books of his being published in French translations . His fame grew until he was treated on equal terms as a poet of the first rank, by the most famous of the great men in Paris . As a character he was less admired, owing to his eccentric, paradoxical, and unbalanced nature . The diplomats in Metternich's service, who were constantly engaged in smelling out revolutionaries, regarded him as a complete outcast . A report 2 written from this prejudiced point of view, called Heine, on account of his unreliability, \"a moral and political chameleon,\" saying that he had no opinions of his own, and might affect constitutional opinions to- day, \"whereas tomorrow he will, with equal skill, plead the cause of absolutism or of radicalism .\" \"He is of a cowardly nature,\" this bitter report continued, \"a liar and a man who would be disloyal to his best friend . Change- able as a cocotte, he is utterly unstedfast ; spiteful as a serpent, he has all the beauty and glitter of that crea- ture, and all its poison ; without any really noble or genu- ine instincts, he is incapable of a sincere emotion . His vanity is such that he would like to play a conspicuous role, but he has played out his part, he is no longer taken seriously, although his talents remain .\" It was only natural that Heine should soon make the acquaintance of James Rothschild, especially as Heine's father had known the Rothschilds well, having been con- stantly associated with the House in financial matters . It was therefore easy for Heine to establish relations with the House, whereas Borne remained aloof, having always been in opposition to the Rothschilds . In his sev- enty-second letter, sent from Paris on January 22, 1832,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 . '97 he had expressed himself in no measured terms about the banking firm . In that letter Borne made play with the relations be- tween Rothschild and the Pope, saying that Louis Phi- lippe would be crowned in Paris, in Notre Dame de la Bourse, with Rothschild functioning as archbishop . He imagined a turtle-dove flying to St . Helena, perching on Napoleon's grave, and laughingly narrating that it had yesterday seen his successor crowned, not by the Pope, but by a Jew . With biting irony Borne suggested that it might be to the greatest benefit of the world if the kings were got rid of and the Rothschild family were set upon the throne . Such a dynasty would never have recourse to a loan, for they would have the best reason to know how dearly such loans would have to be paid . Moreover, peace would be assured, since the Rothschilds would be on the most excellent terms with the House of Hapsburg . Borne next proceeded to show how dearly Austria had had to pay for their friendship . True, no Rothschild yet occupied a throne, but when a throne became vacant they were asked to advise as to who should occupy it . It was more bitter that all the crowns should be at the feet of the Rothschilds than that they should be wearing them on their heads, for in the latter case they would at any rate have to shoul- der the responsibility of kingship . The majority of the European peoples, Borne suggested, would long ago have attained their freedom, had not the Rothschilds and other financiers applied their wealth to the support of abso- lutism . Bitterly Borne described the operations of the Rothschilds, showing how they would depress rentes just before underwriting a loan, and then artificially raise the price, immediately after the agreement for a new loan was signed . Such was the \"game\" that the Rothschilds always played, to enrich themselves at the expense of the country that they exploited .'"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"198 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild In such circumstances there was naturally no room for Borne in James's house . Heine too occasionally turned his biting satire on the House of Rothschild . But he would also often write favorably about them, although not with- out having occasion to be grateful to James for services of a financial nature . The \"great baron\" not only fre- quently invited him to a family meal in the private rooms of his office, but also, as Heine himself tells us, invited him to take part in \"almost all of his more important transactions, often quite spontaneously .' Nevertheless, Heine was invariably short of money, which always melted through his fingers, and against Rothschild's advice, he embarked on other speculations which involved him in serious loss . He did not receive regular remittances from Rothschild, but would often give him to understand that he was in need of this or that, whereupon James, who admired his genius and feared his pen, would send him something under the ingenious pretext that he had made a profit in a share transaction ; sometimes he would deliberately ignore the disguised re- quest, and this would produce ill feeling . When the money was not forthcoming, Heine would ponder more deeply on the part played in the world by Rothschild ; he would come to see him as one of the great- est revolutionaries-a founder of modern democracy . Richelieu had undermined the sovereignty of the feudal nobility ; when it had become lazy and degenerate Robes- pierre had completed its destruction, but the private own- ership of land had survived, and property owners had merely usurped the pretensions of the old nobility, under a new guise . Thereupon the Rothschilds arrived, and had abolished the dominion of landownership by creating the system of . state bonds as the greatest power, and invest- ing money which anyone could possess at any place, with the prerogatives that land had previously enjoyed . 5 Heine evolved these ideas after a conversation with James, \"that Nero of finance who has built himself a"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Heinrich Heine"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 199 golden palace in the Rue Laffitte,\" as he strolled with him arm-in-arm, through the streets of Paris, \"in a quite famillionary way\" as Karl Kraus s wittily remarked . Heine held that James was the man in whom \"since the death of his distinguished brother in England, all the political significance of the House of Rothschild\" was concentrated . Heine particularly admired James for his ability in discovering any persons of talent, even in the comparatively distant country of Spain, though he might not be able fully to appreciate them . \"For his gifts in this direction,\" Heine wrote, \"he has been compared with Louis XIV, and he certainly is a contrast to his colleagues here, who like to surround themselves with a general staff of mediocrity . James von Rothschild may always be seen in intimate association with the notabilities of every walk of life . He might be entirely unversed in a subject, but he always knew who was the best man in it . He probably does not understand a single note of music, but Rossini has always been an intimate family friend . Ary Scheffer is his court painter, Careme was his cook . Herr von Rothschild certainly knows as little Greek as Demoiselle Rachel, but Letronne is the scholar whom he most values . The brilliant Dupuy- tren was his physician, and between the two there was the most brotherly affection . \"Herr von Rothschild was one of the first to perceive the worth of Cremieux, the great and noble-hearted lawyer, who became his loyal advocate . Similarly he at once appreciated Louis Philippe's political capacity, and he was always on the most confidential terms with that great master of statecraft . Herr von Rothschild alone dis- covered Emile Pereire, the Pontifex Maximus of rail- ways, and he immediately made him his chief engineer, entrusting to him the construction of the railway to Ver- sailles on the right bank of the Seine, on which there has never been an accident .

Heine gave recognition where it was due, although he was frequently ironical at James's expense, and reproached him for his meanness and avarice . The outbreak of cholera in Paris in 1832 produced a real panic . There was a rumor current in the capital that the disease was produced by certain mixers of poisons, who poisoned the people with a white powder . Two hapless persons who had bought a white cough powder at a chemist's, and were quietly walking out of the shop with it, were torn in pieces by a crowd which collected in an instant, when an old woman shouted, \"There are the murderers and poisoners 1\" Their bloody remains were carried in triumph through the streets, the crowds shout- ing, \"Voiles le cholera morbus!\" People died in tens of thousands, and Paris was anything but gay . Those who could, and who had the money, fled the city . Heine tells us that 120,000 passports were issued at the Mairie . \"The people complained bitterly,\" he states, \"when they saw rich folk fleeing the city and making for the healthier districts, accompanied by doctors and bottles . The poor man noticed that money was a protection even against death . The majority of the juste-milieu and of high finance have also left, and are living in their country houses . The representatives of wealth par excellence, the Herren von Rothschild, have, however, remained quietly in Paris, thereby demonstrating that it is not only in finance that they are courageous and magnificent .\" 8 According to Heine's mood and finances, such praise would alternate with ironical remarks referring to Roths- child's meanness . Heine can scarcely have been thinking of himself when he wrote in \"Gedanken and Einfalle,\" \"The main army of Rothschild's enemies is made up of"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 201 the have-nots ; they all say to themselves, `What we have not, Rothschild has .' As soon as a man's money is gone, he becomes Rothschild's enemy .\" a This was certainly true of Heine himself . He was, however, impressed by the splendor and wealth of the envied bankers . \"For the beau monde of Paris,\" he wrote on March i, 1836, \"yesterday was a remarkable day : we had the first performance of Meyerbeer's long awaited `Huguenots' at the Opera, followed by Rothschild's first ball in his new house . As I did not leave until four o'clock this morning, and have not been asleep yet, I am too tired to give you an account of the scene of this festival, and of the mag- nificent new palace built entirely in the style of the Ren- aissance, in which the guests wander, expressing their admiration and astonishment . As at all Rothschild's re- ceptions, the guests were chosen strictly for their social rank, the men being distinguished for their great aristo- cratic names or positions, while the women were distin- guished for their beauty and elegance . \"As for the palace itself and its decorations, it unites everything which the spirit of the sixteenth century could conceive and the money of the nineteenth century could pay for . In it the genius of art competed with the genius of Rothschild . Two years had been spent in constant work on this palace and its decorations, and the sums that have been expended are said to be enormous. Herr von Rothschild smiles when he is asked . It is the Ver- sailles of a financial absolute monarch . One is forced to admire the taste no less than the lavishness of the execu- tion . M .

She showed intelligent appreciation of Heine's poetry, which did not make the same appeal to her husband . She con- stantly expressed her admiration for Heine's work, and by flattering the poet's vanity, increased his devotion to the Baroness Betty, who was not entirely displeased when Heine ventured to suggest that such a rare soul should not be married to a dull calculating machine . The poet constantly, indeed regularly, sent her his works, not ex- cepting those which made fun of her husband . He count- ed on obliterating any unfavorable impression by a casual expression of apology . Heine well knew what he was about when he emphasized the contrast in the characters of the husband and wife . Baroness Betty constantly invited him, and on such oc- casions he was able to put forward requests and to ask for favors for friends, such as Ludwig Marcus, who was living at that time in dire poverty . Baroness Betty would plead Heine's cause with her husband, and would also help personally, and Heine would express his gratitude in one of his next writings, in which he would speak of \"the angelic help of a beautiful woman, the wife of one of the richest bankers in the world, who is justly famous for her wit and her knowledge .\" 10 Later, when he lay ill in his attic, he actually wrote to Frau Betty : \"As I lie cut off from the world, the picture of you often com- forts and cheers me . It is one of the most treasured works in the gallery of my memory .\" Since his first meeting with the baroness at Boulogne- sur-Mer in September, 1833, Heine had always felt in complete sympathy with her . His gratitude for many a kindness and his admiration for Betty as a woman and a lady found poetical expression in the poem to which he gave the name \"The Angel .\" 11"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 203 It was in the years 1835 and 1836 that Heine spent most time at Rothschild's house . G~illparzer met him there when, during a short visit to Paris, he was dining at James Rothschild's, Rossini being also present \"Much as I had liked Heine, when I was alone with him,\" Grill- parzer wrote, 12 \"I did not like him at all a few days later when we were dining at the Rothschilds . It was apparent that his hosts were afraid of Heine, and he exploited their fear by slyly poking fun at them at every opportu- nity . But it is not admissible to dine with people whom you don't care for . If you despise a person you should not dine with him . In point of fact our acquaintance did not progress after this .\" About this' time Heine was actually considering the question of dealing with the history of the' origin and development of the House of Rothschild, but the recur- rent tension in his relation with the House since 1837 probably caused him to give up the idea . In spite of such occasional help as he received, Heine's financial affairs were in constant confusion, and James Rothschild refused to intervene in Heine's pecuniary wrangles with his rich uncle Solomon Heine . James for a long time had had intimate financial dealings with that banker, and may well have suffered a rebuff on trying to say a good word for Heine . He did not feel inclined to introduce an un- pleasant element into his relations with a business friend by unduly pressing the point . Various profitable dealings, including a participation in profits on the issue of capi- tal for the Northern Railway of France, seem to have assisted in producing a more genial atmosphere between Heine and James ; and at this time Heine quite unex- pectedly found an opportunity of making himself useful to the House of Rothschild . In 1843, Heine's publisher, Campe, had received from a certain Friedrich Steinmann of Munster a manuscript entitled \"The House of Rothschild : Its History and Its Transactions .\" The book dealt with the House in a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"204 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild spiteful and hostile way . Campe paid the author the fee which he asked, and happened to mention the matter to Heine . Heine asked to see the manuscript, and Campe postponed printing it, giving it to Heine to take to Paris so that he might discuss the matter with Rothschild .\" In a letter dated December 29, 1843, Heine wrote to Campe saying, \"I confess I should be glad of an oppor- tunity of requiting the great kindness that Rothschild has shown me for twelve years [i.e ., ever since he had come to Paris], if I have an opportunity for doing so in an honest manner .\" The pamphlet remained for the time being at Heine's house, and was not published until 1858, that is, fifteen years later, by V . Kober at Prague . By this action Heine had certainly earned the gratitude of the House of Rothschild, and it may fairly be assumed that it was not bad business for Campe . In April, 1840, an incident occurred at Damascus which caused the most intense excitement in the Christian and the Jewish world . A Jesuit priest and his servant had been murdered in that city, and the Jews were accused of having perpetrated a ritual murder upon these victims . The suspected persons were arrested, and as torture was at that time applied in examining such persons, the whole of Jewry throughout the world declared that the admis- sions had been wrung by force, and that the accused were guiltless . The Christians were even more passionate in their assertion that the Jews were guilty . The incident therefore acquired a significance that far transcended any similar local murders . Innumerable Jews sent their pe- titions to members of the House of Rothschild, whose in- fluence with the various governments of the great Powers was well known, asking them to intervene on behalf of their co-religionists . In the case of James and Solomon these prayers fell upon fruitful ground . James took up the matter with the French government, and Solomon tried to induce Metternich to take action ."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 205 Solomon was in so far successful with the Austrian officials that the Austrian Consul von Laurin did actu- ally take steps on behalf of the arrested persons . This man also persuaded Mehemet Ali to order that torture should be discarded in the further course of the case against the Jews at Damascus, and von Laurin wrote di- rect to Solomon to inform him of this, 14 as well as keep- ing James in Paris informed of the course of the whole affair . The French consul at Damascus, on the other hand, had taken up an attitude hostile to the Jews . The Vienna Rothschild asked his brother James to use his influence in Paris, but just at this time the Austro-French differ- ence in the Eastern question was most acute, and Louis Philippe's government feared that the people would re- gard any action in the sense desired by James as a humili- ation of France before Austria, and as unwarranted sup- port of Jewish as opposed to Christian interests . For these reasons any action in favor of the accused Jews was de- layed . \"My efforts,\" James wrote to Solomon, 15 \"have unfor- tunately not yet produced the desired result . The Gov- ernment are acting very slowly in this matter ; in spite of the praiseworthy action of the Austrian Consul they do not wish immediately to recall our Consul, because the matter is too remote, so that public interest has not been sufficiently roused about it . All that I have so far succeeded in doing is, as is briefly stated in the Moniteur today, to arrange that the Vice-Consul at Alexandria should be instructed to investigate the conduct of the Con- sul at Damascus ; this is, however, only a temporizing measure, since the Vice-Consul is under the Consul, so that he has no authority to call the latter to account for his actions . \"In such circumstances the only means we have left is the all-powerful method here of calling in the newspapers to our assistance, and we have accordingly today had a"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"206 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild detailed account, based on the report of the Austrian Con- sul, sent in to the Debats and other papers, and have also arranged that this account shall appear in similar detail in the Allgemeine Zeitung of Augsburg .

Benoit Fould, who, while his co-religionists were being tortured in Syria at the instigation of a French Consul, delivered some excellent speeches in the Chamber of Deputies on the subject of the conversion of rentes and the bank rate, with the im- perturbable calm of a Hillel .\" 1 ° For Austria, however, in spite of Metternich's inter-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 207 vention on behalf of the Jews, Heine had not a good word to say, for he regarded that state as a hotbed of reaction, where the written word was subject to restric- tions to an extent unknown elsewhere . The financial prob- lems of the imperial state had at that time again grown acute, as the war rumors of 1840 had resulted in further considerable military expenditure . There were many hard cases in private business too . Toward the middle of the year 1841, one of the four banks with which the govern- ment had constant financial dealings was actually in dif- ficulties . This was the bank of Geymuller . Metternich wanted at any price to prevent the firm from going bank- rupt, and carried on prolonged negotiations to this end with the House of Rothschild and the other bankers, but they either could not or would not support that bank . On July io it was forced to suspend payment . There were now only three banks-Rothschild, Sina, and Arnstein and Eskeles-that did business with the state . Although the state's need of money was great, its security stood high, and on July 14, 1841, the three banks actually under- wrote 38,500,000 florins of 5% bonds at 104%, Rothschild taking fourteen millions . Immediately after the conclusion of this agreement (the connection between the events can hardly be doubted) Solomon Rothschild sent in another petition asking for a dispensation from one of the numerous regu- lations limiting the rights of the Jews . The ironworks at Witkowitz had originally belonged to the Archduke Rudolph, and had later been inherited by the Archduke Reiner . As the latter had not attained his majority, it was intended to lease the ironworks to Solomon Rothschild . The petition necessary to effect this had been sent in in September, 1833, but at the last mo- ment Witkowitz was purchased by the Archbishop of Olmutz, Count Chotek . When the construction of the Nordbahn began, and Rothschild wanted to make him- self independent of foreign iron, the archbishop leased"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"208 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild the ironworks in equal shares to Rothschild and Baron von Geymuller . In the meantime the ironworks had de- veloped enormously, and, as Solomon said in his peti- tion to the court, it had by 1841 \"grown into one of the most splendid and productive establishments in the mon- archy\" and one that provided employment for fifteen hun- dred men . When Geymuller got into difficulties, and the arch- bishop was also in need of capital, Rothschild sought to take advantage of the favorable opportunity for bring- ing the whole concern into his own possession . The diffi- culty was that Jews in Austria were not permitted to build factories or to acquire the real property necessary for the purpose, 17 or even to engage in mining . Rothschild therefore requested that an exception should be made 18 in his favor with regard to these regulations . In view of the fact that they had just received a loan, the authori- ties at Vienna could not but accede to his request, and Solomon was accordingly permitted to purchase Witko- witz, lock, stock, and barrel, and to proceed with coal- mining and ironworks .\" The moment had been happily chosen . The Roths- childs were exceedingly clever at making governments feel under an obligation to them, and had a genius for striking while the iron was hot . They sometimes made it practically morally impossible for a government to re- fuse their requests, and not to give them the monopoly of banking business . Within his own sphere, Amschel Meyer at Frankfort acted on precisely similar lines . The Bethmann Bank had long been overshadowed . As Schwemer says, 20 Amschel had his finger in every pie : he dealt with the business of the Federation as well as with that of the individual German governments, and supplied the money for the railways that were being constructed everywhere at that time . He continued in close relations with the Court of Hesse, to which his House had owed its rise ."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 209 When in 1831 the son of the old Elector Wilhelm 11 left the capital on account of his mistress, the heir to the throne, who was later to be the Elector Friedrich Wil- helm I, had been appointed joint Regent at Cassel . He was morganatically married to Gertrud Falkenstein, the divorced wife of a Prussian lieutenant, Lehmann ; in 1831 he raised her to the rank of Countess von Schaum- burg, and later he created her Princess of Hanau . In 1846 the elector already had five children by this mar- riage . Amschel Meyer gave the elector financial assist- ance in starting them in life, and the prince and his countess would often \"take their midday meal quite en famille with their business friend .\"\" Not only the elector but most of the other German princes would apply to Rothschild for money . Rothschild would often make the conclusion of other agreements with banks subject to the condition that the banks should take over a portion of the liabilities of these numerous loans to petty German rulers . Just as he thoroughly under- stood how to keep up the price of such securities as he felt inclined to favor, he also knew how to depress a loan . In a report of Baron von Mensshengen we read : 22 \"Baron Rothschild has given a proof of his power in the case of the Russo-Polish Lottery loan of the year 1 835 . He persistently depreciated this very safe and profitable security because the principal underwriter, the banker Frankl of Warsaw refused to allow him to participate in it, and because the Russian Government, being annoyed with the London Rothschild about the loan which he had granted, suddenly broke off relations with his House, and has since dealt with Hope at Amsterdam . \"In these circumstances it is not surprising that many of the smaller German Governments, and more particu- larly that of Nassau, should have recourse exclusively to the House of Rothschild, and should refuse to be in- fluenced by the dissatisfaction frequently expressed by their subjects, especially in the Grand Duchy of Jesse,\""},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"210 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Metternich had for a long time fully appreciated the power of the House of Rothschild, but he would not tolerate an obvious divergence between himself and the Rothschilds in matters affecting foreign policy . When, during the discussions on the loan of 1841, Solomon wanted to put in a clause providing for the possible out- break of war, Metternich replied that as minister for for- eign affairs he would feel compelled to protest against any such clause being admitted, 2 S \"since I could never concur in allowing a decision affecting the question of war or peace to be influenced by the attitude of the banks .\" Solomon replied that he fully appreciated Met- ternich's point, and nothing further was heard of this suggestion . Fundamentally the Rothschilds were the only House in which the chancellor had real confidence, the following circumstance being a remarkable instance of this fact . Several businesses in Vienna and Trieste being in dif- ficulties in August, 1841, the government decided that the three big banks should be allowed to apply four mil- lions for their relief in Vienna, and one million in Trieste . Strangely enough the three banks were allowed to decide to whom such assistance should be granted . This provi- sion soon resulted in considerable discontent, and com- plaints were made to the treasury as to the manner in which the money was allotted . Two banks, that of Sina and that of Arnstein and Eskeles, were more particularly accused of having favored those persons with whom they had close business relations in the allocation of the gov- ernment moneys .\" Metternich carefully went into this complaint, and de- cided that the best way of' dealing with it would be for the state secretly to give Solomon Rothschild the control in this matter, over the heads of the other two banks . \"In view of the conduct of the three firms,\" he wrote,\" \"in allocating the commercial subsidies, the question nat-"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 211 urally suggests itself whether the Government (which is providing the means) has the right to control the opera- tions of the three firms, By control I mean that the three firms should be required to render a regular account of the moneys expended by them . Solomon is bound to feel himself crippled in dealing with this matter, because he dreads arousing the hostility of his environment, and has the most profound contempt for the banking community of Vienna ; moreover, as a business man, he regards his position as that of a foreigner in Vienna, and so he will only deal with the Governments . As, however, he is one of the persons entrusted with the disposal of the moneys of the reserve fund, he must be retained here, and I advise Baron Kiibeck to tell him frankly that he relies on him, but, to tell him so as a confidential friend . This is the line which is most effective in influencing him .\" This was a great mark of the confidence which Metter- nich reposed in Solomon . It was entirely in accordance with their personal relations . Solomon surpassed himself in attentions to the Metternich family . \"Our friend Solo- mon's devotion always touches me,\" the princess wrote just after he had paid her a visit 28 During the summer, when the Metternichs were at their estate near Frank- fort, they received constant attentions, such as American deer for their park, 27 and members of the banker's family often came to call on them . \"Among others,\" the Princess Melanie noted in her diary 28 on September 5, 1841, \"were the Rothschilds, five in number . There were Solo- mon and James, their nephew Anthony, Solomon's son, and finally Amschel, who made a great point of our com- ing to dine with him at Frankfort next Tuesday . James brought me a pretty mother-of-pearl and bronze box from Paris, filled with sweets, which was all to the good .\" When, as in 1843, the Metternichs stayed at Ischl, Solomon was, there, and not unnaturally, for Marie Louise of Parma and her suite were there too .

The question of the Jews' right to hold real property had not yet been settled . In order to get over this diffi- culty, Solomon, having prepared the way by numerous benefactions, applied to be granted the rights and priv- ileges of a citizen of Vienna ; for as a Viennese citizen he would automatically acquire the right to own real property . In order, however, to achieve his purpose, he had to apply to the emperor for a dispensation with re- gard to this concession .\" The emperor granted the dis- pensation, and the town accordingly admitted him as a citizen . Solomon thereupon proceeded to purchase the house of the Romischer Kaiser, which was situated within the Ring of Vienna, in the Renngasse, together with the house immediately adjoining, which he pulled down, building on the site another house specially adapted to his purpose . For this favor Solomon expressed his gratitude when- ever opportunity offered . A terrible fire having broken out in Hamburg in 1842, which destroyed a large pro- portion of the town, Solomon not only offered Metternich a large personal subscription, but also offered to transmit any sums to Hamburg free of charge . \"I shall avail myself,\" he wrote to Metternich,al \"of the services of my old business friend, Herr Solomon Heine, who is well known for his philanthropic feelings, knowing that I may assume that he will dispense with any bank charges, and remit to the civil authorities at Hamburg the exact equivalent of the sums paid in here .\" Such actions as these always made a good impression, and served to consolidate Solomon's position at Vienna,"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"7'he Revolution of 1848 \t 213 The state was in constant need of further loans . In 1843 the three banks offered a 40,000,000 loan in return for debentures to the amount of 43,000,000 florins, Rothschild taking up one-third . In addition to these state loans, numerous private loans were contracted with the most distinguished members of the Austrian and Hungarian nobility . Prince Esterhazy for instance, who had not even repaid his loan of 1829, was, in 1844, negotiating a loan of no less than 6,400,000 florins with Rothschild and Sina . The activities of the House of Rothschild were, how- ever, by no means confined to financial transactions . Any opportunity of doing business in other directions was eagerly seized . Austrian smokers at that time were suf- fering acutely from the fact that the state tobacco mo- nopoly had forbidden the import of genuine Havana cigars, in order to protect the home industry . The House of Rothschild, which fully realized how many cigars were smuggled into the country, made a contract with a firm in Havana to deliver io,000,00o cigars at 33 gulden per thousand, delivered free in Vienna, Rothschild under- taking to obtain the necessary permission to import them from -Kiibeck, the minister concerned . Kubeck immediately agreed since, the cigars being retailed to the public at 70 gulden per thousand, the state made a profit of 11276, as Count Hartig pointed out .\" Kiibeck did not even wait for the emperor's assent, al- though the papers came to him in due course for signa- ture, the emperor being regarded simply as a signing machine .\"' The cigars sold like hot cakes ; a repeat order for 17,500,000 was sent off almost at once, and all con- cerned made a very good business out of it, the smokers themselves gladly paying the heavy price for a pleasure that they had been so long denied .\" The smokers, indeed, were exceedingly grateful to Solomon Rothschild, and this import of Havana cigars, besides being good business, increased Solomon's popularity ."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"214 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Having succeeded in establishing himself in Vienna, Solomon also felt the desire to acquire landed property, to invest his spare cash in real estate, and to create an entailed estate for his family, in the manner of the great nobles of the country . For this purpose he had to petition the emperor, since foreign Jews were also not permitted to acquire landed property . Solomon set out in his peti- tion 85 that he had long ago come to regard Austria as his second fatherland . He recited all the services he had rendered to the State of Austria : \"It has always been my constant endeavor to improve and consolidate Austria's credit, which is now so splen- didly established ; and in these honorable efforts I have always enjoyed the active support of all our Houses on the Continent . I have always welcomed every oppor- tunity, and done anything in my power to promote the interests of industry and undertakings of public utility in Austria . \"The great railway through Moravia, which will soon connect Austria with the eastern and northern seas, could have been achieved only through the expenditure of large sums of money, and by dint of patient waiting ; sacrifices that I was called upon to make, to the amount of several hundred thousand, at a time of acute financial crisis, when confidence was at a very low ebb .\" Solomon mentioned his expenditure of half a million florins on the purchase and installations at Witkowitz, as well as his annual expenditure of four to five hundred thousand florins in wages, and finally, the seven hundred thousand florins expended on the coal mines in Dalmatia, as though all this money had been expended simply in order to provide a means of livelihood to \"many thou- sands of persons who would otherwise be entirely poor and destitute,\" pointing out that up to the present he had derived no profit for himself . \"Your most humble petitioner,\" Solomon continued, \"has always been an active and zealous supporter of all"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 215 other kinds of public institutions as well, and in this con- nection he feels that he can confidently rely upon the wit- ness of the higher authorities, as well as upon the recog- nition of public opinion, since he does not wish to appear to blow his own trumpet, or to weary your Majesty with a narration of individual examples . \"The most humble undersigned believes that these acts, and his general conduct during his stay of nearly a quar- ter of a century in your capital city, have furnished ade- quate proof of his unshakable devotion to the Austrian monarchy, and it is therefore natural that he should most ardently desire to own property in a country whose rulers have shown him so many signal marks of their favor, a country which has so many dear relations for him, and to which your humble and loyal petitioner's posterity, living entirely in accordance with his example, desires to be bound with similar bonds of love and loyalty . This desire would be satisfied by the possession of a demesne in Moravia ; for that is the province which should, in the future, most especially yield the fruits of the well-inten- tioned efforts which your loyal and humble petitioner has made, and will not fail to continue to make, in order to secure its advantage and prosperity . That is also the province in which a substantial part of his wealth has already been invested, in the coal-mines of Witkowitz .\" Solomon wound up this memorial by saying that he confined himself to the most humble request : \"that your I . and R . Majesty may be graciously pleased to confer upon your most humble and loyal petitioner the right for him and his descendants to own one or other of the demesnes in the province of Moravia, if your humble petitioner should find an opportunity for acquiring such demesne .\" The petition was first transmitted to Count Ugarte, the provincial Governor of Moravia and Silesia, for his ob- servation . He emphasized the fact\" that the concession with regard to Witkowitz in no way implied that the"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"216 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild subject-matter of the petition should be granted, \"since it is essentially distinct from the actual ownership of landed property, carrying rights of jurisdiction which, in these provinces at any rate, have never been granted to a person of the Jewish persuasion ; moreover, it is nec- essary to call attention to the fact that if in the case of Baron von Rothschild the right to own real estate were to pass to his heirs, he would be placed in a more favor- able position even than Christian landed proprietors who are not domiciled in these provinces .\" Count Ugarte went on to state that in view of these considerations, it was clear that to accede to Baron von Rothschild's petition would be to confer a quite excep- tional favor upon an individual, such as had never been granted in his part of the country, being contrary to the constitution and to the law . Such a remarkable act of grace on the part of the emperor could be justified only by the most important services and the most highly excep- tional personal qualities . As to the services rendered by Baron von Rothschild to the state in general, Count Ugarte observed that it was not within his province to comment upon them, and that such comment must be reserved for higher authority . The fact of their importance could not be doubted, since the emperor had seen fit to raise Rothschild to the dignity of an Austrian baron, to confer upon him the freedom of the capital, and to grant him the necessary dispensation for engaging in mining operations . As to the question how far the province of Moravia was specially associated with the services in return for which Baron von Rothschild had received these signal honors, Count Ugarte felt that he was merely doing his duty in stating his complete conviction that through exercising his determining in- fluence in favor of the construction of the Kaiser-Ferdi- nand-Nordbahn, the petitioner had particularly earned the gratitude of the province of Moravia . Ugarte further suggested that the large-minded enter-"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 217 prise which Rothschild had shown in establishing the ironworks at Witkowitz seemed to indicate that he in- tended to make them a model and a blessing for the whole country-a second Seraing indeed-and that these works would constitute an enormously important element in the further industrial development of the province . Further, Rothschild was particularly to be commended for the fact that, immediately after taking over these im- portant works, he had instituted schools for the children of the workpeople, thereby showing a concern for the moral and intellectual welfare of the workers that, was rare in the world of industry, and constituted a notable example for others to follow . After observing that the concessions for mining and establishing ironworks which had been granted to Roths- child, were of the greatest importance to the province, Count Ugarte concluded his report with the following general remarks : \"As to Baron Rothschild's personal qualities, his position in Society is so exceptional that he has been entirely removed from the ordinary circum- stances of his co-religionists ; his remarkable qualities and rare intelligence make it entirely inappropriate to apply strictly in his case the regulations in force with regard to other Israelites .\" While leaving it to the judgment of higher authority to decide whether the very exceptional circumstances which he had enumerated justified or did not justify the granting of the petition, Count Ugarte expressed the view that if in spite of all objections an exception to the general rule was at all permissible, the case of Baron von Rothschild would certainly and perhaps exclusively jus- tify such an exception being made . The head of the treasury, Count von Inzaghy, minuted on this opinion that, \"in view of the very exceptional position held by the House of Rothschild in European commerce,\" he felt bound to recommend the granting of the petition . The fact that no Jew owned landed prop-"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"218 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild erty in Moravia did not matter, since in Lower . Austria, where Jews are actually forbidden to stay in the country at all, a Jew had purchased a demesne, and the emperor had actually allowed the estate to pass to his son . It was certainly a fact that it was usual to grant such a right to own land to the petitioner only, without allowing the right to become heritable ; \"but,\" the count continued, \"it seems to me that in this particular case we should have regard to the special circumstances of the petitioner, Baron von Rothschild ; at his advanced age of seventy years it would be almost insulting for the Emperor to grant the right to own land to him alone, and such a priv- ilege would be practically useless if it were not made to cover, at any rate his two children, the I . and R . Consul-General at Frankfort, Anselm, Baron Rothschild, and his daughter, who is married to his younger brother James, Baron von Rothschild, the I . and R . Consul- General in Paris . \"The services rendered by Baron von Rothschild are so well known, he is so famous for his philanthropy and public spirit that it would be redundant for me to enu- merate his many individual good deeds . \"Having regard to the further consideration that it is highly desirable that Baron von Rothschild should be more closely bound to the Imperial State of Austria by the investment of his money in real property in this coun- try ; and in view of the fact that it would create a very strange impression abroad if his particular wish to settle permanently in that country where he has been so actively engaged for a long period of years, and has been asso- ciated with the Government in more extensive and im- portant transactions than has ever been the case before with a private individual, were to be refused after the special distinctions that have been conferred upon him ; I feel it to be my duty to support the petition which has been graciously sent to me by my colleague for my observations .\""},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 219 The emperor gave his decision, acceding to all the re- quests put forward in Solomon Rothschild's petition . By way of showing his gratitude, Rothschild gave a sum of forty thousand florins to erect a building in the town of Bri nn for the purpose of scientific research . Although, as has been shown, the higher authorities in the state fully supported Rothschild, the Moravian Es- tates were of a completely contrary opinion . As the em- peror's decision had already been promulgated, it was impossible for them in the circumstances of the time openly to resist it, 37 but they determined at any rate to address \"the most humble request to his Majesty that no extension of any kind whatever to the exception in ques- tion should be accorded, and that the concession gra- ciously granted to Baron von Rothschild should be strictly limited in application to a single demesne .\" This petition was duly sent forward to the emperor, but Count Inzaghy made the observation thereon that \"this petition of the Moravian Estates does not appear to be entirely consonant with their proper attitude to your Majesty .\" The papers were finally presented to the emperor, to be disposed of by the following sentence : 38 \"I concur in your opinion, and it is my wish that this uncalled for suggestion by the Moravian Estates should be put by without reply\" ; and the emperor duly signed . Baron Rothschild, having obtained his Imperial Maj- esty's blessing, at an expenditure of go,ooo florins for public benefit in the province of Moravia, the Moravian Estates decided as a protest not to accept Solomon's offer . Rothschild, however, determined that the 4o,ooo florins should be applied to the purpose he had intended, leaving it \"entirely to the decision of his Majesty as to how the money should be applied, my wish being that the prov- ince of Moravia should benefit .\" Baron von Pillersdorf, of the emperor's secretariat, recommended that \"that the Emperor should note with"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"220 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild approval Baron von Rothschild's renewed offer, and should grant that he should be informed of the man- ner in which the money should be spent .

During 1844 he bought the estate of Oderberg from Count Henckel, as well as the property of Ludzierzowitz in Prussia ; and in 1845 he bought the Hiiltschin estate . Since 1843 Solo- mon had owned the Schillersdorf demesne in Prussia, near the Austrian frontier . In one direction this estate consisted of a magnificent castle, complete with foun- tains, moats, waterfalls, swans, grottoes, kennels and game preserves. In the other direction there was a foundry and other industrial works . Solomon Rothschild had now suddenly become one of the largest landed proprietors in the country . The resentment aroused by the growing power of the House of Rothschild, which had manifested itself in connection with their purchase of real estate, became espe- cially evident in connection with the preliminary discus- sions regarding the construction of a central railway through Hungary, in which Solomon Rothschild meant to play a leading part . Sina's rivalry was also a factor in this matter, and he had succeeded in securing the support of Count Szechenyi, the great Hungarian ."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 221' And, indeed, the magnificent display in which Solomon Rothschild had latterly indulged, as for instance when on a journey, was such as could not fail to arouse resentment . His progress from place to place was almost regal . A meeting of the Central Hungarian Railway Company had been called to be held at Pressburg on April 28, 1844- Solomon Rothschild arrived by steamer the evening be- fore, and an unpleasant sensation was caused by the fact that the boat on his account stopped at the Konigsplatz, instead of at the usual landing stage . The occupants of some of the rooms at the Hotel zur Sonne, where the baron stayed, had been forced to vacate them, so that they might be placed at his disposal . It leaked out that two coaches-and-four, with outriders, had been ordered for the baron's return to Vienna on the evening of the 29th . Rothschild's co-religionists also wished to give him a special welcome . \"A large number of Jews here,\" the police report stated, \"waited for him on the banks of the Danube ; Count Esterhazy frustrated their intention of according the Baron a special welcome, as he would not allow the Jews to carry out their scheme of letting off forty rockets . They were restrained even from shouting their welcome, which, in view of the ill feeling between the citizens and the Jews here, might easily have led to a breach of the peace ; as it was people were complaining because the ship landed at the Konigsplatz on account of Rothschild, instead of at the usual landing place . When he disem- barked, a carriage-and-four that had been waiting for him, took him to his hotel . Soon after his arrival he went to the Hollinger cafe, where he had an ice . As he left, some young people shouted at him from the upper story . Rothschild is lunching today with his Excellency Herr Perzonale, and the commissioners of the opposition party will be .there too . At four o'clock, when they break up, Rothschild will immediately proceed home .

These people were particularly friendly and agreeable to Rothschild, and one of them proposed his health in the most flattering terms, expressing the hope that the baron and his brothers resident in the various capitals of Europe would come to Hungary, and devote their wealth and their moral resources exclusively to that coun- try . Rothschild thanked him very pleasantly, saying that, flattering as the suggestion was, it was not practicable, since fate and circumstances decided the matter, but that he would always devote his special attention to the beau- tiful country of Hungary . This remark was received with great applause . As he left, Solomon observed that he would have to follow the example of the schoolmaster who, as he went away, said to his pupils : \"I am going, but I am leaving my cloak behind, and it will tell me what everybody has done, and how they have behaved in my absence .\" This remark was taken very good- humoredly by those present, although it was variously commented upon afterwards . The priesthood were frequently displeased to observe the growing power of the Jewish banker, and they sought, wherever possible, to put difficulties in the way of the House of Rothschild . Thus, in connection with his coal and asphalt works in Dalmatia, Solomon was compelled on February 6, 1845, to request the emperor that steps might be taken to induce the Archbishop of Zara to in-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 223 struct the priests, who were putting all kinds of obstacles in the way of the undertaking, to cease doing so .\" His requests were almost always granted, for Solomon had succeeded in making himself indispensable . He was just considering another highly important business with the state ; namely, a contract regarding the setting up of a salt-works for producing salt in the Venice lagoon, with a view to supplying the needs of almost the whole of Lombardy . 41 When, as frequently occurred, Solomon was away from Vienna, and staying at Frankfort, the authorities in the monarchy who were responsible for its finances, felt quite uncomfortable . This was especially the case when there was a sudden slump in railway securities, and a crisis on the bourse in Vienna in October, 1845, there having been much speculation in these stocks there, as everywhere else in Europe . Alarmist rumors regarding disturbances in Italy so far accentuated the crisis that the three state bankers, Sina, Eskeles, and the manager of Rothschild, who was absent, requested the state to come to their im- mediate assistance with a loan of two million florins on their joint security, that a calamity might be averted . Metternich instructed the Austrian minister at Frankfort to request Solomon, in view of the state of the money market, either to come to Vienna himself, or to send an- other member of his House . He stated that he felt it to be essential in the interest of the state's finances that one member of the Rothschild family should reside perma- nently in Vienna . 42 Solomon replied evasively, as he had urgent business in Frankfort, where there were also financial difficulties ; but the incident served to show how, as soon as Austria was financially embarrassed, Metternich cried out for Rothschild . In France, too, the direction of the state's finances was to a large extent dependent upon the House of Roths- child . In 1841 when James Rothschild was taking the"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"224 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild cure at Gastein, the French finance minister, Humann, asked him to be in Paris without fail by September 7 or 9, as he was anxious that the conclusion of a loan should not be postponed beyond that date .\" In point of fact, a loan of i5o,ooo,ooo francs 3% rentes was underwritten in October, 1841, at 78 .52, by a company of which James Rothschild was chairman, without anyone else having been asked to bid for it . There was great dissatisfaction over the loan in Paris ; it was not considered to have done justice to the country's credit, and the feeling was that Humann had been cheated . There were, in fact, deal- ings on the bourse in the loan directly after it had been underwritten by the House of Rothschild, at 8i per cent .\"' The House of Rothschild was constantly employed by Louis Philippe's government in diplomatic as well as in financial matters . When General Espartero, after con- quering Don Carlos, had forced the queen mother to flee the country, making himself Regent of Spain, Guizot decided that it was desirable to establish better terms with him . The French government being in general on good terms with Marie Christine, France's diplomatic representative at Madrid would have nothing to do with Espartero . It was decided to make advances to him through the House of Rothschild, and Guizot asked James to convey the wishes of the French government in a letter to his representative Weisweiller, through whom General Espartero had invested his private money, so that through this channel the general might be informed of them . Weisweiller demurred at the suggestion because he feared thereby to endanger the financial and commer- cial interests of the House of Rothschild in Spain . How- ever, the messages were ultimately conveyed, although further events in Spain, ending with the fall of Espar- tero, brought the affair to a negative conclusion .\" Although he had been unable to prevent the ultimate defeat of his protege Don Carlos, Metternich still hoped partly to modify its results . His idea was to marry the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 225 young Queen Isabella, daughter of Marie Christine, who was fourteen years old in 1844, to Don Carlos's son, in order thus indirectly to place the son of his protege upon the throne of Spain . The London Rothschilds had written to Solomon in Vienna on March 29, telling him that the British ministry would do everything possible to promote the success of this plan . Solomon immediately passed this on to Metternich, who expressed the opinion that the consummation of such a marriage would be a really happy event for the whole of Europe, and would serve to bring into line France's and England's isolated position with regard to Spanish affairs, with the other three foreign offices . For the sake of his own personal prestige, apart from other considerations, Metternich did attach great importance to this, for he had personally made every possible effort at the courts of Berlin and St . Petersburg, on behalf of the cause of Don Carlos . Solomon Rothschild also perceived that such an event would provide all kinds of possibilities for his House . \"If this event, so fraught with benefit for the future of Spain, should come to pass,\" he wrote to the Rothschild Houses in Paris, London, and Frankfort, 48 \"the moment would have arrived for our House to render effective financial aid to the consolidated Government of that coun- try . Our honored Prince would himself advise us con- fidently to come forward and demonstrate our willingness to set about putting into operation an extensive financial arrangement for Spain, in which endeavors we should be able to count upon the fullest support from his Highness in every possible way . \"Having been authorized by his Highness, my dear brothers, to inform you of his sentiments exactly as they were communicated to me, remembering that they are the views of him whom we are accustomed to regard as our oracle, I need not request you to make them the guiding principle of your actions, as soon as events take such a course that we may give up the attitude of mere con-"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"226 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild templation and embark on a course of action suitable to these highly important circumstances .\" Events, however, were to fall out otherwise . Isabella was married to her cousin, and not to the son of Don Carlos, and Metternich's whole dream of being justified in Spain as well, was brought to naught . Metternich was exceedingly indignant about this, and although generally so lenient in his attitude to the House of Rothschild, in the case of the Spanish affair he was inclined to lay all the blame upon the Paris and the London Houses . In Paris, too, there was a strong party that was much inclined to look askance at the position of special con- fidence enjoyed by the House of Rothschild . This was especially the case with those whom the Rothschilds had not associated with themselves in the Northern Railway undertaking . To have brought in all those who wanted to make money would of course have been impossible, and those who were left out said, to anybody they could get to listen to them, that Louis Philippe had simply resigned in favor of the Jews . Metternich, in a moment of ill temper, once expressed himself rather strongly with regard to the position of the Rothschilds in France . After emphasizing the difference in conditions between Austria and France, he said : \"By reason of natural causes which I cannot regard as good or as moral, the House of Rothschild is a much more important influence in French affairs than the Foreign Office of any country, except perhaps England . The great motive force is their money . People who hope for phi- lanthropy, and who have to suppress all criticism under the weight of gold, need a great deal of it . The fact of corruption is dealt with quite openly, that practical ele- ment, in the fullest sense of the word, in the modern rep- resentative system .\" 4 ?

James Rothschild did not perceive the dissatisfaction that this state of affairs was arousing in the country . He imag- ined that just because everybody was now engaged in speculation and money-making, there would be no desire to overthrow the existing government, for fear of losing money . \"The departments,\" James Rothschild said to Count Apponyi at this time, \"that have got railways, want to keep them in order to make as much profit out of them as possible . Those which have not yet got them hope and wish to have them in the near future . As both these aims can be realized only by the maintenance of peace and order, everybody is now declaring himself to be conserv- ative and pro-Government .\" James's judgment was too much affected by the attitude of those circles with whom he had most to do . He left the fourth estate, that of the workmen and peasants, out of the account, because he came so little into touch with them . His attention was principally engaged by the enor- . mous work of railway construction . In order to silence such opposition as invariably arises in parliament and in the press in connection with any important undertaking he did his utmost to give opposing elements a share inter- est in the concern . The only organ that refused to accept shares was the opposition paper, National, which con- tinued actively to oppose the Northern Railway . On June i 5, 1846, sections of the Northern Railway were opened with great festivities . On July 8 of that year, there was a railway accident . This produced a sudden storm of pamphlets and attacks in the press . The accident was, indeed, a very serious one . Near Fampoux, close to Arras, the train had run off the lines on to an embank-"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"228 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild ment which curved sharply, running into a stretch of water at the foot of the embankment . Thirty-seven people were killed, and the accident produced violent attacks upon the builders of the railway, and especially upon the most important factor, the House of Rothschild . The National started a positive campaign against them, and James Rothschild was attacked in pamphlets on all sides . There had been similar attacks before in Germany, where a certain Alexander Weil, who was known as a socialist and communist, had launched malicious attacks in a pamphlet called \"Rothschild and the European States,\" against the financial despotism and egotism of the House of Rothschild . 49 He endeavored to show that there was only one power in Europe, namely Rothschild ; his officers were a dozen other banking firms, his men were all honorable tradesmen and workpeople, and his sword was speculation . This effusion was extraordinarily tame compared to the storm that now broke out in France . The outstanding at- tack was contained in a pamphlet called \"Histoire e'difi- ante et curieuse de Rothschild I, roi des juifs,\" which con- tained a description of the railway accident of July 8 . This most unsavory production, which laid all the blame on James and his House, was anonymously circulated in large quantities . There were on the other hand, people who endeavored to spread the impression, abroad that they had been authorized by James to issue a counter-pamphlet in reply to this . A man who had not the faintest connection with James Rothschild, published a pamphlet under the title : \"Baron James von Rothschild's Official Reply to the Pamphlet Entitled, 'Histoire edifiante, etc .' \" Another person pro- duced a pamphlet entitled \"Reply by Rothschild the First, King of the Jews, to Satan . the Last, King of Slanderers .\" Such persons then tried to extract a cash reward from James, but they were not successful in this, for James"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The Revolution o f 1848 220 meant to ignore all pamphleteers equally, whether they were for or against him .

It was therefore decided to take active steps, and Solomon's son Amschel applied direct to the . Prussian government .

We felt that it was beneath our dignity to defend ourselves against such vulgar abuse, especially as it emanated principally from a despicable person, to whom our Paris House had quite rightly refused a loan . Our view was that the rabble, which is more inclined to listen to abuse than to truth and right, is difficult to convince, but that the impartial, thoughtful section of the public, which has had an opportunity of ob- serving our manner of acting over a period of years, does not need to be convinced .

As long as our enemies confined their activities to French soil, we did not feel that any useful purpose would be served by taking any action to prevent them, as France is the hunting-ground of the most unrestrained press, and nobody who occu- pies any prominent position is spared its poisonous attacks . In Germany, however, and especially in Prussia, this is not or should not be the case . All the more painful, therefore, was the impression made when we found that similar scurrilous pamphlets were being published in Berlin and Breslau . I will not disguise from your Excellency that at their advanced time of life my father and my uncle have felt these attacks very keenly, and perceive with regret that under the rule of one of the justest of monarchs, and in spite of the control of the strict censorship it should be possible in a country to which they have rendered such important services over such a long period of years, for these foul abortions to see the light of day .

The attacks, however, affected the House of Rothschild to an extraordinarily small degree ; the financial requirements of the great states with which the Rothschilds were in touch were so pressing, and the Rothschild monopoly in this matter was so marked that it was impossible to dispense with them, and all these unpleasant attacks were ignored . Amschel Meyer was the treasurer of the German Fed- eration ; Austria and Prussia had repaid the money for the fortress construction into the Federal account, and when in February, 1846, Rothschild rendered a statement it appeared that the Federation had an amount of seven to eight millions lying at interest in that account . Even the Pope again entered into negotiations with the House of Rothschild, through the intermediary of Met- ternich, in order to obtain money for constructing rail- ways . Since June, 1846, the liberal-minded Pius IX had occupied the papal chair, and he immediately assented to the construction of the railways, which had not been allowed under his predecessor . In this connection the chancellor forwarded, on August 13, 1846, a report of a conversation between Anselm . and the papal nuncio at Franzensbad . 61 Austria required a further loan in 1847, and the three banks, including Rothschild's, undertook, in return for 80,ooo,ooo florins of bonds to pay 84,000,000 florins cash in sixty-five monthly instalments, commencing on June 1, 1847 .' This condition was to prove of vital importance, in view of what occurred in the following year . The loan had scarcely been agreed to, when a further request was sent in to the chancellor's office, asking that a dispensation should be granted,b 2 so that his faith should not be a bar to Solomon's son Anselm receiving the expected grant of the freedom of the City of Vienna .

A further petition was sent in not long after the first, on June i i, 1847 . In it, Solomon requested that his estate at Koritschau in Moravia, and three town houses in Vienna, might be amalgamated into an entailed estate, to the value of 2,000,000 florins . He asked that the value of 2,000,ooo florins should be spe- cially considered, as the law did not contemplate such an arrangement in the case of estates exceeding in value the maximum amount of 400,000 florins, his Majesty alone having power to authorize any exception to this .\" The emperor referred this petition to the departments for their observation, and important events which oc- curred shortly afterwards prevented Solomon's request from being speedily granted .

The younger brothers, Anthony and Nathaniel and Meyer Nathan, became famous sports- men and owners of race-horses . Nathaniel lived in Paris . He was an invalid, but he took an interest in art and science and in the political events that were taking place around him .

The chancellor of the exchequer actually ar- ranged a loan of £8,ooo,ooo through Rothschild and Baring, a loan which later became famous under the name of the Irish Famine Loan . Whereas Nathan had always sought to avoid any polit- ical dignity or position under the government, Lionel wanted to get into the House of Commons . Now, accord- ing to established custom, Jews could not hold civil or military office in England. They were not elected to Par- liament, and they could not vote at elections . The Jews in England lived in a kind of political and social Ghetto and nobody except the Rothschilds and a few other fam- ilies who had succeeded in achieving a very special posi- tion would have thought of attempting to escape from it . Only the two Houses of Parliament would have been able to make exceptions or to alter these conditions . Lionel, however, thought that his House had rendered such con- siderable services to England in financial matters that he ought to be able to get over these difficulties . In August, 1847, Lionel Rothschild stood as Liberal candidate for the City of London, and he was actually elected, together with Lord John Russell . Now each member of the House of Commons, before taking his seat, had to take an oath containing the words \"on the true faith of a Christian .\" Naturally this oath was not one that Lionel could take . It was proposed in the House of Commons that the form of oath should be changed, but the Upper House rejected this motion . Lionel there- fore could not take his seat ; however he stood again as a candidate, and was always reelected by the City, al- though he never exercised his functions as a Member of Parliament ."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"234 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild As in the critical year i830, so on the eve of 1848, the Rothschilds were engaged in enormous loan opera- tions . In addition to the Irish Famine Loan they were handling a French 3%, loan of 250,000,000 francs, which the Rothschilds had underwritten at 72 .48, having, as in the case of the Austrian loan, taken the precaution of arranging that it should be paid only in monthly instal- ments . Austria had also indicated a wish to arrange an issue of certain bonds which was to be kept most strictly secret and which was to be in addition to the ordinary loans, this issue being required to provide the funds nec- essary to strengthen the military forces in the kingdom of Venice and Lombardy, ominous signs of trouble having appeared there in December, 1847 . In this connection Count Kolowrat expressed his opinion generally on the position at the time, showing considerable foresight with regard to future developments . The money market [he wrote\"] is very depressed, and there is no reason to hope for any early improve- ment . Indeed, political developments generally give reason to fear a turn for the worse . After careful con- sideration of the money market, Baron Kubeck feels that he can confidently count on the securities in ques- tion, if not wholly, at any rate to a great extent, being kept by Rothschild in his own safe, and that he will be content with interest at the rate of 4 .6%, a very moderate rate of interest for commercial capital, especially as it has to cover all the risks of the pres- ent unsettled conditions . Baron Kubeck therefore brings forward the House of Rothschild's proposal with the urgent request that your Majesty will accept it and that your authoriza- tion may be phrased in such a manner as to permit the matter to be kept strictly secret .

Unfortunately, when this sum is spent, there will be nothing left to deal with any new misfortune that may arise . Yet States must necessarily reckon with the possi- bility of such misfortunes, even if they take the form of events that lie beyond the control of humanity, such as the death of the Head of a State, the out- break of an epidemic, or the failure of a harvest . I feel it to be my duty at the present moment to put forward these considerations without reserve, and as emphatically as I can, while it is still possible to place a limit on the excessive military preparations in Italy, and on the expenditure of our last resources ; and to call attention to the fact, which will otherwise be made evident by the complete breakdown of our finances, that the Austrian Government has sacrificed too much to its position abroad, and has paid too little heed to conditions at home . I feel it my duty to make the grave statement that we are on the verge of an abyss, and the increasing demands on the Treasury arising out of the measures necessary to combat foreign revolutionary elements have led to increased disturbances within the coun- try, as is indicated by the attitude of the Provincial Estates, and by the literary outbursts in the press of our neighbors .

Kolowrat's remarks were certainly justified ; there was marked dissatisfaction in the country with the regime of the aged Chancellor Metternich, who was now in his seventy-seventh year, and with his paladins, especially the inexorable minister of police, Count Sedlnitzky . In Italy the measures directed against the movements toward na- tional unity were particularly oppressive, and Metter- nich's influence made itself felt with especial severity, so that the blessings conferred by the Austrian govern- ment on the kingdom of Venice and Lombardy were entirely forgotten . During the middle forties further troubles had broken out in the neighboring country of Switzerland, where the population had divided into two camps of Radicals and Conservatives . The seven Catholic cantons had united to form a separate federation, and had declared open hostilities upon the Radicals . In November, 1847, the Moderates were forced to re= tire by the federal army . Austria, France, and Prussia, whose sympathies were naturally with the Conservative federation, regarded the events in Switzerland as a per- sonal defeat . Metternich considered that what had hap- pened constituted a direct menace to Austria's position in Lombardy . Solomon Rothschild too, who followed the chancellor's policy through thick and thin, was deeply affected by these events ; he hastened to Metternich in consternation on November zo, 1847, to ask for information regarding the general position of affairs .\"' Metternich briefly outlined the situation, and then asked Solomon whether he believed \"that it would be better for the Emperor to sacrifice his Italian States to the revolution, and concentrate his forces on this side of"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The Revolution of 1848 \t 237 the Alps, or whether he should assert his position in the Kingdom of Venice and Lombardy .\" \"Not thatl\" exclaimed Rothschild, with reference to the first alternative . \"In that case all would be lost .\" \"That is also my view,\" Metternich replied, \"and that must be the view of all sensible people . Between thought and action, however, there is a great difference .\" Action, however, called for means to action, and the means had to be estimated . Metternich went on to say to Rothschild that he would suggest to the emperor that he should command reenforcements for the Italian army . This would require money, and it was essential that the money should be raised without disturbing the regular course of the state's finances . They had just got over one crisis successfully ; a further crisis would be very danger- ous, and must at all costs be avoided . The chancellor declared that an exceptional situation required excep- tional methods for dealing with it, and asked Solomon whether such exceptional assistance would be forth- coming . \"As much as you want,\" Solomon promptly replied, \"is at your service . And it shall not damage your credit, indeed it shall improve it . Tell me what you want and I'll pay it over at once .\" Metternich replied that he did not want anything ; if the head of the treasury needed money, he would know where to go for it . All that he needed was to know that if Baron Kubeck should need to get money without up- setting his plans, he could come to Rothschild for it . Beyond this, the matter did not concern him . \"As much as Baron Kubeck wants,\" Rothschild ex- claimed . \"I will go to him at once, and he can leave the money market to me .

Unrest was in the air, and waves of excitement passed over Italy, where the series of the 1848 revolutions began with a rising in Sicily, in January of that year . The Vienna bourse reacted with extreme nervousness to this news, and the liberals of all countries bT assiduously exaggerated the bad state of the public finances in that empire, which was regarded as the stronghold of reaction . The populace were already beginning to go to the banks in order to change their paper into coin, and Metternich became seriously concerned . He was not dissatisfied with the general situation in the second half of January, 1848, for Milan was still completely tranquil, though anxious about the financial position . When Solomon visited the chancellor on Janu- ary 23, the latter, as he himself says, spoke to him very seriously, and \"took a very firm line .\" 58 \"Politically,\" he said to Solomon, \"things are going well, but the bourse is in a bad way ; I am doing my duty, but you are not doing yours . If the devil fetches me, he'll fetch you too ; I am looking hell in the face ; you are sleeping instead of fighting ; your fate is therefore sealed 1\" To this attack Rothschild replied with the most pas- sionate apologies, and said, \"I shall buy tomorrow . I have already settled that with Baron Kubeck ; he and you may count on me!\" \"I,\" Metternich replied, \"judge by actions . You may buy tomorrow, but I shall not know why you did not buy yesterday . If it was in order to buy more cheaply, I have no occasion to be grateful to you .\" This conversation shows particularly clearly how closely Metternich and Solomon were bound together for weal or woe .

The Grand Duke of Tuscany, and King Charles Albert of Piedmont, whose dearest dream it was to unite Italy under one scepter, followed this example . The sparks of these troubles were carried from the Apennine Peninsula to France, where they started a gi- gantic conflagration, the flames of which were to spread over the whole of Europe . Louis Philippe's rule had be- come more and more oppressive ; he had ended by refus- ing essential reforms, with the result that a powerful opposition was formed in the capital against Guizot's ministry . The first disturbances that brought out the workmen and students occurred on February 22, 1848 . As even the national guard wished the ministry to be dis- missed, the king, who had become uneasy, accepted the resignation of Guizot. The troops that had been called up came into conflict with the rebels, and the first shots produced terrible excitement . On February 24, barricades were erected in all the main streets of the city ; the national guard and line regi- ments went over to the rebels, and it was soon obvious that things stood very ill with the king's cause . Louis Philippe was becoming an old man ; in his seventy-fifth year he was scarcely equal to dealing with this sudden and unexpected storm . According to Count Apponyi, he showed a lack of decision at the moment of danger, and completely lost his head . As early as February 24 he fled, leaving his capital and his country to the rebels .

He could not credit the fact that overnight changes had occurred that suddenly drew away from under his feet the whole basis upon which his business and his House rested . The banker, who had been perhaps more intimately associated with the regime that had been overthrown than anybody else, was bound to feel that, in the way things were shaping, his position was exceedingly dangerous . His first thought was to quit Paris, and Prosper Meniere tells us that he was actually seen at the Nord station on the point of taking a train to the frontier . At the last moment, how- ever, he appears to have been advised not to leave Paris, as this would permanently undermine his position and his honor . He therefore remained, while his wife and daughter, in a state of great panic and excitement, fled to their rela- tions in London, arriving at Lionel's house unexpected and unannounced . With the terror of their experiences still vivid in their minds they gave a heartrending account of how they had suddenly fallen from the heights of human happiness into the depths of woe and horror . 59 James Rothschild's principal reason for deciding to remain in the capital was that Lamartine and Arago had gone to the Jewish banker Michel Goudchaux, who was also financial editor of the opposition paper, the National, and had asked him to take the portfolio for finance . Michel Goudchaux, who was a friend of Rothschild, agreed, and this so far calmed James that he decided to remain in Paris. Meanwhile Caussidiere, the new prefect of police who had been thrown up by the Revolution, having been a journalist on La Reforme, and having fought on the barricades, heard that Rothschild was med- itating flight .

It was also generally said in Paris that Rothschild was smuggling his bullion out of the country in dung carts, intending afterwards to go formally bankrupt . Caussidiere accord- ingly had James watched by a detective, and when the rumors regarding his intended flight grew more persist- ent he ordered the banker to appear at the prefecture of police . James was then informed why he had been placed under surveillance and was told that he was suspected of intending flight . 80 James replied : \"Sir, I am believed to be buried in gold, whereas in point of fact I have noth- ing but paper . My wealth and capital consist of securities which at this moment are of no value . I have no intention of going bankrupt, and if I must die I shall resign myself, but I would regard flight as cowardly .

Tomorrow I shall introduce my nephew to you, who has just come from London for this purpose .\" Caussidiere replied that he was happy to be able to assist in reassuring Rothschild's family, and he assured him that he had nothing to fear from the people of Paris . They were poor but they were honest, and even if the workman's blouse was sometimes worn by criminals the new government would know how to deal with such people . \"Tout en causant,\" as Caussidiere observes in his mem- oirs, he then asked Rothschild for a loan to be applied ; as he said, to printing works and other institutions . On the following day James Rothschild again appeared at the prefecture, bringing with him his nephew who had arrived from England, and he deposited a sum of money which was divided between the families of the February combatants who had protected the prefecture without receiving any regular pay .

James declared that the Revolution constituted force majeure, relieving him of the obligation to find the remaining 168,ooo,ooo francs . Rothschild also held an enormous quantity of Nord Railway shares, which, owing to the panic on the bourse, had fallen enormously like all the other securities . In spite of the extensive support given by the London House, which was entirely unaffected by these events, James had to make the most prodigious efforts in order to meet his most pressing obligations, being forced to sell large holdings of 3 % rentes at the ridiculous price of 33 francs, and there was worse to come . The Republic was proclaimed, and the destruction wrought in the Tuileries and the Palais Royal, which the mob plundered, throwing the most valuable furniture into the streets where it was burnt, gave reason to fear that further outrages would occur . The national guard and other troops succeeded with difficulty in restoring order in the center of the town, whereupon the rabble proceeded to attack the unprotected buildings in the out- skirts . The mob's rage now vented itself upon all railway works such as stations and bridges, these being completely destroyed and burned down within a radius of thirty miles of Paris .

There has been nothing of the kind . A sudden thunderclap, a tempest, in which everything has been torn down ; it is Providence, God has willed it so .\" James did not get off at all cheaply . Caussidiere had taken money from him, and Suresnes was destroyed, while his hopes of the Jewish finance minister Goudchaux were to prove vain . Ledru-Rollin, minister of the interior in the provisional government, who was setting up national workshops, kept sending in fresh demands for money to the finance minister ea under every conceivable pretext, until the latter resigned in disgust after holding office for a few days . According to the statements of a Russian secret agent who was an eyewitness of the Revolution in Paris, Ledru- Rollin, firmly determined to stop at nothing in order to get money, went to James Rothschild . He told the banker that if he did not give him 250,000 francs required for patriotic purposes, he would send io,ooo workmen into the Rue Laffitte the next day to destroy the Palais Roths- child and take vengeance on him . James is stated in his panic to have paid the money, which was thus practically extorted at the point of the pistol . The Russian related that a few days later Ledru-Rollin repeated the experi- ment, and succeeded under further threats in extorting an additional 5oo,00o francs .

With the fall of Louis Philippe the Rothschilds had lost one of the most essential supports on which their power in Europe was based .

It was only a matter of days, however, before a still more powerful and important support of the gigantic structure erected by the five brothers gave way . The news from Paris produced the greatest consterna- tion in the Austrian empire . Metternich received the first news of Guizot's fall from Solomon Rothschild, who had had a telegram from his brother . He would not be- lieve it, and when shortly afterwards the Russian charge d'affaires called 114 and confirmed it he exclaimed in dis- may, \"Eh bien, mon cher, tout est fini .\" He still hoped that the monarchy would survive ; but when he received from Solomon the further dismal news that the Republic had been proclaimed in France, the aged chancellor is said to have collapsed in his armchair in despair .

Knots of people col- lected in the streets, where orators harangued them . \"Down with Metternich I\" was the universal cry . A crowd of people passed before the chancellor's office shouting that the prince must be dismissed . Stones are thrown at the Archduke Albrecht ; the military open fire . The first victims fall, the excitement spreads more and more . Barricades are put up close to the Rothschild house, which is not far from the arsenal . Solomon anx- iously watches the growing disturbances from the win- dows of his house . The citizen guard sound the alarm and fly to arms . The excesses of the populace in the streets increase .

Rothschild was glad to do the fallen statesman a friendly turn and sent him a thousand ducats through the architect Romano .\" As soon as he received the money the' man who a few hours before had been the most powerful person in the imperial dominion, left the city in disguise, carrying money for his journey and a Rothschild letter of credit . Things had already gone so far that on his journey through Germany Metternich was forced, for the sake of his personal safety, to disguise his identity as far as pos- sible . On March 20 for instance there was a rumor in Frankfort that the chancellor had arrived, and was stay- ing at the house of the Austrian general Count Nobili . Thousands of people immediately collected outside the general's house shouting, \"Pereat Metternichl\" The gen- eral came boldly to the window, announced that the prince was not staying with him, and then drove quite alone at a walking pace through the crowds to a re- ception at Baron Amschel M . von Rothschild's .

Amschel Meyer Rothschild was therefore also at the center of a danger zone, and at a place of considerable political importance, for the forerunner of the National Assembly, which was to provide a new unifying central authority for the whole of Germany, met at Frankfort . This fact necessarily suggested all kinds of possibilities to the official banker of the German Federation if the new authorities were cleverly handled, and if the game were not spoiled with them at the start .

Lombardy also revolted, a fact which made Solomon seriously anxious about the capital amounting to 400,000 florins which he had invested in Venice, in full confidence that Lombardy would continue under Austrian dominion . 87 The Rothschild undertakings were threatened through- out the length and breadth of the monarchy, and Solomon applied his efforts to saving what could be saved . He therefore begged the minister for foreign affairs on June 15, 1848, in view of the rumor that there was every prospect of Lombardy being pacified within a short time, to see that he did not suffer loss, having regard to Aus- tria's well-known care for the interests of her subjects, and of important industrial undertakings .

The defeat of the army of Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, on July 25, at Custozza, by the aged field-marshal Count Radetzky, relieved the situation . Italy's hope during these times of stress was that France would intervene, and that Sardinia would assist her against Austria . There was considerable fear at Vienna lest republican France should take such a step, and the Austrian tempo- rary charge d'affaires von Thom, who had served under Apponyi and held office until Hiibner's arrival, and who knew James Rothschild well, was instructed to report on France's attitude . The foreign embassies, particularly those of the conservative Powers, had, however, practi- cally no influence in Paris at this time, and they got no news .

Serious disturbances again broke out on the govern- ment's attempting to resign . After three days' street fight- ing in June the energetic war minister, Louis Eugene Cavaignac, who was sincerely attached to the republican cause, emerged victorious . He assumed the position of a dictator, and was nom- inated president of the council of ministers by the Na- tional Assembly . James had been on excellent terms with him of old, and he succeeded, at the expense of consid- erable sums of money, in making himself useful to the general, and to the republican cause, so that he was soon as good a republican as he had been a monarchist .

In the general confusion his name, with its associations with the most splendid period of French history-Waterloo had been forgotten-gave hope ; for thousands and tens of thou- sands the name of Napoleon was the symbol of strength, splendor, order, authority, and gloire . After the June fighting considerable sections of the populace became influenced politically by the sentiments of the Right . There was a keen desire for peace and order, and suddenly the immortal name of \"Napoleon\" became the idol of the people . James had watched this development with mixed feel- ings . He remembered the part he and his brother had played under Napoleon I, and he could not but reflect that the great man's nephew knew perfectly well how the Frankfort Jews had shown the game they were playing after the fall of the emperor, and had gone with flying colors into the camp of the victors and of the returning Bourbons, thereafter pursuing their business happily and magnificently under high protection, while, the great em- peror was pining away at St . Helena . Louis Napoleon would not have been a man ; he would certainly not have been Napoleonic had he not wished to take just vengeance on those men or their descendants ; at any rate he could not be expected to show them any marked friendliness .

He said to me that in the present state of mind of France, with Bonaparte making progress on all sides, if England does not prevent France from possible intervention in Italy, on war being actually declared Louis Napoleon will forth- with be carried shoulder-high ; Italy having been drawn into the war, the first measure both of Republican and of Imperial Bonapartists will be again to declare the Continental blockade against England .\" James Rothschild next called on the King of the Bel- gians, Louis Philippe's son-in-law, who also looked askance at Louis Napoleon's rise . When the Revolution broke out in Paris, King Leopold had thought for a time that he might incur a similar fate to that of his father-in-law, and be compelled to leave the country . In order therefore to be secure .against all eventualities he had remitted a sum of 5,000,000 francs to the House of Rothschild, which was to be placed at his disposal if he were actually compelled to leave the country . It was on this matter that James had gone to Brussels .

The slump in securities has assumed alarming proportions, and yesterday there was actually a rumor to the effect that the House of Rothschild was going into liquidation .\" Things were not nearly as bad as all that, but it made Rothschild exceedingly uneasy to see how the cause of Prince Louis Napoleon was advancing with enormous strides throughout the country .

On October 6, 1848, other troops and men of the na- tional guard who did not wish to go to Hungary mutinied and joined the rebels . The shouting mob, drunk with vic- tory, proceeded to the ' war-office building where the ministry was meeting, and threatened to lynch the min- isters . They, however, all escaped, with the exception of the unfortunate war minister, Count Latour, who was cruelly murdered, his corpse being hung stark naked to a lamp post, where the mob continued to insult and beat it . After this murder the crowd, which was quite out of hand, proceeded to the arsenal which is now the central fire station, and which then had its frontage on the Wip- plingerstrasse and Renngasse, being therefore quite close to the Rothschild house .

After the fall of the first Napoleon, France had tried first the elder and then the younger line of the Bourbons . The majority of the people, however, felt uneasy under the form of gov- ernment introduced in 1848, for memories of the terror and excesses of the First Republic that followed the great revolution had not entirely died out, and they were re- vived by the June rising of 1848, which was suppressed, after sanguinary conflicts, by Eugene Cavaignac, war minister of the Republic . It was only natural in these circumstances that the French people should respond to the magic name of Napoleon, which in spite of the tragic end of the man who had made it famous had remained a symbol of genius and glory. On the outbreak of the revolution, Louis Napoleon had hastened to Paris to spy out his chances ; at first he remained in the background, but when in June he was elected to represent Paris and three departments, he felt that his moment was at hand . The aura surrounding the name of Napoleon, with its peculiar psychological appeal, was successfully exploited by a powerful agita- tion, so that at the presidential elections of December 1o, 1848, no less than five and a half` million, out of seven and a quarter million votes, were cast in favor of the prince . The Rothschild family watched these developments,- : ----- 257"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"258 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild with no little dismay . They had not, as in the case of Louis XVIII, eased with their gold the progress of the regent from London to his throne in Paris . The reaction had occurred far too suddenly, and they were too intimately associated with the dynasty that had given them such an extraordinary position in Paris, to be able to effect so abrupt a readjustment of their whole position, the expe- diency of which, at first at any rate, was far from certain . Moreover, there were historical reasons why they should feel embarrassed in tendering their support to a Napoleon, since they were bound to reflect that their attitude after the fall of the first Napoleon had made it obvious to everyone that they had always been secretly in opposition . If a successor of that great man were actually to attain to power, the members of the Rothschild family could hardly expect him to look upon them with favor and con- fidence In the absence of any possibility of Louis Phi- lippe coming back, the House of Rothschild was inclined to favor a republic . The men at the helm seemed to pro- vide a sufficient guaranty against such a republic being too extreme ; and the Rothschilds had succeeded through their earlier connections in establishing good, and in some cases, even intimate relations with these men . They were exceedingly friendly with Cavaignac, and on the best possible terms with General Nicolas Chan- garnier, who had been recalled from Algiers to the Na- tional Assembly, and had been appointed to the command of the national guard . Changarnier paid gallant attentions to James Rothschild's wife, the beautiful and intelligent Baroness Betty . Politically the general was also in sym- pathy with the House of Rothschild, since, if he could not achieve the presidency himself, he was inclined to sup- port the Bourbons, his only difficulty being to decide as between the older and the younger line . Changarnier and the Rothschilds were therefore alike dismayed at the defeat of Cavaignac and Ledru-Rollin in the presidential elections . The general, however, retained"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 259 his high military office, since for the moment he was in- dispensable to the new president, Louis Napoleon, the problem in 1849 being to repel further attacks by the radi- cals ; in this matter, although otherwise opposed, their in- terests were identical . Changarnier, who secretly still cher- ished a hope of attaining to the presidency himself, noted with displeasure, as also did James, that the entourage of the prince president (consisting, as many of their friends stated, of greedy adventurers, although it certainly in- cluded Persigny, a man of blameless character who was blindly devoted to the Napoleonic cause) was constantly urging Louis Napoleon to make himself absolute master of the state . They were also displeased to observe that Louis Napoleon showed no small skill in enlisting the support of philanthropic and socialistic movements . The result was that, while on the surface Louis Na- poleon's attitude to the House of Rothschild was polite, the opposition between them increased . The president felt that the bank was an international power and that his own position was not so secure that he could afford to make enemies unnecessarily . Financially, however, he had little need of the Rothschilds . The rich Jewish banker, Achille Fould, a member of the Paris bank of Fould and Oppen- heim, had attached himself to the prince some time ago, and he not only lent the money the prince so sorely needed to consolidate his position, but also, as a financial expert, became his confidential adviser in all money mat- ters . In order to cut the ground from under the feet of his great rival, Achille Fould had been particularly active in confirming Louis Napoleon in the belief that no help could be expected of a House which had been so inti- mately associated with the fate of the Bourbons, and had been so definitely hostile to the first Napoleon . In this way Fould hoped to secure the position with the powers in the state that the Rothschilds had enjoyed .

On October 31, 1849, Achille Fould was ac- tually appointed finance minister to the Republic . Such being the state of affairs it must have been with mixed feelings that Louis Napoleon, President of the Re- public, and James Rothschild sat next to one another irk the coach of honor at the opening of the Northern Rail- way of France line to Saint-Quentin . The shouts of \"Vive l'Empereur 1\" with which the president was acclaimed by the crowds were music to his ears, but they roused, bit- ter feelings in the breast of James . There was a third in this company, Jacques Emile Pereire, the Portuguese Jew who had attracted James's attention in connection with the foundation of the railway companies, and who had achieved riches and honor in his service . He had for some time been in touch with Fould, and when he saw the new star rising in the French firmament, he decided that the time had come to sever his connection with his old chief and to make an independent bid for wealth and power by placing himself at the service of the new lord of the land . He too heard with satisfaction the eloquent plaudits of the multitude, reminiscent of a glorious past . Externally, things seemed to be going on as before, and it would have been difficult for the uninitiated to guess what was happening behind the scenes . The president's representative and James Rothschild walked side by side behind Honore de Balzac's coffin on August 20, i85o . During the years of his growing success Balzac had been a constant visitor and friend of the House of Rothschild . He had never been able to get out of the habit of contracting debts, and having made James's acquaintance at Aix-les-Bains,l he naturally borrowed money from him .

The opposition between Changarnier, who controlled the military forces in Paris, and the president became more and more pronounced . The general overestimated his in- fluence and his position in the National Assembly ; his popularity in the capital was declining, while that of the prince was increasing . Herr von Hiibner, the new Aus- trian representative, whose predecessor James continued to lament, attributed this fact partly to the fact that the general's relations with the House of Rothschild were no secret . \"The feeling of popular resentment from which the general is suffering just now,\" he reported on June 13, 2 \"is largely attributable to his intimate relations with the Rothschild family, arising out of a sentiment de cur for Madame James Rothschild . The prince, whom Chan- garnier has on several occasions provoked by holding re- views of the troops without even advising him previously, learned that the said lady was present at them in a mag- nificent equipage, and that the gallant general saluted her before the whole army of Paris .\" Louis Napoleon finally decided, at the instigation of his entourage, to take steps to relieve General Changarnier of his command . The decree of dismissal had lain for four days on the president's desk, when he changed his mind again ; the insincere and short-lived reconciliation was marked by a magnificent review, at which the general marched the troops past the prince . During this period the enthusiastic Bonapartists were working zealously for the reestablishment of the Empire .

The latter attempt had resulted in a sen- tence of twenty years' imprisonment, and he did not re- gain his liberty until the February revolution of 1848 . In- spired with a burning hatred of the Bourbons, he now .became the most zealous champion of the Empire . Louis Napoleon had at once taken him into his con- fidence and employed him on important diplomatic mis- sions ; from December, 1849, until April, 185o, he was at Berlin . Foreign countries, and especially Germany, were dis- turbed to observe the internal developments in France, as that country appeared to be moving toward a second Napoleonic Empire, with all the unfortunate associations connected with that name . Amschel Meyer at Frankfort and his brother Solomon, who had also been staying at Frankfort since he had fled from Vienna on the outbreak of the revolution, shared these misgivings ; they asked their brother James to let them know the truth as to the state of affairs in Paris, and how far they had real cause to feel alarmed . During James's temporary absence, his eldest son Alfons Roths- child answered their letter . He admitted that the con- flicting and exaggerated reports in the newspapers gave distinct ground for alarm. He therefore wished his uncle to know the opinions of well-informed persons who, by reason of their position in the state, exercised a direct and powerful influence upon the course of events . In that category Changarnier was obviously included by implica- tion . Alfons Rothschild expressed the view that there was a unanimous desire to maintain peace and order . The only cause of alarm was connected with Persigny and the imperialist elements . \"M . de Persigny,\" he wrote,' \"the representative of France in Berlin, is to return to his post in the near fu- ture.

You may assure your friends that these schemes in no way enjoy the approval of our Government, of influential members of the Chamber, or of the country itself . France has no desire at all to see Prussia and Austria at war . The idea of German blood be- ing shed by Germans seems criminal, and if the Elysees [the president, Louis Napoleon] should really embark upon such an eccentric policy, our statesmen and parlia- mentarians would certainly refuse to adopt it or carry it through . You may therefore set your minds at rest . . . The Government will follow an entirely conservative policy .\" Changarnier was sanguine too ; he said of Persigny who was somewhat short of stature, that he was busily, engaged in \"turning the little man's head .\" ¢ But the gen- eral was mistaken . Louis Napoleon pursued his course un- swervingly . On January 5, 1851, the president relieved General Changarnier of his military command, although he had failed to carry a vote of censure on the general in the National Assembly . The result was that Louis Napoleon broke with the Assembly ; but the Assembly itself was split by this event, and its majority became divided . Meanwhile the president, who was determined to cut the Gordian knot, had completed his preliminary prepara- tions . By the coup d'etat of December z, 1851, whereby he dissolved the National Assembly, he laid the foundations of his personal power . - Louis Napoleon's most important opponents, number- ing almost twenty-seven thousand persons, were arrested and deported or otherwise dealt with . In this number were included Thiers, Cavaignac, and Changarnier .

The leading positions were mostly occupied by persons whose names were closely as- sociated with the First Empire, the new men being Morny, Flahaut, Persigny, and Fould . These events caused consternation in the house of James Rothschild. Changarnier's fall made an end of all the hopes which he had set on him . \"The arrest of the General,\" Hiibner reported,s \"has brought sorrow into the home of the Rothschilds, but it must be admitted that Baron James is bearing the blow with great resignation . All things considered, the position is exceedingly serious .\" Louis Napoleon submitted the draft of the new consti- tution to the people, and took a plebiscite on his measures which resulted in his obtaining an enormous majority, seven and a half millon votes being cast in favor of his measure and six hundred and fifty thousand against . The people wanted peace, and for them the name of Napoleon symbolized a happy future . By way of countering any misgivings lest, as in the time of the First Empire, the calm which every one longed for should be shattered by war, Louis Napoleon made the statement at Bordeaux, \"The Empire is peace,\" thereby giving open expression to his intention of assuming the imperial crown . James had to make the best of a bad job and adjust himself to the course of events . Louis Napoleon had not shown any overt hostility to James ; he had even, in accordance with his policy of se- curing the support of the Catholics, induced him to grant a loan to the Pope . Moreover, at the beginning of 18 . 52 he had granted a syndicate of bankers, operating under the leadership of the House of Rothschild, the concession for constructing the railway from Paris to Lyons .

The Paris House had scarcely recovered somewhat from the consequences of the February revolu- tion of 1848, when it was faced with these further serious problems . , At this time an event occurred that profoundly af- fected all the members of the Rothschild family. Frau Gudula, widow since 1812 of Meyer Amschel, the founder of the bank, and mother of the five Frankforters, who had witnessed the rise of the House from its begin- ning, died May 7, 1849, at the age of ninety-six . She had seen the passage of the law of February 20, 1849, con- ferring civil and political equality on all members of the state, including the Jews, an event which her husband and her sons had done so much to help bring about . In spite of all the wealth that had come to her family she had never left the little family house in the Jewish quarter, for she feared that fortune would desert the House if she were to forsake the spot where it had first come upon them, during the lifetime of her beloved . husband. She kept her health up to an advanced age, and then, when the first sign of trouble occurred, she was angry with the doctors for not being able to assist her more effec- tively . When Dr . Stiebel replied that it was unfortunately impossible for him to make her younger, she answered in the words that have since become famous : \"I 'do not want you to make me younger ; all I want is to be made older .\" e Until the end of life the venerable woman re- mained saving, simple, unassuming, and deeply religious . Her bridal wreath, carefully preserved under glass, and still occupying its place of honor at Frankfort, was a symbol of the pious life of this fine old woman, so true to her traditions .

The financial supremacy of the House in England had scarcely been affected by the de- velopments on the Continent . Its members were rather concerned to raise themselves socially, for the House of Lords was strongly opposed to the idea of Jewish emanci- pation . Anthony, Nathan's second son and the younger brother of Lionel, who was now head of the English House had, on Sir Robert Peel's recommendation, been created a baronet on January 12, 1847, with the special provision that if he had no heirs male, the title should devolve upon the heirs of his elder brother, Lionel . He lived the life of a wealthy country gentleman, and kept open house at Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire . Meanwhile Lionel, whom the City of London kept electing to Parliament, did not cease his efforts to secure admission to the House, in spite of the obstacles of the Christian oath and the opposi- tion of the House of Lords . His case raised the important question of principle, as to whether Jews should be ad- mitted to the House of Commons or not . On July 25, 185o, a meeting of electors of the City, which had been called at a London tavern, decided that Lionel should go to the House of Commons on the following day and claim his seat . He duly appeared and asked to take the oath on the Old Testament . Sir Robert Inglis, however, the leader of the Tories and the opponent of Jewish emancipation, opposed the suggestion .

On that day he again appeared in the House of Com- mons, and took the oath of loyalty to the queen as well as the oath of supremacy, which recognizes the sovereign as the only head of the church, these two oaths being quite unobjectionable since they closed with the words, \"so help me God .\" In the case of the third oath required by law, however, the oath of abjuration, which deals with the descendants of James II, 7 and is still required, and which closes with the words, \"on the true faith of a Christian,\""},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 267 Nathan substituted the formula, \"so help me God,\" add- ing that these words were more binding on his conscience than any other . He had taken up the pen to sign his name in the register of admitted members, when the Speaker told him to withdraw . A fresh election was demanded on the ground that Baron Rothschild had refused to take the oath in the prescribed form . An amendment that he should be re- garded as an actual member of the House was lost by a majority of 104 votes . The matter aroused great excite- ment, and there was keen public discussion . The position was that any change in the formula in the oath of abjura- tion could be brought about only by an act of Parliament passed by both Houses, although the oath was quite re- dundant and had a purely historical significance . If, how- ever, the House of Commons had agreed, after all that had occurred, to his taking his seat, Rothschild could have sat in it from that day . By doing so, however, he would have made himself liable to an action by any person in any one of the three principal courts of justice, and to a penalty of five hundred pounds for each day that he had sat in the House, the fine being payable to the person who brought the action .' Although at a later date a majority of the House of Commons actually voted that Lionel should be admitted, the bill was rejected by the House of Lords, and some years passed before the matter was finally settled . Through his brother Nathaniel and through occasional visits, Lionel kept in close touch with his uncle James in Paris . In view of the developments of events in France, James felt that he ought to discuss the situation with his other brothers and nephews in Frankfort and Vienna, and accordingly set out on a journey to these cities in August, 1852 . At Vienna James was received in audience by the Em- peror Francis Joseph, who asked him what was happen- ing in France . The emperor informed James, as Austrian"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"268 \t The Reign o f the House o f Rothschild consul-general in Paris, that he cherished the most friendly feelings for Louis Napoleon and asked him to pass this on . The duty of communicating this message, non-committal though it might be, was a welcome one to James, since he would be coming to the president, who was on the verge of achieving the imperial dignity, with pleasant words from a \"legitimate\" potentate, and would thereby be enabled to improve his unfortunate position in Paris . After Solomon's flight, the Vienna branch of the House of Rothschild was without a real head, being carried on by managers and secretaries . Later on, Solomon's eldest son Anselm, who was forty-nine years old at the time, frequently visited Vienna, and although he was Austrian consul-general at Frankfort, he took over the control of the business, constantly coming and going between the two towns . When the reaction set in, in Austria and the aged Metternich returned, it became easier for the House of Rothschild to regain their footing in Vienna . The family wealth was unimpaired . Society and the state still wanted their money ; the aristocracy returned to power, and closely guarded the throne . Old connections, from the time of Metternich, which had been only temporarily severed, were resumed, and the House of Vienna was soon reestablished in its former respected position . When James returned to Paris from Vienna, there was an unpleasant surprise awaiting him . His opponents had succeeded in entirely winning over to their side Louis Napoleon, who had very little understanding for financial matters, and they were already venturing upon a move which should take the financial power in France entirely out of the hands of the Rothschilds . They had planned to found a great rival bank, which should receive exten- sive support from the state, and in which-this was the essential point-Fould, Pereire, and their retainers should play the leading parts . The roles had been cleverly al- lotted . The highly gifted and assiduous Pereires with"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 269 their tireless energy, who had been schooled by Roths- child, were ostensibly to be the founders . Achille Fould was to stand aloof, so as to be able to hold office under the state, but his intimacy and influence with the new ruler would be his highly important contribution to the capi- tal of the new venture . With the support of the ruler and of the state, they hoped that their business would succeed . There was an element of Saint-Simonism and socialism for decorative effect, and indeed this was not a matter en- tirely of phrases and theories such as the democratization of banking, for some new ideas of real value were cer- tainly developed . The fundamental idea was that the state should be made independent of rich individual bankers, and that even the smallest savings of its citizens should be canalized into a gigantic reservoir, the new bank, which would distribute them as and where capital was required .\" Fould won over his s overeign . b y the pleasing prospect of being able to make himself independent of Rothschild, who at heart was an Orleanist, by the proposal that any loan for which the necessity should arise should be is- sued in small quantities direct to the public, and thus escape the Rothschilds . The phrase souscription nationale coupled with the idea of independence of the anti-Napoleonic Rothschilds entirely won over Louis Napoleon, and Fould and Pereire's hopes soared so high that they already saw them- selves in control of a monopoly for the whole credit organization of France . Thus they hoped to drive the Rothschilds entirely out of the field . When James perceived this danger he did everything he could to warn the President of the Republic and to open his eyes . He sent Louis Napoleon a memorandum written in his own hand, in which he set out the dangers of all these innovations and, prophesied that the new ven- ture would come to a bad end . It was an easy matter for Fould to make it clear to Louis"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"270 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Napoleon that this could all be explained by James's hos- tility to the formation of a new Napoleonic empire . On November 20, 1852, the memorandum constituting the new company was actually published in the Moniteur . It was given the name Credit Mobilier . The two brothers Pereire and the Foulds held the majority of the shares, each couple holding over eleven thousand, out of the or- iginal capital of forty thousand shares . The name of Louis Napoleon's confidential adviser, Achille Fould did not appear, the shares standing in the name of his brother Benoit, who was head of the bank B . L . Fould and Fould- Oppenheim . Associated with the founders were the names of decorative personages belonging to the aristocracy, such as the Princess von Leuchtenberg and the Duke of Galliera, and also the Bank of Torlonia in Rome and Solomon, Heine of Hamburg, Heinrich Heine's uncle . Altogether a total of 120,000 shares at Soo francs a share was issued, so that even the smallest capitalists could take part in the venture, which indeed they proceeded to do . France was at the time living in a kind of fever evoked by the name of Napoleon . Everyone hoped that in ac- cordance with the promises of the new ruler, peace and tranquillity were assured for a long period and that it would therefore be easy to grow rich without much effort . The share which anyone could easily take in the new ven- ture seemed the obvious way of achieving the desired result . One day after the publication of the memorandum which called the Credit Mobilier into existence, a plebis- cite yielded almost 8,000,ooo votes in favor of an imperial constitution, against 250,000 votes on the other side . On November 23, the first day on which the shares of the Credit Mobilier were quoted on the bourse, the securities, whose nominal value was Soo francs, were quoted at i,ioo, and four days later they rose to i,6oo . James Rothschild watched these developments ironically, but with a certain amounf of concealed fear . His warnings passed unheeded ."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 271 He naturally took no part whatever in the undertaking, and in his heart declared relentless war upon it . The contest, he now realized, would be no easy one, for behind the new undertaking stood the name of the head of the state, who on December 2, 1852, was proclaimed Napo- leon III, by the grace of God and the will of the people Emperor of the French . James was able to derive a certain secret satisfaction from the fact that, as early as December 31 of that year the shares of the Credit Mobilier were quoted at only 875 francs . The shares had become as dangerous as any securi- ties on the bourse, and were the sport of unsound specula- tion . Not everyone had been dazzled by these developments . There were other contemporaries of James who perceived the dangers lurking behind these financial experiments . \"Thanks to the new concern,\" one such skeptic wrote sar- castically to Vienna, 10 \"the more favored people on the Paris Bourse at any rate will be enabled for a time to speculate with every prospect of success, without touching a sou .\" Thus owing to the support of the authorities, new men had come into the control of financial- affairs . Not only Fould and Pereire, but some highly unsavory elements as well, had come into the foreground, which sought to make hay by a skilful combination of business and journalism . There was in particular a certain Jules Mires, originally a poor wretch from the lowest class in Bordeaux, where he hit upon the idea of publishing a paper which, in addi- tion to certain items of news, should contain a daily list of persons who had died in the town . In each case the ill- ness of which the person had died was stated, as well as the name of the doctor who had attended him . This caused annoyance to the younger members of the pro- fession, and they paid Mires the sum of 25,000 francs to cease publishing the paper . With this money Mires migrated to Paris, where he"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"272 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild founded a railway paper on the same system, calling it the \"Journal des Chemins-de-fers .\" By means of both true and fabricated disclosures he alarmed the public and pro- duced consternation among the companies, which were forced to pay for his silence . In addition he acquired so much wealth by speculation that he soon achieved a place among the leading Paris financiers, who associated with so many important persons . The new powers and enterprises had not yet reached the stage of being able to compete with the Rothschilds outside France . Everyone, even the Papal States, still ap- plied to the Rothschilds when in need of money . During Napoleon's presidency Rome had been the scene of dra- matic events . It was hoped in Italy that the nationalist and liberal Pope Pius IX would join the general movement against Austria . He, however, feared the spirit of anarchy fomented by the revolution, and any too great extension of democracy, while he also hesitated to enter upon open hostilities against Catholic Austria . The result was to produce the exciting November days in Rome, when the Pope's palace was besieged by the mob, and the Holy Father was compelled under threats to appoint a radical ministry . Thereupon the head of Christendom fled in dis- guise to Gaeta in Neapolitan territory, whence he pro- tested against any deeds of violence in Rome while the Roman Republic was being set up in the Residence of the Papal States . _ On February 20, 1849, Pius IX applied to the Catholic Powers, France, Austria, Spain, and Naples and Sicily, begging them to assist him with their arms to regain his temporal power . Louis Napoleon, who at that time wished to win the support of Catholics throughout the world with a view to his ultimate imperial schemes, did actually land troops in April, 1849, to march on Rome . After various vicissitudes the French occupied the city on July 3 and re- instated the papal government . Meanwhile the Pope was living at Gaeta in wretched circumstances and was in"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Count Camillo Cavour"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 273 great need of money . This was particularly necessary for his return, since he could not reenter his capital with empty hands . The Pope accordingly entered into nego- tiations with a company of French capitalists, but it soon transpired that the bank which was backing these people had not the necessary funds at its disposal . Pius IX was therefore advised to apply again to the House of Roths- child, whose international connections were such that, even so soon after the revolutionary events that had occurred throughout Europe, they controlled the neces- sary amount of money . The papal envoy at Naples accordingly got into touch with Carl Rothschild, but the terms offered by the latter seemed to him to be wholly unacceptable . As has already been pointed out, there could be no question of the Pope returning to Rome until the loan was settled . Carl made it a condition for granting the loan that the gates and walls of the ghetto should be abolished, that Jews should be allowed to live where they pleased in the Papal States, and that all special taxes and separate forms of procedure for dealing with Jews in the courts should be abolished . The secretary of the Jewish community at Rome had come to Naples to discuss these requests . Carl also de- manded a mortgage on the ecclesiastical estates as security since, as his son put it to the Austrian minister at Naples, Count Moritz Esterhazy, it was \"difficult in view of the complete absence of any material or moral guaranty of- fered by the present papal government, to enter into a transaction involving such a large sum of money without a mortgage .\" The first conditions were at once definitely rejected by the Pope, who refused even to consider such demands as conditions . He stated that he would prefer to suffer an indefinite period of financial misery rather than incur the reproach of having subordinated higher to temporal in- terests . The second set of conditions seemed to Carl Roths- child at Gaeta to have a greater chance of being accepted ."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"274 . \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The negotiations proceeded actively at Naples, but finally Carl declared, since the ecclesiastical authorities were strongly opposing the mortgage as well, that he had ex- ceeded the instructions of his House, and that James Rothschild in Paris should be approached with a view to continuing the negotiations . Pius IX accordingly sent a request direct to the French government, asking them to use their influence with the House of Rothschild . When the papal nuncio transmitted this request, both Louis Napoleon personally and the Paris cabinet approached James with the request that he would offer the Pope acceptable conditions .\" James de- cided that the House did not stand to lose much, since the, papal government was just about to be reinstated, and its continuance in office would be guaranteed by the Catholic Powers . James also mentioned the wishes of the Jews in Rome, and referred to the abolition of the ghetto walls and the question of extraordinary taxes and restrictions on their liberty of movement . Such conditions affected the Pope unpleasantly, as they constituted an obvious interference in the internal affairs of his state . However, the Pope did not wish the negotia- tions to break down on account of these demands . James was accordingly informed that the concessions which he was asking for his co-religionists were to a large extent already in force, and that his Holiness could not expose himself to the suspicion of having granted concessions af- fecting questions of religion on account of the financial difficulties from which he was suffering .\" He then gave a written assurance to James, through Monsignor Forna- rini, the papal nuncio in Paris, 13 to the effect that the Holy Father had the best intentions with regard to the Jews in his States and that the nuncio was authorized to repeat to him that the Holy Father would not withdraw his promises in that matter . This also involved an edict regarding the abolition of the ghetto . The final difficulties had thus been disposed of, and the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 275 money was paid by the Rothschilds into the papal treasury on very favorable terms . 14 The final obstacle to the return of his Holiness to Rome was removed . After the satisfactory conclusion of these difficult mat- ters the Pope took his leave of the King of Naples, who had offered him a refuge in these trying times, and on April 12, i850, he made his entry into Rome . The Rothschilds had therefore provided the money for the return of the Pope, without having secured a formal assurance regarding the betterment of the lot of their co- religionists in anything but the most general terms . Carl Rothschild went to Rome shortly afterward, and on this occasion he again heard the most painful lamentations about the lot of the Jews, which, in spite of everything, had not been improved . He therefore decided to ask Prince Schwarzenberg to intervene with the Holy See . \"During my last stay in Rome,\" he wrote to the prime minister, 16 \"I was brought, both by personal observation and by hearing the representations of the leaders of the Jewish Community there, to the conviction that their lot is a very hard one, and in view of their pressing requests I was unable to refrain from promising that I would use such feeble influence as I might possess, with such influ- ential persons as may be willing to listen to me favorably, to secure the betterment of their lot .\" He went on to state that he and his whole family had the most keen and lively sympathy for the sufferings of that community, and he begged the imperial government, which offered such a moving example in the way it granted its equal paternal protection to all confessions alike, to use its ascendancy and its powerful influence with the Holy See on their behalf . Schwarzenberg instructed Count Esterhazy to make representations in Rome, but it was a long time before the matter was settled . On receiving a letter of complaint from the Jewish Community in Rome, 16 James also applied to the Austrian government .\" He suggested that the Pope was not aware"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"276 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild that the Jews had again been confined to the ghetto, and subjected to every possible kind of restriction . Esterhazy was again . instructed to discuss the matter in a friendly way with the Pope, and this was done on several further occasions ; the reason being that the Austrian government was just at that time negotiating with the Rothschilds for a sterling loan . In spite of having resumed its good relations with Aus- tria, the House of Rothschild was constantly engaged in loan negotiations with Sardinia, the enemy of the Papal government . That state was suffering acutely from the consequences of the unfortunate war with Austria which, after Radetzky's successes at Mortara and Novara, had cost King Albert his crown . As the king felt that fortune was against him, his son Victor Emanuel had to go the hard road of concluding a peace with Austria which was signed in Milan on August 6 . He succeeded in avoiding any surrender of territory, but Austria required a heavy war indemnity for the payment of which the state of Sardinia had to incur a heavy load of debt and enter the international financial markets as an applicant for loans . At that time the banker Giovanni Nigra was Sardinia's finance minister ; although only moderately endowed with financial gifts, he had dared at this difficult moment to take over the direction of the state finances . He was at that time on friendly terms with Count Camillo di Cavour, who did not then hold any public office, although he was already a member of Parliament . It was with him, his authority in such matters being already recognized, that Nigra mostly discussed economic questions . Even before the conclusion of peace, the finance min- ister had got into touch with Rothschild, who had asked him what would be the amount of the war indemnity de- manded by Austria . But it was not until after the con- clusion of peace that serious negotiations were started . James came from Paris to Turin to conduct them with Nigra, and also came into touch with Cavour . Rothschild"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 277 and Cavour once dined together with Nigra . 1 S James was at first somewhat suspicious ; he asked for information re- garding the internal arrangements of Sardinia's finances and it was not until he had been convinced that the state of Sardinia had achieved clarity and order in its own affairs that he became more amenable . Cavour expressed the following opinion on Roths- child : 19 \"He is really most anxious to have serious deal- ings with this country, and he has repeatedly told me that in spite of everything he regards the State of Pied- mont as established on a firmer basis than that of Austria .\" James had been brought to this opinion by the experi- ences of his brother Solomon at Vienna and by events in Hungary . Nigra also carried on negotiations with James Rothschild independently of Cavour, who wished to leave as small a share as possible of the loan to the Italian bankers. Cavour had hoped that ten to twelve millions would be allotted to the Turin and Geneva bankers, part of which amount he had wished to be reserved for the Swiss banker de la Rue, who was a friend of his and in close business relations with him . On the evening of October 4, 1 849, Nigra had a long conference with Roths- child, in the course of which he allowed himself to be persuaded to reserve for the Italian bankers only 8,ooo, coo out of the 62,000,000 franc loan . Cavour, who knew nothing of this, went to Rothschild the same evening to ask him for 6oo,ooo francs' worth of bonds for de la Rue, or rather to inform him that the banker would underwrite that amount . \"The old Jew,\" Cavour wrote de la Rue '20 replied with a smile that you were acting very wisely, and that it would be better for you to buy rentes in Turin and Genoa than in Paris . I thought that everything was going through splendidly, for it was not until afterward that Bombrini 21 informed me of Nigra's defection .

Nigra 22 left me out of the negotiations, only calling me in when the agreement was to be signed . I flatter myself that if I had been in his place I should have got better terms . I had worked out a scheme through which it would have been possible to dispense with Rothschild . I used this scheme to counter some of his demands, but could not alter the basis of the agreement, which had been definitely fixed . Nigra's great mistake has been that he has not had enough confidence in the capacity of our own banks to take up the loan . . . . This morning a Herr von Landau 28 called to offer me on behalf of Rothschild as many rentes `,au prix coutant' as I wanted . As you may imagine, I refused this offer, but it gave me some idea of the way business is done in most of the European cab- inets .\" A few days later, the loan had been fully subscribed 24 It was so popular with the Italian people that the finance ministry was besieged by a mob who positively fought to get rid of their money . Turin alone could have absorbed far more than nine millions . \"Nigra is being roundly abused [on jette les hauts cris],\" wrote Cavour ; \"the poor fellow had the best in- tentions in the world and honestly believed that the coun- try would be satisfied with eight millions . I am convinced that if the loan had been opened on the first of this month, and if, as I suggested, bills on London and Paris had been accepted in payment, we could have dispensed with the Rothschilds .\" We see, although he had no official position, how great an interest Cavour was already taking in the financial business of the state and how much he resented the fact"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 279 that his country had come to be so dependent on the House of Rothschild . He had already made up his mind, if he should ever have anything to say in the matter, to make a radical change from this state of affairs . Nevertheless the loan was a great success for Sardinia, and the country had reason to congratulate itself on its relations with the Rothschild bank . The loan, however, did not suffice to relieve Sardinia of all her pressing obligations, or to cover the deficit in the budget . Nigra therefore had to look about for _a further loan ; but on this occasion his unofficial financial adviser Cavour meant to keep a closer watch over his inexperi- enced friend and fellow countryman . \"Nigra is con- stantly corresponding with Rothschild,\" Cavour wrote at the beginning of the year i 850 . 26 \"I shall see to it that he is not bamboozled .\" Rothschild, who had already made up his mind to un- derwrite the second loan, assumed an attitude of indiffer- ence toward Nigra, in order to secure better conditions, and he made every effort to insure that the first loan should be quoted as low as possible on the bourse, so that he would not have to offer too high a rate for the second . The slump in the bonds and Rothschild's apparent re- luctance greatly disconcerted Nigra . It never even oc- curred to him that an effort might be made to raise the loan through another house . \"If the bonds refuse to rise in value,\" Cavour wrote,\" \"it is Nigra who is to blame, since, as he owes Rothschild 21,000,000 he cannot make up his mind to enter into ne- gotiations for the new loan . You will understand that un- til the baron has definitely secured it, he will continue to depress the market.

Nigra is extraordinarily nervous, and I cannot understand why ; for if Rothschild takes the trouble to come here, he will certainly not leave with- out having concluded his loan, even if it costs him one per cent more to do so .\" Cavour was at the time keeping away from Turin, al- though he was already generally regarded as a candidate for the ministry and had had occasion to enter into lengthy discussions on this matter . That being the position, if he had taken a personal part in the loan negotiations, he would have given the impression of already acting as finance minister, without actually being, a minister . \"I have prolonged my absence from Turin,\" Cavour stated, 28 \"in order not to have to associate with Rothschild . I felt that it would have been hardly fitting for me, in view of my present abnormal position, to interfere in the loan negotiations .\" On the very day on which Cavour wrote this letter, the Marquis d'Azeglio, Sardinia's prime minister and minis- ter for foreign affairs, summoned Cavour, and asked him to accept the portfolio for agriculture, trade, and ship- ping . Cavour assented, although, as he himself said, 21' he knew nothing about shipping . Having now, as a minister, become a member of the cabinet, this brilliant man hesi- tated no longer to intervene in matters of finance and in Nigra's department, although he was naturally unable as yet to exercise a determining influence in financial mat- ters .

Cavour conceived the plan of selling these securi- ties in Vienna and Frankfort, and he asked de la Rue to discuss this suggestion with his business friends in those towns, Goldschmidt and Sina . \"It is a business,\" the min- ister wrote, $° \"that ought to appeal to them . I believe that they would be very pleased to steal a march on Roths- child, and it would delight me to put a spoke in the wheel of that Jew who is cutting our throats .\" Cavour's influence, however, was not as great as he could have wished . Nigra was still minister of finance, and the bonds were not immediately issued . Nigra was not equal to his task ; the burden of debt and the deficit con- tinued to increase, and the state's finances fell more and more under the influence of the Rothschilds . \"I am greatly concerned about the financial position,\" Cavour wrote to the prime minister at the end of March, 1851 ; 81 \"Nigra is shockingly incompetent .\" After he had taken office, Cavour's opposition to the finance minister became more and more pronounced ; it culminated in Cavour offering to resign during the dis- cussion of commercial agreements with England and Bel- gium, if Nigra should insist upon adhering to his scheme .

Cavour now had his reward for having maintained his personal freedom and independence with regard to the Rothschilds . He fully realized that the only way of obtaining favorable terms in the future was to prove to the Rothschilds that they had no monopoly of state loans, and that the state was not so entirely dependent upon them as they had been able to assume under Nigra's administration . Cavour meant to avail himself of the English market, and for this purpose he applied as early as April 25, 185 1, six days after his appointment as minister of finance to Sardinia's minister in London, the Marquis Emmanuel d'Azeglio . \"We must,\" he wrote, 82 \"at all costs extricate ourselves from the painful position in which we are placed with regard to the House of Rothschild .

In July of that year Cavour did in fact succeed in concluding the loan with Hambro .

Cavour now felt more friendly to the House of Roths- child, and allowed them to transfer to Vienna the six million of war indemnity which were still payable to Austria, \"for,\" he wrote, \"it has hitherto been the Roths- childs who have paid for us and collected for Austria . I think it will be well, in order not entirely to alienate that great financial power, to pay this last instalment of our misfortunes through them .\"\" But the Rothschilds were exceedingly angry at Ca- vour's action, and they meant to show that they could not be easily trifled with . They did everything possible to de- press the price of earlier loans, which they had got rid of, and at the beginning of September, Sardinian rentes were in fact quoted at a very heavy discount on the Paris Bourse . Although this development was not entirely un- expected, Cavour was not pleased . \"I was more annoyed than alarmed,\" Cavour wrote to Revel, \"at the slump in our bonds .

The House of Rothschild thereupon again approached the Piedmont government, James sending his son Alfons to Turin to offer Count Cavour a loan of 40,000,000 francs (2,000,00o rentes) at the extraordinarily favorable rate of 92 . Cavour did not intend yet to issue a further loan, but he was delighted by the high figure offered by the House of Rothschild, which he rightly regarded as attributable to the success of his move in England .\" He laid the pro- posal before the Chamber with the observation that he would be able to carry on until the early month of 1853 without a loan . The Chamber accordingly, not wishing the country's debt to be prematurely increased, rejected the offer in spite of all its advantages . Meanwhile, after a short interval of retirement, Cavour became prime minister on November 4, 1852, retaining the portfolio of finance . During the early days of January, 1853, the Piedmont treasury, as had been expected, again felt the need of money, and Cavour decided to sell the 2,000,000 of rentes which Nigra had reserved out of the loan of 1851 . James, who had always wanted to underwrite this por- tion of the loan which he had handled, did not hesitate to travel to Turin . He offered 88, whereas Cavour asked 95, and in the end he agreed to 94 .50, that is, four points above the highest price that Hambro had ever reached .\""},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"286 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild This money, however, did not suffice, and Cavour was forced to consider a new loan, which this time he intended to be a three per cent one . Cavour had no objection to the House of Rothschild in principle ; he merely wanted to get the best possible conditions for his country, and con- trived skilfully to play off one financier against another . Hambro felt that he was too weak to undertake a second loan on a large scale, and Count Corti reported accord- ingly to Cavour . Cavour instructed him to go to Paris and negotiate with Fould and see whether the Credit Mobil- ier, who were in keen rivalry with the Rothschilds, would not be prepared to underwrite the loan . He sent Corti an introductory letter, which the latter handed to Fould on January 21, 1853 . Corti stated to Fould that Cavour was absolutely free to negotiate the loan where the interests of his country would be best served, and that he would therefore conclude it where he could get the best terms . \"I believe,\" Fould replied ' 42 \"that you will find the market in Paris and London well disposed to your coun- try . The slump which has again occurred lately is a con- sequence of the deliberate maneuvers of Rothschild, and of the fact that everybody is sure that you intend to issue a further loan .\" Corti's view was that Fould had the highest opinion of Sardinia and was very much inclined to underwrite the loan en bloc . On the following day, Corti again called on Fould, who talked to him about his syndicate (the Credit Mobilier), saying how marvelous it was, and that its like could not be found anywhere else . He then asked about terms, and Corti mentioned the figure 70 ; Fould said that was too dear, and that he must insist upon better terms . Nevertheless, it was apparent that he was most keenly anxious to underwrite the loan . 43 Meanwhile Cavour had received Corti's letter . \"My dear Count,\" he replied, \"I have read with great interest the report of your conversation with M .

Fould had once said to him with some heat, \"Cavour must choose between me and him .\" The French financier was particularly excited when he heard that Alfons Rothschild had again set out for Turin ; and he had every reason to be, for while Cavour was instructing his envoy Corti to negotiate with Benja- min Fould and the firm of Fould and Oppenheim, the minister himself was negotiating in Turin with Roths- child . At the beginning of February, statements appeared in several Paris papers to the effect, that the new Sardinian loan had been already concluded with the House of Roths- child. In a state of high excitement, Fould asked Corti the meaning of this and the latter truthfully replied that he had no knowledge of it .\" Fould's information, how- ever, was not derived solely from Rothschild himself who, without suspecting that Fould was also negotiating with Sardinia, asked him whether he would care to have a share in a Sardinian loan, saying that in that case he would be prepared to transfer a portion to him . Fould declined the offer, stating that he wished to retain his freedom of action in that matter, in order to be able to act on his own account . 47 In dealing with Corti he showed a growing keenness to take over the loan .

Fould naturally did not reply, but he was to pay dearly for hav- ing given himself away . Rothschild still endeavored, through the finance minister M . Bineau, to ascertain the price that Fould had asked, and the price that he had been offered, and then immediately sent his son to Turin . Luigi Corti called on Fould on February 27, informing him that Cavour's price was 73, whereupon Fould pretended to be highly disconcerted, and made his first counter offer of 66 .66 .4 8 Luigi Corti thereupon said that that figure was quite impossible, and that he ought to make a reasonable offer, as Rothschild was in Turin, and prepared to snap the business up under his nose . Young Rothschild had in- deed actually arrived at Turin on the evening of Febru- ary 26, 1853, although Cavour had not invited his visit in any way . The minister, Cavour, was advised of his ar- rival by the representative of the House of Rothschild, G . Landau . The news stiffened Cavour's resistance to an extraordinary degree . \"My dear Count,\" the prime minister wrote to Luigi Corti the same day, \"M .

You will appreciate the fact that Fould's competition has been worth some millions to us .\" 51 Cavour thereupon telegraphed to Corti 62 on March 3 that he had come to terms with Rothschild, as the latter had offered so much better terms than Fould . Corti broke off the negotiations and left Paris without having had time to follow out Cavour's playful suggestion . In later years he often enjoyed telling how cleverly Cavour had played the various greedy financiers off against one an- other . The great statesman in later years, too, was guarded and cynical in his dealings with the House of Rothschild, and was always afraid \"d'etre juive par Rothschild,\" as he put it .\" Corti's services were warmly recognized by Cavour . \"I thank you, my dear Count,\" he wrote to him, \"for the manner in which you have carried through the task with which you were entrusted. Although the agreement was not concluded through you, you contributed very largely to its success .\" Through the skilful manner in which he had handled the problem, Cavour, the new star on the political hori- zon, and the genius of the unification of Italy, had proved himself the financial equal, nay the superior, in his contest with the Rothschilds . At about the same time, Bismarck, the statesman of the unification of Germany, came into contact with the Frankfort Rothschild through his appointment as Prus- sian minister to the Diet at Frankfort, since the Roths- childs, as bankers to the Federation, looked after its financial affairs .

It is true that the nation was by no means satisfied with the ineffectiveness of the Diet in internal affairs, while it was disgusted with its impotence abroad . The revolutions that convulsed Europe in 1848 and 1849 at once upset the tranquil working of the Diet . The idea of national unity took a strong hold upon Germany, and after the episode of the National Assembly, Prussia and Austria each came forward with the intention of assum- ing the leadership of Germany . While the Prussian gov- ernment summoned its supporters to Erfurt, Austria called upon all German states to restore and reopen the Frankfort Diet, as it had been constituted before the revolution . Austria had triumphantly dealt with the ris ings in Italy, in Hungary, and in Vienna, the heart of the monarchy, and her new leader, Prince Schwarzen- berg, proceeded to turn his whole attention to regaining Austria's old dominating position in Germany . In this he could count on the support of Russia, who had shown in the case of Hungary that she was prepared to come to the rescue with armed force in suppressing revolution . At that time Prussia's military strength was not sufficient to enable her to put a recovered Austria in her place . She was therefore compelled on March 29, i 85o, to yield to the humiliating demands of Schwarzenberg . One year later, the German Diet of 18i5 was restored, and Prussia also notified her intention of reentering the Diet in May, 1851 . Amschel Meyer Rothschild had maintained an attitude of cautious reserve, as he watched the vicissitudes of the struggle for the settlement of the German constitution that was being carried on in his native town . Although he was banker to the Confederation, and therefore inti- mately concerned in its destiny, he did his utmost to remain aloof from all complications, being in 185o already seventy-seven years old . Efforts were constantly being made to draw him into politics . He was asked, for instance, to finance political newspapers, but the House"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 291 of Rothschild refused to have anything to do with such proposals . If they needed papers they always had recourse to individual editors, who had the desired articles pub- lished ; but they were never tempted to publish a paper themselves, in which they would have had to identify themselves with a definite political point of view and a clearly defined program . Amschel Meyer accordingly replied on March 20, 1849, to a proposal of this nature, that his House had \"always objected to taking part in the foundation of political papers,\" and he therefore sin- cerely regretted that he was unable to fall in with the suggestion . Prussia's reentry into the Diet called for the appoint- ment of a representative . On May io, Otto von Bismarck, who was appointed to this office at the age of barely thirty-six, arrived at Frankfort . Although personally he shared the conservative . sentiments of Austria, he was inspired by a presentiment of the future greatness of his country, and determined in spite of all that had occurred, to secure for Prussia the place in Germany that was her due, and if necessary to fight for it . Bismarck's first impression of Frankfort was not a favorable one ; he found it \"deadly dull,\" s4 and his new profession of diplomacy was anything but congenial to him . He described the social life of the delegates as con- sisting of nothing but \"suspicious spying on one another\" ; \"no one,\" he wrote, \"would believe how much charlatan- ism and self-importance there is about this diplomacy .\"' Bismarck was looking for lodgings, and meanwhile was seeing callers in a plain furnished room in the town . One of the first to call on him was old Amschel Meyer Rothschild, who wished to get on good terms both with the representative of Prussia and with Count Thun, the representative of Austria . Bismarck regarded Rothschild as a curiosity, for he was little impressed with exclusive society in Frankfort . \"You need not be afraid of high society here,\" 66 Bis-"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"292 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild marck wrote to his wife . \"As far as money goes, Roths- child stands highest, and if you were to take all their money away from the others, they would not stand par- ticularly high .

In order to give Bismarck no chance of refusal, Rothschild's first invita- tion to dinner was for a very long time ahead . Bismarck replied that he would come if he were still alive . \"My answer,\" Bismarck wrote to his wife,\" \"affected Amschel so profoundly that he has told everybody about it, and goes about saying, `Why shouldn't he live?

Bismarck had still failed to find lodgings that would be within his means . Amschel offered him an ele- gant Rothschild villa some way out, on the Bockenheim Road . 87 ,On October i Bismarck moved into the house at q .o Bockenheim Road, which as a matter of fact did not belong to the Rothschilds, but whose first two floors had been used by Carl Meyer von Rothschild on the occasion of his second visit to Frankfort . No sooner had these personal matters been settled than politics engaged Bismarck's full attention . The defeat of Prussia at Olmiitz burned in his soul . He and the leading men at Berlin were at heart convinced that Prussia had the right to seize the leadership of Germany ; to establish her ascendancy over Germany . The fact that Austria in- disputably enjoyed the formal leadership at Frankfort made Bismarck all the more determined to watch over Prussia's interests . It became apparent that Vienna intended to use the Diet, the majority of whose states were in favor of Aus- tria, for the purpose of outvoting Prussia ; but Bismarck meant at once to contest Austria's leading position as far as this was possible . The following remark, which he made shortly after his appointment, was characteristic of the man . Let him but have his way, he said, and he would return with Austria's scalp . 68 Bismarck was reserved and somewhat suspicious in his attitude toward the House of Rothschild, since he felt that he had reason to believe that the bank was more attached to Austria than to any other federal state . The Rothschilds had at that time been in Berlin on financial matters,\" and had expressed a wish to be granted the title of \"Bankers to the Prussian Court .\" The govern- ment at Berlin asked Bismarck to express his opinion on this request, and the latter replied that in his view the"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"294 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Rothschilds were adequately rewarded by their pecuniary profit for any possible efforts they might have made in the interests of Prussia . Thereupon the proposal was dropped . Bismarck was annoyed because Austria took the chair at the Diet, and her representative carried the title Pre- siding Delegate . The opposition between Prussia and Austria was constantly making itself felt, and questions of minor importance were often the occasion for a struggle for prestige .\" Such a question arose on the sub- ject of the fleet . The central authority at Frankfort had created a German fleet in 1848, to which Prussia contrib- uted financially, while Austria did not . It had become necessary to find further funds, and it fell to the Presiding Delegate, Count Thun, to bring the matter before the Assembly . An assessment of the states was to be made, but Prussia protested against any further expenditure as long as certain states were in arrears in respect of the earlier instalments due . The matter dragged on until the requirements of the fleet became so pressing that some- thing had to be done . Toward the end of the year, Bis- marck had almost made up his mind to agree to the assessment, when he received peremptory instructions from Manteuffel to protest against it and immediately to return to Berlin . The Prussian delegate left for Berlin on January 3, 1852, and in accordance with the estab- lished practice he asked his opponent, Count Thun, who was exceedingly angry at the attitude of the Prussian government and the difficulties which it was constantly making, to represent him in his absence, anomalous though the position would be . Now the officers and men of the fleet required their pay . \"It was essential,\" as Thun observed, 81 \"as speedily as possible to see that the deficit was covered, unless we were prepared to face a mutiny on the ships .\" Thun accordingly summoned a meeting of the Diet for January 7, when the Prussian envoy, Bismarck, would be"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 295 absent ; and after a lively 'debate it was decided to ask the Rothschilds for a loan of 260,000 gulden to meet these requirements, on the security of the federal moneys depos- ited with the bank . Thun, who proposed the motion, had simultaneously to vote against it as representative of Prussia . Bismarck and the Prussian government were kept telegraphically informed of what was happening by the counselor of legation, Wetzel . The day after the resolution was carried Count Thun proceeded to enter into confidential negotiations with Rothschild, 82 to determine the conditions on which the necessary money could be advanced . The banker was prepared to grant the loan for six months, at 4%, with- out charging commission, merely expressing the wish that he should not be required to put the terms into writ- ing, as this might convey the impression that he wanted to take advantage of the unfortunate position in which the fleet was placed . The Diet therefore immediately agreed to the neces- sary advance of 6o,ooo gulden, and addressed a letter to the House of Rothschild, asking them to pay this amount . Meanwhile Bismarck telegraphed on January 9 to Wetzel, instructing him to protest to Amschel Meyer, and on the loth he confirmed these instructions in detail, in the following message : \"Prussia does not regard the contemplated payment of money as a Federal loan ; the Federal moneys deposited with Rothschild cannot legiti- mately be diverted from the object to which they had been originally assigned . Register your protest with Rothschild against this money being spent or appropri- ated . We maintain our right of action against the House of Rothschild for any damage that we or the Federation may suffer through such payment . Rothschild is not required to obey the President's instructions in loan matters .\" 88 When, on the evening of the loth, Wetzel met Count Thun, who was \"taking a breath of air after a hard and"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"296 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild trying day,\" Wetzel told him that he had intended to come and see him 84 in order confidentially to inform him that he had received instructions from Berlin to bring pressure to bear upon Rothschild to refuse to advance money for the fleet . Thun replied to him that this was Wetzel's affair, and that although he had the highly unpleasant duty of representing Prussia in the Diet at that time, he was not responsible for her actions, but only her mouthpiece . He added that he was doubtful whether Rothschild would listen to Prussia's views, since he had received his instructions from the presiding officer in the prescribed form, in accordance with a resolution of the Diet, and he was not to take cognizance of the negotiations at the meeting of the Diet, or of differences of opinion between the various members . Wetzel said to Thun that this was his opinion also, and that for this reason it was all the more painful for him to carry out his instructions . Whereupon they parted . As Thun expected that such action on the part of the Prussian delegation could not fail to produce some effect upon Rothschild, he asked one of his attaches, the Baron von Nell, to call on Rothschild on some pretext or another on the morning of the loth, and endeavor to ascertain his attitude . Herr von Nell reported to Count Thun in due course that he had found Rothschild entirely changed in his attitude, and that Rothschild had said to him that he could not afford to make an enemy of Prussia . Finally Rothschild had stated that he wanted to give the matter further consideration, and that he wished to request Count Thun to fix a time for the following day, the i rth, when he could come and discuss the matter with him . Thun invited him to come at twelve o'clock . The position was exceedingly painful for Rothschild . He did not in the least wish to annoy either Austria or Prussia, and he wanted to remain banker to the Diet and carry on his business in peace ; and now he suddenly found himself faced with the conflicting claims of two of the most im-"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 297 portant states of the Confederation and was compelled to take sides with one of them . He described the difficulties of his position in eloquent language to Count Thun, during their conversation on January i i . According to his report, Thun put the fol- lowing points to Rothschild \"Who has to decide questions affecting the business of the Federation? The Federal Assembly . What is the offi- cial means by which the Federal Assembly communicates its wishes to third persons such as yourself? Through the Delegate who presides over the Diet . The demand which you have received has therefore fulfilled all the condi- tions necessary to make it in order . In my opinion Prussia has no reply at all if you say to her : `I have no knowledge of what occurs within the Federal Assembly . My legal authority is the Presiding Delegate, who has sent me his instructions in accordance with a resolution of the Diet, and I have carried out these instructions as in my position I am required to do .' \" Thun also gave Rothschild to understand that if he refused to make the desired pay- ment, Thun would be compelled to call a further meet- ing of the Diet upon the following day . It would be impossible for the majority of the Assembly to allow an individual government to prevent the execution of a reso- lution which it had passed, so that in all probability it would pass a resolution that the Diet's business should be transferred to another bank at Frankfort, which would be prepared to pay the money when it was wanted . The aged Amschel Meyer followed what the count had to say in a condition of great excitement . He suggested, as a way out of the difficulty, that he should be author- ized to pay the 6o,ooo gulden to Austria's account . Thun, however, stated that he could agree to this . In the end Amschel Meyer yielded to the pressure brought to bear by the count and the combined endeavors of his entour- age, and promised to make the payment .

I said I must therefore ask him not to regard any expressions I used as official. I felt that I must hon- estly say that it had never occurred to me as conceivable that a Government of the Confederation could ever be moved so far to degrade the Federation's authority as to protest to a banker against a resolution passed by the Confederation, leaving it open to him to let the whole town and the whole of Germany know what was hap- pening . If Prussia had been concerned only to maintain her principles, a formal protest at the meeting of the Diet would have suffced ; the incident, however, revealed the fact that Prussia was not concerned with achieving this trivial object, but wished to establish what in my view was an entirely unreasonable and inadmissible principle -namely, that Prussia alone should lay down the law to the Confederation ; and if this were so, the very existence of the Confederation would be at stake, for those ques- tions which we have conscientiously endeavored to keep in the background would be forced to an issue, and the decision in their case might easily lead to consequneces of the gravest nature .\" Thun also gave the counselor to understand that in such circumstances it would be exceedingly painful and"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 299 indeed impossible for him to take the place of the Prus- sian delegate .

I feel that their action has made the position so acute that an understanding and reconcilia- tion will no longer be possible . The Diet naturally could not accept the position, and if Rothschild had not agreed to pay the money, I could not have left the matter in sus- pense for another twenty-four hours, even if war would have been the inevitable result . The failure of this attempt will merely serve to make Prussia feel humili- ated ; she will be more irritable than ever, and I myself do not perceive how she can reverse her policy .\" He went on to state that his success in inducing Roths- child to pay had produced a few days' peace, but that Prussia's aim was still merely to humiliate the Diet . \"As I have said,\" Thun's letter continued, \"I am convinced that Prussia will not allow matters to proceed to ex- tremes, that is, to a breach, if she sees in others the firm determination not to be intimidated by the idea of pro- ceeding to extremes .

Thun was not content with leaving it to Wetzel to re- port, but himself wrote direct to his Prussian colleague, Bismarck, at Berlin . In this letter he also stated that he would never have believed 84 that a German government belonging to the Diet could so far have degraded the authority and prestige of the German Diet as to protest to a Jew against the resolution of the Diet . \"I confess,\" wrote Thun, \"that so long as I live, I shall blush to think of it .

When Bismarck, on taking his leave, stated for the second time that he expected to pack his trunks in a few days, Thun replied that he could but congratulate him on getting out of a position which must have been a highly painful and unsavory one for a man of honor, since the govern- ments themselves attached so little importance to the maintenance of the honor and prestige of an assembly in which they were jointly represented, that they were pre- pared to protest to a Jew against this resolution .\"' Bismarck showed the Rothschilds very plainly how angry he was with them . He did not accept any of their invitations, and showed them in every possible way how strongly he disapproved of their conduct in this matter . All the Rothschilds' efforts to conciliate him availed noth- ing for the time being, and Bismarck did not confine himself to a social boycott, but in his wrath at the Roths- childs' having placed money at the disposal of the Diet in spite of Prussia's protest, he endeavored also to secure that his government should break off all business deal- ings with the House . As your Excellency is aware [Bismarck wrote on March i i to the Prussian prime minister, Manteuffel 70 ], the firm of Meyer Amschel von Rothschild and Sons here has completely ignored the protest . . . and paid the sum of 6o,ooo gulden at its own peril, as the head of the firm himself stated, in order not to spoil its relations with the Imperial Government of Austria . The protest did"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"302 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild have the result that it was decided not completely to carry out the resolution, authorizing the military subcommittee to take up a loan of over 260,000 gulden ; but it would have been easy for the House of Rothschild to find reasons for withholding the 6o,ooo gulden, or for paying the money in some other way, without excessive collusion with the Austrian Government . Your Excellency may infer the extent to which that House is anxious to please the Aus- trian Government in every possible way from the fact that he immediately informed the Austrian Delegate of every remittance that he receives for the Prussian Delegation to the Diet . On one occa- sion Count Thun actually informed me that the House of Rothschild had been instructed to make such a payment before I had received any official intimation to that effect . The conduct of the House of Rothschild in connection with this protest has caused me to ignore all invitations from the Herr von Rothschild resident here, and in general to give him to understand that his action has been highly displeasing to the Prussian Government . I cannot but also regard it as desirable that the business relationship in which the Prussian Delega- tion to the Diet has hitherto stood with the House of Rothschild should be broken off, and that the busi- ness should be transferred to another firm here . Your Excellency will agree with me that a continuance of this relationship would be liable to be misinter- preted and might be represented as indicating that the Prussian Government had convinced itself that the House of Rothschild could not have acted other- wise . Bismarck accordingly proposed Moritz Rethmann as being a suitable house to be entrusted with the business instead of the Rothschild bank . It happened, however, that the Rothschilds had a supporter in the president of the Preussische Seehandlung, whose name was Bloch . Manteuffel had referred Bismarck's proposal to the Prus-"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 303 sian finance minister Bodelschwingh, and he had con- sulted Bloch . Prussia had concluded loans with the House of Rothschild both in i 85o and in 1852 and although Bloch expressed the opinion that the house of Bethmann was perfectly sound and reliable, he suggested that there were \"other considerations of a general nature, especially in the interests of the Seehandlung, against the change .\" 71 He mentioned that the Seehandlung had very consider- able sums on deposit with the Rothschilds, which they could at any moment deal with as they pleased, and the important question arose \"whether, having regard to the substantial amounts that are involved in this case, an- other firm would be in a position to offer the same secur- ity as the Rothschilds undoubtedly afford .\" Bloch further pointed out that whereas the Bethmanns, in spite of the invitation they had received from him, had taken no share in the loan of i 85o or in the loan of 1852, the Rothschilds had invested very considerable sums in both these loans, and had always cooperated most read- ily with the State of Prussia in other financial operations . They must therefore obviously feel themselves slighted by the sudden withdrawal of the business in question ; and besides, it was possible that on a future occasion the success of similar financial operations might be frustrated through the opposition of these bankers who, through their extensive means, exercised a determining influence on the money market, and that in any case, without their cooperation the success of such operations would be made much more difficult . Bloch further stated that he was \"far from holding a brief for the Herren von Rothschild, or from wishing to give them any advantage inconsistent with the pub- lic interest,\" and expressed the opinion that they were hardly likely to favor Austria as against Prussia, since their attitude in financial transactions was affected by purely business considerations . Having regard therefore to the business relationship"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"304 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild between the Seehandlung and the Rothschilds, he was in favor of ignoring Bismarck's proposal . Manteuffel thereupon decided that Prussia's business relationship with the Rothschilds should not be broken off . They on their side did not weary in their endeavors to obtain Bismarck's forgiveness and reestablish them- selves in his favor . Carl Rothschild, Solomon's son Anselm, and indeed Solomon himself, who was at the time on a short visit to Frankfort, called one after another, on Bismarck, to express their regret at what had happened . Young An- selm went so far as to attribute the incident entirely to the senility of his uncle, who was already seventy-seven years old, saying that he had been so fiercely threatened by Thun that he had finally acquiesced in the payment . Meanwhile the question of the fleet had been settled by agreeing that Prussia should not have to make any fur- ther claim and the fleet itself should be put up to auction . Indeed, Prussia was indemnified for having paid more at the beginning by having two ships ceded to her . The rapprochement between the Rothschilds and Bis- marck was promoted by the fact that Count Thun, who was not particularly well disposed to the Jews, supported a protest brought forward by twelve Catholic citizens of Frankfort against the extension to the Jews of the rights of citizenship granted on October 8, 1848, and Feb- ruary 20, 1849, which were decried as \"revolutionary leg- islation .\" The Senate of Frankfort sent forward this protest to the Diet, and on August 5, 1852 the Diet resolved that the law of February 20, 1849, conferring on the Jews equal civil and political rights, was to be regarded as \"not legally enacted,\" and that the Free City of Frank- fort should be requested to announce accordingly that the law was not valid . As this proposal had emanated from the Austrian Catholic party it was opposed by Bismarck, with the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 3 0 5 result that the Prussian delegate found himself on the same side as the Rothschilds, who were watching the fur- ther development of the matter with deep anxiety . An- selm Rothschild appealed to Vienna with an urgent re- quest to Schwarzenberg that the imperial court should use its influence to insure that the resolution of the Diet should not result in the Frankfort Jews sustaining a re- verse which would be unjust and not in accordance with the general good . He pointed out that out of 57,550 citi- zens, only six per cent, that is 3,500, were Jews so that it was ridiculous to fear being outvoted . When in the middle of November, 1852, Count Thun was recalled from Frankfort, Bismarck felt that he had completely carried the day, and he was prepared to take the blame for the incident of the Rothschild advance . He again accepted invitations to the Rothschilds, and his at- titude implied, not merely that he had been reconciled to the House of Rothschild, but that his feelings had changed completely in their favor . When later on Manteuffel again asked Bismarck for his opinion in the matter of appointing Rothschild court banker to Prussia, he no longer found him opposed to the idea . Manteuffel emphasized that it would \"not be exactly easy to call such an important bank to account with reference to . any profits it might make,\" 7' and wished to be told whether he could grant the Rothschilds the title they desired or whether their sympathies were still predominantly anti-Prussian . \"My interest in the matter,\" wrote Manteuffel, \"I would . tell you in the strictest confidence, is somewhat to divert Herr von Rothschild from the efforts he is mak- ing here to improve the Vienna exchange, and to induce him favorably to consider the construction of a railway which we may wish to have built .\" Bismarck replied\" that he had no objections to raise against the title being granted, and that in his opinion there was reason to believe that the persons concerned"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"306 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild would highly appreciate the honor which it was intended to confer upon them . \"The Rothschilds,\" Bismarck wrote, \"have never been really guilty of anti-Prussian sympa- thies ; all that happened was that on the occasion of a dispute that occurred between ourselves and Austria about a year ago on the question whether certain deposits should be made available for the fleet, they were more afraid of Austria than of us . Now, since the Rothschilds cannot properly be expected to show such courage as would lead the justum ac tenacem propositi virum to resist such ardorem civium prava jubentium as Count Thun developed on that occasion, and as the other mem- bers of the family have since apologized for the attitude of Baron Amschel, whom they described as senile [he died in r855], I feel that, in view of the services which this financial power is able to render, their mistake on this occasion may be consigned to oblivion .\" Of his own initiative Bismarck went even further . He repeatedly recommended, both in conversation and in writing, that the banking house which, with the excep- tion of the single instance in January of the preceding year, had always shown its willingness, in its financial dealings with the Prussian delegation, to be of service to his government, should be granted some distinction . The blame in that instance was, as stated by members of the House of Rothschild themselves, attributable to the senility of Amschel Rothschild, who had allowed him- self to be intimidated by the threats of Count Thun . The conviction has repeatedly been forced upon me [Bismarck wrote 74] that the leaders of this finan- cial power would value a distinction conferred upon them by Prussia, since they do not merely value per- sonally honors conferred upon them .

The efforts . . . which Austria made in the course of the summer, to secure the emancipa- tion of the Jews, seem to be attributable to the efforts of the Rothschilds . . . The present senior partner of the House here, Meyer Carl von Rothschild, has repeatedly given me to understand how greatly he desires to receive the Red Eagle of the Third Class, which order has been conferred upon two of his sub- ordinates, one of them, whose name is Goldschmidt, being at Vienna, and, as was particularly emphasized by Herr von Rothschild, upon the eldest of the brothers von Bethmann, who is Prussian Consul here . I would regard the conferring of such an order on Meyer Carl von Rothschild as being wholly in the interests of the State, and I am willing to recommend to your Excellency that in addition to this order, the honorable distinction of Royal Court Banker to His Majesty the King should, for the reasons above indicated, also be conferred upon all the members of the House of Rothschild . The Prussian finance minister, however, unlike Man- teuffel, was not well disposed to the Rothschilds . He ignored the opinion expressed by the president of the Seehandlung, and informed Manteuffel that in his view \"the firm of the brothers von Rothschild has of recent years shown itself less disposed to act in the interests of our Government than previously .\" He therefore held that neither the Order of the Red Eagle nor the title of Court"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"308 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Banker should be conferred upon them . The finance min- ister's aim apparently was, by this refusal, to induce the !Rothschilds to prove themselves more amenable to the wishes of the Prussian government in financial matters, in order that they might be deemed worthy of such istinction . \"His Majesty the King,\" Manteuffel wrote to Bis- marck,\" \"has no objection if, when a suitable occasion offers, it should be indicated to the members of the firm that it is greatly regretted that in the circumstances it is not possible to confer the mark of favor contemplated, but that it is hoped that the House will find another opportunity of enabling the Government to do so .\" Bismarck informed the Rothschilds that Manteuffel was not averse from the idea of conferring a distinction upon them,'' but that the finance minister had \"com- plained to the King regarding the attitude of the House in recent times .\" The Rothschilds protested that they were exceedingly hurt at this suggestion, and that they had no idea at all what could be the basis for it . The newspapers put forward the idea that, since the Order of the Red Eagle was in the form of a cross, a special form of it would have to be designed for the Jews . \"If this view is correct,\" Bismarck wrote to Manteuf- fel, \"any more or less emancipated Jews, such as the Rothschilds are, with the exception of the . very aged Amschel, will lose any inclination to adorn themselves with a decoration which will have become a stamp of Judaism .\" A conflict arose in Berlin between Manteuffel, who was on the side of the Rothschilds, and the finance min- ister, who was against them, the conflict ending in the victory of the prime minister . On February 12, 1853, the bankers Meyer Amschel von Rothschild were appointed 'Court Bankers after all \"as a mark of His Majesty's satisfaction\" and Manteuffel hastened to inform Bis- marck of this fact, having reason to believe that the latter"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 309 would be pleased to be the first to bring this information to the Rothschilds? 7 Bismarck reported that he had done so, adding some items of financial news which he had heard at the Roths- childs' . There was such a superabundance of money in the Frankfort market at that time that Rothschild had terminated and repaid a deposit of i,ooo,ooo thaler, which the government of Saxony had deposited with him, stating that it could not afford to pay more than i Y2% . \"This superabundance of money,\" Bismarck wrote,\" \"is attributed by Rothschild to the fact that, partly through the fear of war, and partly through the uncer- tainty regarding the future of the Customs Union, the spirit of enterprise has vanished, so that money is flowing back from business without being reinvested . Rothschild said that he would be exceedingly grateful if he could be shown a possibility of placing his money at 3/ % . If the Prussian Government should at the moment enter into any business transaction with the House of Rothschild which would give the latter some opportunity of show- ing their personal good-will, I would venture dutifully to repeat my suggestion that the mark of royal favor already given should be followed up by conferring the . Order of the Red Eagle of the Third Class on Baron Meyer Carl . He is at the moment the most influential member of the family, and I have had further proof of the high value which he attaches to the conferring of such a distinction upon himself, and of the eagerness with which he is seeking it . It was impossible for him to understand how he or his House could, as I recently gave him to understand, have given the Finance Minister any occasion for dissatisfaction .\" Bethmann, who had been cherishing the hope that he might himself become Court Banker to Prussia, and thereby win a victory over his old rival Rothschild, was exceedingly disconcerted when he heard that the latter had succeeded in obtaining the appointment . He hastened"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"3io \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild to Bismarck and told him that the rebuff which he had sustained could be compensated for only by conferring a personal distinction on himself .

John, which he indicated as being a reasonable compensation . I cannot regard him as being a suitable person to bear this Order . . . .

Whenever the Diet showed any sign of activity, he attributed some secret or deceitful motive to the Aus- trian government and its new representative, Baron von Prokesch-Osten . Similarly in their treatment of the Jew- ish problem . The protest of the Catholic citizens of Frankfort had still not been disposed of, and Bismarck expressed the suspicion 78 that Austria herself had delib- erately tried to make this an important issue, so that if it depended upon the president of the Diet to retard or expedite it, this fact could be used to bring pressure to bear on the House of Rothschild in financial negotia- tions . Bismarck meant to suggest that Austria would vote on the question of the retention of the constitutional lib- erty of the Jews according as the House of Rothschild should prove obliging to her in financial matters or not . \"The effect of such pressure,\" Bismarck wrote ' 80 \"can be justly estimated only when one bears in mind the exceptionally high importance that all members of the Rothschild family attach to the attainment of better political and social conditions, in their native town of Frankfort especially . The chief of the House here, C . M . von Rothschild, who, one gathers, has a decisive influence in the family affairs, is especially sensitive on this point, by reason of the rivalry of Christian bankers .\""},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Achille Fould"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 311, There was no way of pleasing Bismarck in this matter . If Austria opposed any alteration in the constitution that would damage the Jews, this proved her servility to the Rothschilds and her dependence on the Jews . If, on the other hand, she supported such a change, this amounted to 81 \"the resumption of her former paramount position in the governance of the city\" ; and this would be a dan- gerous development . Bismarck remained true to his pol- icy of opposing Austria's influence with the Diet when- ever he could . The Prussian delegate therefore opposed the protest, and supported the retention of Jewish liber- ties in Frankfort, thereby winning the gratitude of the House of Rothschild . The personal relationship between the old bank and the delegate who was still to play such an important part in the history of Germany, remained a very satisfactory one until Bismarck's official duties at Frankfort came to an end in 1859 . It was not affected by such temporary difficulties as arose during his period of office at Frankfort between Prussia and the House of Rothschild . There were two opposing parties in the Prussian government . The party to which Manteuffel and the cabinet's adviser Niebuhr belonged were favorable to the Rothschilds, whereas the finance minister Bodelschwingh did not attempt to con- ceal his dislike of them . When in the spring of 1854, just after the western Powers and Turkey had declared war on Russia, the Prussian government was faced with the possibility of being forced to take military measures, Manteuffel per- suaded the king that Niebuhr should be commissioned to sound the House of Rothschild regarding a possible loan of 15,ooo,ooo thaler, without the finance minister being told anything about this .\" Niebuhr fixed on neu- tral Heidelberg as a place for the discussions, which were attended by Meyer Carl and Nathaniel who, already an invalid, came from London for the purpose . Even the"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"312 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild aged James was asked to come from Paris to Heidelberg, a fact which clearly showed Niebuhr the great impor- tance that the House attached to the conclusion of this business . He therefore hoped to obtain favorable terms ; but the Rothschilds proceeded with extreme caution and kept on excusing themselves from any definite statement, on the ground that James was still absent, until, after three hours of negotiation, Niebuhr asked them with some heat whether they wanted to do the business or not ; if not, would they kindly say no . It was not a matter of politeness but of business, and he and his government wanted to know where they stood .\"' Niebuhr got a de- cided yes, by way of answer, and they proceeded to argue as to the price at which the loan should be underwritten . The Rothschilds offered 9o, but Niebuhr replied that this was an impossible figure, and he must have 93, which had been offered elsewhere. The Rothschilds declared that it was impossible that such an offer should have been made by people who seriously meant business . Nie- buhr thereupon provisionally broke off negotiations, and returned with Meyer Carl to Frankfort, where he told him that the minister, Manteuffel, would gladly have concluded the loan with him out of respect for the House of Rothschild and owing to his feeling that he would then be carrying through a plain and reliable transac- tion, but that this required a certain amount of courage, as there was public opinion in Prussia which was preju- diced against doing business with his House . On June 8, the negotiations were resumed at Hanover with the Paris and Frankfort Rothschilds . These both repeated the previous offer made, but appeared very dis- turbed regarding the political situation, and asked that until the loan was fully subscribed, no Prussian mobiliza- tion should be ordered, as this would inevitably bring about a fall in quotations . Agreement on many points had already been reached, when the finance minister, Bodelschwingh, suddenly heard of the negotiations which"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 313 had been carried on behind his back, and protested em- phatically . He bitterly reproached' Manteuffel and Nie- buhr, stating that the Rothschilds had offered' \"the most worthless conditions .\" 84 Bodelschwingh secured the breaking off of discussions with the Rothschilds, and had the loan subscribed privately, with a fair measure of success . Meyer Carl returned to Frankfort very much disap- pointed, and poured out his soul to Bismarck, who found food for thought in the differences of opinion in his own government . At about this time, the president of the governing body at Trier asked Bismarck to use his influence with Roths- child on behalf of the Jewish Community at Cologne . Bismarck felt compelled to reply that, while he was pre- pared to use his personal and private influence with the family, he was unable to ask a favor on behalf of the Prussian government, since, as he said, 86 \"the conduct of the House of Rothschild in connection with the last Prus- sian loan has not been such as to make it desirable to ask these gentlemen a favor on behalf of the Prussian Government .\" This rift in the lute was a matter of some concern to the Prussian delegate, since, it being his constant aim to restrict the' sphere of Austria's influence, he had in- tended to make use of the Rothschilds in connection with a scheme that he had planned, the object of which was to check the circulation of Austrian securities in the South of Germany . In the South, and particularly in Frankfort, many persons held Austrian investments ; and they were led to place their political support where their financial interest lay . Bismarck meant to counter this by facilitating dealings in Prussian securities in every way possible . When Meyer Carl asked him to have the inter- est on all Prussian state bonds paid through him, an ar- rangement which would substantially facilitate dealing with these securities in South Germany, Bismarck imme-"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"314 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild diately agreed . He reported accordingly to Manteuffel, adding that Rothschild had offered very favorable terms \"since he looks at the arrangement from the point of view that it increases his business .\" \"If, therefore,\" Bismarck wrote,\" \"higher quarters should be disposed to accede to the request which Roths- child has so frequently made to me, I believe that the greater convenience and security against loss thereby of- fered would be an inducement to Jewish investors to increase their holdings of such securities .\" This proposal, however, again met with strong opposi- tion on the part of the Rothschilds' bitter enemy, the finance minister, Bodelschwingh . He pointed out that the Rothschilds had already been entrusted with the interest payment on the loan of 1850 and 1852, as well as on the premium loan of 1855 . \"Had this firm,\" he continued, \"taken a proper share in the loan of 1854, which was con- cluded in exceptionally difficult circumstances, the same arrangement might have been made . \"That it would be exceedingly agreeable to the House of Rothschild to be granted the same advantages with regard to the 4Y2'70 loans of 1854, 1855, and 1856, al- though it had nothing to do with their issue, is readily intelligible . Such action, however, would not be in ac- cordance with the interests of the Treasury .\" Manteuffel held that Bodelschwingh had been largely responsible for the fact that Rothschild had not taken part in the loan of 1854, but for the time being Bismarck's proposal was not accepted . The Rothschilds, however, persisted in their request, and Bismarck was not the man easily to accept a refusal . Meyer Carl addressed two urgent letters to Bismarck at a short interval, 87 reminding Bismarck that he desired all the Prussian 4/ % loans, including that of 1856, to be \"domiciled\" with his bank . \"Your Excellency is aware,\" he wrote, \"that my House, which has been devoting itself as always with the great-"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 315 est zeal to strengthening and extending the financial credit of the State of Prussia, has succeeded not only in obtaining a market here for the most recent loan issued by the Bank of Prussia but also in obtaining such an extensive market for this loan throughout the whole of Southern Germany, that securities to the amount of 7,000,000 have already been sold .\" Thereupon Bismarck wrote a letter to Manteuffel,SB strongly urging that the Rothschilds' wishes should be carried into effect . \"I do not know,\" he wrote, \"the reasons which pre- vented the House of Rothschild from taking a proper share in the loan concluded in 1854 under difficult con- ditions . In raising this matter, I did not proceed from the assumption that there was any question of punishing or rewarding a bank for its business methods ; my sole aim was to discover an arrangement which would favor a larger sale of Prussian securities abroad, and would at- tract foreign capital for our needs . That such an arrange- ment as has been suggested, would assist in achieving this end, appears not to be disputed by the Finance Min- ister, only he does not regard the advantages as so con- siderable as has been stated . I do not gather from the arguments advanced by the Finance Minister that he fears that we should suffer any disadvantage from such an arrangement, especially as the House of Rothschild is prepared to forego even the small amount which it had asked to cover expenses . We may of course, assume that the bank has its own reasons for making such a proposal, for it is not going to undertake all the work involved out of devotion to Prussia . The fact, however, that its advan- tage is identical with ours, does not seem to me to fur- nish any reason why we should ignore ours .\" Bismarck further developed his argument against Bodelschwingh and concluded `by suggesting with all deference that the matter should be discussed once more with the finance minister . This was done, but without pro-"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"316 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild ducing the desired result . Bodelschwingh held that there was no reason for further considering the Rothschild proposals.\" Indeed, in a letter to Manteuffel he made a counter-attack upon Bismarck, and endeavored to show that the latter had \"failed clearly to grasp the proposal .\" 90 On still failing to obtain a favorable decision, Meyer Carl applied direct to Manteuffel ; he said that he would accept any indemnification for the work involved that might be considered reasonable, as he was solely con- cerned \"to demonstrate again the sincere devotion of his House, and their desire to serve the interests of Prussia's finances .\" The matter was not decided until Bodelschwingh re- signed and a new finance minister, von Patow, was ap- pointed . Although Bismarck had left Frankfort by then, he urged the new finance minister to accede to the Roths- childs' request, but this was not done 91 until Bismarck's successor, Herr von Usedom, had also supported the pro- posal, 92 and Rothschild had appealed to the president, von Camphausen, pointing out that he had recently sold Prussian securities to investors to the value of several millions and had \"thus assisted in consolidating the finan- cial interests with those of South Germany .\" This matter, too, had clearly revealed the excellent understanding that had subsisted between Bismarck and the Rothschilds during the later years of his stay at Frank- fort . Neither did their pleasant relations suffer through the following tragi-comic incident, which originated in Berlin and was exceedingly painful to the House of Rothschild, but for which Bismarck, as they well knew, was in no way responsible . Bismarck's suggestion that Baron Meyer Carl von Rothschild, who lived at Frankfort, and was the eldest son of Carl Meyer Rothschild of Naples, should be given the Order of the Red Eagle as well as the title of Court Banker, was accepted, but a special order of the Red Eagle was designed for non-Christians, being of an oval"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck \t 317 shape instead of in the shape of a cross . At the beginning of July, 1853, Bismarck handed Meyer Carl this order, which he considered to - be very tastefully designed .\" Rothschild appeared grateful, but he accepted the deco- ration with mixed feelings since, as he already held, among others, the Order of the Redeemer of Greece, he would clearly have felt himself more at home among the cross-wearers. The House of Rothschild did, in fact, re- gard the oval as a slight rather than as a distinction, and this decoration was a constant source of irritation to Meyer Carl Rothschild . He felt it all the more keenly when, on August 14, 1857, just after Prince William of Prussia had taken over the government from King Fred- erick William IV, who was ill, he received the Order of the Red Eagle of the Second Class, also in the form designed for non-Christians . Meyer Carl as far as possible avoided wearing the Order, as he felt that it marked him out in an unpleasant way, but persons who were ill disposed to the Rothschilds whispered to the new regent that Rothschild wore the Order of the Red Eagle in the form of a cross . One day, to his surprise, Bismarck received the following commu- nication from Manteuffel :\" \"It has been brought to the notice of his Royal Highness, the Prince of Prussia, that the Court Banker, Baron von Rothschild at Frankfort on Main, upon whom the Order of the Red Eagle of the Second Class was conferred by royal decree on August i i, in the form appointed for non-Christians, is wearing the Order in the form of a cross, and I have been instructed to inquire into this matter .\" The prime minister requested Bismarck to state in con- fidence whether the prince had been correctly informed .

On the occasion of the official reception which I myself gave on the 25th ultimo, to celebrate the marriage of H .R .H . Prince Fred- erick William, which he would have had to attend in uniform, he excused himself on the ground of ill- health, it being painful to him to wear the Red Eagle decoration for non-Christians, as he would have had to do on that occasion .

I have never heard that Herr von Rothschild . . . has worn the decoration appointed for Christians, although the Frankforters love making the most of such incidents, and in view of the keen rivalry between the various financial powers, the Christian bankers have derived no small satisfaction from the fact that Herr von Rothschild may not wear the regular decoration .

Roths- child advised against selling, as the securities in question had good prospects . \"Yes,\" replied Bismarck, \"but if you knew the object of my journey you would think other- wise .\" Rothschild replied that that might be so but he could not advise him to sell . Bismarck, however, got rid of his securities and left for Paris . Louis Napoleon was very amenable and would not have been likely to create any difficulties about the action against Neuchatel . Meanwhile, without telling Bismarck anything about it, the King of Prussia had changed his mind, and decided to have nothing more to do with the matter . The war which had been expected, therefore did not occur, and the securities in question continued to rise in value . Rothschild was proved right, and the great statesman lost a considerable amount of money through the premature sale . Bismarck was in Frankfort when old Amschel Meyer so delightfully described by him died ; he continued to be on the best of terms with all the members of the House living there . When, in 1859, he left Frankfort to take up his new post at St . Petersburg, the Rothschilds hoped that they had established themselves in the favor of the man who, their instinct may well have told them, was destined to great things ."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII From the Crimean War to the Italian War of 1859 A FTER being directed for several years by temporary managers, the Vienna House of Rothschild ac- quired in Solomon's son, Anselm, a chief who endeav- ored to restore the prestige of the House of Rothschild in the imperial dominions, after it had been almost de- stroyed by the revolution and Metternich's flight . Thus in Vienna as in London, the third generation since the foundation of the bank had come into power . Just as Nathan's sons, although they did not inherit his financial genius to the full, were distinguished from their father by a remarkably good education, so Anselm Rothschild also was a highly cultured man who, unlike his father, had mastered the German language, and also spoke French and English very well . He was naturally modest and quiet ; and his studies in Berlin, his activities in the Paris House, and his extensive journeys throughout the world had developed his personality and social poise . In Vienna, however, he was an absolute stranger, since, even after he had completed his studies, he had been living at Frankfort, and his duties as Austrian consul- general in that city were not an essential part of his activities . It would mean hard work to restore his House to its firm position under the new and entirely altered con- ditions . His task was made somewhat easier by the fact that Metternich returned at the end of the year 1851, and that Kiibeck of the finance ministry, an old acquaintance of the family, still possessed great influence . Metternich's return was a clear indication of the change 320"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"From the Crimean 'War to the Italian War 321 in the internal political situation . After the stormy years in which the pendulum had swung so far to the left, the forces of reaction were again asserting themselves . Single individuals were again assuming control in the state, and financiers were beginning to feel that conditions were again beginning to obtain under which they could regain their political influence . Anselm availed himself of every opportunity of drawing attention to himself by munifi- cent gifts . The return of the Emperor Francis Joseph from a lengthy journey through his northern states, fur- nished a welcome opportunity for such expenditure . \"After a long absence,\" Anselm wrote to the minister of the interior, \"and having accomplished a journey full of benefit to the monarchy, the honored father of our country is returning to his capital . All hearts go out to meet him, and Vienna celebrates a day of festivity . From palace and cottage shouts of welcome echo to greet our beloved sovereign . Sharing profoundly as I do in this universal rejoicing, I would like, my dear Minister, as some satisfaction to my feelings, to make a small contri- bution to the relief of the sufferings of the needy in Vienna and I venture humbly to transmit to your Excel- lency the enclosed s,ooo florins C .C ., with the humble request that you will graciously make such use of this sum as may seem best to you .\" All the papers commented on Anselm's gift, and he received an official letter of thanks . The young emperor, however, remained very unapproachable, and none of the new ministers were as disposed as Metternich and Kolowrat to allow Anselm to have political influence ; and even if they had been, it would not have had the same effect, for none of them, not even Schwarzenberg, who died all too soon, had anything like as much power as Metternich . Austria's finances were certainly in a very bad way, and it was through this fact that the Rothschilds were to recover their influence in Austria .

Anselm succeeded in getting a loan floated for him in London in May, 1852, a considerable portion being un- derwritten by the Frankfort House as well, but this did not help much, and the accounts for the year 1853 still showed a deficit, although externally everything re- mained quiet . Moreover, the government and its departments were by no means well disposed to the Jews in Austria, al- though they occupied most of the principal places in banking and finance, and were able, through their inter- national connections, favorably or unfavorably to affect the state's credit . The veto on the purchase of real estate by the Jews was actually reimposed in the autumn of 1853 . There- upon, according to reports from Paris,' a kind of coali- tion was formed on the bourses of Paris and London, its object being to damage Austrian credit . The measure made a highly unfavorable impression on the Rothschilds, and Anselm was reproached by James for having failed to oppose the decree earlier and more emphatically . James spoke to the Austrian Ambassador Hubner in the greatest dismay ; he said that the excite- ment on the bourse was intense, and as Austrian consul- general he did not dare to show himself lest he should expose himself to the attacks of his co-religionists, who were reproaching him for his devotion to the Austrian government . He said that his position was an exceedingly painful one ; Austria's credit had been profoundly shaken both in France and in England by the measure ; no one wanted to hear anything more about the Metalliques, and it was impossible even to think of a loan . \"In a word,\" Hubner reported, \"he is beside himself .\" Hubner suggested that it would be well for the govern- ment to \"soothe the children of Israel,\" as he put it, for"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"From, the Crimean War to the Italian War 323 apart from the Oriental question, the Austrian measure against the Jews was the sole topic of conversation in Paris . Meanwhile a new storm center had formed in the east of Europe . Russia was the only state that had remained untouched by the revolution of the preceding years ; she had indeed assisted materially in suppressing them be- yond her frontiers . The tsar wanted to satisfy his sense of power at the expense of a completely disorganized Turkey, which he called \"a sick man .\" An agreement re- garding the partition of Turkey broke down owing to England's suspicious attitude, and all the other states, too, were afraid of Russia becoming too powerful in the Balkans . The occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia by Russian troops in May, i853, could not but be regarded as a particular menace to Austria at a time when she par- ticularly wished to avoid foreign complications, since her finances were in a very bad way . Metternich refused to tolerate being left out in the cold . The aged statesman had resumed his traditional relations with the House of Rothschild, as represented by the son of his old friend Solomon, and from time to time he had recourse to KUbeck, who was still friendly to him, and who had the ear of the emperor, with a view to quietly bringing pressure to bear . On December 2, 1853, Metternich informed Kubeck of what had been said at a visit which Anselm had paid him . Herr A . von Rothschild [he wrote], whom I had not seen for several weeks, called on me and dis- cussed the general situation, which has taken such a dangerous turn owing to the unfortunate state of affairs between Russia and Turkey .

The conversation was here interrupted by a visit from the Nuncio . Rothschild took his leave and as I went with him to the door Rothschild said to me, \"You mark my words, we are on the eve of a crisis ; if something is not done to avert it, it will be upon us before the new year!\" These words made an impression on me, and I am therefore communicating them to you as being the only person to whom I may properly tell them . You will be able to judge better than anyone else what value should be attached to them . Rothschild was then not at all satisfied with the con- duct of affairs in Austria, not only on account of Baum- gartner's incompetence, but also because he was not asked for his advice in financial and political matters . Russia's conduct produced even more violent reactions in the west of Europe, in England and France, than in the im- perial city on the Danube . England feared Russia's ad- vance toward the Mediterranean, while in France the new and therefore particularly sensitive emperor was deeply wounded by the manner in which he was treated by the tsar, who did not concede him the manner of ad- dress commonly used between monarchs, namely, \"Mon frere,\" but addressed him simply \"Sire et bon ami .\" This question of form showed only too clearly how little the tsar was pleased with the new regime in France .

Eugenie de Montijo, who had come to Paris with her mother in 1852, was a member of the brilliant society of the French court, and fascinated the emperor with her charm and intelligence . She was, moreover, the daughter of a Spanish nobleman who had once fought for Napoleon I . James Rothschild knew the ladies very well, for the Countess Montijo, whose means were limited, while her expenditure was lavish, constantly came to him for ad- vice, and often attended his parties with her daughter . He closely followed Louis Napoleon's growing interest in the Spanish girl, and was one of the first who con- ceived the possibility that the radiantly beautiful girl would one day be empress . When Napoleon invited the Montijo ladies to Compiegne with other guests, James took care to be accurately informed of the former's conduct . On hunting and other expeditions the emperor had fre- quent opportunities of conversation with Eugenie . She speedily gave him to understand that she was not the type to consent to a casual liaison . Soon everyone in Paris was discussing the emperor's interest in the young lady, and the rumor was already becoming current that the em- peror meant to marry her . Two parties were immediately formed, the one favoring and the other being opposed to the match . James Rothschild belonged to the former party, and although ministerial circles were keenly op- posed to the idea, James, who had a particularly reliable source of information, felt convinced that the marriage would take place . On December 31, 1852, Napoleon sum- moned a council of ministers at which, under the seal of secrecy, he proclaimed his intention of marrying the young countess .

The `parvenu' therefore may not hope to con- clude a royal marriage unless, like the late Duke of Or- leans, after begging at all the courts, he brings home a princess of whom nobody has ever heard . In order to safe- guard his dignity and that of the nation which has con- ferred upon him the Imperial crown, the 'parvenu'- that is, the son of the people-will be forced to choose a parvenue as his bride . If the monarchs of Europe should take umbrage at this, let them remember that the fault lies, not with me, but with their own diplomatists, who leave me no choice in the matter . If I am to be debarred from contracting a `political' marriage, I shall at any rate have the comfort of being able to contract a mariage d'inclination . As, however, I am accountable for my actions and omissions to nobody but the nation that has set me upon the throne, I shall appeal to them in this matter too, by a special message which, as the Chambers are no longer sitting, I shall address to the Bar of the Senate and of the Legislative Corps .\" Ministerial circles were very much inclined to regard the suggestion of this marriage as being at bottom only a political demonstration against foreign diplomacy which had succeeded in frustrating the efforts of the Em- peror of the French to obtain the hand of the Princess Wasa, and, as Louis Napoleon stated he had been defi- nitely informed, which was determined to bring to naught any efforts of a similar nature, including those for the hand of the Princess von Hohenzollern, who was a cousin of the Princess Wasa .

James was particularly assiduous in his attentions to the Montijo ladies . The ball at the Tuileries of Janu- ary 12, 1853, finally removed any doubts that he might have felt as to the correctness of his surmise . Hiibner relates the following illuminating episode in his memoirs, Only privileged persons were allowed to enter the Mar- shals' Room at a ball . James Rothschild was escorting the Andalusian, Mlle . de Montijo, while her mother was on the arm of one of his sons . The latter thought that he could find room for the two ladies on some settees . The wife of a minister, who wanted the seat in question, and who thought it was impossible, in spite of all the current gossip, that the emperor should marry Mlle . de Montijo, remarked quite shortly to Eugenie, who was just going to sit down, that those places were reserved for the wives of ministers . The two Spanish ladies were painfully embarrassed . They looked helplessly at their escorts, who were also exceedingly uncomfortable . Thereupon Napoleon saw what was happening, and hurried over to the ladies, tak- ing them to tabourets which were just by the members of his family . This action could not be misinterpreted and caused a sensation ; everybody recognized it as signifying that the emperor was actually determined to marry the young lady . The future was to show that James Rothschild's wise behavior, at a time when Eugenie had not yet attained the height of her good fortune, was to bear good fruit . The future empress never liked the banker Fould, her husband's protege, and she therefore prevented a com- plete breach with James, who seemed to have been forced into the background by Fould, the Credit Mobilier, and the Pereires .

On the same evening Solomon Rothschild, who was staying in Paris with his daughter-in-law, gave a dinner . At this dinner the emperor's marriage was the sole topic of con- versation. It was naturally a matter of particular inter- est that Napoleon had paid a public tribute to his bride's virtue, by saying of her, in the message\" : \"I have chosen a woman whom I love and honor .\" Baroness Charlotte, Anselm von Rothschild's wife, re- marked : \"One can love a woman without esteeming her, but it is only when one honors and respects her that one takes her as a life companion .\" As this statement indi- cated, the House of Rothschild at this dinner took the side of the emperor without reserve ; and they arranged that he should soon hear about it . The Austrian Minister Hubner was, as we know, not well disposed to the Rothschilds ; their feelings were cer- tainly mutual . James said that he would prefer again to see a grand seigneur as Austria's representative in Paris, who would have a proper residence and live in style . Hubner was a little jealous of the Austrian consul- general for other reasons, and also because his position at the imperial court had now been somewhat improved through the Montijo ladies . In accordance with the tradi- tions of Austrian diplomacy he regarded a consul-general ,a priori as a person in a subordinate position, and James's peculiar standing in society and in the state worried him . The result was that each tried to give the other petty pin-pricks . James endeavored to undermine HUbner's position at Vienna by sending in colored reports of third parties, while Hubner prevented James from being pres- ent at the emperor's betrothal at Notre Dame Cathedral on January 30 .

Herr von Hubner, however, kept the invitation back . The em- peror, hearing that James had not been present, asked the duke why, and discovered that the Austrian minister had prevented the baron from accepting the invitation . This made the emperor exceedingly angry, and when, on the evening of March 3, he saw Rothschild at the court ball at the Tuileries, he went up to him and shook him warmly by the hand, although he did not say a word to any of the foreign representatives . KObeck's secret correspondent in Paris, who was also hostile to Hubner and was a friend of Rothschild, made the following report on the incident\" : \"As unfortunately nothing in Paris remains secret for long, Napoleon III knows that there is friction between Herr Hubner and Baron Rothschild, and that Herr Hubner will not admit Baron Rothschild to the Diplomatic Circle on public occasions, although it has always been the custom in France that Consuls should appear at Court, together with their respective Ministers or Ambassadors . Napo- leon III, who has been told about this, is profuse in showing marks of good-will to Baron Rothschild, just in order to let Herr Hubner see how distasteful the latter's personality is to him .\" This was not literally true, the statement having been colored by the fact that the journalist Debraux, who was temporarily employed at the Austrian consulate-general, was intriguing against Hubner . Relations between Na- poleon and James were far from being as cordial as all that ; but the emperor felt grateful to James because he had been friendly to the Montijo ladies, and because of his attitude in the marriage question . In financial matters he continued to place his unrestricted confidence in Rothschild's rivals, Fould and Pereire, and their Credit Mobilier, although the latter was already being severely criticized . Hubner had no sympathy with financiers who"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"330 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild wanted to play an important part . \"In other countries,\" he observed contemptuously, 5 \"where everything has not yet been leveled by sixty years of revolution, as it has here in France, there are still, thank God, separate classes ; but here money is everything, and in the sentiments of the nation, the Rothschilds and the Foulds have the prece- dence of the Montmorencys and the Rohans .\" The ten- sion between Hi brier and his consul-general had the un- fortunate result that the minister was deprived of an important and abundant source of information ; for Rothschild had achieved an exceptional position among all classes of the population of Paris . Through his con- nections he always had the best possible information on all matters ; that such information should not reach the minister was particularly regrettable at a time when the position in foreign affairs was becoming critical . The Emperor Napoleon, who had been offended by the tsar, was making approaches to England with a view to taking sides against Russia on behalf of menaced Turkey . After the sensation of the emperor's marriage had somewhat subsided, the question of peace or war domi- nated the ministries, the salons, the clubs, and the streets . People were already beginning to talk about an inevitable war, words which struck terror into the heart of James Rothschild . Hiibner found James Rothschild at this time \"positively demoralized\"' by fear of war . The actual facts, however, were not quite so bad, for James had been told by his nephew in England that that country too would proceed against Russia, and he heard from Anselm in Vienna that, even if Austria did not intervene actively, she was inclined to withdraw herself from Russia, and would in no circumstances fight on her side . Although the House of Rothschild was bound to regard a war as a serious interference with its activities, to which peace was essential, it found some comfort in the fact that all the Rothschild Houses were on the same side .

On March 12, 1854, England and France concluded an alliance with Turkey, and when the tsar failed to reply to their demand that the Danube principalities should be evacuated, the war broke out, which came to be called the Crimean War, after the country where it was fought . Now that the die was cast, the Rothschilds completely identified themselves with the countries in which they were living . Duke Ernest of Coburg actually states in his memoirs' that Rothschild said to him as early as March 4 that he would place any amount of money at his dis- posal for war against Russia . This attitude was certainly partly attributable to the fact that the Jews were partic- ularly oppressed in Russia . As the war proceeded the rivalry increased between the Rothschilds and the Credit Mobilier, which with the assistance of the government was achieving a very power- ful position, engaging it in undertakings of the most va- ried nature, and already extending its activities beyond the boundaries of France . It made advances to the Vienna cabinet, whose policy at that time was particularly nebu- lous and uncertain, and which required large sums for military preparations . Austria threatened Russia without actually attacking her, and allied herself Platonically to the western Powers, without assisting them . This policy alienated both sides, and proved expensive in addition . When the financial embarrassments of the state had be- come particularly acute the Austrian proceeded to con- sider the sale of the state railways . In 1852, the Austrian state owned all the railways in the monarchy, with the ex- ception of the Nordbahn, which was the province of the Rothschilds, and the Vienna-Raadbahn, which belonged to the Sinas .

Such a scheme was nat- urally exceedingly distasteful to the Rothschilds, for if all the other railways in Austria, including the northern state railways, were to come into the possession of a rival undertaking this might have serious consequences for their Nordbahn . The Rothschilds accordingly at once started a campaign against the scheme, which had already made considerable advance, but they were not able to prevent its being carried into effect . The board of directors of the new undertaking, which assumed the name \"I. and R . Chartered Austrian State Railway Company,\" contained the two Pereires, Adolph Fould, Napoleon's half-brother the Duke of Morny, and the Barons Georg Sina, Daniel Eskeles, and Ludwig Pereira, all of them bitter enemies of the House of Roths- child . Baron Eskeles went to Paris and got an introduc- tion to the French government from Ambassador Hub- ner, who avoided saying anything to the Rothschilds about the matter . The government had two excellent reasons for wishing the scheme to go through . It wished to assist the Credit Mobilier, which enjoyed the emper- or's patronage, to obtain a good business and also to induce Austria to intervene actively on the side of the western Powers ; only the authorities in Paris wanted to wait awhile lest the considerable French loan which had just been issued should suffer from the diversion of . the large amount of capital required by the new railway company . The Prussian prime minister decided to take advan- tage of this delay in order if possible to secure the Aus- trian railways for a Prussian syndicate under the leader- ship of the Seehandlung . This idea, however, did not appeal to the directors in Vienna, who felt it would humiliate Austria in the eyes of the other states of the Federation .

The House of Rothschild put every possible obstacle in the way of the scheme . Anselm in Vienna called upon and discussed the matter with all the persons in authority in the government, including Metternich and Kubeck, the latter most strongly condemning this selling off of the state railways? His uncle James took similar steps in Paris, but without avail . They were simply regarded as competitors who were left high and dry and wanted to deprive their rivals of their success . On January 1, 1855, part of the railways belonging to the state were actually sold to the Credit Mobilier for 2,ooo,ooo gulden (about 77,000,000 CC) whereas the cost of constructing the railway had amounted to 94,000,000 gulden . 10 The Southern and the Lombard-Venetian Rail- way remained in possession of the state . It is interesting to note that the conclusion of this agreement was kept secret from the public until it had been actually signed . It was a bitter blow to the Rothschilds ; they who had laid the foundations of the Austrian monarchy's railway system, and who had been so anxious to get under their own control the railways from the extreme north to the extreme south, now had to see their Nordbahn being threatened by hostile rivals . Anselm Rothschild gave Baron Kubeck the most de- tailed explanation regarding the nature of the agreement that had been concluded, showing how unfavorable it had been to the State of Austria . They both condemned the affair as a \"disgraceful business .\" 11 A keen rivalry between the Credit Mobilier and the Rothschilds had now arisen in Austria too ; the former did all it could to depress Nordbahn shares on the Vienna Bourse, while the latter endeavored to do the same with regard to the shares of the new State Railway Com- pany .

As far as the authorities of the state were concerned, Anselm did not reveal any sign of his displeasure and when, in February, 1855, the Empress Elizabeth was ex- pecting her first child, he joined with the other bankers in generous contributions to philanthropic objects, in commemoration of the joyful event . There was one, pos- sibly accidental, fact indicating that during the last year Baron Sina had done more profitable business with the state, in that he expended 5,ooo gulden CC, whereas Anselm devoted only 4,000 gulden to similar objects .\" Secretly, however, Anselm, spurred on by his uncle James in Paris, was planning a counter, campaign against the menacing extension of the Credit Mobilier for which, with the assistance of Kiibeck and Metternich, he soon secured the support of the finance minister, and which he was soon able to put into operation . Meanwhile the Crimean War continued . The Roths- child Houses in the West supported the combatants in every way ; they underwrote the British war loan of £16,000,ooo while James took a large share in the great French September war loan of 750,000,000 francs . The Rothschild Houses also joined in granting a loan to Turkey, although it should be added that this was guar- anteed by England and France . By their actions the Rothschilds demonstrated their faith in the final victory of the allies whose campaign in such a distant theater of war was necessarily something of an adventure . As, in England especially, large numbers of people had lost their confidence in state securities owing to the war, the Rothschilds were able to acquire such bonds cheaply, and also to underwrite the loan at an advantageous rate . They were not mistaken in having confidence in any venture which England undertook ."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 335 After battles of varying success the fortress of Sebastopol fell in September, and the death of the Tsar Nicholas as well as the war weariness in Russia, gave the western Powers ground for hoping that the campaign would ter- minate speedily and victoriously . The Rothschilds had again backed the right horse, although it is true that in their position it was impossible for them to consider any other . They could, however, have remained aloof from any financial participation, and, as we have seen, they did not do so . As soon as they realized that they could not prevent the war, they placed themselves at the service of their countries' interests ; and as the Crimean War ended successfully, it also served to increase the enor- mous wealth and to raise the reputation of their House . In this respect the year 1855 was a particularly satis- factory one for the House of Rothschild . But for the family it was destined to be a year of mourning, for no less than three of the five brothers died in that year . The first was Carl, who died on March 1o, 1855, at the age of sixty-seven, after surviving for only two years the death of his gifted and witty wife, Adelheid . He left three sons . The eldest of them, Meyer Carl, was destined to take over the important position at Frankfort, as Amschel had had no children . The youngest one, Adolph, who was then twenty-seven years old, took over the direction of the Naples House, which even then had a very restricted im- portance, and whose continuance was dependent upon the Bourbons remaining in power at Naples . The business with Sardinia and the Pope had a long time ago passed out of the control of Naples into that of the Paris House . Adolph had married Julia, the daughter of Anselm of Vienna .

Since he had vanished from the scene at Vienna, he had had no further influence on the business of his House, and since 1849 he had been left out of account because the other members of his House did not agree with his attitude during and after the revolution . Now at last his eldest son Anselm formally took charge of the Vienna House . Anselm endeavored to save what he could of the old position of his House ; indeed, a long time before his father's death he had already succeeded in delivering the first counter attack upon the Credit Mo- bilier . With the support of the Austrian ambassador in Paris, Isaac Pereire had made proposals to the govern- ment of the imperial state for founding a concern in Vienna on similar lines to the Credit Mobilier . He had, however, been anticipated by Rothschild, who had brought together a group of highly influential aristo- crats, such as the Princess Fi rstenberg, Schwarzenberg and Auersperg, and Count Chotek ; the Austrian finance ministry having granted permission to the group that was led by Rothschild and Lamel to found a Credit In- stitute for Trade and Industry, which w w as to have many of the essential characteristics of the Credit Mobilier although it was conceived by the founders solely as a means of keeping the Credit Mobilier out of Austria . Of of the 500,000 shares at 200 gulden, two-fifths were re- served for the promoters of the company, the articles of association providing that they should pay up one-third of the nominal value of these shares . After clever propa- ganda, the remainder were speedily taken up by the pub- lic . The shares soon rose extraordinarily in value, rising to double their nominal values at later periods, in the so-called founders' years . The policy of the Credit Insti- tute was, however, more cautious and conservative than that of the Credit Mobilier, a fact which was soon to be painfully obvious . Meanwhile Amschel Meyer, the head of the Frankfort House, who was eighty-two and the eldest of the five"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 337 brothers, had fallen seriously ill .

In his later years Bismarck was fond of telling a - story in which Amschel Meyer made fun of himself . Having called in the doctor at the age of eighty-one, when he was ill, Amschel Meyer thought that his end was near . The doc- tor examined him and replied, \"What are you thinking of, baron? You may live to be a hundred .\" Thereupon Amschel Meyer replied with a smile, \"What are you talking about? If God can get me for 8r, he won't take me at a hundred!\" Throughout his life Amschel kept as aloof as possible from politics . A conservative by instinct, he was friendly to Austria and did not wish to have anything to do with extravagant schemes such as Zionism . He expressed his views strongly in 1845, explaining to Bernhard Behrend that the redemption of the Jews could be brought about only by the will of God, and that he regarded the idea of purchasing a particular area of land in North America for the settlement of the Jews as a stuss (stuht) with which he would have nothing to do . 13 Old Amschel Meyer was remarkable for his keen un- derstanding and his wide knowledge of human nature, and was always ready to treat intelligent and real persons al par ; . He regarded personal interest as the main incen- tive to human action . He remained true to his religion until he died, ate nothing but kosher food, and enjoyed discussing theological subjects . Meyer Carl, the eldest son of the Naples Rothschild, who had for some time assisted him in the management of the Frankfort bank was indicated as his natural successor . The Frankfort firm thus acquired a capable and businesslike chief .

As the heir to the dead man's private property he came into a rich inheritance which he largely devoted to the exten- sion of his art collections . Of the five brothers who had been scattered over Eu- rope, only one now survived . This was the youngest, James Rothschild of Paris, who was now more than sixty- three years old and was tacitly regarded as the chief by all members of the House . He had followed with no little concern the develop- ment of the Crimean War, but when the allied armies returned victorious he congratulated himself and his brother on the attitude which they had adopted during the campaign . The new tsar was . more ready to conclude peace than his predecessor Nicholas had been . At the end of February, 1856, the peace conference met on the Seine, and a month later peace was concluded . France thereby acquired a dominating position on the Continent and this increase in her prestige reacted favorably upon her finances . This time the Credit Mobilier achieved the cli- max of its career ; French rentes stood very high and the shares in that undertaking, which yielded ten per cent in 1852, yielded 44 per cent in 1855, the shares being quoted on the bourse at the highest point which they ever touched, namely, 2,000 . They were destined thereafter constantly to decline until the inevitable collapse of a concern with such extensive aims . At that time however, after the victorious conclusion of the Crimean War, France was pervaded with the spirit of courage and en- terprise . Austria, unable to make up her mind as to what she wanted during the whole of the Crimean War, had sub- stantially increased her financial difficulties without achieving any concrete political advantage . She therefore had to consider how she could get ready money by dis- posing of the remainder of her state railways . It was in this connection that the Credit Institute founded by the"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 339 Rothschild group won its first spurs . To the great annoy- ance of the newly founded State Railway Company pat- ronized by the Credit Mobilier, it succeeded in register- ing the considerable success implied by the acquisition of the Lombard-Venetian railway system . On May 14, 1856, the agreement with the Credit Institute was com- pleted, the Englishmen Talbot and Laing, as well as the French Duke of Galliera, being parties to it . Austria received the sum of roo,ooo,ooo Austrian lire, payable in convenient yearly instalments, and partly out of the realized profits of the concern . This success showed the Credit Mobilier that the Rothschilds were able to stand up to them in Austria . The London, Paris, and Vienna banks were represented in the concern, as well as the Princess Schwarzenberg and Furstenberg, who had joined in the foundation of the Credit Institute . The Rothschilds, having now acquired a substantial proportion of the railways in Austria, proceeded to think out further extensive schemes . In September, 1856, they planned to construct railways in Moldavia and Wal- lachia, as an extension to the Austrian railways in Sieben- burgen, and to carry these on to the Black Sea via Buchar- est .\"' The Austrian authorities took a friendly attitude with regard to the grant of a concession to construct those por- tions of the railway which would lead to the Wallachian frontier . While these extensive schemes were under considera- tion, an incident occurred which seriously affected the Paris House and created a considerable sensation . Peo- ple had grown accustomed to regarding the Rothschild banks and all their undertakings as thoroughly efficiently managed and their officials as being absolutely reliable ; it therefore came as a great shock when, in September, 1856, the Rothschild principal accountant of the North- ern Railway of France, whose name was Carpentier, dis-"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"34o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild appeared, together with another official, after having embezzled millions . The thieves fled to America, and it was not until a considerable proportion of the money had been irrevocably lost that their arrest was effected . The Paris House assumed full responsibility for the loss, and did not allow the others to share it . No one de- rived greater satisfaction from this incident than the two brothers Pereire . Their own success was at this time be- ginning to wear somewhat thin, and although they ex- tended their operations over an ever widening field, even bringing Mexico within their range, they were constantly losing ground with their more solid business associates . The news which Anselm received at Vienna regarding the way things were going, encouraged him to a more aggressive competition with the Credit Mobilier . He did not fail, however, to follow his father's example, and when necessary, to intervene on behalf of his Jewish co-religionists . On August 8 he begged Count Buol- Schauenstein 15 for a \"warm and timely word\" on behalf of the Jews in Vienna . He made a similar appeal 18 to the Austrian envoy to the Vatican, as he had received a heartrending petition from the Israelite Community in Rome . Lionel, the head of the British House, was at that time also fighting for the emancipation of the Jews in Eng- land . His brilliant social position, which was reenforced by the skill with which his brothers Meyer and Anthony had made themselves popular in English society, through their love of art and sport, marked him out as a redoubta- ble protagonist of the cause . His dinners and parties were masterpieces of taste and magnificence . In March, 1867, he had married his daughter Leonore to Alfons Roths- child, James's son and the heir to the Paris bank . By acquiring Gunnersbury House, which had formerly been the country place of Princess Amelie, the aunt of King George III, Lionel had established himself in a magnificent residence . If there was anyone who could"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 341 intervene effectively on behalf of the emancipation of the Jews it was he. So far, however, although he had been elected three times to the House of Commons, he had not been allowed to take his seat on the ground that he refused to take the prescribed oath, in which he would have had to confess himself a Christian . Lionel meant to remain a Jew, and to force his way into the House of Commons . All England took an interest in this struggle, which was the actual occasion for raising the question of Jewish emancipation . Lionel found a powerful ally in Benjamin Disraeli, the friend of his House, who although he had himself become a Christian warmly supported Lionel in his en- deavors . In 1857 Lionel was elected to the House of Commons for the fourth time, but the House of Lords still refused to accept the alteration in the formula of the oath although the House of Commons had voted in favor of changing the oath . Lord Derby, who in 1858 became prime minister for the second time, and in whose ministry Disraeli held office as chancellor of the exchequer, had so far always proclaimed himself an opponent of Jewish emancipation . Now, however, he and his colleagues in the cabinet were persuaded by Disraeli's tireless efforts, to agree to a compromise ; namely, that the nature of the oath to be taken by its members should be left to each House to decide . The House of Commons was therefore free if it wished to devise a special formula for Jews, while the House of Lords could say that it was not con- cerned with the conditions under which members should be admitted to the other House . The motion was speedily carried through both Houses and Rothschild was thereby enabled to take the oath under the altered formula, on July 26, 1858 . When he entered the House it was packed . In deep silence he was led to the table by Lord John Russell, who had always supported the principle of equal rights for all citizens . He bowed to the Speaker, and took the oath on the"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"142 \t The Reign of the Douse of Rothschild Hebrew Bible, substituting for the words \"on the true faith of a Christian\" the words \"so help me, Jehovah .\" Thereupon the Speaker shook hands with him, and he took his seat on the side of the Liberal party, the House still maintaining a deep silence . Thus a struggle of eleven years was ended by Jews being admitted to the House of Commons . Lionel took little active part in politics . He devoted his energies principally to important business undertak- ings, especially those in Austria . Anselm, encouraged by his success with the Lombard-Venetian railways, had again taken up the scheme of getting control of the Siid- bahn, that is, of the line from Vienna to Trieste . The Aus- trian State had grossly mismanaged this line financially, and there was no money for further construction . Approximately the same group, under the leadership of the Rothschilds, who had acquired the Lombard-Vene- tian railway, now turned their attention to the Siidbahn . They felt that they would thus acquire an undertaking which would greatly enhance their prestige, and whose shares would be an admirable speculative investment . Moreover, it would be possible to arrange to pay the pur- chase price in instalments over a period of several years . The company accordingly obtained the concession for the Southern State Railway as well, and as a result the railways of Upper Italy became united with the Southern Railway in a single concern . The transaction was carried through with such techni- cal skill on its financial side that the purchasing syndicate was enabled to show a highly substantial profit on its con- clusion . One consequence of the transaction was that large numbers of foreigners, especially of French officials and engineers, were taken on the strength of the railway, which was to constitute the chief link between the Italian provinces and the monarchy . All this happened just be- fore the campaign of 1859, at a time when the activities"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 343 of Sardinia's highly gifted prime minister had for some time been watched with growing concern . How little fear there was of any war with France was indicated by the fact that this important railway was left to a group con- sisting mainly of French capitalists . Meanwhile Cavour had been deliberately proceeding with his preparations for the unification of Italy under the scepter of the only native dynasty that ruled in any of the Italian states, that is, under the liberal kingdom of Piedmont . The Sardinian statesman perceived that the dearest wish of himself and his people could only be achieved by war, and he accordingly set about developing the com- mercial and military resources of the country . All this was done secretly, commercial measures often serving the purpose of concealing his war aims . When in 1856 Cavour required a loan for the purpose of strengthening the military power of the state, he advanced the pretext of railway and other construction, more particularly the construction of a tunnel through the Mont Cenis, where- by the shortest route from Turin to Lyons was to be established . Cavour clearly showed what was in his mind in a confidential letter to the director-general of the treasury, Count T . di S . Rosa . \"I share your opinion,\" he wrote to him on August 22, 1856, from Turin, 17 \"that it will be necessary to issue a loan ; but such an operation must be justified by reasons which will not give rise to the opinion that we require it in preparation for war . Such a motive is quite naturally supplied by the conquest of the Mont Cenis . If therefore you speak to Rothschild about any proposal for a loan avoid saying anything that might lead him to suppose that we are contemplating a terza riscossa (third resump- tion of war) . Tell him that we want to drive a tunnel through the Mont Cenis and to build the line from Bardonneche to Susa at the expense of the State, which will involve an expenditure of thirty-six million .\""},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"344 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Cavour fully realized that his small state with its few million inhabitants could not make war upon Austria alone, and that he required allies . Sardinia was now to have her reward for participating in the Crimean War . Napoleon showed a benevolent interest in the efforts for the unification of Italy . The Crimean War having been successful, he was then at the height of his power ; he was not to realize until i 87o what a grievous mistake this war had been, through which he had made an enemy of the tsar, who threatened Prussia's rear . Austria had taken no part in the campaign, but Sardinia, with her beggarly five millions of inhabitants, had, although God knows what interest she could have had in the Crimea . Her action had been wise, for it was only with Napoleon's help that she could hope to detach Lombardy and Venice from the imperial state of Austria . Napoleon showed himself well disposed to Italy's efforts at unification, a fact which naturally reacted upon France's relations with Austria . Napoleon welcomed any opportunity for punishing Austria for her dubious attitude during the Crimean War . Austria's representative in Paris, Count Hiibner, as well as her consul-general James Rothschild, occasionally heard very unfriendly words said about that country .\" These dangerous developments were closely followed by James as well as by Adolph in Naples and Anselm in Vienna . A war between France and Austria, fought on Italian territory, must necessarily be exceedingly dan- gerous for the Rothschild Houses established in those three countries, especially now that they had acquired such a large interest in the railways within the Italian provinces of Austria and in Austria herself . In such cir- cumstances military developments might have the most catastrophic consequences, and it was therefore essential to avert the menace of war . Adolph Rothschild was him- self firmly convinced that in view of the fact that Louis"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 345 Napoleon had always been so intimately concerned with Italy, he had his eye upon the king of Naples too .\" Meanwhile, the conspiracy started and actively pro- moted by Cavour continued on its course . Orsini's attempt upon the life of Napoleon III on January 4, 1858, pro- voked by the monarch's somewhat sluggish interest in Italy's interests, hastened the emperor's decision to inter- vene actively in support of the unification of Italy . The secret conversations between Cavour and Napoleon were naturally kept strictly concealed from Austria . On De- cember to, 1858, the emperor finally concluded the secret alliance between France and Sardinia, undertaking to come to her assistance in the event of an attack by Aus- tria . Cavour could be relied upon to see that that country should finally lose her patience and attack Piedmont, which would be necessary in order to put Austria in the wrong with regard to the world in general . In December, 1858, the Paris press 20 started a cam- paign against Austria which made James Rothschild very uneasy . He asked the emperor for an audience in order to call attention to this campaign . He said that he was particularly concerned about an article which had appeared in the Moniteur on December 4, and caused very considerable excitement . Napoleon was much upset by what James had to say ; he admitted that he had him- self inspired the article, a fact of which Rothschild was not aware. During this conversation the emperor was pensive and uncommunicative . When James pressed him to say something reassuring, the monarch asseverated that he had no intention of making any changes in Italy . Thereupon James appeared somewhat reassured and the funds, which had been gravely depressed, began to re- cover moderately . Even after this audience, however, James was not completely easy in his mind ; and a remark of Napoleon's at the New Year's reception of 1859 was again to plunge him into a state of alarm . On this occa-"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"346 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild sion, after being particularly friendly to all the other diplomats present, the emperor turned to the Austrian representative and said to him : \"I regret that our rela- tions with the Austrian Government are not as good as they have been in the past, but I would request you to inform the Emperor that my personal feelings for him are unchanged .\" The diplomats, including Hubner, did not see any- thing unusual in this remark at first . Paris, however, took an entirely different view, and everyone was talking about an imminent war with Austria, which the emperor was obviously planning . Neither did James share Hiibner's sanguine attitude . On the bourse and among the leading financiers there was a positive panic, and Napoleon de- cided that it would be advisable to mitigate the effect of his words . He therefore prompted the Moniteur and the papers which supported him to interpret the incident in a reassuring manner, and this had some effect upon the bourse . James, however, continued to be skeptical . On January 8 he went once more to see the emperor, who again painted the position couleur de rose . As Napoleon also said that he had no intention of offending Hubner by his remark, James returned home satisfied in his mind, and took the necessary steps to bring about a rise in public securities . The panic seemed to be stemmed, but no sooner had the nervousness been somewhat allayed than it be- came known that Prince Napoleon had become engaged to Princess Clothilde, the daughter of Victor Emmanuel . This news produced another terrible slump on the Paris Bourse, rentes dropping on January i r from 72 .30 to 62 .80 .

James's efforts in this direction were, however, fruitless, as there was a complete lack of confidence everywhere . During a hunt over the imperial estates James again asked Napo- leon about his plans with regard to Italy, saying that he had been horrified to learn that troops had been sent to Bologna and Ancona . Napoleon replied that Austria ap- parently intended to attack Piedmont . Rothschild main- tained that Napoleon's policy was mistaken . He reminded him of what he had said at Bordeaux : \"The Empire is peace .\" At a Tuileries ball at this time Rothschild turned this remark round, saying to one of the ministers in his bad French : \"Ententez fous, bas de baix, bas d'Em- bire .\" 22 General de la Rue had the hardihood to repeat this quip to the emperor, but the latter was not amused . At that time Austria had sent an envoy to London to enter into negotiations with Rothschild for a loan . Lionel asked James to take a share in it, but he hesitated on account of the political situation, and the danger that the state which was asking for the loan might soon be in- volved in a war . James again contrived to have a word with the emperor in order to ask him whether he might underwrite the Austrian loan, or part of it . He wanted to insure that the"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"348 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild emperor would not regard any such action as indicating an unfriendly attitude toward France, on the part of the House of Rothschild, and he also wanted to observe how the emperor would react to this suggestion . Napoleon did not betray his feelings and gave James permission to act as he wished in the matter of the Austrian loan . He may well have reflected to himself that the wise old banker was entering upon an exceedingly risky business . On January 29, 1859, the marriage between Prince Na- poleon and Princess Clothilde of Savoy was celebrated . The extraordinary haste with which this marriage was concluded caused a general sensation, dangerous' political motives being quite rightly suspected . \"Everybody is nervous,\" Hi bner reported . 23 \"People take alarm at any- thing, and fear makes men cowards .\" James Rothschild was the subject of conflicting emo- tions . He was in favor of peace and his sympathies were with conservative Austria, which country, Anselm told him, desired nothing less than to be forced into a war by Italian attempts at secession and by Cavour's machina- tions . On the other hand, he did not like to see such an old client as Sardinia being lost to the Rothschild bank through her warlike policy, and being driven into the arms of other financiers . The war was not yet an actuality ; perhaps things would not go so far, and in that case he did not want to lose Sardinia's custom . As early as the middle of i858, when the Senate at Turin had sanctioned a further loan, Cavour had entered into negotiations with Rothschild, but on that occasion he had felt that Roths- child was too high and mighty . At the beginning of 1 859, Rothschild himself had suggestion for a loan put before Cavour . James's motive for so doing was, as much as anything, to see how things stood, and he was determined that if Cavour really intended to make war on Austria, he would, in spite of everything, refuse to give him the money, so long as the danger of war continued . Cavour, however, was delighted that Rothschild had"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 349 this time come of his own accord . \"The Herren von Rothschild,\" he wrote to Prince Napoleon, 24 \"have in- formed us that they would be prepared to make us an offer .

If they are pre- pared to undertake the loan on the basis of payments being in definite instalments, we shall easily come to an understanding with them ; but if, as I fear, they only mean to deal with the matter on a commission basis, we shall have to look elsewhere . The firm of S . Paul has offered us its assistance, and as it is more enterprising than the Rothschilds it is possible that it will underwrite what we want to place in Paris . As a last resource there remains the offer of the Credit Mobilier, which Bixio has put before me . We shall have to accept it if we cannot do better .\" Cavour had at that time authorized the Marquis Mon- ticelli in Paris to negotiate regarding the loan of fifty millions . He hoped that with the assistance of Prince Napoleon, who was now a son-in-law of his king, the matter would go through somehow or other ; he meant to float part of the loan himself in Italy . The terms offered by the Credit Mobilier were rather stiff, but Cavour said, \"If after divorcing the Rothschilds we marry MM . Pereire, I think we shall get on very well together .\" 26 Cavour was perfectly right to rely rather more on the Credit Mobilier, for James Rothschild and several other bankers soon perceived the objects for which Sardinia required the money, and declared that they would not supply any money for war . 2 ' Count Walewski, the min- ister for foreign affairs, who was naturally acting in concert with his imperial master, and with Cavour, wish- ing to reassure them said : \"Gentlemen, if that is your"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"35o \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild only difficulty, you need not hesitate to undertake the loan, for there will not be a war . I assure you that for the moment there won't be one .\" The \"pour le moment\" was certainly not calculated to reassure James and the other bankers . A pacific article which appeared in the Moniteur of March ,5 was in- tended to emphasize the good-will underlying the min- ister's words ; but it did not carry conviction . Five days later an inflammatory article appeared in the Constitu- tionnel to the effect that Austria could not and would not yield . \"The funds are falling,\" Hiibner reported ;\" \"early this morning Rothschild called on me in a state of great alarm, and he was closely followed by the Duke of Gal- liera and a crowd of curious and interested persons who, knowing that I am a man of few words, hope at any rate to guess from my expression whether they should buy or sell .\" Sardinia, however, had refused to accept Fould's ex- ceedingly oppressive terms, and she had succeeded in floating the whole loan in Italy without the assistance of the Paris bankers . \"More money was brought to us than we could accept,\" Cavour wrote to his banker friend, 28 and he reported with satisfaction to Nigra : \"The loan has gone through quite splendidly . The populace came in masses to the sub- scription offices . By collecting a large number of small amounts we have obtained the millions which the Paris bankers refused to supply .

Even the emperor hesitated for a moment, and Cavour himself, on visiting Paris at the end of March, was gravely concerned as to the success of his plans . In the end, however, Austria started the ball rolling by her unwise and premature ultimatum of April 23, whereby she provided Cavour with the pre- text which, according to his own words, he had constantly been awaiting in order to go to war, and put herself in the wrong with regard to the world at large . The Rothschilds were again forced to realize that the times were past when, as in 1830 and in 1840, they had been able positively to prevent wars through their influ- ence . This had already been apparent in the revolutionary period of 1848-49, and in the case of the Crimean War . The declaration of war at the end of April, 1859, caused the greatest dismay to the whole of the House of Roths- child, and especially to its three branches in Paris, Vi- enna, and Naples . We must remember that they had only just bought all the Lombard-Venetian railways-the very railways that would be in the theater of war, as well as the Siidbahn, which would be entirely devoted to mili- tary purposes . And they were interested in countless other loans, schemes, and undertakings in the three countries affected by the war . The consequences were bound to be immeasurable . French rentes, which stood at 68 in the middle of April, had already fallen to 6o by May 3 . Angrily James said to himself that this \"third-class"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"352 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild Napoleon,\" who with cynical scorn ignored the peace promises which he had made so emphatically before the whole world, would come to a much sadder end than his uncle, although he had had extraordinarily good luck so far . The aged James felt that his hands were tied, and that he could but watch the development of events as a spectator . With concern he noted the great suc- cess of the war loan . Was he mistaken, he wondered, and were the emperor and his rash and unsubstantial finan- cial advisers, Pereire and Mires to prove to be right, and he himself, with his solid, conservative, and logical views to prove wrong? Events seemed to justify such considerations as these . War broke out in May, and Aus- tria's armies, which were commanded by an incompe- tent general, were defeated by the French and Sardinian troops, whose union the general foolishly did nothing to prevent, at Magenta and Solferino . The armistice of Villafranca was concluded fairly speedily, on July 8, i 859, and to the considerable dis- appointment of Cavour, who had meant to conquer not only Lombardy but Venice as well, it was followed quite soon afterward by peace preliminaries . The unsuccessful issue of the war resulted for Aus- tria in the younger branches of the Hapsburgs being deprived of their rule in Tuscany, Parma, and Modena . The Rothschilds had business connections in all these states ; their interests were everywhere affected, and when they attempted to save what they could, Austria re- proached them for doing business with the newly estab- lished revolutionary governments in those territories . When on August 22, 1859, French newspapers pub- lished the news that the new government of Tuscany had concluded a loan with the Paris House of Rothschild, Count Rechberg telegraphed indignantly to Hi bner's successor, Prince Richard Metternich, the son of the chancellor, who had been appointed to Paris after the armistice, instructing him immediately to ask James"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"From the Crimean War to the Italian War 353 about this, and to report whether the statement were cor- rect .$' James and his eldest son were away at the time and in their absence Gustave von Rothschild explained 32 that there was no question of a new loan, but that it was the balance of a loan of ioo,ooo,ooo lire, which had been first contracted as long ago as 1852 and which was only gradually being placed on the market . He stated that the new government had asked the House of Rothschild to deal with this, because the whole matter had passed through its hands since the start . Count Rechberg had to content himself with this explanation . Austria's influ- ence in Italy was at an end, while the Vienna House of Rothschild, which might more easily have been brought to book, put the blame on the French House, saying that it had nothing whatever to do with these matters . The appointment of Prince Richard Metternich, the son of Solomon's great friend, as ambassador in Paris, was exceedingly welcome to the Rothschilds . They hoped to establish as good relations with him as they had en- joyed with Austria's Paris representative in the days be- fore Hiibner . The increase in Napoleon's power, resulting from this successful war, produced alarm in England resulting in a nervous tension which was not without its effect upon the relations between the two countries . At that time peo- ple were eagerly discussing the news from Cuba, in which there was a growing movement for secession from Spain, and in favor of union with North America . England tended to sympathize with the United States, while France's sympathies were on the side of her Latin sister . This served to increase the prevailing irritation between the two countries, which was expressed in sharp press attacks on both sides of the Channel .

England had continued to hope that the war of 1859 would terminate without France's obtaining any accession of territory . Napoleon had, however, achieved his desire . \"The example given by France,\" Lionel Rothschild remarked to the Saxon diplomat, Count Vitzthum, 34 who was in London at the time, \"is dangerously catching . There will be no ground for surprise if England avails herself of the first opportunity of securing possession of Sicily and Egypt . Nor will it now be possible to prevent the United States from annexing Cuba .\" The Rothschild fears were unjustified . They thought Napoleon, who had so far been successful in all his rash military undertakings, capable of the wildest schemes, especially as they realized how much he was disposed to emulate the great deeds of his uncle . He had avenged 1812 by the Crimean War : was it not a natural infer- ence therefore that he would now proceed to take vengeance upon England, the most relentless foe of the first Napoleon . The Rothschilds were, however, mistaken . Napoleon by no means felt that the moment had arrived to break with England . He did not feel strong enough, and he could not forget that Palmerston had been the first to recognize him as emperor .

Nevertheless I do not hesitate to maintain that the Em- peror does not want such a war, and that there will be no breach this year . . . .\" Vitzthum was proved right . The Rothschilds were spared the disaster of an Anglo-French war, but there were plenty of other things happening in the world that exercised a profound influence on the various Rothschild Houses . The fact that Austria's position had suffered through the war naturally reacted upon her finances when in April, 186o, that state issued a loan of -oo,ooo,ooo gulden, which was especially difficult to negotiate, since nobody had regained complete confidence in the imperial state . The finance minister went to Anselm at Vienna to ask him to underwrite as much of the loan as he could, and also requested Metternich in Paris to induce James to underwrite twenty-five out of the two hundred millions . James was very ready to meet him . \"He will gladly put his name at the disposal of the Imperial finances,\" Met- ternich reported,S6 \"and he will today inform the Vienna House to this effect .\" James called on Prince Metternich on April 8, to- gether with his eldest son, Alfons, whom he was already bringing into the most important transactions . He made it a condition that the 25,ooo,ooo gulden should be under- written not by his House alone, but by the joint Houses of the brothers Rothschild, which were lending their"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"356 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild names in order to assist in the success of the loan, but were not undertaking any responsibility for it 37 The loan was very much damaged by the events lead- ing up to the suicide of the Austrian finance minister, Baron Bruck, who was falsely accused of having been concerned in malpractices in connection with army con- tracts, the incident occurring just at this time . At first only 76,000,000 gulden were subscribed, and it was not until public opinion had been reassured, and it was rec- ognized that there was a serious intention to restore order in the financial administration of the state, that Anselm Rothschild in Vienna was successful in his efforts to bring the loan to a satisfactory conclusion . He was re- warded for his services in April, 186, by being appointed a life member of the Austrian House of Lords . Mean- while in the south of Europe the storm clouds gathered about the state of Naples . The movement for the uni- fication of Italy, which owing to the French occupation of Rome had been brought up short at the gates of that city, next concentrated upon the kingdom of Naples and Sicily . The march of Garibaldi's thousand men caused Sicily to secede in May, 186o, and the bold volunteer leader proceeded to transfer his efforts to the mainland at Naples . On September 4, i86o, Garibaldi had reached the capital, in which the king and his banker Adolph Rothschild were awaiting the course of events in Paris . On September 6, the king withdrew, with the troops that had remained loyal to him, to Gaeta, and Adolph Roths- child also left the unfriendly city, which was shortly afterward entered by Garibaldi . The king had not suc- ceeded in taking with him on his flight the money de- posited in the state coffers, and he very soon found himself in serious financial difficulties .

The king therefore sent a courier to Paris to ask for a loan of one and a half million francs . Meanwhile the Austrian government, which naturally supported the maintenance ' of the Bourbon regime in Naples,, had informed the king that it would endeavor to secure financial assistance for him .\" In doing so it had Anselm Rothschild in mind, and hoped that it would be possible to induce him to grant King Francis a loan . Thereupon the king first asked for 6oo,ooo to 900,000 francs, being the equivalent of i 50,000-aoo,ooo Neapoli- tan ducats ; shortly afterwards he increased his request to 5oo,ooo ducats .\" The situation had, however, grown very much worse by the middle of October, i 86o . Piedmont attacked Naples, and King Victor Emmanuel joined forces with Garibaldi . Napoleon's fleet was still living off Gaeta in support of the King of Naples, but it was already coming to be recognized in Paris and at the imperial court, that it was not possible to offer any continuous opposition to Italy's spontaneous movement for unification, which had also found support in England. James was of the same opinion, and through his connections he soon learned that Napoleon intended to withdraw his fleet from Gaeta, and to leave the King of Naples to his fate . He therefore discouraged Adolph's suggestion of granting a loan to the king in his difficulties, and also warned Anselm in Vienna, who was left no peace by Rechberg, against pro- viding any money for the kingdom of Naples . Rechberg therefore was met with a refusal and had to inform the king that, in spite of his promises, he was unable to as- sist, 40 since Austria was in financial difficulties herself, and could only have come to his support through the mediation of a bank . \"And,\" he wrote, \"it is no use blinking the fact that_ ti -"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"358 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild the unfortunate issue of the recent fighting has seriously affected our prospects in this matter .\" Thus the financial position of the king, who, with his brave consort, Queen Maria, was facing things coura- geously at Gaeta, soon became desperate . \"Think of it,\" the king said 41 to the Austrian Captain Frantzl, who was staying with him . \"Russia won't give me anything lest she should displease the Emperor Na- poleon .

Finally, even Na- poleon withdrew his fleet from Gaeta on January 20, 1861 . Rations were now cut off, and the king decided to capitulate on February 13, 1861 . Thus the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies came to an end and was merged in the new Italy . Adolph Rothschild had remained loyal to the Bourbon regime . He had not foreseen the actual de- velopment of events, and had not been able, or had not wished, to adapt himself in time to the new conditions . He therefore left Naples for good . The Naples branch, which in any case had ceased long ago to be productive for the joint Houses of the Rothschilds, was liquidated, and Adolph returned to Frankfort with his brothers . However, until the end of his life he maintained the most cordial relations with their dethroned Majesties, which clearly shows that they were grateful to him for his attitude at the time when they were in the greatest peril .

They built railways in Brazil ; they established offices in the South of the United States for the purchase of wool, which they shipped to France, where they marketed it . Being no longer able to use their enormous funds prin- cipally in national loans, as they had been doing in the past, they bought up whole tobacco harvests for sup- plying the tobacco requirements of the various states . Their own ships carried the enormous cargoes between the, United States and France ; it was natural that, hav- ing such extensive commercial interests, the Rothschilds should anxiously watch the course of political events in the two countries . When the war of secession broke out in America, the Rothschilds, whose interests were prin- cipally in the southern states, supported the Confeder- ates . When they were defeated, the Rothschilds' Ameri- can businenss was seriously affected . The Rothschilds took up a skeptical attitude toward the rash attempt of Napoleon and the-Empress Eugenie to found an empire in Mexico, in which Maximilian of tAustria and Charlotte of Belgium were sacrificed, and they took practically no part in the loans issued for that purpose, which were later to involve the French sub- scribers in such heavy loss . They were content to leave these to the Credit Mobilier of the brothers Pereire whom Napoleon III had preferred to them, but whose posi- tion was not nearly so firmly secured as that of the Rothschild bank, which political circumstances had put 360"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The &ventf ut Years \t 361 in the background, although it had nearly a century of history behind it . After the war of 1859 the Credit Mobilier had exces- sive commitments and liabilities . Its shares were quoted at about Boo and the amount still standing to the credit of profit and loss account in 1859 had completely disap- peared from the balance sheet by i 86o . Large dividends were still paid in order to maintain confidence, but they were paid out of capital . This bank suffered a serious blow through the fall of another rival of the Rothschilds, the notorious Mires, who had been working hand in glove with an unscrupulous press, and had been sup- ported by persons holding the highest positions in France . The career of this financial swindler had been truly amazing . Apart from acquiring an enormous fortune, he had succeeded in marrying his daughter to a Prince de Polignac . The result of his arrest in 1861 was all the more terrible . When it was no longer possible to con- ceal the innumerable irregularities of which he had been guilty, and when it also became known that the Duke of Morny and other men closely associated with the government had had dealings with Mires, people in Paris began to say that the government was a party to what had occurred . The Rothschild bank had held aloof from the activi- ties of Mires and his fellows, if for no other reason, be- cause they belonged to the other camp, and the fact that they were not in any way involved in his fall constituted a certain triumph . All was not well at this time with France's finances in general . In 1854, 1855, and 1859 there had been issues of rente loans to an amount no less than 2,000,000,000, and in 1861 a further 132,000,- ooo had been subscribed by the public . It was not possible to count upon the public for the continuance of such generous cooperation . In these dif- ficult circumstances Fould, who in November, 186o, had given up the portfolio which he had held since 1852,"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"362 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild attempted to get back into the saddle . In September, 1861, he submitted to the emperor a memorandum which gave a picture of the financial situation in France that was even darker than the facts, and at the same time sug- gested ways and means for putting France's house in order . Napoleon again took on the statesman whom he had favored since he had come into power, published his memorandum, and appointed him finance minister on November 14, 1861, with instructions to deal with the floating debt of nearly a billion . This appointment particularly delighted the chiefs of the Credit Mobilier, since they hoped that M . Fould would facilitate the operation which the company meant to carry through, in order to be able to pay further divi- dends to its shareholders . The only person who was dis- pleased was the empress, who had always disliked Fould because of his opposition to her marriage . She shed a few tears and then reconciled herself to the facts ; but she was to prove right in her judgment . Fould was not the financial genius that he had made Napoleon believe him to be ; but Fould had come to realize one thing : in spite of all the support that the state might give it, the Credit Mobilier could not carry through to a successful issue the struggle against the firmly entrenched House of Rothschild, which had ramifications in so many countries of Europe and based its strength everywhere upon enor- mous real assets . Fould had already taken up a more cautious attitude toward this undertaking, having obtained a pretty ex- tensive knowledge of its resources from his brother, who was in its employ . When shortly afterward, encouraged by Fould's appointment, the Credit Mobilier sought to obtain a monopoly of the state's credit business-an omnium, as it was called-he advised the emperor not to accede to this request, as going a great deal too far . As early as January, 1862, only two months after tak-"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"The Eventful Years \t 363 ing office, Fould made a much more favorable report on the finances, being helped by the fact that his earlier report had exaggerated the evils of the situation . He then attempted the exceedingly daring experiment of converting the ii,ooo,ooo,ooo of rentes from 4/ to 3% . This transaction hung fire, and would have been a com- plete failure if Fould had not effected a certain rap- prochement with the House of Rothschild . As early as February, 1862, there was a rumor in Paris to the effect that the House had come to Fould's assistance and that the secret purchaser who had been effecting purchases of rentes on the bourse in order to bring about a rise was none other than the House of Rothschild . Fould was coming to the conclusion that it was time to give up fighting the Rothschilds . He admitted to him- self that they were a world power . Though the Credit Mobilier had established a firm footing abroad in Aus- tria, Italy, and Spain, and even on the other side of the Atlantic, the full burden of these developments had to be borne by the central bank in Paris ; it was not, like the Rothschilds, able to rely upon support by its own banks, each of which had control of ample resources in the great economic field of Europe . Napoleon too, whose feelings for the Rothschilds were really not friendly, had to admit this, and he was confirmed in this opinion by his wife . The first hint of this change of attitude reached the public on February 17, 1862, when Napoleon and Fould paid a visit to James Rothschild, to hunt with him on his magnificent estate at Ferrieres . It was indeed more than a visit, it was a veritable journey to Canossa . This was a severe reverse to the Credit Mobilier, for the visit was a clear indication that it was falling into disfavor in the highest quarters . It was being generally stated that Rothschild would now come to the assistance of the French state with a loan . Comic papers turned the in- cident to account in some exceedingly amusing sketches ."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"364 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild There could be no doubt that the hunt would serve as a pretext for discussing means of improving France's finances . The general public was not favored with any- thing more than the superficial statements usually issued in connection with interviews with monarchs ; but the general setting and the list of those taking part in the hunt, which included the British and Austrian ambassa- dors and the ministers for foreign and home affairs, Walewski and Persigny, made it obvious that this was no ordinary house party . The Chateau Ferrieres lies in the middle of a mag- nificent park generously stocked with game, between the forests of Crecy and Armainvilliers . James Rothschild had purchased the property about i 82o from an impov- erished nobleman, and had immediately proceeded to demolish the smaller buildings and to improve the park and the gardens . The property had gradually been de- veloped by the Rothschilds into a princely estate, and they had also established on it a magnificent Dutch dairy, a merino sheep farm and a bakery . There were splendid stables, a riding-school, and a special riding-track . When Napoleon arrived at the station of Ferrieres in hunting-dress he was met by James Rothschild in a coach and four a la Daumont, the lackeys all wearing new dark blue gold-braided liveries . James's four sons helped their father to do the honors of the occasion .

After seeing the chateau, the emperor went the round of the gardens where, in accordance with custom, he planted a young cedar handed to him by the head gar- dener . Afterward a magnificent lunch was served in the hall, upon dishes of beautifully wrought old silver, while the guests ate off Sevres porcelain china that had been painted by Boucher . On the emperor's right sat his hostess, the Baroness Betty, and on his left was James . At half past twelve the shoot was on in the immense park, which was surrounded by a wall . Shots could be heard on all sides, almost as if a small war had broken out, and the emperor, accom- panied by two loaders, made use of eight guns to bring down the innumerable pheasants, partridges, hares, and rabbits . This imperial amusement cost the lives of 1,231 head of game . When the guests returned, weary, to the chateau, they found a buffet of the choicest delicacies, and from the gallery above the hall a choir from the Paris Opera sud- denly burst into a hunting song, the music of which had been specially composed by Rossini for this occasion . When he left the chateau in the evening the emperor rode through an alley of torches which stretched to the farthest bounds of the estate . The splendor of this occasion was no less than that with which Anton Fugger received Charles V at Augs- burg in his famous house in the Weinmarkt ; but it did not alter the fact that Napoleon continued to view the Rothschilds with distrust, while they on their side were unable entirely to forget the emperor's attitude to them since his accession to the throne .

They felt that her sympathy was more sincere, and that it was prompted by gratitude for their earlier attitude . Napoleon and the Rothschilds re- tained their antipathy to one another, even though their interests compelled them for the time being to march side by side. In foreign policy their different tempera- ments soon manifested themselves again . Napoleon was always influenced by the memory of his uncle and a ten- dency to feel that he ought to follow his example in many matters . When, in January, 1863, a further rising occurred in Poland, against the oppressive domination of Russia, Napoleon was very much tempted to intervene actively on the side of the Poles . The rich bankers and financiers, including the Roths- childs, were opposed to such an adventure . They did everything they could to induce the imperial government to have nothing to do with it ; and in fact, no action was taken . \"The peace of the world,\" Disraeli wrote at this time, to a woman friend,' \"has on this occasion been preserved not by statesmen but by capitalists .\" Meanwhile the Credit Mobilier was continuing to suffer reverses . The year 1864 was an unfortunate one on the bourse, and the failure of the Mexican loan in- volved it in loss . It was already apparent that the methods of the brothers Pereire, although covered by high-sound- ing phrases, were in essence nothing but rash spec- ulation . They were already having disputes in the court with persons whom they had treated unfairly . The brothers hoped that Napoleon would protect them, and he wished to do so but was unable to in view of public opinion . \"I shall do everything,\" the emperor said,' \"to support them, because the Empire is deeply indebted to them ; but I cannot afford to impede the course of justice, or to come into conflict with it .\""},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"The Eventful Years \t 367 As a result of these developments the value of the Credit Mobilier shares fell considerably, and the two Portuguese brothers lost the great position to which they had shot up all too rapidly . While the star of the Pereires was declining, the Roths- childs were coming to occupy a position of ever increas- ing importance in the court circles of the second empire, and this was not surprising in view of their relations to all the courts and monarchs of Europe . On December to, 1865, 8 King Leopold I of Belgium died-a royal patron who had had dealings with them throughout his life, and had deposited the sum of 5,ooo,ooo francs with them in 1848, which by the time of his death had already reached the considerable figure of 20,000,000 francs, 4 and came to form the cornerstone of the enormous fortune which the Empress Charlotte has only recently left in dying after nearly sixty years of mental affliction . While he was alive King Leopold had not confined himself to financial dealings with the Rothschilds, but had also paid them social attention, by which they al- ways set so much store . He had visited them at Ferrieres and, like Napoleon, had planted a tree which, together with his name in the visitors' book, bears witness to his visit . Lionel in England took a special pleasure in display- ing the social position which his House had achieved . An opportunity for display was afforded by the marriage on June 7, 1865, of his second daughter Evelina to Ferdi- nand, the son of Anselm Rothschild of Vienna . Some years before, Lionel had started building a magnificent town house in Piccadilly close to the house of the Duke of Wellington, and this was opened on the occasion of his daughter's wedding .

In the even- ing a great ball was given, which was attended by the Duke of Cambridge and other royalties as well as by the whole diplomatic corps and several politicians . All par- ties were represented, from the blackest Tories to the most radical of the Whigs . It was scarcely possible for the Rothschilds to climb higher in social position . The Rothschild ladies did not fail either to do justice to the wealth of the family .

The Crimean War had finally destroyed Napoleon III's relations with the tsar . When the conflict between Austria and Prussia broke out in 1866 he failed to take a definite line as the interests of France required . As early as 1865 France's financial barometer indicated stormy times ahead . Things were going ill with the Mex- ican adventure ; a poor harvest had made bread dear ; the prices of rentes, as well as of other securities, and espe- cially of the shares of the Credit Mobilier, showed a constant tendency to droop .

The Prussian statesman had had the forethought to conclude an alliance with Italy, and also to establish re- lations with the revolutionary-minded subjects of the Emperor of Austria, with Hungary and the southern Slavs . Bismarck also made timely financial preparations for war, having recourse in this connection to the banker Gerson von Bleichroder, who had close business relations with the Paris and Frankfort Rothschilds . Like Metter- nich, Bismarck was little practiced in financial matters . A contemporary said of him \"Bismarck was comparatively lacking in financial gifts in spite of his remarkable versatility . His intelligence was such that he could undoubtedly have made himself thoroughly at home in financial matters, but he had obvi- ously little inclination to specialize in this field, and of all his Ministers the Finance Minister exercised the greatest independence with regard to Bismarck .\" 6 Through Gerson von Bleichroder, who had for some time been planning the foundation of a big Prussian financial house in partnership with the Rothschilds, and who finally formed a banking concern with them, the so-called Rothschild group, Bismarck had some dealings with the House of Rothschild, with whom he discussed financial preparation for armaments and military expen- diture . The Prussian prime minister and Bleichroder were, however, to learn that the Rothschilds were not prepared to provide any money for such purposes .

With reference to Austria's policy in Italy, however, and the Emperor Francis Joseph's wish to retain Venetia, feel- ing in London and Paris was in favor of allowing free play to the movement for the unification of Italy . It was thought that Austria would be best advised to sell Venetia . to Italy . This would help to restore her disorganized finances . The Rothschilds too supported a friendly solution on these lines . They had heavy commitments in Italy, and the sale of Venetia would raise the value of Austrian securities, of which the Rothschilds held such large quantities . Lord Clarendon, too, recommended the scheme s to the Austrian ambassador on the ground that Austria, once liberated from this burden, would have her hands freed in Germany .

Moreover, the savings which Italy could effect in her military expendi- ture should be sufficient to pay the interest on this gigantic loan . Austria was completely unresponsive to the sugges- tion, a fact which did much to alienate the sympathy which was felt for her in Paris with regard to Prussia . The French House of Rothschild, however, continued to maintain an attitude of reserve with regard to Prussia . In general the situation was not taken nearly seriously enough in Paris, as everyone believed that Austria would beat Prussia hands down . \"The Army,\" Richard Metternich reported, 9 \"from the War Minister down to the junior subaltern, does not doubt that Austria will be victorious .\" As early as the middle of March the Prussian minister, von der Goltz, had reported to King William, \"It is said that the House of Rothschild is determined to bring its whole influence to bear to prevent Prussia from going to war .\" to Bismarck thereupon replied : \"We wish to postpone making full preparations for war in order first to carry through the financial operations which would necessarily be more difficult when the situation had become more tense owing to an increase of armaments .

I feel I ought to mention this fact since it shows how care- ful one must be in dealing with Rothschild .\" '-I- Meanwhile the situation was becoming much more acute . On April 8 Prussia and Italy concluded an \"of- fensive and defensive alliance\" and military preparations proceeded actively in both states . The two great rivals, the Rothschilds, and the brothers Pereire, whose Credit Mobilier was involved in serious difficulties, were united in their desire for peace . Both families had been invited to an imperial reception 12 at the Tuileries on the even- ing of April i i, and they most earnestly implored the emperor to exert his powerful influence in the cause of peace, and thereby restore general confidence . They drew a dismal picture of the position on the bourse, and showed how public and private interests would be affected . They added that if the present condition of uncertainty were to last even a little while longer, they would no longer be able to keep the bourse in hand, in which case a ter- rible disaster would become inevitable . The emperor, however, stated most categorically that it was not in his power to take any preventive action . Bismarck pursued his aim with uncompromising logic, even against his own king, his queen, and the crown prince . Austria was again cleverly maneuvered into mak- ing the first military move : she made her army ready for action . Bismarck was now easily able to induce the king to issue the appropriate orders .

Germany was the traditional enemy, and Italy was bound to cast longing eyes upon Rome, as the crown- ing point of her unification, and Rome was still occupied by the French . He therefore strongly urged upon the Chamber that the fundamental principles of the Peace of 1815, which had insured that Germany and Italy should remain disunited, should be upheld . Napoleon was the more dismayed by speech of the leader of the opposition, received as it was with great applause, since it had been the very Treaty of 1815 that had sealed the fate of his uncle, and had restored the Bourbons to power . On May 6, at the opening of an exhibition, the emperor stated clearly, in reference to Thiers's speech, that he must definitely oppose the suggestion that those treaties should be regarded as a basis of French policy . His re- mark was misunderstood and produced alarming reac- tions throughout Europe .

On the other side was the Prussian prime minister, who concentrated with decision on a definite goal, and had a clear and definite appre- ciation of the position . It was not, however, Bismarck only who discouraged all attempts by mediation, confer- ences or other political expediences, to prevent matters with Austria from coming to a head . Austria also proved exceedingly obstinate . Her foreign policy was controlled not by the emperor or by his foreign minister, but by two exceedingly inept heads of departments in the foreign office . Through declining to attend a conference, on which James had set his last hope of maintaining peace, Austria forfeited such sympathy as is always accorded to the party attacked . James was indignant that his repeated exhortations to his nephew Anselm at Vienna to urge the authorities there to exert themselves in favor of peace, had pro- duced no result. The Rothschilds could not get a hearing in Vienna or in Paris, and certainly not in Berlin . The times of 183o and i840, when they had successfully used their influence in the cause of peace with the persons in authority, and had been able to compel the avoidance of war by withholding their money, were over . They en- deavored to requite the fact that their wishes were being so little regarded by being correspondingly disobliging in meeting financial requests, but such action too pro- duced no result . It is interesting to note 14 that toward the end of May the House of Rothschild deliberately re- turned a check of the Austrian ambassador, Prince Rich- ard Metternich, for the trifling amount of 5,000 francs, on the ground that he had not at the time this amount standing to his credit . The incident was talked about in Paris, with the result that the temperamental Princess Pauline Metternich was quite unrestrained in her com- ments on the Rothschilds, stating that in future she would treat them as tradesmen and not as gentlemen ."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"The Eventful Years \t 375 The same evening on May 27, Alfons Rothschild gave a big ball, at which the Metternichs were conspicuous by their absence . Such occurrences, however, were only a storm in a teacup . In June the Austro-Prussian War broke out, which ended on July 3 with the defeat of Austria on the battle-field of Koniggratz . The fact that Anselm was at Carlsbad just at this criti- cal period may be regarded as characteristic of the un- concerned attitude which even financial circles at Vienna adopted with regard to the outcome of the war . Just be- fore the battle Anselm had subscribed io,ooo gulden for the wounded, and for the relief of the general distress . He was now also seized with panic, and returned as speedily as possible to Vienna, where the wholly unex- pected news had brought people speedily to earth . He had to see that the interest of his House were secured as far as was possible in the general debacle . He had the bitter satisfaction that the Viennese were forced to admit that the House of Rothschild, especially its eldest representa- tive, James in Paris, had been proved right in their warn- ings against going to war . It could scarcely be expected that the Rothschilds should be eager to assist Austria and the German states that had suffered defeat in alli- ance with her, but it was immediately asked to come to the rescue . This was first requested in the case of Austria's close ally, Saxony, whose territory was occupied by Prussian troops . As they advanced the possessions of the Saxon treasury were hastily removed from Dresden to Munich ; but after the battle of Koniggratz they were no longer safe in that city, and Count Vitzthum was sent to Munich to look after the money . He found the treasures of the green vault, and the cash reserves of the finance ministry lying about in chests and cases in a shed without any locks .\" Prussia had already occupied Aschaffenburg ; she gave battle at Kissingen .

The plan was to get the things into a neutral country, i .e ., into Switzer- land, but there were too many cases and they had to be reduced as far as possible . The consignment consisted of innumerable little bottles which looked as though they contained spirits, but in reality held over a million of money in silver thalers which it had not been possible to convert into gold . \"In order to get over this difficulty,\" Vitzthum re- ported, 16 \"I made inquiries of the agent of the House of Rothschild, and learned that one of their couriers had just arrived, and would be returning to Paris in a few hours . I therefore sent the bottles by the courier to my friend, Baron James Rothschild, asking him to keep them in the Rue Laffitte, where I would myself arrive shortly . Old Baron James wanted to convert the solid thalers into francs, which would naturally have involved quite unnec- essary charges .\" Vitzthum insisted that the million thaler should be de- posited in natura, and that he should have the right to demand their return in a similar condition . Baron Roths- child remarked that this was not business, and that he only knew francs . \"And I only thaler,\" Vitzthum replied . Thereupon James attempted to intimidate the count, and asked what would happen if Prussia should sequester the Saxon cases . \"Oh,\" replied Vitzthum, \"that's all right . I've provided for that . But if occasion should arise I would simply remind you of the origin and traditions of your House . When the Elector of Hesse, driven from his country by Napoleon, entrusted his treasure to your father, the lat- ter never thought of enriching King Jerome of West- phalia with those moneys, but on the conclusion of hos- tilities, returned to the Elector the moneys which had been entrusted to him, himself .

He took charge of the money, and afterward, when everything had again settled down, it was duly returned to Saxony . Now, when Prussia, swollen with power, could rely upon a victorious army, which had scarcely an enemy left that could be regarded seriously, Napoleon demanded at Berlin the territories on the left bank of the Rhine, including Mainz . Those in the Prussian capital, however, would not hear of such proposals . Bismarck pretended that he had never dreamed that Napoleon would express such a wish . In England it was thought that Prussia would immedi- ately comply with these requests . Anthony Rothschild in London assured Count Vitzthum that the Paris Bourse was a reliable barometer, and that Prussia would make no difficulties, and would pay the modest bill . The Brit- ish ministers, however, shook their heads over this optim- ism, and expressed the view that Prussia would refuse . Anthony is said to have made observations to Vitzthum at this time, which were characteristic of the materialist attitude of the Rothschilds, even in the third generation . \"The sooner we are rid of all our colonies,\" he is actu- ally supposed to have said on September 12, 1866, 17 \"the better for England .

The whole of France instinc- tively felt that Napoleon had let pass the favorable oppor- tunity for fighting against a Power which might still become highly dangerous to France at a time when that Power was involved elsewhere . This attitude, which in- fected all circles of opinion in France, also expressed itself in the financial condition of the Napoleonic state, which became progressively worse . The Credit Mobilier, which had large holdings in the seriously depreciated Austrian securities, and had other commitments far beyond its strength, was unable, in spite of Napoleon's favor, and in spite of being assisted by the state, any longer to conceal its bad financial position . To pay dividends out of capital was bound to have the most devastating effect upon a concern that was so dependent on the good opinion of the bourse and of the public, and that was now revealed to rest upon a purely speculative basis . By December, 1866, the shares had already fallen to 6oo ; in April, 1687, the Credit Mobilier had to show a loss of 8,ooo,ooo francs in respect of the year 1866 and its shares then fell to 350 . Napoleon was implored not to continue to support the Pereires, as the government risked being involved in the debacle of the Credit Mo- bilier, which could no longer be concealed from anyone . The open war between the two great Jewish financial groups,\"' the Pereires and the Rothschilds, had now been decided in favor of the latter . As Scheffer says, 19 they had always regarded the Credit as a foreign body which, since it could not be made to serve their ends and only acted as a rival, must at all costs be destroyed . And it had now come to that . In the evening of his life James had been proved right . All his warnings had come home . The enemy had left the field defeated .

For this, his financial ad- viser, Achille Fould, was in no small degree responsible ; he had resigned his office in January, 1867, and died unexpectedly in the following October . After her unsuccessful war, Austria made a change in the control of her foreign policy, transferring its direc- tion now to the Saxon Baron von Beust . He had known the Rothschilds for a long time and was a friend of the House ; and he took advantage of this connection to bring to their notice his country's urgent need of a loan, for which it had been knocking in vain at the door of the financiers . Austria was at the time planning to reduce the burden of interest payments on her public debt by conversion . The suggestion caused great dissatisfaction among the numerous holders of Austrian rentes abroad, especially in France, who after the war of 1866 had in any case suffered considerable loss owing to the fall in price of these securities . It was even proposed that Austrian secur- ities should no longer be quoted on the bourse . Thereupon Beust decided to approach the aged James Rothschild direct, with a request for mediation . \"I am instructing Count Vitzthum,\" the minister wrote,\" \"to discuss our financial position with you, and the measures that should be taken to prevent Austrian securities from being excluded from the quotations on the Bourse .

He assured the Austrian ambassador 21 that he would do everything in his power to insure that Aus- trian securities should continue to be quoted ; he coupled this assurance with the advice that Austria should favor the loan subscribed in Paris and London, by a special regulation . This advice, and the steps that he took in connection with the Austrian securities, were among the last acts of a business nature that it fell to James to carry out . In the summer of 1868 he fell seriously ill . Besides his painful complaint, he was suffering from liver trouble and jaun- dice . He died at the age of sixty-six and a half, on Novem- ber t 5, 1868, one day after the death of his friend the composer, Rossini . So long as his strength had permitted, he had continued actively to direct his business, and death alone could interrupt the extraordinary activity which he had shown throughout his life . \"Rothschild is dead ; long live Rothschild .\" Thus the French court adapted the well-known epigram made on the death of a king ; for a king James had undoubtedly been in his own sphere . The democratization of financial operations was beyond his understanding . He remained throughout his life the banker who had risen to power in the shadow of a princely house, and who sought and found his customers among the monarchs of the whole of Europe . Speculation having become the dominant interest of considerable sections of the population in Paris, the bourse was always a center of excitement . James Roths- child, who was cautious and reticent, and exceedingly confident of his own judgment, although quite friendly to such persons as knew how to handle him, appeared once or twice at the bourse during the last years of his life .

On his death the Paris correspondent of the Kolnische Zeitung wrote an article in which he stated that James had come to Paris in 1812, with about a million francs, but that he was now estimated to be worth about three billion . The journalist observed that English financiers who were in a position to know had assured him that in all the United Kingdom there was no one possessed of a similar fortune . The figure mentioned was of course imaginary ; James's son Alfons would himself have found considerable dif- ficulty in estimating the value of his inheritance ; but the publication of this article, together with the descriptions of the magnificent funeral, constituted a great advertise- ment for the House of Rothschild . If the dead man's wishes had been carried out, the funeral would have been a very simple one, without the military honors to which he was entitled as a holder of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, but such was the interest displayed that half Paris took part in the mag- nificent funeral procession . Napoleon was represented by his chief master of ceremonies, the Duke of Cambaceres ; the King of the Belgians sent an aide-de-camp ; the royal family of Orleans, the Emperor Francis Joseph, and the President of the United States telegraphed their condo- lences .

At the age of nineteen he was sent to England to study the organi- zation of railways, and afterward he was employed in the Northern Railway Company of France, of which he became chairman on the death of his father . In 18 55 Napoleon appointed him a member of the governing body of the Bank of France . Alfons was already a naturalized Frenchman, and whereas his father had always spoken wretched French, which was the joke of all Paris, Alfons was a master both of written and of spoken French . He was destined to lead the Paris House through the stormy period after the fall of the imperial regime, which his father had so often predicted, but which he did not live to see . This catastrophe approached with gigantic strides . All Bismarck's energies were concentrated upon his life's work-the union of all Germans under Prussian leader- ship . He attached to himself all those who would be use- ful to him in this connection, and the question of ways and means was given proper consideration . The relations be- tween Bismarck and Bleichroder, the clever financier, had become constantly closer since 1866 . Since her vic- tory over Austria, Prussia had risen substantially in the regard of the Rothschilds, and the association between them and Bleichroder, which was already of many years' standing, became a close one . The House of Rothschild had no member of their family to take charge in Berlin, as they had in the other capitals of Europe, and so Bleichroder was entrusted with representing the interests of the House in Berlin and the whole of Prussia . In accordance with the usual practice of the House of Rothschild, he received the political information from London, Paris, and Vienna that was always furnished to its representatives .

It was of course advis- able to exercise caution in this matter, for Alfons Roths- child's attitude was absolutely that of a French patriot, and it was necessary to take care that the general antipa- thy which the Rothschilds had always felt toward the Napoleonic regime should not outweigh, in the senti- ments of the present chief of the House, his feelings of patriotism for France . Bleichroder was influential with Bismarck in financial and commercial matters, and the latter had given instruc- tions that Bleichroder should be kept informed of devel- opments in the political situation . In this matter, how- ever, he exercised a greater degree of caution and reserve than Metternich had done in his relations with Solomon Rothschild . He used Bleichroder and his association with Rothschild for his own purposes, but he was able to say with justification :\" \"It is not necessary to let the Jews get the upper hand, or to come to depend on them finan- cially to such an extent as is regrettably the case in sev- eral countries . My relations, as a Minister, with Jewish high finance have always been such that the obligation has been on their side and not on mine .\" Through the private channel available to Bleichroder, Bismarck kept a close watch on what was happening in Paris, where dissatisfaction with the imperial regime had been constantly increasing since the unfortunate year 1866 . Napoleon wished to atone for the indirect reverse which he had then suffered by the peaceful acquisition of Luxemburg, hoping in this way to divert attention from the growing opposition at home .

Since, however, he meant at any price to weld such a unity together, war would be sooner or later inevitable . Napoleon was too sick and too undecided to rush into such a conflict, and Bismarck hoped that perhaps he might be able to achieve his end without bloodshed . Then an incident occurred which caused French national feel- ing suddenly to flame up, depriving both leaders of the control of their people, and hastening the catastrophe . Spain, constantly afflicted by political crises, was at- tempting to find some final solution of her problem . A republic was not in favor, and neither was past experience encouraging with regard to the possibility of a Bourbon dynasty . The possibility of finally achieving a unity be- tween Spain and Portugal was a motive for considering a member of the Portuguese royal house . Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, whose wife was a daugh- ter of the King of Portugal, was suggested . Bismarck supported this candidature, which appeared to him to be in the interests of Prussia, but in France the proposal aroused a storm of indignation . It was felt that France would be ground between the upper and nether mill- stones of Germany and Spain . When, on July 3, it became known in Paris that the prince had accepted the candidature, the French com- pletely lost their heads . \"Vengeance for Sadowa,\" was shouted in the streets, and it was admitted that the de- feat of Austria in 1866 was a defeat for France . The court and the emperor were not able to resist the influence of the general emotion . At this fateful moment, Napoleon sent for the chief of the House of Rothschild, in order through him to urge upon England that she should repel this attack upon the honor and security of France .

On July 5, 1870, Alfons Rothschild was hastily called for by the imperial adjutant and brought to Saint-Cloud, where he appeared before the monarch in a state of considerable excitement, for he had never been summoned in such an unusual manner or at such an unusual time .\" The emperor ex- plained to the banker that there was at the moment no foreign minister in England (Lord Clarendon had died on June 27 and Lord Granville was not appointed until July 6), and that he therefore desired to send a message through Alfons to the prime minister, Gladstone . This was a somewhat clumsy excuse, for it would have been possible to make use of official channels, but Napoleon preferred to deal with the matter privately, through the Rothschilds . The emperor wished in this way to let Glad- stone know that the Hohenzollern candidature was in- tolerable to France, and to ask Gladstone to do every- thing possible to have it withdrawn . Alfons Rothschild immediately sent a cipher telegram to Lionel in London, and Lionel's son Nathaniel, after- ward Lord Rothschild, deciphered the telegram for his father, and then hurried with it himself to Carlton House Terrace . There he found Gladstone, who was just about to leave for Windsor to see the queen ; he got into his car- riage and drove with him to the railway station . After reading the telegram Gladstone said nothing for a while . Finally he stated that although he was by no means in favor of the candidature, he was not inclined to interfere with the free right . of the Spanish people to choose their own sovereign . The telegram which Lionel sent containing this news, profoundly disconcerted the Paris Bank .

He is said to have quite lost his temper over the rash and shortsighted politicians and generals, as he called them, who were bringing such dis- aster upon Europe, and he decided that, if he could not check the course of events in the West, he would at any rate do everything possible to prevent Austria from en- gaging in the conflict herself . By July i i Bleichroder regarded the situation as hope- less ; on that day he instructed his London correspondent Worms by telegram, to sell all his securities at any price, and this was done, at considerable loss . 26 Nevertheless, it seemed that all would end well after all .

As soon as war had been declared, Alfons Rothschild identified himself entirely with the French cause . In spite of the misunder- standings between his House and Napoleon, he hoped whole-heartedly that France would be victorious . In a manner that was scarcely polite to the German government 27 he resigned his office of Prussian consul- general and, as far as he was able, he assisted financially in the energetic prosecution of the war against Prussia . Meanwhile the campaign developed with surprising rapidity . To the astonishment of Europe the French army was conquered after a few battles, rapidly following on one another. The empire was shattered, and Napoleon III was taken prisoner .

When the king, arriving from Lagny, entered the gorgeous apartments he said to his staff, 28 \"Folk like us can't rise to this ; only a Rothschild can achieve it .\" Alfons Rothschild had left only a steward and a few female servants . The king refrained from installing him- self in the owner's gorgeous bedroom . He had his iron bedstead put up in a modest little room, and strongly forbade his suite to touch anything . Even the game were not to be interfered with in any way-an order which specially grieved Bismarck, who was passionately fond of sport . Scarcely had the German general headquarters been installed in Ferrieres when, on September i9, 1870, Jules Favre arrived at the chateau to negotiate with Bismarck regarding an armistice and possible terms of peace . This meeting proved fruitless, the .

The letters were examined by the German intelligence depart- ment to see whether they contained information of mili- tary value, and the letter of December 28, 1870, to the Countess de Moustier was discovered .

Thiers immediately informed him of Bis- marck's enormous demands, and of the German proposals with regard to payment, and the banker fully shared the opinion of Tiers, who was naturally still trying to resist the oppressive conditions . Bismarck was angry that Rothschild, whose family was, after all, of German origin, should also be making difficulties, and that he should behave as though he were as French as the other two negotiators . When Alfons Rothschild, who was a puny little man, went up to the big chancellor and began talking to him in French,\" Bismarck treated him with scant courtesy, in fact with positive rudeness, while he treated the two other negotiators in a more friendly way, in order to make them forget his earlier outbursts . He was annoyed at Rothschild's acting as Thiers's second .

These laid down the main lines of the arrangements whereby all the great money merchants of Europe were to be brought in as guarantors of the war indemnity, which meanwhile had been reduced to 5,000,000,000 .

Whenever there was any sign of trouble, Gen- eral Trochu was nervous and undecided in dealing with the enemy .\" Gustav Rothschild was convinced that toward the end of October, six weeks after the city had first been in- vested, the armed resources of the capital would have been sufficient to break through the lines of the attackers, and compel them to raise the siege . He was also of the opinion that the sortie of September 2, 1870, would have had every chance of being successful if only the French troops had been led by an energetic and competent general . The Austrian ambassador, Prince Metternich, and the British Ambassador, Lord Lyons, had left Paris for the seat of the French government at Tours . Gustav Roths- child spoke of the unfortunate effect produced by their quitting Paris, for it had been believed, and it was still believed, that the presence of these two ambassadors in Paris would have facilitated the negotiations at Ferrieres and would have modified the terrors of the siege, and possibly prevented the bombardment . Gustav Rothschild also discussed the future, and the probable terms of peace, with Count Vitzthum . \"The moment,\" he said, \"for Austria and England to intervene actively and firmly has arrived .

If, however, she should insist upon wresting from us the line of the Vosges from Belfort to Metz and Longwy, it will be exceedingly difficult for us to raise even a much smaller amount, as I shall explain . \"A mutilated and humiliated France will have but one thought-revenge, and that is, war .

The English government had indeed, as Disraeli and Lionel Rothschild, who was behind him, so keenly de- sired, attempted at the last moment, to propose that the amount of the war indemnity should be decided by arbi- tration . But England was too late, and nobody took any notice of her attempt at intervention . On February 26, 1871, the preliminary Peace of Ver- sailles was accordingly signed, concluding the war that affected the future more perhaps than any other of the nineteenth century . Bismarck did not deny himself a small personal re- venge on Rothschild . Three days after the signature of the preliminary peace Thiers's aide-de-camp D'Heris- son, was dining at Versailles and Bismarck deliberately told the story of the churlish behavior of Rothschild's steward at Ferrieres, passing on to some general remarks about the Rothschilds, whose grandfather had been \"Court Jew\" to the Elector of Hesse, and \"private Jew\" to innumerable noble families .\" On March r i the Emperor William and the German general staff left Versailles .

Finally at the end of May the government troops suc- ceeded in quelling the rising and in restoring order in Paris, by their energetic action . The government depart- ments, and the various fugitives, including the Roths- childs, returned to the capital, where they had to pro- ceed with the work of actually carrying out the peace conditions . The Rothschilds were referred to extensively, espe- cially in connection with determining the instalments in which the war indemnity should be paid . Thiers and Favre had invited them to the peace negotiations rather than other bankers, because they knew that behind the Paris Rothschilds, who, like all other French bankers had suffered heavy losses in the war, stood their cousins in the other capitals of Europe, especially those in Lon- don and Frankfort . In view of the extraordinary position which Lionel had been able to achieve, and which was attributable, in no small degree, to his friendship with Disraeli, who had so long been chancellor of the ex- chequer, and in 1868 had been appointed prime minister, his financial support was necessarily of the greatest value to France .

The social position of the family, as re- vealed by its residences outside Germany, had reached a point which, in view of the origin of the family, is sur- prising, and must be regarded as unique . Economically they succeeded through all the vicissitudes of the modern era in maintaining their wealth at a most impressive level, although they had to surrender to others the distinction of being the wealthiest in Europe . Through the unique combination of high social posi- tion and great financial resources with the international connections of Jews, they have succeeded by cleverly adapting themselves to the politics of the day, in playing an active part in important political and economic de- velopments up to the present day . It is still impossible completely to ignore them in those countries in which the family is still established . But the general position of the House has somewhat changed as compared with earlier times . When the five brothers of the second gen- eration disappeared from the scene, the close union between their Houses and their intimate cooperation be- came somewhat modified .

In England, France, and Germany the mem- bers of the Rothschild family had themselves naturalized ; they were received in the highest social circles in these countries, and it was therefore only natural that they should endeavor to outdo in patriotism the natural-born Englishman, Frenchman, or Austrian, whose family had been settled in the country since time immemorial . This change came to be expressed in the regulation of the family property . Whereas during the time of the five brothers each brother shared in the profit or loss in every transaction according to conditions determined by con- tract every three or five years, now each of the four pre- siding Houses had its own private property, and it was only in certain big transactions, individually specified when they arose, that the four Houses acted together under special agreements, more or less constituting a single firm for such purposes . This did not prevent one House from assisting another in its private transactions by supplying information or by other effective help, when opportunity offered . The most important men of the time have recognized, often reluctantly, the peculiar position which the Rothschilds have achieved in the world . Bismarck, whose attitude to them has been shown to have been sometimes cynical, and at other times friendly, once said at a dinner which the crown prince was giving to the Reichstag, and at which Meyer Carl, the Frank- fort Rothschild, was a guest, that he missed him in Ber- lin, that he ought to stay there more often and entertain ; that he owed it to his House . Rothschild asked whether he should give dinners in a restaurant, whereupon Bis- marck replied that it would be still better if he would buy a house of his own in Berlin, for the Paris and the London Rothschilds were not much use to him, and so the Frank- fort one ought to do something in Berlin .

The suggestion of a Berlin branch came to nothing, and indeed the original Frankfort House declined more and more in importance under the empire . Meyer Carl, the head of the Frankfort House, had, contrary to the usual practice of the Rothschilds, taken an active part in politics . In 1867 he had been elected member for Frankfort in the Reichstag of the North Ger- man Confederation, and afterward he became a member of the Prussian Upper Chamber, and of the Reichstag under the empire . For two years he was actually a town councilor of the city of Frankfort, which before would have been quite inconceivable in the case of a Jew . Meyer Carl worked in close association with his brother Wil- liam, whereas Adolph, who had been in Naples, made his permanent home in Paris . Meyer Carl always felt that Fate had treated him very cruelly in giving him only daughters, and no son . His brother William also had no male descendants . Meyer Carl's ambition to achieve a high and honored position in the empire of William I, revealed itself in later years in a positive craving for Orders . The Emperor William I had given up his pre- vious ideas with regard to granting Orders of a special design for non-Christians, and he wrote playfully to Bismarck when Meyer Carl was aspiring to a Grand Cross with broad ribbon 2 : \"Carl Meier, Baron von Rothschild, has developed a bad attack of Bandwuym (tapeworm) at the approach of the investiture ceremony . I can't cure this, but I could cure Kreuzschmerz (lumbago) .

When Meyer Carl died in 1886, his brother William became head of the bank, Meyer Amschel Rothschild and Sons . But he had not the qualities re- quired to reestablish the importance of the Frankfort firm ; and when he died in 19oi, the parent firm ceased to exist . It is represented indirectly at the present day by the Goldschmidt-Rothschild Bank . Minna Carolina, the daughter of William von Rothschild married Maxi- milian von Goldschmidt, who had an independent bank at Frankfort, and after the marriage, added the name of Rothschild to his own . As this couple inherited a large proportion of the enormous wealth of the parent firm that had now disappeared from the scene, the Goldschmidt- Rothschild Bank soon acquired considerable importance . The value of the inheritance may be inferred from the taxes paid, as well as from interesting estimates made by Bismarck . The latter remarked in the year 1875 when he was making war on Rome' : \"If I were to assess the Jesuit Order for Income Tax purposes, I should not, at the moment, assess it quite so high as the property of the late Rothschild, but at over half his wealth, that is to say at about 25o to 280 million thaler, or about one billion francs in capital value .\" According to the diaries of the French ambassador, George Louis, the Emperor William II, when his yacht Hohenzollern was in Palermo harbor in April, 19o8, re- ceived a young Paris Rothschild, whose yacht had also put into that harbor, and as Bismarck had done on a pre- vious occasion, suggested to him that a member of his family should settle in Berlin .' The ambassador asserts that the emperor spoke for more than an hour to this young French Rothschild about the greatness of his House, praising the services which it had rendered, and lamenting the fact that although it had originated in the German town of Frankfort, it was no longer represented in Germany . He said that a member of the family ought"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century 403 to come to Germany again ; that he, the emperor, had no religious or race prejudices, and would give a branch of the Rothschilds in Germany a position that would actually excel the position of their Houses in Paris and London . Inquiries of a personage very closely connected with the Emperor William prove this story to be entirely imagi- nary, the emperor never having had any such conversa- tion, or made any such suggestion to a member of the House of Rothschild . However that may be, the fact remains that there was now no branch of the Rothschilds in the country whence they had set out to conquer Europe, and that, of the five original branches, only those of Lon- don, Paris, and Vienna survive . On the other hand, Anselm had succeeded in reestab- lishing the prestige of his House in Austria, and in re- storing the position of his family which had been so much damaged by Solomon's flight in 1848 . On the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War a veritable fever of com- pany promotion and unparalleled overspeculation broke out in Austria too ; Anselm condemned these tendencies and kept aloof from them as far as possible . There was a general desire to imitate the Credit Institute founded by the Rothschilds, the value of whose shares had risen in a most extraordinary manner, on the part of persons who, however, lacked the financial solidity of the Rothschild Houses . This finally led to the notorious collapse of May 8, 1873, which Anselm alone was prepared for, and able to deal with, at a considerable cost, while the new com- panies and banks surrounding him came to grief . As the House of Rothschild alone emerged without serious dam- age from this catastrophe, it acquired many enemies and critics .

Anseim had three sons, of whom the eldest, Nathaniel, had no taste for business at all, his preference being for good company and artistic interests, a fact which often caused trouble with his father . Anselm's houses, 17 Rue Laffitte, Paris, the Romische Kaiser, the house in the Renngasse, the Gundelhof in the Bauernmarkt, and his estates at Schillersdorf and Beneschau, were divided among his children by his will, with the explicit injunc- tion never to sell or mortgage any of them, but to main- tain them faithfully in the male line . He distinguished in his will between the tastes of his sons Nathaniel and Ferdinand, who, as he wrote, had like himself a special liking for the arts, particularly for such artistic objects as are associated with the period of the Renaissance, and his son Albert, who preferred to occupy himself with business and technical matters . In his will, Anseim emphasized the necessity for main- taining \"that lively sense of brotherly unity\" which had hitherto existed and which, he had no doubt, would con- tinue to exist in the future .

Albert Solomon von Rothschild, Anselm's third son, now became head of the Vienna House, while the two elder sons followed their hobbies on a grand scale, Nathaniel living an extravagant life as a grand seigneur with a taste for art, while Ferdinand was a great sports- man . Born in 1844, Albert attended the Gymnasium at Vienna, added a university course at Bonn and training in a bank at Hamburg, after which he went on long jour- neys until 1874, when he took charge of the Vienna House . Two years later he married the daughter of Alfons Rothschild of Paris, thus following the example of his predecessors who, with few exceptions, had mar- ried members of their own family bearing the Roths- child name .

The precious objects which it contains are literally un- paralleled, and the historical value attaching to many of them cannot be estimated . In the dining-room,' for in- stance, four pictures by Vanloo had been let into the paneling, representing sculpture, painting, architecture, and drawing, which were originally commissioned by the Marquise Pompadour for her Chateau Bellevue . In a corner there is a small oval Louis XVI table with a sort of porphyry top, formerly in the possession of Queen Marie Antoinette, which bears her monogram with crown . An enameled Medici china set of the sixteenth century consisting of twelve pieces is to be seen in one of the electrically lighted glass cases . On a red table is a dagger with a rich gilt handle which once belonged to Wallenstein .

The Vienna Gardens of the Rothschilds on the Hohe Warte are famous ; they are an absolute paradise in which every variety of rare flower and fruit is to be found in its season . It is not surprising that, leading such a manner of life, the Rothschilds should also have wished to continue to improve their social position . Indeed, having regard to the circumstances of the time they put forward the most audacious requests . Thus they had conceived a great long- ing to achieve the fullest competence to attend courts, so as to be on an equal footing with the highly privileged great noble families of the country who could show hun- dreds of ancestors. They applied great pressure to secure this object . The Rothschilds had succeeded in putting many of the members of the highest nobility under obli- gations to them . Alfons Rothschild in Paris induced King Albert of Saxony, the friend of the Emperor Francis Joseph, to use his influence to get this distinction con- ferred upon Alfons' son-in-law . At first there was very obstinate opposition, and many a financial sacrifice had to be made in rendering services to the state and assisting in philanthropic objects before it was decided in the win- ter of 1887 to make an exception in favor of Albert Roths- child and his wife, and to admit them to court . The other members of the House also secured this distinction in course of time, and the Rothschilds felt themselves thenceforward to be equal members of the so-called Vienna court society, and from that time to the present day they have moved almost exclusively in those circles .

Julie Roths- child owned a delightful villa at Pregny on the Lake of Geneva, where she devoted herself to her favorite hobby of horticulture, having extensive conservatories . The fact that the empress also loved flowers more than anything else in the world, gave an excuse for inviting the empress to Pregny . This was in the fateful year of 1898 . The empress, who had a weak heart, had been taking the waters at Nauheim, after which she spent one night at Munich in the room she had lived in as a girl . Thence she went to Switzerland, and on September 9 arrived at Pregny by the ordinary passenger steamer . The baroness had offered the empress her yacht, but this had not been accepted, since Elizabeth had heard that the crew were not allowed to accept presents, and she felt this fact to be embarrassing .

This incident led the empress on her way home, although she had spent such a happy day, to talk about religion and death to the Countess Sztaray . When the latter observed that she looked forward to death with- out fear, Elizabeth replied : \"But I fear death, although I often long for it ; the passage and the uncertainty make me tremble, and especially the thought of the terrible struggle which one must undergo before reaching the other side .\" Little knowing what was in store for her, the unhappy empress spent the night at the Hotel Beau Rivage in Geneva .

They would have wel- comed even more joyfully, it is true, a restoration of the Bourbons, especially if it had been the House of Orleans, but they were careful to keep this wish to themselves . The monarchist-clerical regime of Marshal Mac- Mahon was less congenial to them ; and they did not feel that he had the ability to remain at the head of the state . 8 After some keen party contests, the year 1877 saw the triumph of the republican idea in France, and a new ministry in power, in which the friend of the House of Rothschild, Leon Say, who had remained true to his lib- eral principles, was again responsible for the finances . He was in a general way the friend and confidant of the House of Rothschild, and this connection brought several advantages to the Bank . At the beginning of the eighties, when Gambetta was in power, the atmosphere was again less favorable to the Rothschilds . Gambetta was opposed to the private companies, which controlled the railways of France, and he was therefore also opposed to the Rothschilds as having the most important railway inter- ests in France . His fall and death in the year 1882 again liberated the railway . An agreement was concluded be- tween the French state and the six great railway com- panies, under which the former undertook not to avail it- self for thirty years of its right to repurchase the private railways on repayment of the advances . The Rothschilds, who feared any new war as likely to interfere with the smooth running of the business, were not inclined in spite of their strongly patriotic attitude, to support Gen- eral Boulanger, who preached a war of revenge against Germany, although they exercised caution in showing their feelings . Alfons continued with a sure touch to con- trol the destinies of the Paris House . The differences between France and England with re-"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century \t +1 II gard to Egypt and the Suez Canal caused embarrassment to the Paris and London Houses, who were supporting their respective governments in these questions . When the matter had been finally settled in favor of England, the path was clear for creating more friendly relations be- tween the two countries . As early as 1877 the Prince of Wales, who was afterward King Edward VII, had taken up this idea and endeavored through his personal friends in Paris, especially Alfons Rothschild, to produce a con- genial atmosphere for an entente between England and France .' At that time he was not successful, but a change in the world situation made France more amenable to the idea later . France's occupation of Tunis had led to ill-feeling in Italy, and at the beginning of 1883 that country joined the German-Austrian Dual Alliance . This fact caused alarm in France as to the possibility of a war on two fronts, and she endeavored to ascertain the secret pro- visions of the Treaty of Triple Alliance, and if possible to detach Italy, whose association with Austria was only half-hearted, from her friends . During the following years the first efforts were made to secure an understand- ing between France and Russia . Considerable progress had already been made in the matter of the understanding with Russia, when in April, 1891, Paris proceeded to work with greater energy to detach Italy . The representative of the House of Roths- child in Rome, a certain Padova, was used for this pur- pose . Italy had appeared in- the French money market in search of loans, and Padova\" was instructed to state that no money could be lent to a state which might conceiv- ably embark on a hostile action against the country of the persons supplying the money . In this way an attempt was made to ascertain the military provisions of the Treaty of Triple Alliance . The Austrian ambassador in Rome actually reported that he had learned from a reliable source that a representative of the House of Rothschild"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"412 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild had made extensive promises of a financial nature on con- dition that Italy should remain neutral in a Franco-Ger- man war, or should acquiesce in the reconquest of Alsace- Lorraine .\" The attitude of the Rothschilds was at first reserved with regard to the Franco-Russian rapprochement . The Prussian Diskonto-Gesellschaft of Bleichroder and the Frankfort Rothschilds had refused Russian requests for loans (the financial situation was one of the principal reasons which drove tsarist Russia into the arms of re- publican France) . The Rothschild attitude was influ- enced to no small degree by the fact that the Jews were persecuted in Russia . When, however, the alliance be- tween France and Russia took shape, and the squadrons of the two countries united in friendly festivities at Cron- stadt in July, 1891, it became a patriotic duty to assist Russia in her financial requirements and the Rothschilds recognized that they would have to ignore the particu- larist interests of the Jews, as in the interest of their position in France, they could not stand aloof from par- ticipating in the big loans which that country was making available for Russia . Toward Germany they excused their change of policy, principally on the ground that, whereas they had pre- viously refused Russia a loan, since she oppressed the Jews, they were now attempting to get better conditions for the Russian Jews by granting such loans . Count Miin ster, German ambassador in Paris, reported on this mat- ter to the German chancellor, von Caprivi, on October 23, 1892, as follows \"Whereas I have hitherto always assumed that his Majesty the Emperor of Russia will never bind himself to the democratic Republic, or enter into a treaty of alli- ance, I am now no longer quite certain whether some agreements have not been entered into .

The Rothschilds, who have so far been royalists, have approached the Re- public, and are now hand in glove with the Government, whereby they regain their influence . The prospect of making a profit and, according to Alfons Rothschild, the hope of attaining better conditions for the Jews in Russia, have induced the House here to enter into negotiations for a loan . The fact that the London House will have nothing to do with this loan shows how cunning these great Jews are . They always have a back door open . . . . That the wife of the new Finance Minister, Witte, whom Russian ladies here have described to me as being an intelligent and very intriguing Jewess, is of great help in bringing about an understanding with the Jewish bankers, seems to me to be not improbable. The Paris Bourse is afraid of being overshadowed by the Bourse of Berlin, and the big Jews believe that if they can earn money they can best help the small Jews, with the result that although the French market is saturated with Rus- sian securities, the French give their good francs for bad rubles .\" In view of the international position of the House there was . always the possibility of diplomatic indiscretions, such as might have the most far-reaching consequences . Thus we now know from the memoirs of Prince von Eulenburg that the secret understanding regarding the Mediterranean between France and Italy, which paved the way for Italy's secession from the Triple Alliance, was known in Vienna and Berlin before the treaty had been settled, through Nathaniel, the brother of the Vienna Rothschild, who had heard about it from his Paris cousin .\" The social position of the House of Rothschild con- tinued to be maintained at the highest possible level .

Thus for instance the two Baronesses Marguerite and Bertha Rothschild married in 1878 Agenor, Duke of Gramont, and Louis Alexander Berthier, Prince of Wag- ram, a descendent of Napoleon I's famous chief of the general staff . Like all members of his family who in the course of time attained virtually legendary reputations for enor- mous wealth, Alfons Rothschild was the victim of daily anonymous letters . In his case an attempt was made actually to carry out the threats . It may be that the shot fired at him one day while shooting at Ferrieres was an accident, but there can be no doubt that a parcel which was addressed to him and which exploded when opened by a secretary, was directed against the life of Alfons Rothschild . 13 Besides being chief of the Paris House, Alfons was also chairman of the Northern Railway of France and, to his great joy, he was elected one of the forty immortals of the French Academy . Alfons Rothschild died on May 26, 19oS, and his son Eduard succeeded him as chief of the French bank . Alfons's brother Edmund has become famous for his sup- port of Zionism and the idea of a Jewish colony in Pales- tine . During recent years, and at the present day, the Eng- lish Rothschilds have occupied the most important posi- tion of all the branches of the House of Rothschild . Dur- ing the period after the Franco-Prussian War this was especially attributable to the close relations between Lionel Rothschild and Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield . When Gladstone was defeated in 1874, Dis- raeli again became prime minister, and succeeded in ingratiating himself with Queen Victoria to an extraor- dinary degree . Although Disraeli was a Christian, his Jewish descent was an important factor in making his friendship with Lionel, which dated from their youth,"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century \t 415 an exceedingly intimate one . Beaconsfield once wrote, of the Rothschilds : \"I have always been of the opinion that there could not be enough Rothschilds .\" 14 The fact that Lionel belonged to the Liberal and Dis- raeli to the Conservative party was quite irrelevant . The banker and the minister understood each other exceed- ingly well, and in questions affecting the emancipation of the Jews, Lionel and Disraeli were so much of the same opinion that the Conservative minister almost always voted against his own party . It is apparent that the House of Rothschild certainly did not suffer from this close friendship with England's prime minister, but the gov- ernment and England also gained advantage from this connection . This was particularly the case in the matter of the Suez Canal question . The grandson of Mehemet Ali, the Khedive Ismail Pasha, who ruled in Egypt from 1863 to 1879, had incurred a perfectly monstrous load of debt . It is true that he inaugurated an era of unexampled prog- ress in his country, but he had also increased the national debt by the year 1875 from about three hundred million marks to about two billion, his own personal extrava- gance having been a large factor in bringing this about . In the end the Egyptian state and the khedive got so heavily into debt that the ruler was compelled to proceed to sell the 177,602 shares in the Suez Canal which he held, to obtain money for his most pressing requirements . It was essential that the cash should be made imme- diately available, and the khedive had already got into touch with French financiers . Heinrich Oppenheim heard of the whole scheme which it was proposed to carry through ; he was a banker who had often lent the khedive money, and he informed both the journalist Fred- erick Greenwood and Lionel of this excellent opportunity for the British government to secure its hold upon the maritime connections with India . Disraeli had for some time been thinking of securing a dominating influence in the canal by securing the 400,000 Suez Canal shares . But"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"¢i6 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild now it was essential to act quickly, for the khedive had already granted an option to French financiers, so that the British could not afford to delay with their offer . Parliament was not sitting, and could not be summoned quickly enough ; and it was not such a simple matter to take £4,ooo,ooo out of the treasury without parliamen- tary sanction . In view of the importance of the matter, Disraeli ignored all these difficulties . \"We have scarcely time to breathe, we must carry the matter through,\" Dis- raeli wrote to his queen, 18 and through his friend Lionel Rothschild, the £4,ooo,ooo required for the purchase was raised without parliamentary sanction . By the afternoon of November 26, I 87S, the purchase had been carried through . The Rothschilds had advanced the money at 3%, while Ismail had undertaken to pay 5% per annum until the dividends on the shares should again become payable .\" Thus the British government carried through an important political and a magnificent business deal . Disraeli reported to his queen in terms of the pro- foundest regard . \"Madam, the business has gone through, you have the money . Four million pounds . There was only one House that could have done this, the House of Rothschild . They have behaved wonderfully, and have lent the gold and the money at a very low interest . The whole of the Khedive's share is now in your Majesty's hands .\" This transaction particularly emphasized the friend- ship between Rothschild and Disraeli to the world at large . German ambassadors and statesmen such as Count Munster 17 and Prince Hohenlohe 18 ,always spoke of the English Rothschilds as being intimate friends of the premier . It was not, however, the prime minister Disraeli alone who was on good terms with the Rothschilds living in England . Edward, Prince of Wales, who was then thirty- four years old, was also on the most friendly terms with the whole family . The queen was positively shocked by"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century \t 4 1 7 the intimate friendship between him and the great Jew- ish financiers, Lionel, Anthony, and Meyer, the heads of the Rothschild family, and later with the younger generation, Nathaniel, Ferdinand, and Leopold . The prince was often a guest at their magnificent country houses . In Sir Sidney Lee's biography of Edward VII 19 we read : \"The Prince's business instinct enabled him to appreciate the financial acumen of the Rothschild Clan but he was more effectively drawn to its members by their profuse charity, their range of political information, their hospitalities, their patronage of sport and their assiduity in collecting works of art .\" The prince himself was present as a guest at the mar- riage of Leopold Rothschild to Marie Perugia, in 1881, and was greatly impressed by the Jewish marriage cere- monial, which he had never seen before . The Prince of Wales was also frequently present at the Rothschild dances . While the sons of the Rothschild House observed the family rule of marrying only girls of Jewish race, daugh- ters of the House married members of the highest Eng- lish aristocracy . The daughters of Lionel's younger brother Anthony, Constance and Anna, married respec- tively Lord Battersea in 1877, and the Honorable Eliot Yorke, a son of the Earl of Hardwicke in 1873 . Moreover, a daughter of Lionel's fourth brother Meyer Amschel married in 1878 Archibald Philip Primrose, Earl of Rose- bery, who was undersecretary of state at the home office under Gladstone in 1881, and was secretary of state for foreign affairs in Gladstone's third ministry of 1886, and in his fourth ministry of 1892 to 1894 . In 1894 he suc- ceeded Gladstone as prime minister . With such extensive and unique connections, it was not unnatural that the Rothschilds should continue to exercise a profound influ- ence upon high politics .

The House of Rothschild main- tained still close relations with Bleichroder ; on June is, 1878, Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfiirst, who was then ambassador in Paris, was staying in Berlin, and called on Bleichroder, who was able to show him a letter of Lionel's which had just arrived from London, and which definitely stated that Beaconsfield had gone to the Congress at Berlin with the most peaceful inten- tions . 20 Beaconsfield and Lionel did not fail to act in the inter- ests of their common race at the Congress . Lionel wrote a letter to Beaconsfield requesting him in the name of hu- manity and civilization to intervene on behalf of the ill- treated Jews in the east of Europe ; this letter was read to the Congress in session . At the same time Lionel brought pressure to bear upon Bismarck through Bleich- roder, and also sent an appeal to the French delegate, Waddington, and to the Italian delegate, Count Luigi Corti, with the result that Article 44 of the Congress of Berlin actually provided that all the members of all faiths in the Balkan peninsula should be on an equality . The Austrian delegate, Count Andrassy, had been appealed to in a similar way by the Vienna House of Rothschild . Lionel had actually been the successful protagonist of Jewish emancipation in England . Sir Moses Montefiore and he shared the honor of having rendered this service to their fellow Jews . When, on March 18, 1869, Lionel attended the consecration of the Jewish Synagogue in London, he exclaimed in the course of his speech : \"We are emancipated, but if our emanciation should damage our faith, it would be a curse instead of a blessing .\" His chief source of pride lay in the fact that he had succeeded in getting into the House of Commons .

Lionel had been most carefully prepared for his work by his father, and throughout his life he conducted the affairs of the bank with sound judgment, and prodigi- ously increased the wealth of the Rothschilds, while the activities of his brothers in art, sport, and social life fur- nished a background which obliterated the modest origins of his family . He floated about sixteen British state loans in the course of his life, and had also succeeded in getting on to good terms with the prince consort . His eldest son, Nathaniel Meyer Rothschild, succeeded to the baronetcy of his uncle Anthony . In his way he was the complete Englishman, quiet and of few words ; he spoke no language but English, was modest, warm- hearted, and always courteous .

Ferdi- nand was a son of Anselm, the Vienna Rothschild, who had settled permanently in England after his marriage . The House of Rothschild was now more firmly estab- lished than ever .

Where were Arn- stein-Eskeles, the Foulds, the Pereires? The Rothschilds had survived them all . In general world politics the Rothschilds continued to use their influence in favor of peace . They observed with dismay the growing opposition between the impulsive Emperor William II, who was always liable to make in- judicious remarks, and the sensitive and aging Prince of Wales . He also watched with concern the development of an increasing jealousy between England and Germany . The German Emperor's telegram congratulating the Boers on their attitude with regard to the Jameson Raid of 1895 was a matter of absolute despair to the English Rothschilds, who thought that this misfortune would immediately be the cause of war . Alfred, Lord Roths- child's younger brother, constituted himself a kind of unofficial diplomatic agent, working in close collabora- tion with the British government, while he was also in touch with the German embassy, which was under the direction of Count Hatzfeld .

But all this came to nothing ; indeed at the end of 1898 there was a dispute between England and Germany regarding the ownership of Samoa, and William II agreed to demand that a com- mission of three representatives of the protecting Powers, together with one impartial representative, be sent out if relations should be broken off against the wishes of Germany .

I am well aware that the press in Germany is free, as it is in England, and that it will not have its policy prescribed for it, but when the press of a country spreads rumours about a friendly Power that are absolutely false, the Government could have well taken the first convenient opportunity of stating how much it regrets that such false statements have been given currency .

Count Metternich said in his reply of June 2, 1903, 29 that the object of Russia's financial policy was to bring Eng- land into the fold ; nevertheless, there was for the moment no prospect of a Rothschild loan for Russia . Massacres of Jews had recently taken place in Russia . In a general way, Munster wrote that the power of the Rothschilds in London has declined considerably, and Metternich wrote \"The London House enjoys great prestige, owing to its history, but for a long time no new business has come its way, and it contents itself with the safe investment of its wealth . For a long time it has ceased to undertake foreign loans on a large scale ; the only exception is in the case of Brazil, to which country it occasionally lends money .

Eckardstein wrote in this sense to Alfred Rothschild, who tried to convince ;his brother . On January 20 Count Hayashi was at Alfred Rothschild's and asked him for financial support for Japan . Alfred Rothschild made certain that the British government would have no objection, and then spoke of, his sympathies with Japan's aspirations, offering the pros- pect of the support of the House of Rothschild at a later opportunity . On February 8, 19o4, the Japanese suddenly attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . The war took its course . Russia attempted to secure financial assistance from the French House of Rothschild ; but she found that it was not particularly cordial . The German ambassador, Prince Radolin, reports on this matter : S 0 \"The Paris House of Rothschild is hostile to Russia, and at the present time is standing somewhat aloof from Russian operations . Baron Alfons said to me recently that Russia had made fine promises regarding the future treat- ment of his co-religionists, if only the money were forth- coming, but that his - attitude was that these were ; empty promises. Since, however, as a good Frenchman, he feels that he is more or less called upon to support the`Russian Alliance (and that is what I infer) he will possibly soften in the end and open his purse, however unfavorable a view he may take of the present situation .\" These short extracts give us sufficient indication of the fact that the House of Rothschild was courted by the great Powers until quite recent times, and that questions of high policy were most closely associated with their business transactions at all points. It must be left until a later period to deal with this in greater detail and more explicitly . During the last ten years before the World War, the Paris and London Rothschilds naturally identified them-"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century 429 selves- entirely with the respective policies of the coun- tries with which they were doing business ; but both they and the Vienna House, which was in the camp of the Triple Alliance, hoped until the last moment that the great conflict could be averted . The policy that the Roths- childs had followed since the fall of Napoleon, or indeed since they had come to possess a very large fortune, of always using their influence in the cause of peace, under moose protection they could preserve their money and d elop their world-wide business without disturbance, pe tinued to be their main inspiration throughout the riod immediately preceding the World War . If ever 'the archives of this period should be made available to the public it will probably be possible to show by docu- mentary evidence what we can now deduce only .from the consistency of the Rothschild policy during a century as shown by various indications and from information derived from certain responsible persons : that imme- diately before the outbreak of the World War the Roths- childs, especially the London Rothschilds, did everything possible to avert the catastrophe which was bound to constitute . a serious blow to the unity of their House, which, in a-certain sense, was still an important factor . However, their complete impotence to intervene effec- thely in the important decisions regarding world policy during the present century was only too obvious . They were not listened to, and when the Serajevo murder snatched the reins out of the hands of the statesmen throughout the world and the steeds of destiny took the bit between their teeth as they headed for war, the Roths- childs too had to make the best of a bad job, and like everyone else submit to the course of events . They again found themselves faced with a situation which, although it was not new to them, was not by any means easy to deal with ; again they had a foot in each camp . The Lon- don and Paris Houses were in the camp of the Entente, the Vienna House was in the camp of the central Powers ."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"430 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild The male members of the various Houses who were of military age joined the colors of the countries which they had adopted, and a member of the London House, Evelyn Rothschild, actually fell in battle in November, 1917, fighting against the Turks in Palestine . In general, the Rothschild Bank adopted a cautious reserve and a wait- ing policy, such as was natural in their position . The result of the World War was as fortunate for them as was possible in the circumstances, since two branches of the Rothschilds, and those the more powerful and well established ones, were in the countries of the victorious Entente, while only one branch was affected by the conse- quences of defeat . The Vienna House certainly suffered enormous losses, as did everybody in the conquered states, from the depre- ciation in securities and the value of money ; but scarcely had peace been concluded and the close relations be- tween the three Rothschild Houses reestablished when everything possible was done by the two Houses operat- ing in the victors' countries to assist the Vienna House in its great difficulties . A particularly fortunate coup was successfully carried through when the Morgan Bank came to the assistance of the depreciated French franc in 1924 . The Rothschild Bank in Paris took part in this operation, and was therefore in a position to estimate to a day when the franc would rise and naturally informed the Vienna House of Rothschild, advising it to deal in francs with a view to a rise, and not as almost all the rest of Europe was doing with a view to a fall . In a manner entirely unintelligible to a layman en- dowed with ordinary common sense, even the most ex- perienced financiers in Germany and Austria, and in several other European states, speculated on a fall in the currency of the most powerful of the victorious states on the Continent . A fate was prophesied for the franc similar to that which had been experienced by the Ger- man mark . When the measures for assisting it began to"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":".The Rothschilds in the Twentieth Century \t 431 take effect, and, instead of falling, the franc improved by almost a third of its value, the Rothschilds and the Vienna Credit Institute which they control, and which advised all its correspondents not to join in the franc speculation, won the day, while a large number of specu- lators, especially among the new rich, were forced to register extensive losses . By this move among others the Vienna Rothschilds have succeeded in making good a large proportion of their war losses, and even under pres- ent conditions, their social position and their general prestige have survived undiminished in the small Re- public of Austria . Today, one and one-half centuries after the foundation of the Bank, the Rothschilds are still firmly established ; their riches and their name are world-famous . It would be idle to attempt to measure their wealth in figures, for wealth of this nature changes continuously, and cannot be registered in figures even by its possessors . Such figures as occasionally appear in the newspapers represent esti- mates of an entirely imaginary nature . It is sufficient for us to know that the wealth of the family as a whole is still enormous, and increases automatically ; even though it may be surpassed by many private fortunes in England and America . The wealth of the family has become pro- verbial ; in ancient times the name of Croesus was a synonym for very great wealth . Today the same idea is conveyed even among the uneducated by the name of Rothschild . We have endeavored to show how this mass of wealth was acquired . It has always been done by main- taining the closest contact with those in charge of the world's destinies, and by a clever adaptation to events . The Rothschilds practically never opposed themselves to the authorities in the state for the time being ; they al- most always sought to come to terms with them, however uncongenial they might sometimes be . This naturally in- volved an extensive opportunism, but their success in- creased the prestige and the power of the family . Today"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"432 \t The Reign of the House of Rothschild the Rothschilds constitute a dynasty with all the advan- tages and disadvantages which that word implies . Every dynasty has been founded by exceptionally in- telligent or exceptionally brave men and certainly by men of unusual energy . In their way this was also true of the Rothschilds ; but the policy of inbreeding, which they have carried to even more dangerous lengths than many ruling houses, is undermining their spiritual and physical capital . Up to the present the advantage of concentrating their power and wealth by marrying within the family has overborne all other considerations . Bismarck once stated on this point : \" \"I have known many members of the House and I have always been struck by their lust for gold ;-this is attributable to the fact that each one of them wishes to leave to every one of his children as much as he himself has inherited, and that is surely absurd . . . . The Rothschilds are an outstanding example, but the X's provide a similar instance [Bismarck mentioned the name of an illustrious Prussian noble family .] A hun- dred and fifty and a hundred years ago the X's furnished eminent statesmen and generals to the State, and they were fine men . Today an X can scarcely be made use of as a subordinate official or second lieutenant .\" The future will show whether the Rothschilds will develop along similar lines . During the sixty years that have passed since the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War the world has undergone profound changes . Scien- tific discoveries have produced revolutionary results in every field ; conditions of life have been changed by the extraordinary development of a world press, by the in- vention of the petrol engine, the airplane, wireless, and a thousand other things ; all these have influenced the tech- nique of finance and commerce . Throughout the cen- turies, however, one factor has remained constant-the power of money ; indeed, the importance of this factor has increased .

Be- sides, it is not possible even approximately to ascertain the price at which they could be sold, in view of the fact that such reliable and timely help as is essential cannot be expected .
