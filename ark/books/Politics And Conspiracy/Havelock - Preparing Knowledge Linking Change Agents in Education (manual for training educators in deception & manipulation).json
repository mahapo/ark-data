As a result of this collaboration a second working draft (prototype #2) was produced including case studies from these change agents . Prototype #2 was reviewed intensively and evaluated by 115 educators chosen systematically to represent gerotypical future users of the manual . The response was over- whelmingly favorable and in addition provided a quantity of information which could be used fcr developing a third revision (prototype #3) . Subsequently the manual, under the title \"A Guide to Innovation in Education\" has teen distributed by The Institute for Social Research on a limited basis urder a developmental copyright from USOE so that it could be sold at cost anc used in a number of university courses, in-service workshops, and conferences . The feedback from this controlled dissemination has indicated that the \"Guide' can be an important tool in training and in program manage- ment in a variety of educational practice settings . The \"Guide' has now been further revised in accordance with objective A-3 to include a brief introduction for administrators and a greatly expanded section explaining the concept of \"resource linker\" and two other alternative change agent corcepts,-the \"catalyst\" and the \"solution giver .\" Additional sections are nov , being written and all three appendices revised and up-dated, _ using non-federil funds in preparation 'for final publication . Negotiations are under way with Educational Technology Publications, Inc . which has expressed a desire to publifh the final version . Checklists have been prepared for key portions of the text in accordance , with objective l . - 4 . . However, these instruments have not yet been field tested so that their utility is still a matter of conjecture . It is anticipated that before such materials can be used as reliable tools of change planning, they will require several cycles of development parallel to that of the \"Guide .\" B . \t Training Designs On May 25 - :o 27, 1970, 51 nationally recognized leaders in the field of change agent training were brought together at Clinton, Michigan to discuss the critical is! .ues relevant to the content and procedures for such training . The conference, itself, was an Intensive learning experience for those involved and represented a major dissemination thrust for the \"Guide\" and for the need for new resource : linking change agent roles . However, the conference also produced a numb# :r of specific, through tentative, training designs for different conceptions of . :he role . These are incorporated as Part V of the manual described below The primer\" products relevant to the achievement of objective B-2 have been assembled n the form of a manual for training program developers . This manual includes sections on knowledge content to be trained, goals of train :ng, principles of t - ainlng, an eight-part systematic framework for designing comprehensive programs, and several presentations of alternative . training models 4 F"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Section I :HISTCRY OF THE PROJECT Backgrounc and Rationale* The 1960'! saw the emergence of a new awareness that research by itself does not provice direct answers to the problems faced in the practical world, and this awareness has been articulated in the formation of a new discipline focused on the problem of knowledge dissemination and utilization . Research studies of the dissemination-utilization process were virtually non- existent prior to World War II ahd were restricted largely to the area of agricultural irnovations until a decade ago . Increasingly in recent years, however, there has been evidenced a dramatic growth of interest in this topic in such fields as public health, mental health, medicine, international development, and in partictflar, education . Together %, â€¢i th this growing interest in dissemination and utilization as a research concern have come increasing efforts to establish dissemination networks, new soles, and institutions designed specifically to speed the flow of knowledge from research to practice . U .S . education has been in the fore- front of this innovative trend . Starting with major federal legislation on education in tte early 1960's, there has been a very rapid growth of research and development centers, information clearinghouses, regional laboratories and locally based and regionally based dissemination projects, conferences, and training programs, all geared generally to the same end of up-grading education by irfusing in the practicing school system new ideas and innovations baied on - research knowledge' . This proliferation of institutional forms has been so rapid that in nearly all cases it has preceded the development of adequate role definitions and adequate training and support activities and materials for these new roles . Practically overnight, thousands of new knowledge linking roles (disseminators, consultants, demonstrators, etc) have been created and filled'by people who have only a vague conception of what the role is and no real way of preparing themselves and supplying themselves with the appropriate knowledge and materials for occupying the role . Major contributions toward defining and publicizing the need for the linker role in education were made by Clark and Hopkins (1966 a & b) when they developed a ta) :onomy of linkage roles as a part of their study of \"Roles for Research, Development and Diffusion Personnel in Education .\" They saw specialized diffusion role! . as an essential accompaniment to the roles related to research and developmen - : in education and further study convinced them that the demand for persons to fill these roles would be tremendous in the not-so-distant future . The instil :utionalization of linking roles In education is urgently needed to satisfy thi- ; growing demand and to assist in coordinating linking functions so that role o â€¢\" erload and marginality, current major causes of linking failure, do not become - :otally nullifying forces In knowledge diffusion In education . The primary considerations for establishing and training personnel in linking roles are outl ned by Havelock, et a) (1969, Chapter 7) . *Much of this Material Is adapted from the original proposal 6 statement ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"To provide adequate support for these emerging linking roles in education, the educational establishment will have to provide training courses and field handbooks and manuals not only in specific content areas r .uch as' reading, guidance, administration, and . curriculum but also in the general processe â€¢: of disseminating and installing innovations, planning of :hange, and faci itating the flow of knowledge from research to practice . This project was intended as one contribution to this difficult but essential 'rocess . Building on an extensive review of the dissemination and utilization : :terature (Have~ock, et al, 1969), we set out to create a field manual for the ' :racticing knoa-le :dge linker in education . It was felt, however, that such a iocument would be successful only if it were developed collaboratively with a epresentative s :,mple of these linking agents . Later phases of the project be concerned with further revision and extension of the field manual and ,he establishment of training programs to familiarize linkers with its contents 'nd potential uses . It was felt that through such programs some strong new role ;rages would corm into being through educators who were beginning to develop an 'identity and a de :fined area of expertise as resource' linkers . B . \t How the Guide was Created : Cycles of Development 1 . Review of Past Efforts and Development of a Proposal This project began with a need expressed by the Office of Education for a companion work to the extensive compendium and analysis of findings on dissern :n :ition and utilization (Havelock, et al, 1969) . While this work was still in progress it was already-obvious that its primary audiences would be - - researchers and policy planners who had the sophistication, patience, and motivation ' :o derive their own implications . What about the busy administrator or practitioner who needed practical help on knowledge retrieval and utilization? Was it not possible to develop cme practical guide for this broader and less research-or ented audience so that the substantial existing research and theory in this area could be put to more immediate practical use? A firs' : step was to look for models of such an effort . Had anyone tried to do this Before and how well had they succeeded? In 1958, Lippitt, Watson, and Westley had published a volume entitled The Dynamics of Planned Change . This book wars well written, summarized a good deal of existing research, and was directed broadly at practitioners of change . However, it was still largely theoretical-analytical in approach ; it did not draw specific implications for specific si : :uatlons ; it contained few clearly specified \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" ; it was in no sense a \"how to\" manual . Furthermore, The Dynamics of Planned Change was not sysi :ematically evaluated by any group of change agents for its utility or effectiveness before final dissemination . A more recent effort by Thomas E . Woods, The /administration of Educational Innovation (1967) does a fine and concise job of summarizing the rich literature on the diffusion of innovations (touched only lightly by Lippitt, et al) providing it In pamphlet size in the language : that a busy practitioner might understand and absorb . But Woods' effort likewise was not tried out and evaluated on a practitioner audience and probably dcx :s not have enough depth to be considered a manual on change ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"-3- proposed by self-selected subgroups at the Michigan conference . Finally, the manual includes a fully developed outline for training state agency change agents .' Plans for publication and distribution of this manual on training have not been fully formulated but it is expected that further revisions will be made using ron-federal funds and that the Institute for Social Research publications office will make the document widely available . .

A single message about an effective innovation was transmitted by different media to several matched audiences and their adoptive be'iavior was compared . Glaser found that the written communication alone was sifficient for diffusing knowledge of the innovation, but that the additioi of a demonstration conference or consulting activities significant y increased its actual adoption . The key variable here was . the opportuiity for the receiver to give feedback to the sender about his evaluat on of the new idea in terms of his own experience . These results sug â€¢t ested that various mechanisms, conferences, interviews, evaluation \"orms, and consultations might be needed (a) to develop a product tha : was meaningful and useful to the intended audience, and (b) to-diff-ise the product once it was developed . Although the use of a training package for disseminating experimentally- based or iniovative programs to practitioners is common, as are studies of their effec :iveness, their diffusion potential is limited because these programs hale generally dealt with specific innovations, have been developed ii response to requests from specific audiences, and have been designed to solve the unique problems of their respective situations . Such was th! purpose of the social science curriculum development studies of .ippitt and Fox (1964) . The same limitations apply in lesser degree to Richland's \"traveling seminar\" (1965) for educational innova- tion diffusion . Although such programs and packages are invariably reported as \"successful,\" each faced anew the problems of entry, resistance, and linkage training with its respective audiences . ; Moreover_, . even haviY ng --- solved these problems for themselves, they do not contribute very much to our gene-al knowledge on linkage problems in education . Their techniques for dealing with these problems are not readily generalizable to other, audiences o - to the same audience under different conditions because the techniqies of entry, linkage training, etc . have not been clearly differentiated from the innovation itself . Also, 3s these examples illustrate, much of the existing research had as its )rimary audience that group of practitioners who are most directly involved with the consumer (student, patient, etc .) . These people are-arely in a position to assume the role of knowledge linkers to other practitioners . They may or may not have the administrative authority t) act as a linker or change agent in their system, but if they are directly involved with the consumer they will have little time or energy t') devote to linking activities after coping with the more salient--ani urgent--daily problems in their own consumer system . One attempt to overcome these limitations and to establish linking functions aid roles as a permanent aspect of a school system was reported by Shaevitz and Barr (1968) in A Training Program for Research Utilizers : Philosophy Goals and Methods . Their simultaneous \"microaction\" and . \"rnacroactioi' i research directed training in change processes at class- room teaches and principals and at people who had cross-building responsibilities within the school system . However, a lack of user B"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(1) (2) (3) - 7- sophistication and an unfortunate lack of involvement on the part of the participants motivated the research team to turn from general issues of change processes to the solution, through change, of specific existing prcblems in the system . Thus, the future linkage potential of .these two groups remains unexamined . Another important contribution to our early planning for this project was the :work of the Communication Program of the Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development directed by Dr . Paul Hood . We were especially impressed by the systematic development and evaluation process employed by that program in the evolution of educational products, and we made a conscious effort to adapt their approach in our own planning . - On the whole, past research seemed to say exceedingly little about ,the effectiveness of specialized communications of the type envisaged in this pro j ect . On the other hand, there was some reason to believe from numerous studies and observations of knowledge linking roles in various othe :r fields that the development of viable knowledge-linking roles in education would be significantly aided by the simultaneous - development of training programs, handy reference tools, and other software supports at least on a par with those now possessed by the county extension agent in agriculture . They also suggested the need for a development strategy which - included features such as : piirticipation by the audience in product planning, s\"stematic evaluation, and p anned diffusion including user training and follow-up . With these ideas in mind the Michigan team developed a proposal to USOE for- a manual incorporating features-(1) and (2) with the . expectation that feature (3) would be added at a later date if the early work ' .as successful . 2 . Literature Review and Annotated Bibliography After 7 unding, :the project staff began by making a thorough search for major wl)rks on &hange in education, updating the search` effort of two years earlier which had led to the comprehensive literature review . This time, aowever, we were especially on the look-out for literature on change which was practitioner-oriented and in which derivations of implication ; for practice were spelled out . From 0is literature review the staff* developed the first product of the proj .ct, an annotated bibliography of \"Major Works on Change in Education\" +ith a detailed subject index . The subject index was later . valuable as a key to specific points and quotations which we wanted to include in the \"Guide .\" It was also anticipated that this bibliography *Havelock laid oit the overall plan and took part in editing and screening while the annotations and indices were developed by Huber and Zimmerman ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(1) would be a useful appendix for the \"Guide,\" itself, and, for that reason we used the following criteria for choosing works to be cited : (1) 3eneral coverage of, a range of topics relevant to educational change . (2) In book form . (3) 'ublished and available in education libraries, cook stores, or by ordering from indicated sources . For tie most part we excluded empirical studies and reports on specific research projects unless they covered a range of relevant topics, offered both research findings and implications for practice, and could se obtained as separate monographs . Copies of the bibliography were printed and distributed both by the Uniiersity of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory .* Included was a sheet entitled \"feedback to authors\" which asked readers to voluntarily indicate how they had used the bibliography and how useful it had been . Although this device induced only a trickle of responses (they are still coming in) there seemed to be a generally favorable response . 3 . Choosing a Structure for the \"Guide\" There were several alternatives available to us in structuring the \"Guide,\" and because of the potential importance for later utility and acceptance by practitioners, we were anxious to explore a number of them be\"ore arriving at any conclusions . At least six possibilities presented : :hemselves : An encyclopaedic compendium of facts about change process, written in a simple style with practical implications, spelled out and arranged as alphabetical entries of any length from a shout paragraph to 2 or 3 pages, thoroughly :ross indexed . ; Pros : relatively easy and straight forward to create, a good reference for specific user needs, maximum user selectivity allowed . Cons : expensive to produce If done well (it would be very large), hard to disseminate, very low user involvement (impossible to read cover-to-cover), difficult to use in a training program or in a course . I n neither case, were federal funds from this project used for dissemination . 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"-10- con ; : it would be difficult to present a coherent over- view or systematic topic coverage . Most of what is written, even if it is very well written, is not practitioner-oriented and does not go far in spelling out the \"how to's .\" (6) Problem solving stages : this is the approach used by Lippitt, Watson and Westley (1958) . Pros : from our reading of the limited research literature on the change agent, this approach seems closest to the way he organizes his life and work . It allows systematic and logically ordered topic coverage and is especially suited to the \"how to\" style of presentation . It is also fairly involving and can be presented in parallel with actual case materials . It is also handy as a basis for simulations . 'nna : there is little agreement among experts on either the numbering or the ordering of such \"stages\" ; moreover it may be more difficult In this approach to pick up the change agent \"where he's at .\" This framework might be seen by some as too rigid and arbitrary to apply to the myriad of situations the change agent might find himself in . After some discussions with other CRUSK staff experienced as change agents and change agent trainers (e .g ., Ronald Lippitt, Robert Fox, Mark Chesl .r, and LuciIle- Schaible)--and--some - intensive field interviews with educational_ change agents in Michigan (in the state department, at the University, and in three school districts), two facts became evident : (a) that tie problem solver and the casebook approaches were both the most user-oriented and (b) that it is very difficult to elicit meaningful reactions to the idea of a product when the reactors don't have a model of the \"re - 31 thing\" in front of them . Weighing these alternatives and facts, we chose the problem solver stages approach as our primary structure for developing a first prototype with the aided notion that various appendices (such as the annotated bibliograp y) and a subject index could enhance its value as a reference work, and that a series of case studies would increase and enhance its value as a readable and involving book . 4 . &ptoratory FieZd Interviews The exploratory f ;eld interviews were especially important in giving us a picture of the \"life space\" of the people who are now operating as educatianal change agents . It was obvious that most of these people are not theorists or even grand strategists, that what they know about the change process Is not very systematically organized and only loosely articulated, that they think In terms of specific projects on which they, are working, and that their thinking runs in a kind of a chronological order as they talk about their work . It was evident that If we were 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"-9- ( ) .%systems analytic framework such as Stufflebeam's \"Context-Input-Process -Product\" (1970) . would allow a systematic coverage of most topics in a logical order . This would make the book most useful to policy and program planners especially if they had engineering backgrounds . Increasing numbers of educators are becoming familiar with this approach to conceptualizing and ordering the facts about complex topics . :ons : may not do justice to some of the social and psychological realities which the change agent must contend with . Moreover it, is still foreign territory to many educators and enemy territory to some . (3) %communication model approach (i .e ., \"Who says or does \t r hat to whom by what channel to what eff'e( t .\") such is used by Hovland (1954), Rogers (1962 and Havelock (1969) in his comprehensive literature review .

It would also be an extremely helpful adjunct to training . 'one : it would be very difficult to teach much substance of the research or theory of change in this manner and it would be very difficult to compose in the first place .

Originally a conference had been planned to attract twenty or more educators representing change agents in at least four categories :, (a) State Department of Education personnel who are engaged in disseminating new knowledge to school systems . (b) Directors of knowledge utilization and demonstration projects under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . (c) Dissemination staff members from the Regional Educational Laboratories . (d) *Professors in schools of education . However because of our budget constraints and the increasingly evident need to work in depth with those who we contacted, we decided to limit the first conference to five articulate and representative change agents who would be willing and able to (a) read our materials .critically and thoroughly, and (b) provide us with descriptions of their work which could be developed Into cases for inclusion in the \"Guide .\" 5 . \t The knowledge Linkers Workshop \t =- _ ' _ :n_- _ During the fall of 1968 and the early winter of 1969, the project staff worked to develop a first prototype of the \"Guide\" based on the problem solving structure in preparation for the first evaluation by the change agents and a representative of the USOE (Mr . Richard Elmendorf) . By February 15, each participant was mailed a rudimentary draft version including drafts of the introduction, Chapter I \"Establishing the Knowledge Linker Role,\" Chapter 2 \"Diagnosing the Problem in the Client System,\" Chapter 3 on \"Retrieving Relevant Knowledge,\" an appendix to Chapter 3 on available information resources, Chapter 4 \"Selecting the Innovatior,\" and the annotated bibliography . The conference was convened on March 15, 1969 . By prior arrange- ment each participant began by relating a case of attempted innovation from his %ork experience . The case could be either successful or unsuccessful but in either case It should be the one he knew most aboL's and the one that seemed to him to Illustrate the most about the change process . After each presentation the project staff would question the presenter and suggest how his narrative could be fitted to a problem solving stages model of change . Part of the afternoon session was reserved for comments and reactions to the drafts of \"Prototype #1 .\" The introduction and the overall plan for the \"Guide\" were received favorably as were the two appendices, but all the participants found the writing style difficult and the layout of chapters cumbersome and rather overwhelming in detail . It was clear that 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"-12- a more pal 'shed product was needed in a simplified writing style with a reduction of diagrams and \"telegrams\" and an increase In narrative prose and quotations . On tht whole, the conference was very successful even if it contained â€¢. ome bad news for the development team . The case presenta- tions were interesting, rich in detail, and right on target as potential case mater 'als for the \"Guide .\" The feedback on the prototype also provided explicit guidance for further development and support for overall di-ection . 6 . Creat - on'of Prototype #2 The first and most important task following the March conference was writing and rewriting of the main context of the \"Guide .\" Havelock assumed primary dutles .for this part, of the project, receiving editorial help and cri- ticism frorr Douglas Truax and Joyce Kornbluh . The introduction and first chapters were written and rewritten several times until the whole staff felt the proper tone and flow were achieved . Once the style had been set and practiced for .a while the writing became much easier . Parallel to this activity the project staff was developing case studies ba! .ed on the presentations at the conference . Four of the five presentations were judged to contain enough detail to merit inclusion in the \"Gu de\"* but they required extensive editing and rewriting before they were ! .uitable for publication . Part of this editing process con- sisted of adding steps that might have or should have taken place but were not s' .ated clearly by the presenter . This fictionalization was minor but was deemed desirable for the sake of readability ., However, it may have resulted in distortions such that some cases (e .g ., \"Mike\") sounded more organized and more successful than they actually were while . others (e .q ., \"Steve\") sounded less so . There was considerable disagree- ment among the staff over the wisdom of presenting cases which were not absolutely faithful to reality as spoken by the change agents . However, 115 change agents who later evaluated the \"Guide\" rated all the cases as \"typica\"\" or \"very typical\" in their experience .\" Considerable time and thought were devoted during this period to providing ien Interesting and, readable format for the main text . In prototype )`l we had provided a text with many headings and an elaborate paragraph numbering system, Interspaced at frequent intervals with quotes frori other sources . Our conferees felt that this approach chopped up the text and made the flow of thought very hard to follow . On the other hand they enjoyed the quotes which were on target . The sc-lution seemed to be a two column format with the text flowing down the lEft column and the right either clear for individual note- taking or providing space for quotes where appropriate . Standard reference footnotes were relegated to the back of the book and the numbering system disappeared entirely . Another change was the addition in the rigi-t hand column of references to case study material whenever a point in the text could be illustrated by what did or did not happen in one of the cases . *The fifth case was the last presented and suffered from time limitations ; there was litt'e time left for staff questioning and clarification after the initial presentation . \t 4 **See Section II of the report for presentation of this data . \t 1 ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"-13- The \"Guide\" as It was developed during this phase of the project had six components : (1) The introduction which ex lained the purpose of the \"Guide,\" suggested three alternate role models for the change agent and a brief analysis of six process stages (\"building a relationship,\" \"diagnosis,\" \"retrieving resources,\" \"choosing solutions,\" \"gaining acceptance,\" and \"stabilization and self-renewal .\" (2) The four case studies . (3) The text of six chapters, each representing a \"stage .\" (4) An alphabetical listing of specific \"strategies\" of change . (5) (6) The annotated bibliography . The fourth part (strategies) was derived from a CRUSK working paper by davelock entitled \"Innovations in Education : Strategies and Tactics .\" This listing was added as a compromise with the encyclo- paedic ap3roach mentioned earlier . As finally assembled, prototype #2, represented a comb Ination, of, . ;J approaches Intended to appeal to users with a variety of information acquisition habits . The first three parts could be read in succession ; the last three parts could be used for a variety of reference purposes . A reader could also brouse or skim with the aid of charts, a clear outline and headings and many quotes from the leading authors in, the field . We were concerned, of course, that all these elements might represent too much for a manual of this kind but it did provide readers with many alternatives, and with a thorough evaluation planned, we felt that It would be best to let readers decide what should stay and what should go . 7 . Review by a National Cross-Section of Educators in Typical Change Agent RoZes By the fall of 1969 we felt we had a product worthy of field evaluation . As called for in the proposal, reactions were solicited from four groups of educators thought to be typical of those now operating as \"change agents\" within the U .S . educational complex . The sample chosen was not intended to be representative of the nation's educational linkers in any strict statistical sense, nor were the four populations from which they were drawn exhaustive of possible linking role positions in the national educational establishment . However, each of the populations chosen had certain distinctive features which made them sigr â€¢I ficant audiences against whose judgment the utility of the An index of information sources in education (intended as a supplement to stage 3) . 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"-14- manual should be measured . The significance of each group is specified briefly below : (1) State Department Personnel : Every state employs a number of professional educators (ranging from about 10 in the smallest states to about 200 in New York and California) as consultants, coordinators, and disseminators in various specific subject matter areas typically under major divisions identified as \"administrative services,\" \"instruction,\" and \"vocational education .\" Whether or not such professional staff serve as knowledge linkers is not entirely clear . However, such persons are strategically located and formally charged with duties which bring them into frequent contact with practitioners (administrators, teachers, and other!) under circumstances where they may be seen as know- ledge linkers . State Department personnel are also significant as a potential audience because of the probable increased reliance upon the states for the administration of federal dissemination progrcms over the next few years . (2) \t [SEA Title III Directors : this title provides funding for locally originated projects to diffuse innovations and facilitate the innova- tive process at the school system level . With fiscal year, 1966, the federal government started funding 1,000 such projects across the country . Directors of such projects are change . agents or administrators of innovation activities more or lees by definition . Hence, they represent a large and rapidly grog :ing new audience for knowledge about the utiliza- tion process . Study of this audience and its reactions to the mi,nual might give some indication of the relative merits of installing and supporting knowledge linkers on the local schoolystem level in contrast to state, regional or federal loci . An estimated 1,500 individuals belonged to this popula- tion it the time the project began . (3) Regional Educational Laboratory Dissemination Staff : The REL's were established with the specific mission of develcpment and dissemination of educational innovations . Although they varied greatly [n size and emphasis, the 20 REL's then in existence represented an important emerging force in the : educational establishment . They were stafTed by young, eager and often highly skilled professionals dedicated to educational change . Thus, although the number of individual diffufion personnel (including those involved in demonstration and field consultation activities) was small (approximately 200 individuals at that time) it was proportionally large within the REL's . In addition the REL's deserve close watching as potential loci for a vastly expanded federal effort in which an equivalent .16 .,}"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of the present diffusion network in agriculture (the Coopera- tive Extension Service)' would be installed in the field of education . (4) ~'rofessors of Education : There are an estimated 50,000 professors of education teaching in the 1,500 degree-conferring institutions of higher learning in the United States . Although it is presumed that few f-om this group would identify themselves as \"knowledge linkers\" or \"change agents,\" they represent the largest clearly identifiable pool from which such persons are likely to emerge In selecting a sample from this group for evaluating the manual,' we were guided by such additional criteria as : some amount of extension teaching, involvement in consulting activities uff campus, and membership or training experiences with such groups as th< : National Training ti-boratcries of NEA . In accordance with the plan set out in the original proposal - prospective respondents were chosen at random from available lists and were sent a letter and a brief form explaining the project, asking for them to spell out their current role and soliciting their . consent to be reviewers of the manual in exchange for receiving a complimentary copy of the final product . The r- :sponse to the commitment request letter was very encouraging (151 out of 200 or 75 .5% accepted) . Of these 115 later returned completed review forms (75.6*) . Although the detailed results of this review process are presented in Section II of this report, their import can be summarized briefly . The review process was successful on three counts : (1) It elicited a high rate of return . (2) Reactions to the \"Guide\" as a whole and to all major sections was overwhelmingly positive . (3) The reviewers provided us with extensive and detailed information for the development of a third and signifi- cantly improved version (prototype #3) . 8 . Creation of Prototype k3 With additional support from the U .S . Office of Education we were able to use the feedback from the reviews to formulate another revision of the \"Guide\" in the winter of 1970 . . The principal changes made were as follows : (1) Complete rewrite (for about the tenth time) of the' introduction . .17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"9 (2) Complete recomposition and rewrite of Stage III (I'l .cquiring Resources\") .' (3) Introductions and \"editorials\" on each case study . (4) Updating the appendix of information sources (the obsolescence rate for this index is extremely high) (5) Minor changes in the other \"stages .\" (6) The inclusion of many more references to the case studies in the right hand column of the text . Each of these revisions was based directly on feedback from reviews . Disserni :iation and Utilization of Prototype #3 This third prototype version was considered sufficiently polished to merit limited distribution and utilization in some training workshops and conferen :es . Under a developmental copyright, the Institute printed and paper-boind 2,000 copies, recouping printing costs with a $3 .00 charge on ea :h copy .* In addition to individual users, the \"Guide\" became the basis for several in-service training workshops, conferences, and graduate seminars among : which were the following : (1) The \"Guide\" formed the basis of a training institute for vocational education information specialists and program administrators held at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May of 1970 .** \t At this event, participants divided into four groups to simulate the development of a change project using each of the six stages .

(4) \t n the summer of 1970 the \"Guide\" was used in conjunction_ with two pilot programs to train state agency linkage - agents (Project SPREAD at Denver, Colorado and the Pilot 'state Program sponsored by the National Center for Educational Communication (NCEC) at the University of Itissouri) . (5) \t n the winter and spring of 1971 the \"Guide\" was used s as the basis of graduate seminars at Michigan and at the University of Sussex in England . In these seminars graduate students worked on educational change projects which were analyzed systematically according to the six tages .

In this seminar, participants i :lustered into eight groups . Two groups focussed on each of the four case studies, listing what should have and could have been done at each stage .

FUrthu'r Revisions and Additions Under USOE Contract Although none were funded under this contract, most of the dissemination events listed above were evaluated and provided feedback of potential relevance for redevelopment of the \"Guide\" at some future date . Most of this feedback was extremely positive suggesting that the core document served Its purpose more than adequately . However, there were certain changes and additions that might make it even more powerful and more relevant for a wider audience . Therefore in a contract supplement the USOE provided additional funds for the development of : (1) Checklist summaries of major points in each chapter . 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I 9 -18- (2) kn Introductory section for administrators snd at least one other specialized audience . `and (3) > new section on establishing the role of change agent- <nowledge linker .

The checklists, which are contained in \"Attachment #2\" below, still require and deserve considerable revision and evaluation . Ideally they shouli follow a development cycle parallel to the \"Guide\" itself . . It was decided that special introductions should be brief and fairly broadly targetted or else they would throw off our original change agent audience . The second introductory statement applies to \"inside agents working from below\" which we found to be the largest class of users and potential change agents on the educational scene, i .e ., students and teachers w,-to want to change their own school . These sections are incor- porated in the \"introduction\" to the copy of the \"Guide\" presented in Attachment /1 . The new piece on the problem of establishing the role of linker has not been incorporated in the \"Guide\" as such (although the role description section has been expanded and revised) . Rather it seemed appropriate to provide this material as part of the manual on training program design (Attachment 13) where it Is incorporated as elements of Part IV, especially IV - 1_, 2, 3, and 5 . Considerations of role definition,development,and installation are thoroughly explored throughout the training design manual and specific alternatives are provided in Parts V and VI . 11 .

The aithor has immediate plans to revise and expand several parts including the introduction, Stage I, Stage VI and all the appendices . In particular Appendix B has proven extremely vulnerable to obsolescence and must be thoroughly overhauled . All these changes will be made by the author and they will lead to the puJication of the \"Guide\" in the spring of 1972, probably by Educational Technology Publicat ons .

Backgrc-und : The Need for Something Beyond the Guide The original proposal for this project was focussed exclusively on the development of a \"Guide\" to the process of knowledge utilization (in early draft titled \"The Knowledge Linker's Handbook\") . The \"Guide\" was to be targetted to a particular educational audience, those concerned with utilizing knowledge to introduce practice improve- ments at all levels and in all types of educational situations . However, from the beginning there was a problem in identifying who these people were by title and position . Up to now no one in education has carried the title of \"change agent\" or \"resource linker,\" \"utilization specialist\" or \"knowledge broker .\" Yet once the development cycle began and we started identifying individuals, interviewing them, and getting their inputs on the emerging \"Guide,\"it became evident that while such people do exist ., they are (a'l in very short supply, (b) know very little of the literature on change, and (c) fly by the seat of their pants in developing change strategies . The \"Guide\" would be a help provided the right people were aware of it, were motivated to read it, and had enough initiative to find ways of using it in their work . These were all big \"ifs .\" Clearly something mnre substantial and intensive was needed if we were to move toward a really lasting, coherent, and professional concept of resource linker . As with the development of the \"Guide,\" itself, we decided to move forward in a collaborative and systematic way, this time involving the key national leaders who had had a hand in the training of various types of educational change agents or had a hand in administering organizationss and program ; In which such individuals would be working (e .g, State education agency staff) . The idea of a training program design as the appropriate next step in our program had roots in other events of the previous two years that are worth noting : (1) T-pe need for the design of some sort of nation-wide program t3i diffuse current knoKledge on utilization and planned innovation was discussed at length during the review conference of leading utilization scholars in Ann Arbor in February, 1968 (that meeting was sponsored by the Literature Review Project) . At that time, Everett Rogers described the experience' of the National Project for Agricultural Communications (NPAC) which was launched in the mid-fifties as a program to diffuse current knowledge about communication of innovations to agricultural change agents in all the states . There was consensus among t-we group that a similar program was needed now in education . (2) The same idea was proposed again to the Special Interest Group on Research Utilization of AERA at the annual meeting in Los Angeles in February, 1969, and strongly endorsed by ''ost of those present . 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"-20- (3) Our experience in April, 1969, at the mini-conference of educational change agents to discuss the emerging hand- bcok (see B-5 above) strongly indicated the need for some scrt of training workshop as a necessary accompaniment to any written materials . The participants at this meeting were or-ly able to identify themselves with the materials after tFey had had a chance to discuss the \"agent\" role concept In the context of their own work and to compare their experiences with others engaged in similar activities . For these reasons a proposal to extend the project to include a conference to develop training program specifications was submitted and approved by the USOE ; subsequently a second supplement was requested expanding otn these Ideas and calling for more extensive conference follow-up, (in addition to \"Guide\" additions described earlier) . 2 . - Conference Planning As a f rst step in developing this part of the project a planning and steering committee was formed consisting of : Ronald G . Havelock, Project Director Henry 11 . Brickell of the Institute for Educational Development Charles C . Jung of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Thomas C . Clemens of the U .S . Office of Education This group represented a range of backgrounds and points of view with a cormw)n central concern for the training of specialists in resource utilization .- The committee had these concerns : (a) to design an event that would be involving, informative, and productive : i .e ., we had to attract the very best people in the field, we had to teach them what we had in mind as \"resource linking change agentry,\" and we had to get them to work together to produce some training designs . (b) to choose a list of potential participants and a procedure for recruiting them . To speak to the first concern, it appeared that the conference, Itself, should be designed to have three phases : (1) input (to familiarize or remind participants of existing state-of-the-art knowledge about change process), (2) discussion (to analyze the problem of training and to derive implications from research literature relevant to change agent training), and (3) output (to work together In teams to put together actual training designs based on (1) and (2)) . To reinforce the input phase it was decided to provide all conferees with advance written materials and to ask for extensive prior reading and thinking on the content represented in these materials . By this means, hopefully, all participants would arrive with some common knowledge in their heads, some shared expectations, and a specific expectation that they could and would contribute to the proceedings . 22 *A r co"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"3 . e -21- Choosing and recruiting participants was also a crucial task . We had to have people who (a) represented the highest . levels of sophistication and understanding of change processes from a variety of perspectives, (b) had long experience and know-how in the art and science of training, per se, (c) understood the complexities of the educational settings in which trainees would be working, and (d) had the national recognition and respect as leaders and experts to give the conference and its outputs maximum visibility . To meet these objectives at least seven constituencies had to _ be represented in some degree : (1) prominent researchers on educational innovation process, (2) U .S . Office of Education : research training, planning, dissemination, (3) state education agency officials, (4) school of education deans, (5) superintendents or program directors for school districts or exemplary programs, (6) private enterprise, publishers, etc ., (7) Regional Educational Laboratory and R&D Center directors and staff especially concerned with dissemination__and change . Under these seven headings the committee drew up a list of over 150 names . From this list a smaller number (8-10 in each category) were selected e .s the persons to be reached in the first wave of invitations . Because of the prominence and expertise of the chosen group, it was _decided ttat further inducement in the form of travel and living costs should be offered . A grant of 2 000 was rovid Research an th \t 'liza ion of Foun ation grant to help defray these additional costs . Sc ie \t . . n Knowled from i is Kell Recruitment Six key experts were contacted by phone approximately five months before the tentative date set for the conference . Because the participa- tion of these persons was deemed essential, it was felt that their schedule should be checked first and commitments obtained . The fact of their agreement to participate would also be a draw to some of the others we would contact later . A letter of invitation was composed explaining the nature of the conference, objectives, time, place, etc . This letter was very care- fully prepared, checked out with steering committee members and several others,* and rewritten several times .

Additionally, we will be concerned with how we can plan a national program or programs in this area . \"Why the Conference is Needed and Why Now : 1 . \t P-evious reports calling for more change agents and disseminators hive received considerable notice . A training design is the key implementation step for establishing such roles in large numbers .

The Ccmferenee (CECAT) On May 25, 1970 the \"Conference on Educational Change Agent'Trainin (CECAT) began on schedule at a secluded conference center in a country setting* at Clinton in southeastern lower Michigan . Most participants ,arrived Sunday evening, May 24, for dinner and had an opportunity to get acquainted or reacquainted informally before the actual work of the meeting began . Each participant had previously been mailed a number of materials including a paper by Goodwin Watson summarizing the research literature on research utilization,** Planning for Innovation by Havelock, et al ., a 500 page work presenting a comprehensive summary of the literature on planned change, dissemination, and utilization as of 1969, the \"Guide\" (prototype 13) and another practitioner-oriented manual on the change process prepared by Everett Rogers and Lynn Svenning for .\"Operation PEP,\" a Title III project based in the San Mateo, California school district . In addition each participant had been provided with an extensive reaction form covering the major findings reported in these readings . The form ac â€¢k ed for their theoretical orientation, their judgment of the importance of various topics and their choice of a topic on which they could serve as a special informant and resource person to others at the conference . Nearly all participants had faithfully completed this form and returned it to us prior to May 20th so that we were able to collate responses and provide every member with a collective profile of knowledge levels, attitudes, and interests of those attending the meeting . Charles Jung=also prepared a list of generalizations on the training process derived from research findings . We hoped that participants would peruse these two documents fairly carefully to get a feel for what would be discussed the first two days . After a brief orientation session on Monday morning the participants divided into six groups of about 8 members each ; these groups were pre- selected to be more or less homogeneous on the basis of theoretical orientation and topic interest . They were' each provided with a recording secretary and were asked to appoint a chairman to guide the discussion, to- keep time so that each had a chance to make a presentation around one of the generalizations and to post the major points arising from the discussion for sharing with the other groups in the late afternoon . *Actually, because of the number of participants and the small number of private rooms, many had to double and triple up . This caused considerable discomfort to some . The site chosen proved to be a significantly negative feature of the conference . **Prepared for an NIMH contract to Edward Glaser and the Human Interaction Research Institute to prepare a manual on the use of research results in mental health . 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"-2 7 - Following this orientation concerned participants were invited to post an 'Idea for a change role or situation for which a training program of some kind was needed . The question of level was also left open . After these ideas were posted all the participants were asked to read them and to sign up under them if they wanted to participate in that task force . By t!'is process seven task groups were formed ranging in size from two to seven members . In addition, Jour participants chose to work alone developing their own models . The first task force sessions on Tuesday afternoon were intended . to explore the role concept under consideration more fully and to answer the first question on the outline (role definition and rationale) . Tuesday evening Havelock, Jung, and Clemens were to screen the prelim- inary task force outputs and provide itiedback and comment on additional points and clarifications that should be made in the Wednesday morning discussions . On Wednesday the first two hours were devoted to concluding the task force work . At 11 :00 a .m . the task force reports were posted in the large meeting room and output of each task force was summarized by a spokesman . Reactions and clarifications from all participants were offered . A final session of the conference dealt with next steps which might be taken to advance the training of change agents and reactions to this conference . \t This meeting was unfortunately too brief to reach much closure and was rated as less than completely . satisfactory by those who were still present . 5 . Aftermath of the Conference At the close of the conference each member was presented with a long evaluation form which asked for ratings and reactions to each seg- ment including advance materials, over-all design, group sessions, panel, informal discussions, and task force meetings . Forty-one responses were received representing about 90% of the participants who were able to stay with the conference for the three days, exclusive of the chairman and organizer . These responses are analyzed in Section III of this report . Immediately after the conference H Yelock set about preparing guide- lines for a model training program for State Education Agency change ~~e \t lists (Interim Report submitted June 30, 1970) . In developing this p an, he reviewed the task force outputs and panel presentations, and followed a modified form of the task force structure (with an additional eighth element \"utilization of evaluation\") . However, it soon became evident that the rich and loosely structured output Df the conference, though a good stimulus, had to be augmented considerably from other sources . This training model design is now incorporated as Part VI of the \"Manual on Educational Change Agent Training\" (Attachment 13 of this report) . 29 4 r"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":".4 -26- The newsprint summaries of each group's discussion of the day were posted a n the large meeting room and participants were encouraged to \"walk around\" to inspect and consider the points made by other . groups . On the evening of the first day, these same subgroups met once more, this time to consider the several additional topic items that participants had added to the list on the pre-conference feedback form .- These \"hot issues\" discussions were undoubtedly a highlight of the conference for many participants as there was an opportunity to explore issues of great personal concern and currency with a distinguished group of colleagues . Some of these sessions continued well . into the late evening hours . The second day began with aa panel discussion of training \"experts\" on issues particularly germane to training per se . Kenneth Benne, Matthew Miles, Lucille Schaible, Irving Millgate, Ronald Lippitt, Floyd Mann, and Max Goodson each made a brief presentation on training issues followed by a general discussion including all participants . Following this general meeting a new set of subgroups was formed with each of the panel members as chairman of a group . The groups were intended to discuss and post key training issues using as resources (1) the Jung list of generalizations on training, and (2) the panel discussion . it appeared in retrospect that the device of a_!'panel\" was somewhat_ . divisive since many other participants hadexpertise in this . . .ea and may have resented the apparent elevation of a few . Although the conference chairman (Jung) and the organizer (Havelock) thought the panel was very stimulating, it was not rated highly by most participants . On Tuesday afternoon Jung and Havelock explained the nature of the task for the last day, to work in teams to develop training designs and in the process_ speak to seven questions : \"(1) (3) Define the change role, provide a rationale and state limiting assumptions . (2) Minimal preconditions for selection/training of trainers and trainees . Maximal outputs from training : . . .attitude and value . . .knowledge . . .skills (4) Ways to provide required training (e .g ., timing, scheduling, setting, types of materials, types of experiences) . How to set role in an institutional context . Criteria for success in the role .

This proved to be a very difficult aid frustrating task . In some cases they were able to solicit revised cop( from one or another of the contributors . In other cases an edited version was circulated among all contributors of that task force for comment . \t In still other cases editorial judgment indicated that the primary thoughts should be incorporated in other parts of the manual but that a \"design\" could not be reported as such . These judg- ments were especially agonizing because of the investment of effort and interest which the task forces represented to all concerned .' Recorders' notes from each of the Monday and Tuesday subgroup sessions were also edited and -typed . This material is not included directly in this report but was used in preparing Parts I - IV of the Manual on Training . The fiial task under this contract was intended to be the writing of alternative training designs based on the conference (CECAT) . The State Agency design represented one effort in this direction . However, it became apparent after the conference (a) that there was a large variety of alternative concepts of change role and change process training and (b) that the conference, per se, did not provide enough detailed, input for tie full description of any one of them . Therefore the project director decided that the optimum product would be a manual on training design which would give a detailed analysis of the considerations, . principles, and elements that should be incorporated in any such program regardless 3f level or specific focus . In addition this manual would= include the State Agency model (the interim report of June 1970) as a fully developed example, and the most fully articulated task force reports as image-makers for would-be program developers In different areas . Project director Havelock had other commitments in the fall and w ;nter of 1970-71 which prevented him from following through on . this \"manual\" concept . Kornbluh and others attempted to develop this product based on existing notes and outlines but they found that they did not have enough background to complete the job . The present manual (Attachment X3) was composed largely by Havelock In the summer of 1971 . 6 . Plans for Final Production and Distribution of the Manual After this report is submitted to USOE, the manual will be further edited and refined so that It is suitable for publication .* A limited edition will then be published probably before the end of 1971 ark copies will be sent to CECAT participants as promised earlier . Large volume sales of this document are not anticipated . although its utility to a specialized audience of trainers and training designers should be very high Indeed . Publication will be by the Institute for Social Research publications division and no claim will be made foi copyright at least over materials prepared for the USOE contract . *This work will be undertaken without the use of Federal funds . 30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"{ - 30 - Section II : EVALUATION OF THE \"GUIDE!' (PROTOTYPE #2) BY 115 CHANGE AGENTS* A . \t The Reviewers As described in Section I above, letters were sent out in the fall of 1969 to 200 educators in typical change agent roles asking if they would agree to revieh the \"Guide\" for us . This letter is reproduced as Appendix A to this sectior . Of the 200 educators whom we initially contacted 151 agreed to review the \"Guide\" and they returned to us a form giving a brief descrip- tion of their Grofessional activities . This form is reproduced as Appendix B of this section . When prototype #2 of the \"Guide\" was prepared we forwarded this to them together with an extensive review form, which is reproduced, along with its cover letter, as Appendix C to this section . This review form was actually completed and returned to us by 115 people, or 75 .6% of those who had consented to review the \"Guide .\" We initially planned to draw our sample of reviewers from four areas which we felt were representative of typical potential users of the \"Guide .\" These areas were : 1) State Department of Education personnel who act as consultants, coordinators and disseminators ; 2) Directors of local innovation projects supported by ESEA Title III ; 3) Regional Educational Laboratory dissemination staff ; and 4) professors of education . We did carry out this plan but we also decided to include a sample of educators chosen from local school district personnel . We knew that our sample of Title III directors would give us some indication of how well the \"Guide\" would be received at the local level, but we also felt that these individuals are often engaged in fairly specialized programs of questionable permanence . We therefore decided that a ~#mpling of local educators in general would give us a broader indication of ilie,,extent of the audience to which the \"Guide\" might appeal . We wanted our reviewers to be representative of educators throughout the nation, so our initial letter asking change agents to review the \"Guide\" was sent out tc . educators In all 50 states and the District of Columbia . Since not all c-f those whom we Initially contacted actually completed the review form, - nc-t every state was represented in the final sample . The sample was still widely representative, however, with the 115 reviewers coming from 37 states and the District of Columbia . Table 11 .1 shows the national distri- bution by states of the reviewers in each of our five sub-groups . [Insert Table 11 .1 here] The positions held by the reviewers were quite diverse, but a brief general characterization of those In each group may be made . There were a total of 41 reviewers in the State Department group, and of these, 19 were directors or coordinators of programs which ranged from vocational rehabili- tation to statewide planning and dissemination . Ten were supervisors or superintendents of departments within the state departments of education, and eight were consultants or research utilization specialists . The-four remaining members of this group were planners and project developers . *This section was prepared by Mary C .

We have no current plans to do so but strongly recommend that USOE take further steps in this direction . CECAT was not in itself an unqualified success ; It did not produce the kind of product with the detail and clarity we had hoped for, but it did demonstrate that there was a great interest In this area across the nation among educa- tional leaders, and to some ex ' tent It Indicated that there is a community of thought on what Is needed . Another CHAT or series of CHATS (regionall or topically focussed, perhaps) with adequate funding for advance pre- paration and follow up, would start a significant movement for educational reform in the United States . 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"TABLE 11 .1~ ~ \t National Representation in Sample of Reviewers - Total for State \t L - Local \t R - Regional Labs - State Department \t III - Title III Directors \t 0 - Other III R L 0 I I I 1 \t 1 \t 4 2 - \t I \t 1 \t - ,13 State \t TI S III R L 0 Montana \t 1 I - 1 - Nebraska \t I _ 1 - Nevada New Hampshire \t I New Jersey \t 1 New Mexico 2 New York 10 North Carolina \t 5 North Dakota 0 01(i 0 1 Oklahoma 0 Oregon \t 2 Pennsylvania'' -7 Rhode Island 1 South Carolina 4 South Dakota \t 6 Tennessee I Texas 2 Utah I Vermont 0 Virginia \t 3 Washington 0 West Virginia 0 Wisconsin 1 Wyoming \t 1 I I 6 - I I 2 I TOTAL \t 115 141 21 21 21 11 S to to \t T S 1 Alabama \t 4 Alaska \t 0 Arizona \t 0 Arkansas \t 0 California \t 13 Colorado \t I Connecticut \t I Delaware \t I Washington, D .C . 1 Florida \t 2 2 Georgia \t 2 Hawaii \t 0 Idaho \t 0 Illinois \t 3 Indiana \t 0 Iowa \t 3 Kansas \t 2 Kentucky \t 3 Louisiana \t 0 Maine \t I Maryland \t I Massachusetts \t 3 Michigan \t 14 6 Minnesota \t 3 1 Mississippi \t 0 Missouri \t 5 I"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"-32- Our reviewers included 21 ESEA Title III directors, 14 of whom listed themselves as directors of special programs which ranged from curriculum research to in-service education . The remaining 7 members of this . group were administrators, either school principals, superintendents or adminis- trative assistants . Of 21 reviewers from the Regional Educational Laboratories, one was a laboratory director and another was an assistant director . The group included 12 directors or coordinators of various programs such'-as individual learning and teacher training . The remaining seven reviewers in this group held avariety of positions, mainly as assistants to the professional staff of the laboratories . Our sample of 21 local school educators included six superintendents of schools and three principals or vice-principals . Nine members of the group were directors of programs which typically served an entire school district ; \"Director of Research, Development and Planning\" and \"Director of Secondary Education\" were typical job designations . One reviewer was an educational researcher and two were administrative assistants . Our sample of professors of education was the smallest group, with only seven respondents in this category . Their areas of specialty ranged from community activities to educational research . Four additional educators who reviewed the \"Guide\" could not readily be classified as belonging to one of our five respondent groups . These included a Program Manager for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and a director of educational research and training . We combined the responses of these educators with those of the professors of education to make a total group of 11 respondents which we designate as \"other\" in reporting the responses to the review form . We asked all our reviewers to indicate the activities in which they were involved as educators and change agents, either full or part time (see Appendix 3 of this section) . Their responses to this question are presented in Table 11 .2, which shows the percentage of \"hch respondent group involved in each of 12 areas of professional activity . [Insert Table 11 .2 here] All groups have a very high' percentage of respondents engaged in administrative duties, with a total of 71 .3% of all respondents spending at least part of their time in this area . Just as outstanding is the fact that apart from the \"other\" group, which includes the university professors, a very low percentage of respondents are engaged in teaching . The balance of their time seems to be spent primarily in research, development, in-service education, and consultation, with some groups being quite involved in committee and task force work . They also have apparent high interest in maintaining professional relationships ; 80% of respondents belong to at least one professional organization, and the average number of memberships for all reviewers Is four . Judging from this profile I think we can conclude that these educators are indeed acting in typical change agent roles ; they are interested in and have access to many sources of new ideas and they are engaged in many activities which would serve to bring their information to the attention of others ."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"- 33 - 'Professional Activities of Reviewers *Percents for each group do not total 100% because respondents could check more than one Item . **The percent of \"Title III group\" respondents who Indicate they are involved Title III programs does not total 100% because some respondents in that group had recently completed their Title III programs .

Evaluation of the Case Studies The rationale for inclusion of the case study materials was, of & urse, to give concrete examples which would serve to Illustrate the material of the later chapters (\"stages\") . The case studies could be considered a success only if they adequately served this purpose . We therefore asked our review- ers whether they found the references to the case studies in the text of Part 11 to be useful . The response was gratifying ; 80 .0% of reviewers did feel they were useful . Another 9 .4% felt they were not needed, while 10 .6% found them to be either difficult to follow or distracting .

The case studies were rated on a 3-point scale of \"quite interesting,\" \"somewhat Interesting,\" and \"not very interesting .\" We feel we made an error in judgment In asking for a rating on this particular scale since the words \"somewhat\" and \"quite\" do not convey precise levels of distinction_ Despite possible confusion on this score, however, we can still see clearly from Table 11 .3 that the \"Guide\" as a whole was very favorably received, with 76 .4% of all reviewers rating it as good or very good in interest . 1 .

We described in Section I above the history of our development of change agent training program designs . The design which evolved, and which we have called \"Manual on Educational Change Agent Training,\" . is Attachment 13 of this report . Rather than adding a section on preparing for the role of change agent to the \"Guide\" Itself, we have included an extensive discussion of this subject in the Training Manual . Additionally, we have amended the introduction of the \"Guide\" to include more discussion on defining the role of change agent . Consioering the relatively low response rating given to the idea of adding an appendix of names and addresses of change agents, and also considering the difficulties involved in keeping such a list up to date, we have decided against making such an addition .

We are developing a handbook on the process of change and innovation in education . The book, A Guide to Innovation in Education, is written for educators who are involved in getting innova- tions implemented by schools and school systems . It describes the process of change within individuals, groups, and organizations and suggests specific procedures that can be used to facilitate this process . This handbook is based on considerable re- search on how people adopt innovations and come to utilize scientific knowledge . The research material was reviewed by Dr . Ronald G . Havelock in a report entitled The Dissemination and Utilization of Knowledge : A Co arative Survey and Theoretical Analysis of the Literature, 1969, now available through ERIC . (Both projects are being supported by the Research Utilization Branch of the U .S . Office of Education .) In order to test the relevance of our efforts on the handbook, we need to get the reactions of a few key educators to our first draft . We would like to have you read over the first draft and give us your reactions to it on a brief questionnaire . For your help we will send you a complimentary copy of the final version of the hand- book . We would send you the draft and questionnaire early In October, hoping to make the final version available by February, 1970 . Naturally, we would want to have your responses as early as possible for use in revising the draft . We have enclosed with this letter a copy of the introduction to the handbook .

Over 80% of respondents considered these sections to be either very useful or essential . It was also predictable that, of the appendices, Appendix A (Strategies and Tactics) would be considered the most useful for this type of conference . Table 111 .1 indicates the The Planning of Change (Bennis, Benne and Chin) was potentially an excellent choice as background reading ; 94 .7% of those who read it found it either very useful or essential in preparing for the conference . As Table 111 .1 also shows, however, many people did not have the time to read a book of-this length ; More than half of the respondents had read none of the book, and of those who replied to the question only about half indicated that they had read the entire book, with the remainder making a sampling of a . variety of articles . The other two background readings, Managing Change (Rogers and Svenning), and Using Research for Change (Watson) were apparently not such good choices, but these were considered at least somewhat useful by most of the participants . Table 111 .1 shows that the materials which were rated as most useful in preparing for CECAT were also generally considered to be most appropriate for use in the training of change agents . The Planning of Change and Chapter 11 of Planning for Innovation were again the most highly rated, with most sections of the \"Guide\" also being considered quite important . Somewhat surprising, however, is the fact-that only 34 .2% of - respondents --- felt the chapter on roles (Chapter 7) of Planning for Innovation to be a \"must\" for change agent training . We also felt that while the case study section of the \"Guide\" m ;ght reasonably be considered of lesser- ;value in preparing for CECAT, it would be of key importance in making the \"Guide'''useful in the train- ing of change agents . However, only one third ;of respondents felt this to be the case . Participants were asked if they had additional reactions or comments on the background reading and 75% of them did . The most common comment was to the effect that the readings were appropriate and relevant . A number of people commented that they felt exceptionally well prepared for the conference and that their involvement was increased by our asking for their reactions to the readings prior to the conference . One respondent commented that the readings \"created an attitude of participation and involvement in something that was going to be meaningful .\" There was also some sentiment that there was too much material to read and that either summaries of the literature should have been prepared or else that special attention should have been directed toward certain key sections as was done in the case of chapters 7 and 11 of Planning for Innovation . One respondent wrote \"Too much was expected for the length and type of meeting scheduled . Even if I had read everything there would not have been the oppor- tunity to bring the learnings to bear most productively .\" Another participant summed it up by saying \"I thought all the readings were highly relevant but feel many participants did not read them all .\" 67 s"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"I Writing Style (clarity, flow, conciseness) Organization (Was the structure of the chapter clear and readable?) 5 . \t Usefulness (Could you think of ways that it applied to your own work?) 6 . \t Value of Quotations (Were they usually 'on target'?) s -60- 3 Rating of : \"Stage VI : Stabilizing the Innovation and Terminating the Relationship 8 . \t Do you have any disagreements with the position statements that we have made? 9 . \t Are there any positions that you would like to see emphasized? 10 .

Michigan, were asked to fill out an extensive form evaluating the effectiveness of the conference .** Forty-one partic pants completed this form, representing about 90% of those who were able to stay until the end of the conference . In addition to eval- uating the activities of the conference itself, participants were asked to evaluate the background readings and the printed conference materials which were sent out to them before the conference . The questionnaire also solicited their views on post-conference action possibilities . In this section we will report on the participants' valuation of these--four areas . A . \t Background Readings The background reading materials were intended to provide all participants with a common base of knowledge regarding processes of innovation, planned change and knowledge utilization . It was hoped that these materials would prove to be sufficiently comprehensive and stiumlating so that we would be successful in our attempt to derive implications relevant to change agent training . The participants were asked to give their opinion as to the value of each of the reading materials as background to the CECAT conference . They were also asked whether thi :y considered each literature source to be a \"must\" item in the training of change agents . The responses to these questions are tabulated in Table 111 :-1 : Since not all participants-had read each of the background sources, the percentage responses reported In this table are based only on the number of respondents who indicated they had actually read the materials . (Insert Table 111 .1 here) Since we felt that it would be unlikely that all participants would have time to read all of Planning for Innovation (approximately 500 pages), we directed their attention particularly to chapters 7 (Roles) and 11 (Summary) as being the most relevant . On the evaluation form we asked for separate ratings of these two chapters and for a rating of all other chapters combined . Table 111 .1 -indicates that participants did Indeed find chapters 7 and 11 to be particularly useful in preparing for this conference, with 97 .4% of respondents regarding chapter 11 as either very useful or essential, and 86 .9% rating chapter 7 in one of these two categories . Since we were particularly concerned about participants' reactions to the \"Guide,\" (Prototype #3), we asked for separate ratings of each section of this book . We were very pleased with the responses as a whole and felt that for a conference of this type the higher ratings for the Introduction and the six *This section was prepared by Mary C .

Eighteen people suggested specific additions, but only one article received as many as two mentions : this was the monograph \"Change in School Systems,\" a COPED-NTL publication edited by Watson .* Several people did suggest that some readings should be added which covered the R&D approach more thoroughly . *Available from NTL-TABS, 1201 Sixteenth St ., N .W ., Washington, D .C .

Ali participants had been asked to fill out a form indicating their judgment of the importance of the topics in this list and to prepare to lead a discussion in the area in which they considered themselves to be particularly well-informed . This device was considered very favorably by some ; one participant commented \"Your efforts spent listing the key points of each change process model paid off extremely well . Your procedure for forcing people to select topics to report on was a master stroke .\" Not all participants shared this view, however . There were those who felt that not enough use was made of this preparation ; one partici- pant wrote \"the advance materials and feedback were excellent - but we didn't build on these to the degree we should have .\" Other participants felt that these preparations were not relevant to the conference task ; one respondent 69 Not Very Useful Some- what Useful Very Useful Essential Total No ,pinion 1 .

I don't believe this contributed to thoughts about train- ing . '' \t t , The list of statements about training prepared by Charles Jung should have appealed to those who were dissatisfied with the focus of the change process statements . However, as Table 111 .3 shows, this list was not considered to be quite as useful . Part of the problem here seemed to be that this list was not sent out soon enough, and several people commented that there was an insufficient attempt made to focus discussion on it . The listing of additional points made by participants was viewed by some people as superfluous, but others found them particularly stimulating, and a number of very lively discussions on these points were held at the conference on Monday evening . Whatever the relative merits of the different pre-conference materials, collectively they seem to have effectively fulfilled the objective of pre- paring the participants for the conference and involving them in the task . One participant commented \"I have never felt so well prepared for a conference as I was for this one .\" C . \t Conference Activities Participants were asked to evaluate each separate session of the conference as well as its general aspects . These responses are presented both as percent ratings and mean ratings in Table 111 .4 . [Insert Table 111 .4 here] One participant wrote \"I do not believe that these questions really get at the essence of what was to me a very powerful experience .\" Perhaps this was true for a majority of participants, since, as Table 111 .4 shows, the conference as a whole received a higher rating than did any of its individual parts with the exception of \"opportunities available for informal discussion .\" Informal contacts were in fact a key to the success of the conference from the point of view of many people . The conference was described by some as the best opportunity they had ever experienced to carry on informal conversations with a wide variety of stimulating and well-informed colleagues . One parti- cipant descri :Â° .d the gathering as \"an unusual collection of experts .\" The mean rating of only 3 .1 for the design of the conference indicates that we made some errors in judgment here ; participants on the average were only \"somewhat satisfied\" with the design . There was some disagreement as to whether the conference was structured too rigidly or too loosely, but the primary criticism was that not enough time had been allotted to the work in the task force groups . From the percentage ratings in Table 111 .4 we can see that there was quite a range of opinion as to the success of the meetings which were held on Monday and Monday evening . This range can be largely explained by the varying success of each of the six subgroups as rated'by its own members . 70"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"A I TABLE 11! â€¢4 -69 - Evaluation of Conference Activities Percent Ratings and Mean Ratings* Nercents and means are based on the number who responded to each item . 71 ** 6 - \"one of the best I have attended\" ; I - \"very dissatisfied\" z Mean Number Who Re - sponded to .this Item Percent Rat ngs Ratings* Very - Dissat- isfied Somewha I t Dissat- lsfI4 Somewhat Satisfied Quite Satisfied Very Satisfied Ane of the best I have attended Total Conference as a whol \t 4 0 4 .9 17 .1 39 .0 1 32 .9 6 .1 100 4 .2 Design of conference \t 41 2-4 1 .7 1o7 17 .1 17 .1 0 100 3 .1 -- lo t Orientation Monday 9am . \t 36 2 .8 13 .9 19 .4 44 .4 16 .7 2 .8 100 3 .7 Change Pro- cess Dis- cussions Monday \t 39 10 .3 15 .4 20 .5 30 .8 23 .1 0 100 3 .4 Group Sum- maries Monday Coctail \t 36 8 .3 13 .9 36 .1 36 .1 5 .6 0 1 00 3 .2 Monday evening session \t 28 14 .3 3 .6 28 .6 17 .9 25 .0 10 .7 100 3 .7 Training Panel - Tues . a .m . \t 36 8 .3 - 23 .6 23 .6 30 .6 11 .1 2 .8 100 3 .2 Train ng Statements Groups-Tues . \t 35 8 .6 8 .6 34.3 37 .1 11 .4 0 100 3 . 2 'Group Sum- maAls Tuesday Cocktail . \t 23 4 .3 1 .4 47 .8 26 .1 4 .3 0 100 3 .1 Your Task Force & its Product \t 31 3 .2 11 .3 1 \t 24 .2 22 .6 35 .5 3 .2 100 3 .9 Other-Task Force\" Pro- ducts \t 29 0 2 31 .0 27 .6 20 .7 1 \t 0 100 3 .5 Discussion Critique of Task Force Products \t 25 0 I 44 .0 28 .0 20 .0 8 .0 0 100 2 .9 Implementa- tion-Follaw through discussions \t 19 10 .5 21 .1 47 .4 10 .5 10 .5 0 100 2 .9 Conference Site \t 38 31 .6 1 26 .3 23 .7 10 .5 7 .9 0 100 2 .2 Opportunities for informal discussions \t 38 0 5 .3 15 .8 1 \t 23.7 1 \t 50 .0 1 \t 5 .3-A-1 00 1 \t 4 .3 Your own contribution \t 38 2 .6 25 .0 48 .7 1 \t 21 .1 J \t 2 .6 1 \t 0 1 100 _j 3 .0"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"-70- Though the mean rating for all change process group discussions (item #4) was 3 .4, the mean ratings of the individual sub-groups ranged from 2 .5 to 4 .3 . An even greater disparity occurred for the Monday evening sessions (item k6), for which the sub_-group ratings by their own members ranged from 1 .7 to 5 .5 . The panel discussion on training which was held on Tuesday morning (item X7) provoked many comments, which varied from disapproval to enthusias- tic appreciation . Though described by some as stimulating and on target, the panel 'was felt by others to be lacking in planning and structure and to be unrelated to the outcome goals of the conference . The panel members them- selves gave the panel a mean rating of 3 .0, slightly lower than the rating of 3 .2 which it received from all participants . Though participants expressed some dissatisfaction with the early activities of the conference, they were quite pleased with their primary task activity, the designing of training programs in task force groups . As with the Monday groups, there was considerable variation in the self-ratings of the different task force efforts by the members of each group . Here we notice an Interesting relationship between task force size and satisfaction with the product created . There were four large groups (5 to 7 members) which gave themselves mean ratings which fell between 4 .0 and 4 .5 . Two groups each had two members ; one of these rated itself as 5 .0 - the highest rating received by any group - and the other gave itself a rating of 3.0 . Four participants chose to work alone, and these people gave themselves ratings of only 2 .0 or 3 .0 . This could be explained partly on the basis of modesty of the solo workers . More likely the experience of collaborating in a group is emotionally and intellectually stimulating,`wi .fh the sharing of diverse ideas yielding a richer and more exciting product . We might also speculate that choosing just one partner with whom to work may be a chantey proposition . The only criticism expressed about the task force groups was that there was insufficient time to do justice to the assignment . Participants generally liked the products of their own task force group slightly better than they did those of other groups (mean rating of 3 .9 for own group as opposed to 3 .5 for other groups) . It would stand to reason that people would be most enthusiastic about their own areas of interest, but in addition to this the press of time at the end of the conference did not allow for a thorough total-group discussion of the task force products . This dis- cussion (item 112) received a low rating because of this time factor . The discussion on implementation and follow-through of training designs (item 113) received a similarly low rating, also because of inadequate time . We were somewhat surprised that participants gave their own contribution (item 116) a mean rating of only 3 .0 ; we would have expected this rating to be very close to that of the task force group ratings . Many people felt they had insufficient time to write and contribute as they would have liked, and one person commented \"I gained more than I contributed .\" But another participant who was very satisfied with his performance stated \"I worked hard and I liked I t .\" Finally, Table 111 .4 shows that the site of the conference was its least satisfactory aspect, and we received the most numerous and most colorful comments on this item . There was agreement that the food was good and the setting was 72"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"A TABLE 111 .5 What part of the conference did you find most MEANINGFUL?

New Ideao for Action 'Though the purpose .of CECAT was to help us to arrive at designs for the training of change agents, we felt-the conference would have achieved something else of importance as well if it had helped the participants to arrive at new Ideas or approaches which they could use in their own work . We asked the participants if this were the case and also whether or not they thought these ideas could be implemented- and whether they would make an effort to do so . he responses to these questions are given In Table 111 .7 . -73- down to work and applying themselves to the task of the conference . Perhaps a sharper definition of the task force assignments at an earlier time would also have helped to alleviate this problem . We were aware, In addition, that not enough time had been set aside at the end of the conference for critique and synthesis of the task force products . This problem was heightened by the fact that a number of people had to leave early to catch their flights for home, but this type of problem is one which should be taken into account in the design of any conference of this size . (Insert Table 111 .7 here] -These - responses are certainly most encouraging ; the conference evidently yielded a wealth of ideas and, most significantly, participants are apparently eager to follow through on them . In fact a number of people plan to make an effort to utilize their new ideas wen though the resources to do so are not available to them at the present time . The particular nature of the new ideas and approaches which participants derived from the conference are summarized in Table 111 .8 . [Insert Table 111 .8 here] Two task force g roups . i n particular inspired the bulk of ideas related to task force products . About 77% of those who stated that their new Ideas were related to task force products mentioned the training programs designed by the groups working on the \"macro-system\" and the \"change-through-crisis\" approaches . As well as being a source of ideas for those working in these groups, these two products were the only ones cited by others as being the primary source of their new ideas ."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"-76- nature of the event should depend on its intent ; for instance, one participant who .wis interested in implementing the training design produced by the group working on a \"macrosystems\" approach felt this - end might best be met by scheduling a series of meetings with key \t - personnel in various government and educational agencies rather than holding one large conference . For the most part, however, participants' suggestions were con- cerned with how to design a conference similar to CECAT, and these pro- posals tie in very closely with the evaluation of CECAT activites described above . The suggestion most commonly made was that only those who were truly dedicated to the outcomes of the conference should be invited . Related to this point were recommendations that there should be fewer participants, that these participants should take more of a part in pre- paring for the conference, and that the conference should be more structured around the goals desired . It was also felt that task force work should be started sooner and that more time should be devoted to total-group discussions in order to provide cross-fertilization of ideas . All in all, we find that, by the close of CECAT, participants felt very stimulated and highly motivated to work, but they also felt frustrated by the small amount of time available to them to produce what they con- sidered to be quality products . They would like to meet again to follow through on the ideas inspired by CECAT, but they would like to put more effort into pre-conference prEparation so that they could get down to the work of the conference as soon as it convened . We feel certain that on their own many participants will make use of the ideas generated by CECAT, but we also feel frustrated that, outside of holding another conference, we have no device for drawing on the collective talents of the highly motivated and creative CECAT participants who are now scattered around the country . We are not alone in this senti- ment : one participant remarked \"I would like to be able to tap a group like this for help In meeting our training needs . Perhaps some of the inventiveness possessed by members of the group could be used to invent a process for a productive continuing relationship .\" E . \t Future Need of Conference Related Materials The first set of questions on our CECAT evaluation form dealt with how useful the participants had found the background readings to be in preparing for this conference . We were also interested as well, however, In finding out how useful the participants felt the conference materials would prove to be In the future In their own work . Our final question asked for this information ; the responses are given in Table 111 .9 . [Insert Table 111 .9 here] We were please not only with the very positive response to the \"Guide\" and to PLANNING FOR INNOVATION, but also with the extremely high interest shown in obtaining copies of the CECAT proceedings . Perhaps this response indicates more clearly than any other that the participants felt the conference had pro- duced valuable results . 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"1 TABLE 111 .7 Did the conference help you arrive at any new Ideas for action you could take or approaches you could try In your work? 4 In your opinion w .ald it be possible to %J implement these Ideas under existing con- ditions?

It presents case studies of change agent teams in three Wisconsin school systems . A model for change agent team planning and action -- problem diagnosis, strategy planning, strategy activation, and result evaluation -- is described . The activities of the teams and their colleagues are related, and an evaluation of the interventions based on systematic data is included .

A school building may be- come the target of change elf-)rts as repre- sented in the unitized school concept of the Wisconsin Research and Development Center, a teacher or administrator may be thought of as a change agent and be trained for such a role, or a planned change process may be initiated at the system level utilizing the largest conceivable organizational unit which contains a central office and operating schools as sub-components . The latter is the concept that the Planned Educational Change (PEC) staff offered to the cooperating systems . The rationale of this approach has five elements : (1) it provides entry into a school system by an outside change-agent and re- search team as represented by the PEC staff (2) it assumes the integrated character of a system embracing several components and avoids the problem of selecting one of the components for special treatment ; (3) it maxi- mizes the opportunities of inside personnel to determine priorities for change and to control the systematic development of subparts in accordance with such priorities ; (4) it pro- vides a greater chance for a school system to continue developmental processes after out- side resources have been withdrawn, greater than if a miscellaneous group of teachers or administrators, or a building faculty represents the school system ; and (5) it improves rela- tionships among components and increases possibilities for each component to become a focus of attention . Prospects are then good that the Improvement of interrelationships will lay the ground work for improving a component if and when it becomes the focus of attention . This approach has at least two limitations . The starting point for change is far removed from the student for whom the system functions . Improved learning in the classroom represents the last event in a chain, if the improvement -influence ever reaches there . There is also I The School System Approach the danger of spreading efforts thinly over a large operation . This can lead to tangible results only after a long time in contrast to the visible results that may come immediately through more concentrated efforts . The favor- able points of the rationale outweighed its limitations in the judgment of PEC staff and a system approach was initiated . Change-Agent Teams A change agent is a person or group who works toward bringing about change . Whether school systems are aware of it or not, agents for change function in all systems . Various persons 1n diverse roles from the superinten- dent to a kindergarten pupil have a potential to change themselves and to create change in others . Persons have differing power and re- sources to act as a change force in a school system . A crucial distinction between the rules noted above and a designated change agent is self-awareness . It was assumed by the PEC staff that change agents who are cog- nizant of their resources and mission and appropriately authorized by those with system- wfdo' decision-making responsibility are more effective in planning and managing a change process than persons or groups who are not aware of their potential as effectors of change . The role of expectation is also an important condition . Those who are expected to be change agents are more likely to perform appro- priately . Role of the Change Agent Historically, the role of the change agent was prescribed and largely limited to the su- perintendent of the school system, although more recently administration theorists have sought to unfreeze this one-office-one-man 1"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"2 authoritarian approach . A recent study of the superintendency has concluded that variables related to the superintendent are most impor- tant in facilitating the adoption of educational innovations (Carlson . 1964) ata from the eight school system sample of the Wisconsin study indicate the important role the superintendent plays in influencing the determination of educational matters in general as well as the innovative process . To deny the superintendent his role as a change agent in the school system is unreal and unwise . But to look to him as the change agent leaves much to be desired . This implies that no one else on the staff nas the interest and capabili- ties necessary to contribute innovatively and creatively to the system . While it is true that the superintendent and/or members of his staff should be included in the charge-agent struc- ture due to their key location in the decision- making apparatus and their broad view of the system, other personnel should also be In- cluded . Teachers, principals, and school board members should collaborate in change efforts utilizing their ideas and competencies, and requiring their linkage roles in the system . In the final analysis, the success of a change project will depend upon how well they and/or their peers plan and manage a process of change . This analysis led the PEC staff to the concept of a team designed for school_ system changing (Goodson and Hammes, 1968) . Criteria for Change-Agent Teams Criteria (Goodson and Hammes, 1968) for change-agent team design were formulated as follows : (1) Size . The size of a team should be large enough to utilize the potential of a variety of individuals representing a variety of roles in the system but small enough to be able to function as a face-to-face group . The ideal size would be from five to eight members . (2) High Level Representation . The super- intendent and/or his central office representa- tives should be members of the change-agent team . Such representation would ease legiti- mation problems of the team, provide the team with broad perspectives, and give a basis in reality for implementing its decisions . (3) Vertical Role Representation . Principals, teachers, and school board members should be placed on change-agent teams . This would more readily insure divergent thinking in prob- lem solving and provide necessary linkages in the system to aid innovative implementation . 11 These criteria along with a statement re- garding the intended functions of a team were communicated to each superintendent of the schools considering a cooperative arrangement with the PEC staff of the Center . Two main functions were projected . One was that of assisting colleagues in developing and main- taining a climate in which change and innova- tion might flourish as a natural feature of sys- tem operations . The second was that of plan- ning and managing specific changes_ which a system might need or desire . Within these broad and pervasive functions more concrete and instrumental functions of the change-agent teams were described as follows : (1) To give attention to the school system as a whole and consider needed changes ; (2) to plan and coordinate strate- gies at the system level for initiating and maintaining change processes ; (3) to consult with central office colleagues and building faculty members concerning a particular change project and to consider the prevailing school system climate regarding needs and efforts in change and improvement, including resist- ances to change ; (4) to become a resource to colleagues in planning and managing change activities . Struct1re of Change-Agent Teams Each of the three school systems comprising the case studies responded in a unique manner to the very general conditions of team design set forth by the PEC staff . System A created a team e v of six (later expanded to eight), consisting of a school board member, Assistant Superintendent, Elementary and Junior High School principals, psychologist, and three teachers representing the Elementary, Junior, and Senior High School levels . System B modi- fied a high school curriculum council composed of department chairmen . It was chaired by the system coordinator for instruction . An elemen- tary school principal was added to make a group of 14 members . This structure was modified at a later date by the superintendent . System C used as its change-agent team an Improvement Committee that was already in existence and composed of the superintendent and two coor- dinators in addition to three principals, one in the high school and two in the elementary schools . This structure was later modified to include teachers and related teams in the building units . Each school system partici- pated in three training sessions that were de- signed for team building purposes and which are briefly described in the following chapter ."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Functions of PEC H Interventions by the Planned Education Change Staff Style of Intervention The Planned Education Change (PEC) staff served two functions : (1) that of observation and analysis of the change process ; (2) that of a consultant, offering human relations training and specific resource help, but not deliberately influencing the systems toward any particular innovations or procedures . In a memorandum to colleagues, a PEC staff mem- ber elaborated upon these goals as follows : \"I see the project as creating self-renewing systems . My goal is primarily action with little research . I see the change team as being primarily concerned with changing the processes and structures of the school system rather than being responsible for any particular change . I want to stimulate the teams to think about structure, Interpersonal and organiza- tional problems-what is blocking innovation and how to get through or over blocks . Our inputs, to bring this about, would be human relations training, feedback, information about appropriate innovations, and constant stimula- tion of the team by us .\" The operational scheme became that of the PEC staff working as a change agent with the teams of the three systems and the three teams in turn functioning as change agents within their respective systems . These operations evolved into a collaborative process with a reciprocal relationship between the University and the school systems and, to some extent, between the systems . Interpersonal and problem-solving processes (Dialogue-Inquiry- Action Model) used by the PEC team served as a model for the school system change-agent team which subsequently involved its colleagues in the same processes . Thus there was a mir- roring or simulation of processes thought essential to creating changes with continuous and reciprocal feedback between colleagues, the change-agent team, and the PEC staff . The style of intervention used by the PEC staff rests upon two basic considerations : One is the essential matter of trust and re- spect and the other is the use of the therapeu- tic model . A school system has an integrity that requires it to be respected ethically and factually by any agency that would offer changes to it . Educational changing involves consideration of the necessarily particularized conditions of a school system, i .e ., size, location, socioeconomic status, etc . The PEC staff tried to be sensitive to these indige- nous qualities and to respect the realities and the personalities involved . Leonard Duhl (1967) has described the ther- apeutic model by drawing a parallel between the patient-therapist relationship and the pro- cesses involved \"in getting people to change\" or in \"building new institutions and new ways of coping with problems at this very moment .\" He states : \"When a patient comes to a thera- pist reporting a current crisis, he usually asks for help in reaching a certain goal . If the therapist were a planner, he would probably sit down and outline five steps for the patient to take . If, however, the therapist simply gives a patient five steps to follow, nothing will happen . He must initially teach the pa- tient the step-by-step process of assimilating new information, of reconceptualizing the world, of looking toward generalized goals, and of thinking about how certain immediate steps may be directed toward these generalized goals,\" The therapeutic model emphasizes auto- plastic development-growth from within the system . Development which characterizes the change process as originating outside the system and exerting influence from that posi- tion in modifying the inner workings of the system is described as alloplastic development . 3"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"A fuller view of the change process must con- sider that the autoplastic and the alloplastic are continuous and complimentary .l Both di- rections of development are' involved in the therapeutic model but â€¢p redominance is assigned to the autoplastic, as Indicated by Daniel Bell's (1967) elaboration upon the therapeutic model in the following : \" . . . the therapeutic model has surprising relevance in many problem- solving situations, as sophisticated business managers, for example, might attest . Its sim- ple caution is not to accept the situation as given or defined by the client, but to keep open a range of generalized goals . Individuals may define a problem in terms of the difficulties they encounter in reaching a solution, only to find on analysis that the problem has been falsely put or that some other problem is actually at stake . By emphasizing self- scrutiny, feedback, and re-evaluation of means and goals, the model by its simple common sense warns against the premature closure of a definition or the foreshortening of perspec- tive\" (p . 702) . In relating to the change agents of the school systems, the PEC staff used the therapeutic model giving a decided emphasis to an autoplastic development . Cools of Human Development Laboratory Training The PEC staff attempted to offer to the school systems training goals and designs consistent with the model described above . The training took the form of a Human Develop- ment Laboratory (originally named a Human Relations Workshop) that typically met for 16 hours on Friday and Saturday . Laboratory ses- sions were designed to help the participants develop their abilities in two areas : (1) inter- personal competencies that are involved in re- lating and communicating with others as well as understanding one's self and (2) competen- cies that are necessary for activating a problem- solving process (Dialogue-Inquiry-Action Model), including determination of priorities, the plan- ning of strategies, the handling of data, and the use of external resources . A goal of laboratory training is the acquisi- tion of a sharpened diagnostic sensitivity . As an outcome, participants may become inoreas- ingly sensitive to key relationships among mem- bers of a group ; to situations in which motiva- tion of a member relates to his membership role ; to ways in which group atmosphere influences group actions ; to the nature of decision-making ; and to points in group interaction where mem- bers can be helpful to others In reaching shared goals . A member may come to see more clearly 4 events which happen in a small group and how these events may be constructively influenced by his efforts . This relevant change in partici- pant functioning may be described as growth in diagnostic sensitivity . Another goal of laboratory training is the growth of self-awareness . The member has the opportunity to see himself as he is seen by others ; to privately examine his motivation in the light of data provided by others ; to com- pare his perception of an event with the diversity or the unanimity with which others view the same event ; to compare his perceptions of other participants over a period of time ; to be- come aware of his feelings under group pres- sure ; and to become more aware of the roles he takes in a group . Thus the participant becomes more fully aware of what is happening in a here- and-now context . This learning may be de- scribed as an awareness of self and others . A member is also able to practice and ex- periment with new ways of intervening in his relationships with others . Because of the norm of experimentation and the condition of safety, the member is encouraged to try new roles and styles of personal intervention . For example, a participant who generally initiates group activities may choose to offer support and harmony to the group and give others the oppor- tunity to lead . This gives him new insights into ways in which he can function with others to diagnose the reality, sense problems and needs, and plan strategies for making changes in situations which are problematical for group members . In contrast to the typical schoo'_ or home situation, the laboratory may become for its members an opportunity for free exploration and learning . Another important goal of laboratory training is to afford an opportunity for participants to reassess and to modify appropriately their deep-seated dispositions and stereotypes toward groups and people . Attitudes which strongly affect human relations and the solu- tion of problems and which frequently need examination and more understanding by group members have to do with such phenomena as : Aggression Anxiety Authority Communication failure and success Empathy Conflict Consensus Freedom Hostility Human Intimacy Leadership Personal Autonomy Rationality Resistance Spontaneity Sexuality Submissiveness Viewed through stereotypes the human situa- tion tends to be static, destructive, and fore-"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"boding . When stereotypes have been trans- formed into experience-validated concepts- for example, aggression-as-bad being changed Into a necessary component (autonomy and spontaneity) of human learning-laboratory participation can bring a fresh perspective and more flexibility to human transactions and a new potential for constructive behavior . This transformation is Illustrated by what a teacher reported after a training session : \"The world Including the teachers and pupils in my school look different to me . I can now count on them to be helpful for they empathize with me .\" A laboratory training design is a set of re- lated dialogue-inquiry-action sequences that participants and trainers activate and main- tain during the course of a laboratory . Three elements are generally incorporated : (1) a basic group variously named \"encounter,\" \"sensitivity training,\" \"T-group,\" or, as In the PDC experience, a \"Dialogue\" group (D) : (2) focused or structured exercises ; and (3) In- formation-giving sessions in which models, theory, or knowledge are presented as eco- nomically as possible with the occasion re- ferred to as a lecturette . (1) Design emphasis on interpersonal competencies (2) Design emphasis on problem-solving competencies Session I Interpersonal Figure 1 Concentration and Learning of Participant in Training Laboratory r As indicated above, the human development laboratory is designed to help participants en- hance and further develop two competencies- interpersonal and problem-solving . The dis- crete competencies (or components thereof) are always relate , -j in the functioning of a person and are coi : ; .eptually brought together in the trilogy symbol used above : Dialogue-Inquiry- Action . A training sequence that influences both competencies may consist of two comple- mentary phases with an interlude between Ses- sion I and Session II of approximately six weeks . This sequence is portrayed in Figure 1 . The design emphasizing Interpersonal com- petencies is always antecedent to the second design concerned with problem-solving . In terms of the outcome of laboratory train- ing, a functional integration is sought so that the participant can use interpersonal and problem-solving competencies appropriately in dealing with a situation . One trainee de- scribed his experience with laboratory train- ing and applied it to a school situation . He said : \"I can now better sense when I should speak, when I should listen, when I should state alternatives or raise questions, and when I should press for action .\" Problem-solving Session II S"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The D-group provides a learning opportunity that is experienced intensely by participants . It becomes appropriate . if not a matter of felt necessity, for members of a training group to disclose themselves through Avert actions and to receive feedback from other members . Senses and feelings become very much in- volved, highlighting the learning process that is proceeding for each member . The course of growth is the reversal of other methods, such as reading or lecture-listening, in that ex- perience precedes conceptualization . Words and symbols become attached to events and summarize segments of experience . The use of symbols enriched by meaningful experience enables members to communicate, often at an abstract level, and reflect upon experiences in the training group . But when learning is taking place, the emphasis is upon the here- and-now and not upon something then-and- there which may be recognised and abstractly described . Another important aspect of the training group is the behavior of the trainer . As an authority, an assumption made by members of the group, the trainer violates their ordinary expectations . He does not provide external structure ; rather, members generate structure through attempts to influence one another on the basis of the needs and concepts they bring to the situation . Three kinds of learning are available to a member of a training groups (1) He learns about himself, his own personal functioning ; (2) He learns concepts regarding human rela- tions as a field of knowledge, as well as the diagnostic and intervention competencies necessary for applying the concepts to con- crete human situations ; (3) He learns of the properties of groups and the dynamic charac- ter of the interactions among members . When convened in a laboratory setting, members undergo the process of becoming a group in slow motion . Thus the stages of group development become clearly visible . An early and dramatic stage is represented by efforts of members to resolve the problem of authority-which member or members are to be granted the right to influence others in clari- fying direction and goals and in establishing decision-making procedures . A latter stage of development involves the degree of close- ness which members can extend to one another In sharing ideas and feelings . Other stages, less dramatic but just as important for the group, are made evident in the process of group development . Members can observe almost minute-to- minute changes in the group and talk about them . The origin and history of the group 6 5 thereby becomes clear . By sharing observa- tions and reporting their feelings, members can gain insight into group interaction . The meaning of the experience may be enhanced through collecting and analyzing information about each member and about movements of the group . (See D group exercise on pages 10 and 11 for facilitating such activity .) Meaning is enriched through sharing percep- tions regarding attempts of members to influ- ence one another . The norms of trust and inquiry become im- portant to the life of the group . For a group of trainees to realize their maximum potential, the culture of the group has to be transformed not only by the norm of trust, b, : also by the norm of inquiry . Than open communication among members and the full use of member resources of problem-solving become estab- lished . The norms of trust and inquiry need to be regenerated periodically and cannot be counted on to perseverate from minute-to- minute or from hour-to-hour in the life of a group . The successful efforts of group mem- bers to generate trust and inquiry contribute to group development and the richness of learning for the members . When evaluating a laboratory session, one participant wrote : \"Unless there is sincerity and trust, basic problems cannot be solved . These were gen- erated during the session-we are now ready to begin .\" In the early stages of the life of a training group, members frequently feel that the pro- cesses they are undergoing are somehow spe- cial and artificial and are influenced by the special conditions under which the group meets and the \"manipulative\" behavior of the trainer . In time, however, members come to understand that these processes are somehow a part of all group life and that the similarities between the training group and the work organization of the school or the life of a family are greater than the differences . The phenomena that occur in the training group and those that occur in other groups are of the same order . The Ideas and principles for understanding and acting in the training group are more similar than dissimilar to those than can be applied in other groups outside the laboratory . Un leas the participant in training has strong needs to induce barriers to trust and inquiry in his interaction with others, transfer is easily achieved . A MUM fer Msnnki e d Adlen In planning a laboratory design the PIC staff used the dialogue-inquiry-action model 2 which It recommended to change-agent teams"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"I as a model for their behavior and as represented \t the reality of the school and proceeds step- in Figures 2 and 3 .

The process starts in \t functions, as represented by labels placed in 0 Dialogue-Inquiry-Resolution Figure 2 Dialogue-Inquiry-Action Model 7 1R"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the boxes . These are the mediating functions, according to the experiences gained in the PEC project, that a professional staff must perform and take responsibility for if a school is to improve . The reality of a school is multiple . Parent expectations, interpersonal norms of the pro- fessional staff, behavior and goals of students, structures of the school, teacher and adminis- trator competence, school climate and other conditions represent segments of reality that may need attention . Once a staff In a labora- tory focuses attention upon a particular seg- ment, both careful description and evaluation are needed . Dialogue and shared inquiry among members of a staff facilitate the de- scription and evaluation of reality . The dif- ference between describing reality and eval- uating it is intricate . The latter involves the use of a value or a concept of \"desirable con- dition\" by which the problem-solver concludes that some aspect of reality needs to be changed . The describing and evaluating of reality (phase 1A) leads to formulating and analyzing problems (2) and identifying and clarifying needs (3) . Also, function IA leads to setting goals (1 B) in accordance with reality and con- sistent with the mission of the school (broad functions and responsibilities legitimized by societal representatives) . Planning (4) : elaborating and examining alternative plans is a crucial component of the model . This function Is related to the evalua- tion of reality through problems-to-be-solved and needs-to-be-satisfied as determined by participants in a laboratory who are involved In a school situation . It is the planning phase that Innovations from R and D laboratories (and other sources) become relevant as alternatives to be examined in light of goals, problems and needs . The last phase (5) is acting in which, selected plan or plans are implemented and is of great importance in determining the success or failure of the change process . Another Important feature of the model is that a white box containing a function is a figure upon a ground . The Gestalt or figure- ground Is represented by a white box upon a finely dotted background . The ground to a Primary dialogue-Inquiry-action process . It is a basic process from which specific sec- ondary functions emerge . Dialogue is inter- action among professional colleagues (includ- Ing students and parents) -a teacher talking to a principal or a group discussion among members of a change-agent team . It is from dialogue, facilitated by the interpersonal com- petencies of participants, that the specific functions contained In the labeled boxes are generated and given form and meaning . Dia- 8 logue activates inquiry . It enables group mem- bers to raise and answer questions and to state and consider alternatives regarding a specific function . Dialogue-inquiry terminates in a resolution-a decision or settlement so that motivation to go on can carry participants (change-agent team members, for instance) to the next function . The basic ground of dia- logue-inquiry-action : (1) enlivens and nur- tures a specific function giving it an organic quality and lending an artistry to the process and it does not degenerate into the \"grinding- out of a machine,\" nor lose its life-like as- pects ; and (2) surrounds the consideration of each function and suffuses its creation with dialogue and inquiry, finally urging group members to reach a resolution point and to move on . Individuals in a professional staff solve problems differently . This model allows for different styles and approaches to problem- solving . This basic ground may be conceptualized as the normative and motivational conditions of a school system . Previous studies of PEC proj- ect (Hilfiker, 1969) demonstrate a relationship between norms of trust, openness, adaptabil- ity, problem-solving adequacy, and the out- come of innovativeness . The intensity of these norms influence the behavior of partici- pants in regard to the degree to which they participate in dialogue-inquiry-action pro- cesses . The norms, therefore, determine the dynamic characteristics of a school . Intensely positive feelings shared by participants about such norms enliven and nurture a specific function as indicated above . At an opposite expreme \"hopeless\" or \"don't care\" attitudes by teachers and administrators will not facili- tate but rather depresses dialogue-inquiry- action . Figure 3 represents Reality I at Time I and Reality II at Time II . In the second cycle with the expectation of an improvement in the pro- cess, the prior functions of describing and evaluating reality, acting, etc ., need to be described and evaluated along with Reality II . If Reality II is the same in most respects as Reality I, then no change or Improvement has been realized through the process . As differ- ences between Reality I and Reality II are doc- umented,, the actor knows that changes have taken place . Whether or not changes represent improvements in the reality is obviously de- pendent upon evaluating-the deliberate pro- cess of examining reality In light of values . Initially, the PEC staff carried the major responsibilities for designing and implement- ing Human Development laboratories . Later change-agent teams assumed an increasing responsibility in setting goals, describing and"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"diagnosing their school realities, formulating problems-to-be-solved, and identifying needs- to-be-satisfied through laboratory experiences . Change-agent team members shared with the PEC staff in the dialogue-inquiry -action pro- cess that provided a ground for each of the - steps portrayed as figures on the ground (white boxes against finely dotted background) in Figures 2 and 3 of the model . PEC and change-agent teams used the model described above in guiding their re- spective activities and in planning their cooperative activities . Thus, the model provided a reciprocal mirroring between the PEC staff problem-solving processes and those that change agents needed to institu- tionalize in their systems as robust processes of dialogue, inquiry, and action resolution . The PEC also needed continuous evaluation and feedback to reinforce its efforts to clarify and enhance its problem-solving processes, for it too faced the task of upgrading its per- formance . EienÂ»nts of Laboratory Training Three elements were generally incorporated in laboratory designs . They included the Dialogue Groups described above, Focused or Structured Exercises, and Information-giv- ing sessions . Examples of each will be given below . Basic to Human Relations Laboratory Train- ing was the formation of Dialogue (D) Groups . These are small subgroups of 9 to 12 members who are free to discuss any subject, includ- ing interpersonal problems, and give feedback to others concerning reactions and feelings . Exercises to facilitate interpersonal inquiry and self-disclosure for learning used with D Group members are included here : D Groups SELF-DESCRIPTION AND PREDICTION . Based on first impressions of people in the D Group and on their own experiences in groups, participants are asked to make pre- dictions of their own behavior by responding to the following : Select the person whom you feel will act most differently from you . List words or phrases describing your predictions as to how he will behave . 10 List words or phrases which describe your predictions as to how yon will be- have . GROUP INTERACTION PREDICTIONS . At the onset of the D Group activities members are asked to predict who will be high and low par- ticipators and who will be high- and low-influ- ence members of the group . They are also asked who they feel will try to create a con- genial atmosphere, who will create an atmos- phere of disagreement, and who will try to create an atmosphere of calm and nonemotion within the D Group . MEMBERSHIP EXERCISE . Participants are asked to look for certain behaviors during the D Group discussion and to respond to the fol- lowing questions : List members who tend to support one another . List members who tend to oppose one another . What members of the group seem to be most \"in\" ? What members of the group seem most \"out\" ? Under what conditions do people come into and move out of the group? REACTION SCALE . During the D Group dis- cussion participants are asked to respond to questions which include : To what extent are your opinions being solicited by the group? How satisfied do you feel with your participa- tion in moving toward a decision? How much frustration do you feel as the work on the de- cision goes on? How good is the decision your group is making? Answers can vary in degree from completely satisfied to completely dissatisfied . POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ELEMENTS IN MY SELF IMAGE . All participants are given lists of 220 self-descriptive adjectives which in- clude words such as : aggressive, caring, con- fident, dependable, lively, nervous, over- emotional, powerful, rationalizing, rigid, serious, strong, vulnerable, and zestful . From thii list they choose three positive traits which they have and would like to retain and three negative traits which they also possess and which they would like to do away with . After"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"they have completed this by themselves each member selects a partner . The two exchange papers and together discuss the lists and the reasons for their choices . All participants are then reassembled and each person reports on his partner's lists . In this way, an'indi- vidual reveals himself to one other person who then edits the findings and reports back to the group . Members of the group might ask questions, make comments, give sug- gestions, or agree or disagree with an indi- vidual's perceptions of himself . Focused Exercises Focused or structured exercises were also incorporated into Laboratory training sessions : Five of these exercises are included here :- LISTENING EXERCISE . Participants are grouped in triads and given 8-10 topics for discussion . (Topics might include school- related concerns such as : Today's students are given too much freedom ; or More empha- sis should be placed on Basic Skills in the Primary Grades .) In each triad one member acts as the mediator or evaluator and the other two discuss the topics . Roles are re- versed after approximately 5 to 7 minutes of dialogue so each member is given the oppor- tunity to be a participant and a mediator . The discussion is unstructured . Before a member may speak, however, he must sum- marize (in his own words) remarks made by the previous speaker, making it necessary for the participant to listen and comprehend as well as to speak . NASA EXERCISE . Members are grouped in .clusters of 6 to 10 people and asked to com- plete an individual worksheet determining priorities in the selection of items for sur- vival on the moon . After individual sheets are completed, clusters meet together to de- termine priorities of their group . Consensus must be reached by members of the group to rank the Items (Pfeiffer & Jones, 1969) . BROKEN SQUARE EXERCISE . Participants are divided into groups of S . Each member is given an envelope containing pieces of cardboard for forming squares . The group task is to form 5 squares of equal size . Dur- ing the exercise no member may speak . No member may ask another member for a card or in any way signal another member and ask for a card . Participants may, however, give cards to other members (Pfeiffer & Jones, 1969) . 20 CONFLICT AND COLLABORATION EXERCISE . Participants are divided into two groups and asked to determine solutions to a single problem . (The problem should be such that the groups will develop significantly differ- ent solutions .) The groups then choose rep- resentatives to describe their views and work out a common solution . Both groups are present when the discussion occurs but are on the opposite sides of a negotiations table . Each group can communicate with its repre- sentative by way of written messages . Inter- group competition generally develops quickly . If representatives are unable to agree, prob- lem-solving suggestions are made to give practice in collaboration . The exercise points out the effects of conflict and of collabora- tion in resolving differences (Harrison, 1967) . TRAINING SESSION EVALUATION . Partici- pants of training sessions respond to various evaluative instruments at the completion of the laboratory . Questions asked of group members include : During the session my predominant feeling was one of being \t Regarding this session, I liked As a result of this session, my re- sponsibility is \t Of most value to me during the ses- sion was \t Presentation of Concepts Cognitive inputs were used by the PEC staff in the laboratory as needed . The pres- entations were designed to give the partici- pants a language and concepts for understand- ing what they were experiencing . The basic rationale of laboratory training is to facilitate for the participant a better integration be- tween his emotional experiences, his behav- ior or action, and his referential or cognitive processes . The following systems of ideas were used most frequently, either as a sum- marizing of an experience or for initiating a training experience, and are presented in ab- breviated forms : SELF DISCLOSURE AND FEEDBACK . (Joharl Window) A process of learning for a member of a D Group is self-disclosure and feedback . This is probably the initial aspect of the training 11"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Ig experience . As a member discloses himself by self-references (feelings, self-concepts, etc .) he initiates a positive gain in self- awareness and effective participation . The consummation off the learning process comes through feedback from other group members (their responses to acts of self-referencing and disclosing) . The process is diagrammed in Figure 4 . Known to Others Not Known to Others 12 Known to Self Not Known to Self Figure 4 Self-Disclosure and Feedback Through acts of self-disclosure Area I becomes larger and Area II becomes smaller (see Figure 5) . I III II IV Figure S Self-Disclosure Through acts of feedback from others that are accepted and assimilated by a person, Area I expands while Area II contracts (see Figure 6) .

Area I expar in two directions with a contraction of Areas II and III .

Area I may also expand int Area IV through activities of dream interprets tion, fantasy explorations and similar activi ties . In accordance with the theory of becoi ing a fully functioning person Area I geomet- rically approaches the limits of the basic large square . 1 I\\ II IV Area of free activity - person unin- hibited in public Blind area - per- son's behavior is beyond self-aware- ness but observed by others \t II Private self- awareness area not readily shared with others III Unexplored poten- 1 tial for growth available through fantasy explora- tion and other spe- cial efforts \t IV"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Criteria of Effective Feedback During the initial stages and in later en- counters, members of a D Group are likely to experience anxiety and feelings of ill-ease . Throughout the human career of each member, anxiety is to be expected and a person can learn to understand and cope constructively with it . As we have seen in the Self-dis- closure and feedback abstract, feedback is an important condition of learning . It needs to be done as competently as possible . This means, among other things, that the anxiety- level of the receiving person is kept low, for anxiety contaminates and attenuates such critical processes as self-awareness, sensory acuity and discrimination, dialogue and in- quiry-the very processes that the D Group is designed to enhance in the participant . Attention, therefore, needs to be given to the characteristics of constructive feedback as follows : 1 . It ti specific and not general ; 2 . It is tentative and not dogmatic ; 3 . It jpform ; and does not order ; 4 . It describes behavior and one's perception of the behavior and does not generalize or categorize as good or bad ; S . It describeq one's own feelings, underscoring the I-Thou relation- ship and avoiding the thingness connotation ; 6 . It is pot name calling ; 7 . It does not accuse and impuan undesirable motives to the re- cipient . Three Personal Styles and Social Interoctlon It is postulated that there are three func- tional modalities that enable a person to per- form a role in a social system-fighting, helping, and thinking . One modality may tend to dominate over the other two-thus Person 1 may tend to be a tighter ; Person 2 a helper to others, while a third person may function predominantly as a thinker . These differences that give rise to personal styles may be Illustrated as in Figure 8 . Thinker . Figure 8 Three Different Modalities of Human Functioning A person in which the modalities are equally balanced would be at Position A, the fighter at 8, thinker at C, and the helper at D . These modalities are related to certain properties as indicated in Table 1 . These three modalities or styles are all useful and contribute to group life and the culture of a school . Members of a training group are able to divide themselves into the three categories through a non-verbal exercise . A person's self-perceptions may be challenged by the perceptions of others, inviting exploration of personal style and experimentation in a human development laboratory with the modalities In which the person does not ordinarily function . Triads for various training functions such as consultation-training that involves the roles of a consultant, consultee, and process ob- server may be composed of trainees differently categorized (one objective thinker, one tough battler and one friendly helper) . Dialogue-Inquiry-Action (Problem-Solving Model) The content for this presentation is de- scribed on pages 6 - 10 . The essential points are contained in Figures 1 and 2 and need elaboration . The model was used as orientation to problem-solving sessions . The experience of PEC staff indicates that the orientation to a sequential problem-solving process should be brief . The model may also be used effectively as a guide at certain junc- tures of the sequence, for example, when a group is moving from selecting a plan of action among alternatives to the implementation of the 13"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"plan . Its most effective use, however,, is in conceptualizing the process and inviting dia- logue-inquiry regarding the process itself after participants have experienced the various steps as indicated in the white boxes (Figures 1 and 2) . Erikson's Eight Stages of the Life Cycle and Teacher Influence Erikson's (1963) eight stages are presented indicating the virtuous outcome when the crisis resolution at each stage results in a \"favorable ratio\" (see table 2) . Some specula- tive generalizations are useful in interpreting the ideas as follows : 1 . Each stage may be redone in the re- cycling of the human career ; for example, when an older person again works through the problem of \"trust vs . mistrust\" with a professional colleague . 2 . Either growth that enables the person to \"develop fully\" in a stage and become \"fully ready\" for the next stage or devel- opmental arrestation in some degree may occur at any stage . Growth or arrestation is determined by the educative forces in the person's environment . 14 Table 1 Modalities Related to Strategic Variables 23 3 . Each stage has a potential of social contagion from one person to another through social contact . Mistrust breeds mistrust ; for example, love breeds love, competence breeds competence, and stag- nation breeds stagnation . Members of the training groups partici- pated in the following steps in an exercise after the lecturette : 1 . Review the experiences you have had with teachers . Select one experi- ence that you recall with pleasure and a sense of worthwhileness for your growth . Select another experience which you recall as being either frus- trating or useless for your growth . 2 . Describe the teacher who had a good influence upon you . Indicate critical interpersonal incidents you experienced . 3 . Describe a teacher who had a frustrating or useless influence upon your growth . Indicate critical inter- personal incidents that happened . 4 .

Jones' Propositions Regarding Creative Learning in Contrast with Anxiety This presentation Is designed to conceptu- alize various learning conditions that a partici- pant may experience in a laboratory including the fortunate outcome of creative learning as well as the unfortunate outcome of anxiety . Jones (1968) states two equations that are use- ful in conceptualizing laboratory training and in understanding human processes that are also involved in the school . He postulates that learning starts with Imagination and the out- come (whether creative learning or anxiety) of the process is determined by other factors, as indicated in Figure 9 . Laboratory learning and school instruction need to provide for community-the community Table 2 Erikson's Life Cycle 24 of feelings and ideas or dialogue among per- sons . Mastery of the situation in which the person finds himself as well as self-control are also important conditions . When commun- ity degenerates into a condition of human aloneness and mastery gives way to a sense of helplessness, the equation doesnot yield creative learning . Instead It produces anxiety which may be thought of as being in the pro- fessional domain of Psychotherapy and irrale- vant to instruction in the school and human development laboratory training . The question Is : How can educators be sensitive to alone- ness and helplessness in one another and In students and convert the negative conditions into community and mastery so that Improved competence in interpersonal relations and problem-solving Is acquired? Only teachers and administrators who are competent inter- personally and can activate problem-solving processes can answer this question . One other observation is useful . Jones' two propositions both are premised in imagina- tion . There is a feedback as represented by the dotted line from anxiety to imagination in the one and from creative learning to imagina- tion in the other . The constructive and humane characteristics of Imagination will be rein- forced and enhanced by creative learning and the human organization will be better for each Instance in creative learning . The destructive and inhumane qualities that may be present in imagination will be reinforced and Intensified through feedback from anxiety and the human organization will further deteriorate through a downward vicious circle .

Another form of cognitive input in the lab- oratory was data feedback and analysis . A sample of data feedback provided by the PEC staff is included here . Some differences in the \"climate\" of the two high schools are sug- gested in terms of questionnaire responses by eleventh graders . 1 . Almost half the boys at School A have been sent out of class by a teacher more than once, as against only 11 percent of those at School B . 2 . A much larger proportion of the boys at School A than at School B have skipped school with a gang of kids more than once . 1 6 Feedback \t Psychotherapy 00 1 Imagination + Aloneness + Helplessness \t Anxiety Instruction --*Imagination + Community + Mastery = Creative Learning Feedback Figure 9 Jones' Formula Regarding Anxiety and Creativity _/ 25 3 . Boys as well as girls at School B are more likely to rank being \"bright, well-informed, and interesting\" as very important for them- selves than boys and girls at School A . 4 . Girls at School B are more likely to place great importance on family background than those at School A . In sum, these few items suggest that the student culture\" at School B is more favorable to learning and academic matters than the \"stu- dent culture\" at School A . What can we do about it? These climates tend to be self-perpetuating ; to some extent they are based on the neighbor- hoods from which the students come, to some extent new students acquire values from old students . What can the school staff do to change the climate in School A for the better?"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Change-Agent Team Trah*q Sessions Each of the three Change-Agent Teams work- ing with the PEC Staff had a two-fold function which included providing a climate for change within the school system, and determining, planning, and managing specific changes . After the formation of the teams, work began with a series of training sessions which all three teams attended jointly . The first of these meetings was held In Spring 1967 . The major goal of this session, planned by the PEC Staff, was the improvement of the func- tioning of Change-Agent Teams through Human Relations Training . Participants came to the session prepared for a typical in-service or conference experience and expected lectures concerning team functioning and opportunities to meet and work on their problems . When this did not occur many participants became con- fused and uncomfortable . A member of one of the Change-Agent Teams evaluated the ses- sion as follows : \"After the Initial shock of being exposed to this type of training, I feel much can be accomplished .\" Another stated : \"If I had this to do over, I would have stayed home .\" While a third participant responded : \"It was a new experience for me to explore this tech,ie-je . I was amazed at the evolving structure of the various groups, and the pat- terns that I observed and even the evident change in some of the personalities . I be- lieve that I have profited from this experience and trust that I will be able to carry over what I have learned into all my future meetings .\" Even 2 years later when members of Change- Agent Teams were planning Human Relations Laboratories for others they sometimes referred to the confusion and distrust that was felt when they first participated in these sessions . Most of the initial Human Relations Labora- tories in which members of the Change-Agent Teams participated combined process and task S III Activltles of the Change-Agent Team and Colleagues orientations, although one or the other usually predominated . For example, one of the initial sessions began with members of all three sys- tem teams meeting as D Groups . These are unstructured groups in which members are free to discuss any subject they choose . They usually work on interpersonal problems and give feedback to each other concerning reactions . Following this, members of the separate teams met together in a new D Group situation across system teams . After some time they stopped to analyze what they had learned about each other and how it affected their work as a team . Later in the day each team worked together on a task while the other teams watched to see how the group functioned and made suggestions as to how the team could work together more effectively . Finally there was a time when each team worked on their problem only, using a force field analy- sis, a problem-solving technique wherein forces, both positive and negative, affecting the task are diagrammed and weighted . In this Laboratory Training Session both the problem (the way the team worked together) and the task (the problem they worked on) was attended to . The training design for one of these labora- tories is included . Change-Agent Teams Participants were members of Change-Agent Teams from Systems A, B, and C . Goals 1 . Each member will identify self-learning goals in relation to improving team func- tioning . 2 .

TRIAD DISCUSSION . Using the self-learning goals developed by participants as a basis for discussion, each member of the triad performed on a rotation basis in three roles : (1) consul- tantee, (2) consultant, and (3) observer and analyzer-stimulator of process . PERSONAL STYLES AND GROUP PROCESS EX- ERCISE . Each individual determined his per- sonal~ity type : tough battler, friendly helper, or objective thinker . Triad discussions and Change-Agent Team discussions concerning the individual's perception of himself and his relation to the three personality types, and the triad members or group's perception of the individual followed . GROUP MATURITY ASSESSMENT . Each Change- Agent Team was assigned one of three topics for discussion which included innovations, educational goals, and local problems . A rating form was filled out by two teams who observed the third team . The observed team did a final self-rating after the observation . Several questions included on the Rating Scale are listed below . 1 . Do most people in the group feel free to participate in the discussion? 2 . Does the group find and use its \"experts\"? 3 . Do group members seem to work well together? 4 . Does the group seem to care about the personal feelings of its separate members ? 5 . Do group members listen to what other members say? 6 . Does the group sense the needs . and styles of the members? RESOURCE UTILIZATION EXERCISE . The NASA exercise was used to point out the need for utilizing all available resources in the de- cision-making process . CHANGE-AGENT TEAM PLANNING . Criteria established by the PEC Staff for Change-Agent Team planning included : 1 . Evaluate your team's progress . 2 . Outline concrete action steps ."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"3 . Place action steps in sequence . 4 . Plan a timetable for the completion of each step . Goals of additional laboratory training ses- sions planned for Change-Agent Team members included : Relating sensitivity training to the functioning of Change-Agent Teams as back home groups, learning and utilizing problem- solving techniques, and providing additional information regarding system problems through the use of data feedback . By the fourth ses- sion in which Change-Agent Teams participated, members had accepted and become enthusiastic about the laboratories and the results of train- ing . During this period Change-Agent Teams were asked to decida on an innovation which they would Introduce into their respective school systems . The PEC Staff provided cri- teria for choosing an innovation as follows : 1 . Has your Change Agent Team devel- oped an operational definition of an Inno- vation or change? 2 . Has your Change-Agent Team devel- oped a priority of changes or innovations which you feel are relevant and desirable locally ? 3 . Which of the Innovation-Changes can be processed through your Change-Agent Team? 4 . What levels of decision-making will need to be utilized in processing the Innovation-Change : teachers, adminis- trators, school board members, or the electorate? S . What limiting variables need to be considered before the final selection of the Innovation-Change? Variables in this category might include . some of the fol lowing s a . Time necessary to establish the Innovation-Change . b . Human resources time and energy needed . Projected cost of the Innovation- Change . System \"climate\" for change . Complexity of the Innovation- Change . f . Degree to which system must adjust Its existing patterns, norms, etc . c . d . e0 2 fl V , . Using these criteria, System A chose to work on the introduction of Independent Study, System B selected Modular Scheduling and Independent Study, and System C began the formulation of a Philosophy of Education for the system . The Change-Agent Teams also met regu- larly and independent of PEC in their respec- tive school systems . Each of their meetings was tape-recorded and the tapes were ana- lyzed by members of the PEC Staff . Through this analysis it was possible to see effects of Human Relations Laboratory Training and to note the progress of each group . Although each Change-Agent Team was given identical Laboratory experiences, participated in ses- sions involving Human Relations and Problem- Solving areas, and was given th â€¢' same cri- teria for selecting an innovation or change to be introduced in their respective systems, it can be seen that each team had diverse char- acteristics, goals, and problems . System A System A, the largest of the three systems studied, employs approximately 500 profes- sional workers and has two high schools . The system, like the city in which it is located, is generally considered conservative and some- what slow to change, but has the reputation of being a solid system . In general, while innovations are introduced, they tend to be carried on in a few schools as pilot projects and their spread is slow . In the study involv- ing eight school systems done in 1967, School System A ranked sixth in innovativeness (Hilfiker, 1969) . The city itself, which is a small manufacturing community, is growing but is doing so at a slower rate than many other cities in the state . Some of its major industries are spreading elsewhere . In the Immediate perspective, stability is perhaps the word that describes both the city and the system best . The Change-Agent Team in System A began with six members selected by the Superinten- dent . The group included a school board mem- ber, an Assistant Superintendent, a school psychologist, two principals, and a junior high school teacher . During the first year of the project the members of the team felt that more teacher representation was desirable and included an elementary teacher and a senior high school teacher on the team . This group chose the introduction of Independent Study as its goal . This project, aimed at assisting teachers to provide opportunities for students 19"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"to progress at their own rates and to adapt Instruction to individual differences, was begun at the elementary â€¢l evel . Approximately twenty teachers and administrators from three of the system's elementary schools were ini- tial participants .

Human Develo ment Laboratory Training provided by the PEC Staff was concerned with two types of activi- ties : process (human relations training) and task doing (planning for the introduction of changes within the school system) . A prob- lem-solving session combined both process and task doing activities (see Figure 10) .

This was used as an opening exercise . Participants expressed feelings without verbalization and later dis- cussed these feelings with others . This se- quence included : walking without greeting others, greeting others non-verbally without physical contact, greeting others with physi- cal contact, choosing a partner, communicat- ing with the partner without words, and a sub- sequent discussion of the exercise . TRIAD DISCUSSION-ROLE PLAYING . One person for independent study, one against it, and one with neutral feelings formed triad discussion groups .

Since the beginning of the Planned Change Project 69 people have received a total of 3536 training hours In System A (see figure 11) . A 2-day planning session was held by the Change Agent Team at the end of the school year to determine goals for 1969-70 which included planning for Human Development Laboratory Training for additional 70 teachers interested in Independent Study and developing a budget to be incorporated in the budget of the school . system . During this time the Change Agent Team in System A evaluated the Planned Change Project in this manner : \"In accord with the objectives of the project our Change Agent Team has undergone a series of training sessions in Human Relations and Problem Solving areas, has aetermined educa- tional needs within the school system, and has begun to introduce a particular innovation- Independent Study-into the schools . This has been done by determining where and with whom the innovation should be introduced and by re-educating personnel of the system through sensitivity training, in-service ses- sions, observations, end planned meetings . \"Of particular value to the Change-Agent Team during the three years of involvement in the project has bees : : (1) consultant services of members of the PEC staff ; (2) the makeup, continuing membership, stability and increased maturity of the Change Agent Team which has made this group more effective ; (3) Human De- velopment Laboratory Training which has pro- moted positive charge in attitudes on the part of educators involved ; and (4) enthusiasm and interest shown by members of elementary schools involved in the Independent Study projects . \"Negative aspects of the project as seen by the Charge-Agent Team Include : (1) limited use of feedback from data collections ; (2) lack of time had by members of the Change Agent Team (a great deal of time and ptnnlnq is needed to effect worthwhile changes) ; (3) re- sistance to change by some professional edu- cators . \"The Change-Agent Team believes that Human Development Laboratory Training has resulted in an Increasing sense of trust and respect within the school system and that ad- ditional sessions should be conducted under the direction of trained leaders . It also feels that this project should be continued and the 22 31 . members of the PEC Staff should be maintained as consultants . The focus must now be on our school system, however, and the Change- Agent Team must make decisions and move out on its own .\" The makeup, continuing membership, and training of the Change-Agent Team in this school system proved advantageous to the project as did the obvious support of the Superintendent of Schools, the approval of the Board of Education, the guidance of the PEC Staff and the enthusiasm and support of those who participated in Human Development Laboratories .

The dommunity has a population of over 10,000 and is growing rapidly . This growth puts pressure for expansion on the school system and gives it the opportunity to be innovative as it constructs new schools to meet the increased demands . There are ap- proximately 200 professional employes in the school district . In 1967 it was rated as the most innovative system of the eight In the samples hundreds of teachers and school ad- ministrators visit it every year to observe its innovative procedures . Partly because of rapid changes in the community, this school system underwent several great changes dur- ing the time it was involved in the study . These included a change in the superinten- dency and subsequent resignation of two school board members, the passing of a twice- defeated school bond issue, and the planning of a new high school . 24 3 The Change Agent Team in System B con- sisted Initially of thirteen members, includir the Director of Instruction, nine members of the High School faculty, three members of th Junior High School faculty and an Elementary School principal . After approximately eight months of work, the new Superintendent felt that a Change-Agent Team should be elected and asked that the initial group be disbanded and that new members be voted for . The elec tion was held and all members of the original Change-Agent Team were re-elected by their colleagues with the exception of one faculty member . This was the first re-organization of the team . The second change in the group's structure, came several months later when the Superintendent again decided to re-organize the team . There were fourteen members of this new group, one from each of the departments ii the high school and the Director of Instruction The new Change-Agent Team included only three of the original team members . The Change-Agent Team in System 8 went through two periods of training and identifying needs in the school system . The initial team had focused on modular scheduling and inde- pendent study as the innovations which they felt should be introduced into their schools . After the team's re-organization the bond issue in the system passed . This gave the new Change-Agent Team a goal : that of helping to train other teachers to accept and practice in- novations in the high school which was to be built . In order to do this the Change-Agent Team decided to have a Human Relations Laboratory which would include all 100 members of the high school faculty . The team and the PEC Staff spent a day and a half in preparation for the Laboratory . Goals for their planning meet- ing included : (1) To prepare a diagnosis of the faculty meeting, (2) to consider operational plans for that day, (3) to develop training ex- ercises and instruments to be used in faculty and departmental meetings . The Change-Agent Team identified goals and problems, and listed and assigned priorities to these goals and problems . The group also de- veloped a force field analysis of the task of involving the entire staff of the high school in a Human Development Laboratory . The team decided to function as co-trainers with the PEC Staff and assisted in the planning and preperinc of the training design .

LOCUS OF DECISION-MAKING EXERCISE . Each participant was asked to complete an instru- ment which listed approximately 20 items which are of concern in school systems and 'to decide : (1) Where decisions concerning these items were then made ; (2) where these decisions should be made . Possible decision- makers included school board, central office administration, principals, teachers, and stu- dents . The instrument was constructed in the following manner : Several of the Decision Items are included here : 1 . The decision on how the school cal- endar (number of days taught and when) will be determined, assuming that state legal requirements are met . 2 . The decision on which Instructional aids will be available for teachers' use . 3 . The decision on the selection of textbooks . 4 . The decision concerning parent- teacher conferences . 5 . The decision on the hiring of teachers . 6 . The decision on pupil discipline out- side of the classroom . 7 . The decision concerning the use of pupil achievement tests and scores on the building level . When participating in the Locus of Decision- Making Exercise, teachers and principals felt that the central office and the Board of Educa- tion made the most decisions, but deemed it desirable that they be more involved in the making of decisions .

TWO WAY-ONE WAY COMMUNICATION EX- ERCISE . Participants were divided into three groups . Each group was asked to follow di- rections and draw a diagram consisting of rec- tangles placed in various positions . The first group was given printed directions, the second was given directions orally by someone who could not respond to questions, and the third was given oral directions by a person who could answer any questions which were asked of him by those completing the diagram . A discussion of the exercise and the merits of two-way communications followed . PARTICIPATION-OBSERVATION-PARTICIPATION EXERCISE . Members of the Change-Agent Team and the Superintendent of Schools met in an inner circle with one empty chair to discuss recommendations concerning decision-making which were formulated by clusters . The re- mainder of the faculty was seated in a larger outer circle . They observed the group's pro- cess and could participate in the discussion if they desired by going to the inner circle and being seated in the additional chair (see Fig- ure 12) . Several recommendations for Decision- Making compiled during this session are in- cluded below : 1 . We believe that factors affecting teachers should be a cooperative de- cision . 2 . We are agreed that a definite prob- lem exists regarding communication be- tween staff and administration, and that change must take place concerning com- 26 U15 * CAT Member * Superintendent 0 Empty Chair Faculty Members who could participate by going to the empty chair Figure 1 2 Final Session of a Day of Problem-Solving communication among parties .

We feel that a well-defined com- munications system that allows for a free flow of ideas among all parties should be structured so that decisions are reached with mutual trust and con- fidence . One member of the Change Agent Team evaluated the high school Human Development Laboratory in this manner : \"People told me this was the best in-service we've ever had . They expressed very positive personal feel- ings . My own were a little less positive .\" Another stated : \"People see us trying to make progress and feel better about CAT .\" A third stated : \"Frustration was high after the meet- ing .

The staff is ready for more involvement .\" In general members of the System B Change- Agent Team were committed to the project .

It serves two villages and consists of two elementary schools, one in each village and a high school . Approximately 80 professional workers are employed by the district . System C is a new school district and is also highly innovative ; it ranked third in innovativeness among the eight systems studied in 1967 . It is somewhat restricted, however, by being located In a rather conservative area ; a sur- vey of parents in 1969 showed that 46% felt that \"too many\" new ideas were being tried in their schools . Another problem in this dis- trict is a high turnover of staff, due in part to the hiring of young teachers who are spouses of students at the University of Wisconsin . The Initial Change-Agent Team in System C was made up of five administrators . During Summer 1967 the district acquired a new Super- intendent . He became a member of the Change- Agent Team and the group was later expanded to include four teachers bringing the total mem- bership to nine . A unique situation occurred in this system . A member of the PEC Staff was a resident of the district, a member of the school board, and had been instrumental in unifying the district and planning for the new high school . This may have influenced the involvement in and continuation of the Planned -= Change Project in this school system . Because many of the original members of the Change-Agent Team left the district after the first year of the project, the group was re- organized during 1968 . The structure of the team was changed at this time . Three com- mittees, one in each school, plus a coordinat- ing committee of three principals were formed . The Superintendent was no longer a member of the Change-Agent Team after its restructuring . The goal of the initial members of the Change- Agent Team was to write a Philosophy of Educa- tion for the school district . This was a very appropriate project . Because of the high turn- over in the district, a written philosophy was valuable for new teachers and gave the new Superintendent a chance to shape and influ- ence policy in his school system . This philosophy, however, may have caused problems in the district . It was writ- ten by members of the Change-Agent Team who, at this time, were the younger, more innova- tive, teachers that would, for the most part, remain in the system only a year or two . Since older teachers who lived in the district and had taught in the schools for many years were not involved, feelings of resentment and a division between the two groups seemed to develop at this time ."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"After this project was completed, the \t During the two years of the Planned Change Change-Agent Team focused on the imple- \t Project, approximately 65% of the professional mentation of non-graded elementary schools . \t staff in School System C spent a total of With the reorganization of the team, improl'e- \t 1 . ,440 , hours in Human Development Laboratory ment of the format of high school classy 2nd \t training sessions (see Figure 14) . the introduction of unitized elementary .Jhools became major goals of the group .

The elementary school was to be Initiating team teaching and ungraded classes in the Fall and members attending the session from this school would be working as a team at that time . It was hoped that this session might bring the groups into dialogue and that the elementary school faculty would be helped to successfully implement their in- novative procedures . Originally the training design called for T-Groups combining members of both faculties . The format was changed,' however, when It became apparent that the English team had personal and philosophical differences which needed to be explored . Because of this, the English team worked alone while the elemen- tary faculty met separately to discuss prob- lems and procedures in preparing for the com- ing innovations . The English team had varying reactions to the training . Two members left the session before the end and did not return . Others felt that the session had been very helpful . Some members were simply confused by what had taken place . All seemed to agree that prob- lems that had been buried before were out in the open . By the end of the semester, how- ever, the English team disbanded . This was blamed, by some, on the Laboratory training . What actually happened with this group is a matter for conjecture . They had problems when they arrived . Whether these problems could have been solved by more training or whether the training aggravated them is im- possible to determine . This Human Develop- ment Laboratory training session, however, had a deleterious effect on the succeeding labs since it frightened potential participants and caused the Superintendent to become un- sure of training sessions and their effect . Anxiety feelings at the beginning of further sessions in System C were always higher than in any other system after this Laboratory . In comparison, the elementary school faculty members attending this session had a very suc- cessful experience and asked to come back in a week or two and bring their principal, a mem- ba of the Change-Agent Team, so that they could make mote progress in preparing for changes . As a result, a sc&oond training ses- sion was held for members 0 this group . After the reorganisation of the Change-Agent Team, a combined training session was planned and executed for members of the Teachers' In- 30 service Committee (a functioning committee in the school system) and the Change-Agent Team . This session considered further train ing sessions for the rest of the faculty and particularly with the two committees and the School Board to better define the committees' functions and the Board's policy .

These included observations of support for Change-Agent Teams and laboratory training, casual observations of personal growth and growth in the effectiveness of Change-Agent Teams after laboratory training, evaluations of the program from anonymous questionnaires, and systematic data on changes in attitudes and behavior from questionnaires administered at the beginning and conclusion of the study . Effect of Laboratory Training The leadership of each of the experimental school systems evaluated the effects of lab- oratory training positively . After observing some of its effects, they committed substan- tial resources to further training . Although the Research and Development Center covered the costs of training, the school systems were responsible for the costs of meeting rooms, meals, overnight lodging for participants in the sessions, and the salaries for substitutes to replace teachers who were in training ses- sions . Given the many hours spent in these sessions (see Figures 11, 13, and 14, Chap . III), these represent sizeable investments, and it is unlikely that the schools would have in- vested so heavily had the training not been perceived as useful . The Change-Agent Teams that experienced laboratory training survived and continue to exist . In contrast, the teams established in two of the five control school systems, re- ceiving no laboratory training or external sup- port, withered and died before they became well organized . From observing the teams in training ses- sions and listening to tape recordings of their regular meetings the PEC Staff became con- vinced that the human relations training was IV Achievements and Evaluation being utilized outside of the training sessions and was increasing the effectiveness of the teams . For example, one tape revealed a confrontation between two members discussing the absence of one of them from the previous meeting . The other was angry and felt that this absence denoted a lack of commitment . Business was set aside until this confronta- tion was satisfactorily resolved and the group was ready to work again . In another meeting a group member remarked, \"I have often sat at this table and felt frustrated and afraid to say anything .\" There was a moment of silence and then a shocked, \"In this group! \" from another member . The first immediately exclaimed, \"Oh, no! I meant with other committees that meet in this room .\" This was followed by a relieved, \"I couldn't imagine that you wouldn't feel free in this group .\" It seems apparent that openness and freedom of communication became values for this Change-Agent Team . The same types of observation reveal the personal growth of teachers and administrators who have experienced human relations training . A specialist who worked with personnel in several schools had asked to participate in the human relations training because, she said, \"During the year I noticed that suddenly a teacher would become more easy to work with, listen more, and be willing to try out my sug- gestions . Then one day I discovered all the teachers who had changed had been going to the training sessions .\" A teacher reported that training had improved her teaching . One of her children had even told her that the class enjoyed school more, \"because now you treat us more like people .\" Another team member found a particular human relations exercise carried out at one of the laboratories very helpful to him in understanding the reactions of others . Two years later when another lab- oratory session was being planned in the same system one of his team mates suggested that the exercise be used again .

Data on teacher innovativeness, the ade- quacy of staff meetings, and the executive professional leadership of principals also fail to show that the experimental school systems improved significantly more than the control school systems . The failure of these data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our interventions in changing basic norms and behaviors in school systems may stem in part from the limited intensity and duration of the interventions ; in order to make a basic change it may be necessary to train more members of the school staffs more in- tensively and for longer periods .

It seems more likely that the limited amount of training most persons received was not enough to produce lasting changes in the dependent variables which were measured . This is especially true for teacher innovativeness and relations between teachers and principals, which were not expected to be directly affected by the training . It remains possible and likely that some teachers and administrators who received more intensive laboratory training were strongly affected by it, but the questionnaire data cannot demon- strate these effects . 36 The data for changes in school systems are superior in quality to the data for changes in individuals : the samples are larger, since it was not necessary to rely only on data for per- sons who answered questionnaires in both 1967 and 1969, and averages tend to be much more reliable than measures for individuals . Yet the average measures fail to show that the three school systems with which the PEC Staff worked intensively improved more than the five control systems . Some of the data are shown in Figures 15 and 16 . Figure 15 shows average responses of teachers and administra- tors in the eight school systems studied to an 11-item index measuring support for norms of openness, trust, and innovation . 3 While the three experimental systems showed the highest average support for these norms in 1969, they .88 .85 .80 .75 .70 .65 .60 A \t B \t C Experimental Systems E \t F \t G Control Systems SCHOOL SYSTEM D Figure 15 Mean Values of Support for Norms of Openness .

These events and processes include administrative succession and staff turnover . Administrative Succession During the course of the project, two of the three experimental school systems experienced major changes in administrative personnel, while this was true of only two of the five control systems (and then the changes were less important) . These experiences of admin- istrative succession had great effects on per- sonnel in the systems affected . System A had the same Superintendent, Director of Instruction, and high school prin- cipals throughout the course of the study . The PEC Staff felt it was most effective in this system . Part of the reason for this suc- cess was the continuing stable support for the project from the school administration . In System B the Superintendent resigned after the first collection of data in 1967 and after the Change-Agent Team had been estab- lished . His resignation was partly caused by the defeat of a bond issue in two successive elections and by disagreements with important school board members . He had been known as a permissive leader in an innovative school system . His successor, brought in from out- side, was helped by the resignation of two school board members and by the passage of the bond issue for a new high school ; he may have been partly responsible for the latter success . After two years, about the time of the second data collection, he announced his resignation . In the 2-year period the Director of Instruction and the high school principal resigned and were replaced ; the new principal lasted only one year and was succeeded again . The succeeding superintendent was far more directive and dynamic than his predecessor and his contribution to the system in terms of educational design for the new high school will be felt for years to come in the system . Administrative turnover was just as great in System C . Again the new superintendent took over from his predecessor after the first wave of data collection and after the commit- ment to the project had been made . His prede- cessor was the second of two superintendents of this highly innovative system . The two years of the study saw the replacement of the superintendent's major administrative assist- ant (a role corresponding to the Director of Instruction), the high school principal, and both elementary school principals . One of the 38 new elementary principals was in the system for a year and was replaced . In addition, the , central office had a special consultant for part of the period of the study, a dynamic woman who was associated with another inno- vative project in the system . In contrast, only one of the five control systems experienced the succession of super- intendents, although the superintendent of another system became ill, with disorganiz- Ing effects on the system . There were gen- erally fewer changes in the principals of schools in the control systems . The effects of these changes on the influ- ence structures of these systems is shown in Figures 17 and 18 . In both 1967 and 1969 teachers and administrators were asked, \"In general how much influence do you think the following groups of persons now have in de- termining educational matters (e .g ., curricu- lum, policy, etc .) in your school?\" Response categories ranged from 0 for \"none\" to 4 for \"a great deal\" ; respondents were asked to rate the local school board, the superinten- dent, the principal of their school, teachers in general, and a variety of others . Figures 17 and 18 have been prepared by summing the mean ratings for school board, superintendent, principal, and teachers in general, and then dividing each component by the sum . Thus the relative power of each role, using this index, could logically range from 0%, if the mean rating for the role was \"none\" to 100%, if the mean rating for the one role was greater than \"none\" and the mean rating for the other three roles was \"none .\" Obviously all roles have at least some influence in each system, and the four role types do not exhause sources of Influence, so this index merely represents the relative influence of each of these four roles . Figures 17 and 18 are triangular diagrams . Each apex of the triangle represents a maximum degree of influence, and the opposite side represents a minimum degree of influence, for the indicated role . Each school system is represented by an arrow in the diagram . The tail of the arrow indicates the score for the system in 1967 ; the head the score for 1969 . In Figure 17 teachers and principals [the rela- tively \"lower participants\"] are combined in one dimension, and in Figure 18 the superin- tendent and school board [the \"higher partici- pants\"] are combined in one dimension, sim- ply in order to show the relative movement of influence of each system in four dimensions of authority in just two figures .

In System C, the other experimental system with a new superintendent, the role was perceived to lose influence very slightly . However, Fig- ure 18 shows that in System C teachers were perceived to gain greatly in relative influence, entirely at the expense of principals . That administrative succession does not have uni- form effects on authority patterns is also shown by the results for Systems H and D, the two control systems where the superin- tendent either resigned or became ill . In System H the superintendent role lost influ- ence almost equally to principals and teachers, and in System D the superintendent was per- ceived to lose influence mostly to the school board . The effects on influence patterns of administrative succession depend upon the characteristics of the predecessor and his successor and also upon the state of the sys- tem at the time of succession . Administrative succession probably has many effects upon other characteristics of school systems of interest, including the formalization of rules, norms about communi- cation, and innovation . Since the PEC Staff did not design the data collection to study the effects of succession, it can only specu- late about the effects, although these specu- lations can be grounded upon prior research and theory (e .g ., Gouldner, 1952 and 1954) . A succeeding official in any organization is almost certain to be insecure, especially if he is appointed to change some policies of his predecessor . His superiors, not having full confidence in him, will monitor his be- havior closely . Lacking Informal relations with others in the organization, he will lack many important sources of organizational in- formation . His subordinates are also likely to be insecure, especially if his predecessor has been permissive and democratic . They will tend to attempt to extend their sphere of autonomy in the organization and will with- hold information from him if they feel he may act against their interests . In such a situa- tion, the successor is likely to move in two somewhat inconsistent directions : he will try to formalize rules and communication patterns, and he will engage in what Gouldner calls \"pseudo-gemeinschaft\" behavior with his sub- ordinates, a kind of superficially friendly be- havior designed to elicit trust and informal support that is usually treated with skev , ticism by others . In other words, the administrative successor will often tend to increase slime of those aspects of the organization our i4iterven- tions were designed to diminish : centraliza- tion, formalization of authority and communi- cations, and reciprocal distrust . It is likely 1 that these types of behavior will be transitory ; as the successor develops confidence and an informal network of work associates, distrust will diminish and the felt importance of cen- tralization and formalization will decline . In school systems this is likely to take at least two years, however . We hoped that thee change-agent teams would be able to assist in the transition process, but they did not, probably because they lacked in- stitutionalization at the time of transition . The succeeding superintendents evidently dis- trusted these creations of their predecessors and the group at the University of Wisconsin . One joined the change-agent team as its leader, and initially its only other members were principals and other administrators . Only after about a year was he confident enough to include teachers in the team, and during this period the team was relatively ineffective in terms of its stated goals . The other superin- tendent drastically reorganized the change agent team that was already in existence, al- though he did not join it himself ; both its leader, the director of instruction, and most of its members, were newly appointed or elected . Even so this change-agent team was suspicious of the superintendent . For some time they devoted much of their regular meet- ings to discussing the extent to which the superintendent would permit them to influence school system policies ; skeptical that any effort on their part would have any real effects, they devoted little time to important school system policies, yet they failed to discuss these concerns with the superintendent in an open fashion for more than a year . A well established change-agent team could perhaps aid in the transition when a new school superintendent assumes office . They might serve as an ideal channel for communicating to him the informal culture of the system and the hopes and fears of its members, and they might serve as a sounding board for his ideas about possible changes in the system . These change-agent teams could not do this, for they were not well established, and the succession of superintendents made it difficult for them to become established . Teacher Turnover The turnover of administrators has impor- tant and dramatic consequences for several aspects of school systems . Turnover of teachers also has important consequences, although these are not usually as dramatic or visible . More time is required for newcomers to be integrated in primary groups than in the 41"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"formal orga : . : . :3tion ; while formal rights and obligations may be quite explicit, informal procedures may be implicit and may be learned only through int .- ction with friends . Thus, as turnover rates increase, patterns of informal communication are less well developed . This means that high turnover makes it difficult for a school system to transmit its distinctive culture to newcc, .. â€¢s and thereby maintain this culture . Furthe :-^ . :ore, when high turnover rates exist over a perijd of time, members of school staffs come to expect it to continue at a high rate, and this means that individuals will lack commitment to the organization and will expect that others will also have little commitment . High turnover rates probably lead to lower levels of reciprocal trust, for there is ordinar- ily less reason to trust another who has no commitment to one's organization than another who is committed . Sometimes high turnover makes it easier to change organizations . High turnover makes it difficult to institutionalize change, however, and it also reduces levels of trust and tends to emphasize power based upon formal position rather than upon competence . Thus, high turn- over makes it more difficult to change school systems in the ways attempted by the PEC Staff . One of the experimental systems, System C, had the highest staff turnover in the sample of eight school systems, and System B also had a relatively high rate of turnover . The follow- ing table indicates the magnitude of the dif- ference : Table 5 Staff Turnover and Norms of Schools 42 Percentage of staff em- ployed in the system less than School System \t two years Experimental Systems : System C System B System A Control Systems : System E System G System D System H System F All Systems Percentage of staff hoping to be employed in the same school system in 1974 51 When, as ir . System C, more than one out of three teachers or administrators have served the system less than two years (with more than one of six currently in their first year of serv- ice), and when fewer than half of them hope to be in the same school system five years hence, it becomes extremely difficult to institution- alize new norms regarding trust, cooperation, communication, and innovation . Even if sat- isfaction with teaching and with administrative leadership is high, as it was in System C, commitment and involvement may be relatively low . Data Feedback One important aspect of the original inter- vention design was the feedback of data from questionnaire surveys to change-agent teams and others in the school systems . The PEC Staff felt this information would be very useful in the participants' efforts to diagnose prob- lems in their schools and in their plans to solve the problems . Thus, after the data from the 1967 survey were compiled, a small por- tion of the results were discussed at a series of meetings with change-agent teams and others, printed memoranda containing these were distributed, and correspondence concern- ing data was engaged in . This data feedback was almost totally with- out effect on the activities of the change-agent teams or others in the schools . For example, a discussion of teacher morale and its corre- lates, pointing out the relatively low morale of some groups of teachers in some systems, received polite attention but elicited little discussion . A discussion of administrative succession and its correlates aroused more interest ; teachers in systems affected by new superintendents recognized the validity of the material presented and discussed it a little, but only in the session at which the material was presented ; it appeared to have little effect on their later work . At another session the great differences in the morale of teachers and students in the two high schools of one of the systems was pointed out . At the time this was noted as a probably correct diagnosis, but again it produced no further discussion or action . (Somewhat later there was a student strike at the high school with low morale ; while this suggests that our procedures might have some diagnostic validity, this knowledge is of little gratification, since in fact the data were not used for problem diagnosis or problem- solving .) Evidently data, however valid they might be, will not be used by change-agent teams or 34% 46% 32% 52% 25% 60% 21% 46% 21% 51% 20% 64% 13% 61% 12% 59% 21% 58%"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"school administrators unless they have a felt need for the data and the kind of theory of action that will make the data rele- vant . It is likely that, if data feedback is to be effective, the demands for the data must come initially from the partici- pants, in this case the change-agent teams or school administrators . The problem of stimulating the demand for data has not yet been solved . It seems that presenting some kinds of data does not stimulate demands for other data felt to be of greater immediate relevance . Per- haps such demands will only arise if school personnel feel they have real in- fluence over school policies and if they are in a situation where they must choose between real alternatives and can see the need for information about the alternatives . 59 Summary In this section we have presented some evi- dence showing that our interventions in three school systems has some of the intended effects . The PEC Staff has been unable to provide evi- dence that these interventions produced greater changes in individuals and school systems ex- posed to them than in individuals and systems not so exposed . Changes in general norms gov- erning interpersonal relations in school and changes in general orientations to innovation may require greater inputs than were available and longer periods of time than two years . Dem- onstration that such changes are effective may require statistical or quasi-experimental con- trols for such major confounding factors as ad- ministrative succession and teacher turnover . How interventions could have been made more effective with the limited resources at the dis- posal of the PEC Staff is the next consideration ."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"This report is a record of two years of cooperative effort between the PEC staff and three school systems . What could have been done differently to have made the effort more productive? We now address ourselves to alternatives to the initial project . A More \"Compelling\" Approach Versus the Therapeutic Model This model, as described above, supports training in interpersonal and problem-solving competencies, and emphasizes the responsi- bilities of the internal change-agent team to generate targets for change and to improve structures for facilitating change . There may have been too much confidence placed by the PEC staff in process training which assumes a discovery approach to learning rather than the use of the authority of the University ex- pert to instruct personnel in problem-solving . The Staff could have made a more aggressive thrust by directing the attention of school per- sonnel to areas of school life requiring diag- nostic effort and systematic planning for change . A possible shortcoming or distortion of the therapeutic approach regarding the seductive- ness of sensitivity training not accompanied by an emphasis upon changing reality was recognised by a staff member and is described in the following memorandum to his colleagues : There is possible weakness associ- ated with training for the improvement of interpersonal relations . Such training of- fers only one component of a strategy to solving practiosl problems . To develop the point consideration may be given to what is involved in changing a school with\" expeotatllonthat speciticchanges will represent improvements . In addition to sensitivity training, problem-solving activities and their improvement as psr- V Restrospect and Alternative Futures 53 formed by school personnel are strategic . Human relations as embraced in sensitiv- ity training is only one rubric of neces- sary activity . An accurate statement is that sensitivity training that emphasizes interpersonal relations is a necessary, but not a sufficient activity in an effec- tive strategy for changing a school sys- tem . The equally necessary rubric of problem-solving involves several sub- activities : describing and diagnosing reality, formulating problems, identifying needs, deliberate selecting of change tar- gets (characteristics of the school reality that require change), planning and carry- ing out appropriate actions, evaluating outcomes so as to keep problem-solving in contact with reality, interpretation of data systematically collected about a school system, and similar activities must be mounted by school personnel if changes are to be made successfully . Included also are strategic activities of searching for and installing innovations that offer the prospect of changing the realities that must be changed if prob- lems associated with the internal work- ings of the school are solved . It was at this time that the PEC staff pro- vided the change-agent teams with criteria for selecting changes as reported on page 19 . Each school system responded and specific targets were selected . These decisions re- garding needed school system improvements as selected by change-agent teams had influ- enoe upon training designs . How could the PEC staff have been more forthright and help- ful, follow through with more dispatch, and help the teams to become effective without the investment of more time and energy?

Improvement of Chango- Agent Team Structure The status of change-agent teams in Sys- tems B and C was in doubt at times . Both groups lacked continuity of membership . Sys- tem B did not have vertical role representation . The group was composed primarily of high school representatives with an elementary principal as a liaison for a short period of time . This was only a gesture toward the concept of a system-wide team . In School C the central change-agent team enabled build- ing teams to be formed . There wss, however, a lack of coordination at the system level which was due, in part, to the fact that the central administrative staff members saw the school system as being small and not needing a systematically operated structure to intro- duce and implement change . Additional community involvement in change- agent team activities would have been desirable . System C found that perceptions in their com- munity indicated that the school system was possibly too innovative . Helping community leadership to see goals and assist in setting expectations for the school is an important aspect of change and improvement . System A had a school board member on the change-agent team . This is one way to pro- vide a link between schools and the community . Another way is to create problem-solving teams that include parents and pupils at the building level . Thir involvement of students and par- ents is calculated to open doors for more com- munity, school, and professional dialogue- inquiry-action . Improvement of Human Develop- ment Laboratory Sessions A mood of indecisiveness was projected at times by the PEC staff whose members were as dependent upon the change-agent teams as the teams were upon them . This was due, in part, to the group's own risk-taking efforts . The staff needed the opportunity, which the project provided, to explore techniques and to develop training designs . For examples the locus of decision-making instrument was invented by the staff and non-verbal exercises were adapted to school teachers and adminis- 46 54 trators by the staff . If a similar project was done again, members of this group could act with more confidence, greater sensitivity and expertness at critical points in developing and executing training sessions . A body of funded experiences has been formed that would be useful to school people and human-relations trainer-consultants who are contemplating such a project . This report itself is designed to be helpful in the transfer process . Would additional or longer training labora- tories have produced more penetrating effects? One and one-half days is not much time for a session of this kind . Systems intending to use this type of training might find ways to create a greater training density than short sessions produce . The kind of schedule re- ported here did work well in the three systems . It is calculated that such is possible and com- patible with the norms of many systems . When limited experience with training is seen as valuable, perhaps the norms could be changed to allow for three to five days for training laboratory, thus extending the bene- fits of a greater training impact upon members of the change-agent team and their colleagues . There could have been advanced laboratory training sessions for the change-agent teams . During the second year of the project the teams themselves had no laboratory experiences for improving their own processes, although there were efforts made by the PEC staff to help the change-agent team in System B work through its authority problems with the new superin- tendent . The members of the change-agent team in School System A felt the need for additional training but never implemented their own diagnosis . Maximum learning requires experience in the full sequence of the dialggub-inquiry- action model described and illustrated on pages 6-10 . The teams had oily limited opportunity for experiencing the full cycle . There were few instances in whhich reality changes came about as a resi 1t of the problem- solving activities . The admihistrative addi- tions made in System A after 'a training labora- tory was a success experience for the team and their colleagues as was the training day for the high school faculty in System B . These were probably the most visible successes of any of the three teams . Had there been a greater number of successful experiences in carrying through the full process, the training would have been more effective . More Mor ngM Oats Analysis There could have been more focused train- ing sequences for change-agent team members"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"involving them in the collection and interpre- tation of data . Involvement through training and action in planning data collection would have given teams an opportunity to determine questions to which they wanted answers . Data analysis would then have likely become more relevant and useful to the change-agent team . Providing Additional Technical Consultation The PEC staff could have suggested and encouraged the use of consultants in the im- plementation of various changes selected by the change-agent teams : Introduction of In- dependent Study, System A ; development of a PERT chart forthe conversion from High School A to High School B in two years, System B ; implementation of Non-Graded and Unitized Elementary Schools, System C . Systems A and C did use consultants on two occasions . Additional attention could have been given with profit, however, to enabling the teams to define needs, state questions, and utilize outside resources and consultant services . Failures to Create Structural Changes Creation of three new structures within the school systems were projected at the outset of the planned change project and were never realized . The development of a structure for environmental scanning or reconnaissance ; introducing and operating such mechanism to find innovations in school environments (in- cluding neighboring schools, research and development'centers, etc .) was projected as a functional outcome of the change-agent teams and might have been associated with a com- plementary mechanism within the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction to provide basic information to the local school system upon request . . This local mechanism coor- 515 dinated with a state-wide facility is still believed to be important . Through systematic searching for innovations and gathering of in- formation regarding their educational capabili- ties and applications, a school system could enrich its problem-solving cycle at the point of considering alternative innovations for changing the reality in a desirable direction . Such institutionalized mechanism would repre- sent important facilitation structures for assur- ing continuous self-renewal of a school sys- tem . Competent personnel and budgetary allowances would be required for this type of structure . Establishment of a mechanism within the school system for the continuous assessment of needs and problems that suggest changes in processes, new structures, and learning- teaching instrumentation was also projected . Such a mechanism would provide decision- makers with a rational basis for selecting and trying innovations that could be made visible through the reconnaissance in the scanning function described above . The change-agent teams have functioned in a preliminary and exploratory manner as the initiating structure of such a mechanism, but no system imple- mented a well designed structure during the course of the project . Involving professional staff members and organizing an office within a school system to carry out the training function represents another potential structure that might have been initiated . Staff members operating as trainer-consultants could then be available to professional and student groups when con- fronted with the need to become more sensi- tive to their own functioning as a group, more aware of interpersonal relations, more thought- ful in introducing changes, and more skillful in applying a problem-solving approach to various situations . One school system con- sidered the training of its present staff mem- bers at the outset of the project but was never able to carry it out due to a lack of allocated funds . School System A has this matter under advisement . . 47"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"I _, p . pro- our- 5- of d tam its e as le >n- I Dre ht- ful 0 n- Ri- ver ad der 47 Two points can be made in summary, an observation from experience in changing the business-industrial type of organization and a limited but positive statement regarding the project . It is Likert's (1961) observation that neither the testing of a theory nor the shifting of an organization to a full-scale application of the theory can be hurried . There is no sub- stitute for ample time to enable the members of an organization to reach a level of skillful and easy habitual use of new practices . He maintains that a period of two or three years is usually required to introduce a major change in an organization with less than 200 members and believes that in organizations with more than 200 or 300 employes an additional five or more years may be required to bring about sub- stantial changes . Consequently additional time may be needed to determine the full effects of this project and it may be that an expecta- tion of the two-year cycle is not sufficient for institutionalizing new structures and processes at a level of maximum effectiveness . It should probably be increased to at least four years of cooperative effort between an outside agency such as PEC and a school system to introduce and Institutionalize new structure for change . Continuous effort over a period of time is re- quired and a greater saturation of training is needed than occured in any system, including System A . There is some suggestive positive evidence regarding the relationship between innovative- ness in a school system and the functioning of the change-agent team and the utilization of laboratory training with, personnel . System A moved over a period of two years in its inno- vativeness two positions in rank order within the eight school systems sample, while Its companion system, as far as size was con- cerned, lost in innovativeness . System A developed the most ideal conforming change- VV agent team and made the greatest investmen In training . This in itself suggests the value of the change-agent team and laboratory trail ing . RecemmendOHans It is the conclusion of the staff that while certain activities might have been done mor effectively, the approach of PEC promises long-term lasting effects that a more high] engineered approach from the outside migh not offer . The school is in an environment i which a result and usually a quick result i expected by a pragmatic society . More attel Lion is needed to developing competencies ii interpersonal relations and problem-solving skills which will give more substantive an lasting results in the future . These compe â€¢ tencies represent the capital human resource for a better future . Those persons associate with school development should resist effort to make a show too quickly in favor of a less spectacular approach that emphasizes pro- cesses and the development of people . The three change-agent teams have con- tinued to function within their respective school systems after the completion of the Planned Change Project, thus demonstratinc that members of these groups and school syi tam officials believe there is value in the creation and maintenance of a structure fo change within school systems . The author recommend, as an alternative to the preserv tion of a status quo of questionable value our schools, the creation of change-agent teams, adapted to meet the needs of individi school systems and evaluated as to functio and purposes, and the use of laboratory trai ing as developed and applied in the proje described above ."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"'The autoplastic versus the alloplastic is a major issue in the theory of instruction as pre- sented by Richard M .

Internals are defined as persons who believe that reinforcement is contingent on their behavior, while externals are those who believe that reinforcement is independent of their actions and is controlled by chance or powerful others . Attraction was assessed after subjects were differentially successful in changing the opinions of two confederates . Results on a behavioral measure support the hypothesis that internals are more attracted to others they are able to influence, whereas externals do not differentiate their attraction on the basis of others' persuasibility . However, on an attitudinal measure, there was a trend for internals to be more attracted to the confederate with whom they were less successful . A possible re olution of these results is discussed .

Davis and Alan L . Taylor Iowa State University While considerable research has focused on the generality and correlates of individual differences in susceptibility to persuasive communications (Hovland & Janis, 1959), relatively few studies have investigated the percep- tion and evaluation of individuals who differ on this dimension . Individuals who are perceived to be highly persuasible may be evaluated differently than less persuasible individuals for several reasons . For example, a number of studies have shown that one factor which influences a person's attraction to others is the extent to which they agree with his attitudes (Newcomb, 1961 ; Byrne, 1969) . In general, individuals with similar attitudes are more at- tracted to each other than are those with opposing attitudes . Extending these findings, it is pcseible that individuals who can be persuaded to agree with one's own attitudes would be perceive=d as sere attractive due to an increase in the proportion of similar : attitudes . On the other hand, a highly per- suasible individual might be perceive as an ingratiator and therefore evalu- ated less favorably, although the relationship between attraction and opinion conformity as an ingratiation tactic appoars to be quite complex (Jones, 1964) . A third possibility, and one that was investigated in the present study, is that the relationship betva n attraction and others' porsuasibility is deter- tin ed, in part, by oertain personality characteristics of the perceiver . The parpoee of this study was to examine the relationship between the personality corstruot of internal-external control of reinforcement and attraction to others who differ in their susceptibility to social influence . The construct of internal-external control of reinforcement (I-E) was derveloped from social learning theory (Potter, 1954), and refers to differences 1 To be pram_ Ited at MPA, Detroit, 1971 . U .

At one end of the I-E dimension are individuals who believe that reinforcement is contingent upon their behavio .- (internals), while thcze at the ether end be- lieve that reinforcement is in â€¢7 -,pendent of their acticns and is controlled by luck, chance, or powerful others . Several clusters of I-E studies have focused on the general hypothesis that internals are more likely than externals to en- gage in behaviors desi!ned to control their outc'cnes . Supportive of this notion are studies shoring an internal orientation to be positively associated with civil rights activities ar+anq Negro college students (Care & Fatter, 1963 ; Strickland, 1965 ; Esooffery, 1967), protest behaviors concerning the Vietnam war (Carlson, Tames, & Correre, 1966), membership arid participation in labor unions in Sweden (Seem, 1966), and willingness to bsc-c involved in activities directed at alleviating alleged personal problems (Pthwes, Ritchie, & Davis, 1968) . More closely related to the preset research, Davis and Phares (1967) reported that internals tended to ask ore questions about a person whom they expected to persuade than externals . Similarly, L,efcourt and Wine (1969) found that internal interviewers cede more frequent eye mov .nents and reported more observations of their interviewees than external interviewers . In another study, internals were less inclined to reciprocate interpersonal evaluations in an app rent attest to oontrol the nature of the evaluations they received frcs others (Jones & Shruger, 1968) . Taken as a whole, these studies indicate that individuals who believe they are rcrnonsible for the reinforcements they receive are m=e likely to rake active atte . :ipts to control these events . If it is true that internals are more concerned about controlling rein- force ent, as the aforenmsntj-wed research suggests, it seems reasonable that they would be att racte to others who enhance their potentiality for control . Thus, a highly pcorsuasible individual would prorido the internal an opportunity to exercise a greater degree of control oaer his outcc :~~ss and %rould therefore be perceived as more attractive than one vho rc?iste his influence attempts . 2"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Davis a Taylor \t 3 Externals, an the other hand, should be less affected by the degree to which their persuasion attempts are successful since they tend to believe that out- ocmes are independent of their behavior . In other worc .a, po rurnibility, for externals, should be an irrelevant dimension in evaluating another individua', since any changes in his behavior are viewed as independent of the external's own actions . Thus the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that in- ternals are more attracted to persons whose they can persuade than to those who resist their influence atta pts, whereas externals are leas if :ely to differ- entiate their attraction toward others on the basis of persuaaibility . Method Subjects The 23-item I-8 scale (Ratter, 1966) was administered to several large introductory psychology olassas at Iowa State University and w scored in the inter-nal direction . From this pool, 15 vales who scud in the upper 25% (in- tcrnals, range 17-23) and 15 riles who scored in the lm-ex 25% (c-xternal, range 2-10) of the I-8 distribution served as Ss in the attdy .

Ss ware then asked to fill-out a 15-item frater- nity opinion questionnaire .

Se were instructed not to talk while B was absent end reports from confederates oonfireed that no S ever atta pted conversation .

As soon as S understood the procedure he was taken back to the experimental roots to prevent his arguments . Responses of confederates were predetermined so that subject A was successfully persuaded six out of eight times, while Subject B was successfully persuaded on only two out of eight atts pts . Since attitudinal similarity has been shown to be an important determin- ant of interpersonal attraction (c .f ., Byrne, 1969) an atterpt was made to equate for the degree of similarity in attitudes towards fraternities between s and the two confederates . The answer sheet given the subject prior to his persuasion atter w pts showed that both confederates disagreed with his opinions on four of the it=s and agreed with him on the raining four . On these latter four items, in which there was initial aarec .-Â° at, S was required to argue for a position counter to his real attitude . Thus, S argued for the opposite opin- ion expressed by the two confederates, even when they initially agreed with him . By using this procedure it was pozsible to insure that attitudinal simi- larity Bald be equated at the end of the persuasion attempt . Even though one confederate changed his attitudes more than the other, both of them agreed with four of the S's attitudes (50% sini) A r_ity) at the conclusion of his argu- rnts .

These ite e s are similar to those used as attraction measures in previous research (Byrne i Nelson, 1965 ; 3yrne i Clore, 1966) . As a final part of the experiment, S was taken outside and asked to sit at a table . The table was approximately 18 feet in length and was located about 12 feet from the door of the experimental room . Confederates A and B were already seated at opposite ends of the table and two empty chairs were positioned in such a way that S was forced to sit next to one or the other con- federate . Before S sat dossn, the confederates ware identified by 8 casually stating that t wished to sake sure which subject was \"A\" and which was \"B .\" Subjects A end B then nodded as they were pointed out . To control for any physical attractiveness effects or directic .zal seating tendencies the confed- erate roles as A ernd B end their seating positions were counterbalanced .

Environmental Variables A variety of outside forces are exerted upon the administr-it .or and teacher which may have a positive relationship to the educator's adoption of a custodial ideology . Some differences are : 1 . The outside forces exerted upon the administration by the state, community, board of education, union, peers and subordinates may be greater and more varied than those outside forces exerted upon the individual tcucher in the classroom . \t 40 2 .

The individualized maturity growth that each' student ex- periences and the different maturity levels of students may dictate the different degrees of custodialism or humanism a teacher can practice . In a study by Budzik 1 he compared teachers' perceptions of their pupil c ontr .i l ideology by the amount of teaching experience ._ The data indicated a trend of lower mean score summaries as teachers gained experience in 3 teaching . The data indicate that teachers tend to view themselves as more custodial in their pupil control ideology as they gain teaching experience . It may be that the teacher may develop a complimentary, rather than a reciprocal role for himself, if the school administration does not provide properly trained counselors and other personnel to work with students that have deviant behavior problems .

The data indicated an inability to predict the dependent variable pupil control ideology based on the independent variable of teachers' perceptions of the administrator's control style .

The supportive teacher could provide alternative techniques and approaches to the teaching in meeting the needs of their problem students and students would have counselors available to aid in their problem . In fact we see this supportive program as an alternative program to a basic education program that many schools have developed to serve students who are potential drop outs or are attendance problems . Thes . classes many times turn out to be baby sitting jobs with high attendance problems with the stigma attached to the students as being hopeless and stupid . These students could be placed in the regular curriculum if the teachers could have available to them a supportive program to help handle and cope with the very difficult student . The stigma of the basic education as being a dumping place for hopeless students could then be eliminated . The counseling staff could recommend to the administration that they should provide a crisis teacher whose role would be to observe disruptive students in the classroom and work with these students in his classroom until the students and teachers felt they could return to the normal classroom . The counseling staff could reccrnend to the administration a half-way house to be developed for students who cannot function in the regular class- room . These students would attend the half-way house for a half day in a home learning environment for their basic subjects with special trained teachers in small student groups .

The findings also support the notion of a \"spread of affect\" during game sessions where fluctuations in heart-rates followed each other several times throughout the game sessions . This finding in itself should be of interest to people studying small group processes because it provides a covert indicator of the emotional reaction of several subjects within identical environments . Research and theory in attitude and attitude change has risen sharply lately [see , Beliefs, Attitudes, and Values by Rokeach (1970) ; Attitude, Change by Kiesler, Collins, and Miller (1969) ; Psychological Foundations of Attitudes by Greenwald, Brock, and Ostrom (19681 . Rokeach (1971) notes that \" . . . the main theoretical focus of contemporary social psychology is on the concept of attitude and on theories of attitude change .\" He also notes that a necessary prerequisite for attitude change is a state of inconsistency . inconsistency can be created in an individual by two methods : (1) to induce a person to engage in behavior that is incompatible with his attitudes and values, or (2) expose him to information about the atti- tudes or values of significant others that are incompatible with his own attitudes and values . DISCUSSION The present study was purely exploratory and as such should be interpreted with due caution . The findings suggest that gross mea- sures of arousal or involvement in simulation games are related to atti- tude change but that the complexity of the relationship calls for more individual In addition, a state of"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The experience of an individual in a simulation designed to expose players to what it really is like in inner-cities, namely the game of Ghetto (1970), fulfills the above experimental situations required for attitude change under two conditions : (1) when the player's attitudes and values are not compatible with his experience in the simulation ; (2) when the player believes that the information he receives during the simulation was developed by known authorities in the field . These two approaches are the classical ways of inducing attitude change . Changes in attitudes from playing simulation games nay be interpreted within this theoretical frame- work . It should be added that the approach requires no assumption as to the affective impact of the simulation experience on the participants . In fact, attitudes and values in Rokeach's scheme are conditions that are related to the \"self .\" The affective aspect of Rokeach's theory lies in the satisfaction or dissatisfaction the \"self\" experiences in a particular situation . For example : X - self ;Y - one's perceived performance or be- havior in whatever the situation . \" X and Y are dissonant with one another if the person's behavior in any given situation leads him to become dissa- tisfied with himself ; X and y are consonant if his behavior in a given situation leads him to remain satisfied with himself .\" Thus, the cognitive aspects of attitudes are intimately related to a person's feelings (affec- tive component) about himself in particular situations . The complexity of a simulation game is brought to light when the role playing aspects are noted . For instance, how would Rokeach handle the problem of \"self\" when the individual technically becomes another \"self\" in a role-playing environment? 45 52"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Greenwald (1969, 1970) may provide a partial answer to the latter quee- tion . As noted previously, Greenwald (1970) believes that \" . . . attitude change through role playing may depend on the role player's having as oppor- tunity to consider counterattitudinal information that he has not previ~ly to rejected . McLaughlin (1971) noted that 11 \t . Greenwald concluded that it is not so much learning the contents of the communication that attests subsequent attitude change as the learning of self-generated eosnitivs reactions . The effectiveness of the communication appears to be sipnifteaetly related to the retention of issue-related cognition not contained is the communication itself but aroused and rehearsed by the recipient at the t1se of the,' communication .\" Thus, arousal and satisfaction with one's sscperiasee are related to modifications in cognitions and attitudes as suggested AM* by Rokeach (1971) and Greenwald (1970) . The present study represents a preliminary attempt to relate the affective aspects of particular amp tees . directly to attitude change thereof .

It is one of several social simulation games developed by the Hopkins group . They are games \" . . . in which certain social pro- cesses are explicitly mirrored in the structure and functioning of the game . The game is a kind of abstraction of these social processes, making explicit certain of them that are ordinarily implicit in our everyday be- havior . A social simulation game always consists of a player or players acting in a social environment . There are two ways in which the social environment is incorporated into a game's structure : (1) each player can act as a portion of the social environment of each other player ; (2) the rules of the game may contain contingent responses of the environment .\" (From Coleman, 1968 .)

The major asset of using a simulated environment for psychosocial or psychobiological research is the control one has over both of the determining conditions put forth by Lazarus, Averill, and Opton (in Arnold, 1970) . Dispositional conditions can be controlled experimentally by selecting subjects with similar or dissimilar psychophysiological charac- teristics depending on the effect desired . Situational conditions can be effected by simple modifications of the structural properties of the simulated environment under study . - flood was assessed with the Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL) developed by Nowlis (in Arnold, 1970) ."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"4$ References Abelson, Robert P . \"Simulation of Social Behavior .\" In Handbook of Social Psychology .

The Center works through five programs to achieve its objectives . The Academic Games program has developed simulation games for use in the classroom, and is studying the processes through which games teach and evaluating the effects of games on student learning . The Social Accounts program is examining how a student's education affects his actual occupational attainment, and how education results in different vocational outcomes for blacks and whites . The Talents and Competencies program is studying the effects of educational experience on a wide range of human talents, competencies and personal disposi- tions, in order to formulate--and research--important educational goals other than traditional academic achievement . The School Organi- zation program is currently concerned with the effect of student par- ticipation in social and educational decision making, the structure of competition and cooperation, formal reward systems, ability-grouping in schools, and effects of school quality . The Careers and Curricula pro- gram bases its work upon a theory of career development . It has devel- oped a self-administered vocational guidance device to promote vocational development and to foster satisfying curricular decisions for high school, college, and adult populations . This report, prepared by the Academic Games program, explores the use of physiological and behavioral indices of arousal and mood during performance in a simulation game . The results, with those of further controlled experimentation, may provide guidelines for the optimum use of social simulation games in the classroom . ii 4"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"I thank Gail M .

This im- plies a close relationship between the cognitive and affective com- ponents of learning situations . Their interaction may result in subsequent behavioral change which can be studied immediately after a gaming exercise or after traditional approaches to teaching . The importance of a student's involvement in the learning situa- tion to the solidification of factual knowledge or skills may not be apparent immediately following game play . However, if a gaming ap- proach were compared three months later to a traditional classroom approach (across the same content domain), the simulated exercise might be seen to produce longer lasting changes in knowledge and atti- tudes . Could longer lasting behavioral changes be a function of the greater involvement experienced in a simulation game? Answering this question requires some knowledge of the relationship between involve- ment and learning or attitude change during simulated exercises . The present study deals directly with this relationship . In general, the importance of feeling (mood), emotion, cognition, and affect has been only recently emphasized . (See ,Feelings and Emotions 8"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"by Magda Arnold, 1970 ; , Physiological Correlates of Emotion by Perry Black, 1970 ; Cognition and Affect by John Antrobus, 1970 ; Fantasy and Feeling in Education, by Richard Jones, 1968 .) Usually, research procedures in this area rely heavily on subjective measures of cognition and affect . When physiological parameters are included as objective measures of affect, they are usually recorded from one individual in highly controlled (and sometimes contrived) situations . Seldom are overt and covert measures of affect recorded on several individuals simultaneously, as is done in this study . Some interesting theoretical relationships between cognition and affect (which may have theoretical implications for the present study) have been proposed recently . Lazarus, Averill, and Opton (in Arnold, 1970) have proposed a cognitivt,theory of emotion . They suggest that emotions be considered as complex response syndromes which can be characterized from three perspectives : (a) biological, (b) cultural, and (c) cognitive . They regard individuals as \"evaluating organisms .\" Each person's evalua- tions are based on cognitive activity which can have an associated emo- tion . These authors also note-that the determining conditions of these cognitions are of two types (1) situational (referring to environmental factors), and (2) dispositional (referring to the psychological make-up of an individual) . 2 Both of these conditions are very much a part of instructional simulations . The essence of simulation gapes is to cap- ture (via structured situations) the psychological and environmental de- terminants of particular cognitions . This cognitive theory of emotion parallels our concerns in the present study (i .e . attitude modification, mood, arousal, generalization of affect) ."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Affective experience has been tricotomized by Ewert (in Arnold, 1970) as follows : (a) moods, (b) feelings, and (c) emotions . Ewert suggested that feelings and emotions could be regulated biologically and socially, respectively . Ewert also equated emotions with attitudes towards one's social environment (this general conceptual framework has been related to instructional simulations by Kidder, 1970a, 1970b) . Thus, there may be a relationship, as this study hypothesizes, between the emotional impact of a simulation on the participants and a resulting attitude change . The measurement approach to attitude change used in this study is based in Fishbein and Raven (in Fishbein, 1967) . Fishbein and Raven hypothesized that attitudes have both belief and affective components . In addition, Anderson and Fishbein (in Fishbein, 1967) note that an \" . . . attitude toward the [an) object is predicted to be a part func- tion of the total affect associated with each of the beliefs about the object .\" The theory of Rosenberg (in Fishbein, 1967) is closely related to this approach . In fact, Rosenberg equates attitudes and beliefs with affective responses : \" . . . attitude (here defined as relatively stable affective responses to an object) .\" This hypothesis is nearly synonomous with that proposed by Ewert, above . The theoretical basis of the present study is related to the work of Triandis (1971), Triandis and Malpass (1970) and Greenwald (1969, 1970) . The behavior of an individual participating in a simulation game has ob- vious cognitive and affective components, plus simulated realizations of behavioral intentions . These components are incorporated in a theory of 3 10"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"interpersonal attitudes (a cornerstone of social simulations) proposed and amplified by Triandis (1967, 1970) . In addition, Triandis and Mal- pass (1970) note that measurement procedures are available for evalua- ting interpersonal attitudes \" . . . by examining the cognitive compon- ent by means of logical tasks such as the antecedent-consequent method, the affective component by means of Osgood's semantic differential (Os- good, Suci, and Tannenbaum, 1957) and the behavioral intentions by means of the behavioral differential (Triandis, 1964) .\" The affective and belief components of selected attitudes were evaluated in the present study . The theoretical relationship between the present study and those conducted by Greenwald (1969, 1970) is found in the structured role- playing of participants in social simulations and the information they are exposed to . In the game Ghetto (1970), players (when white, middle- class, and relatively naive) are usually exposed to counterattitudinal information or information opposing their own perceptions . With this in mind, the relationship between role-playing in simulation games and result- ing attitude change can be interpreted within Greenwald's \"amended learn- ing model of persuasion\" as clarified by the following excerpts from his works : It was concluded that the effectiveness of role playing in inducing opinion change may be due in large part to its success in getting subjects to evaluate information opposing their own position in unbiased fashion . (Greenwald, 1969) 4 11"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"(2) These results were interpreted in terms of an associative model of persuasion, and it was concluded that attitude change through role playing may depend on the role player's having an opportunity to consider counterattitudinal information that he has not previously rejected . (Greenwald, 1970) Thus, attitude change may result from modifications of the cogni- tive (Greenwald ; Triandis) and/or affective components (Triandis ; Rosenberg ; Fishbein and Raven ; Ewert ; Lazarus, et al .) of the original attitude . The major hypotheses of the present study are : (1) There will be atti- tude change following participation in the social simulation game, Ghetto . (2) This change in attitude will be related to the player's emotional involve- ment in the game as measured by heart-rate and self-reported mood . (3) There will be a \"spread of affect\" at times during the game,meaning that one sub- ject's excitement may excite another, causing positive correlations between the subject's heart-rates during the game . To provide preliminary support for these hypotheses, the following meas- ures were taken on participants in the social simulation game Ghetto (1970) : (1) heart-rate in beats per minute as a covert measure of affect or involve- ment ; (2) self-report measures of mood 3 at the beginning, during, and at the end of the simulation experience, to provide a second indication of involve- ment ; (3) observations of each subjects' mood at the beginning, during, and after the game to provide a third measure of involvement in the game ; (4) self-report measures of attitudes (before and after the game) whose factual characteristics are manipulated in the simulation game so that a participant is exposed, in an unthreatening environment, to information and situations counter to the participants' original conceptions of that same environment ."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"METHOD Due to the complexities of recording physiological parameters from four individuals simultaneously during performance in the simulation, the saaple'was quite small .

Heart rate was monitored on four subjects during each session . A Narco Eio-Systems Physiograph g ,Six was used for recording purposes . Hardwire recordings were taken from three subjects, the wires leading under large, closed doors immediately behind the subjects . Telemetric recording was taken from one subject in each game session . Surface electrodes were used on all Ss . The two recording electrodes were attached to the upper distal surface of each subject's arm . The reference electrode was attached to the proximal surface of the left forearm . No reference electrode was necessary on the telemetered subject ."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Baseline data were obtained from each subject . Then each was required to complete two pre-tests, one on attitudes and beliefs toward ghetto people (sae Appendix A, Instrument I), and a second on the consequences of living in a ghetto (see Appendix A, Instrument II) . The heart rate was recorded from four subjects simultaneously for 88 minutes during game one, 125 minutes during games two and three . Due to the lag between the base rate recordings and the \"Introduction\" to the game, and based on the fact that arousal and involvement during the game were of primary interest, the four simultaneous heart-rate recordings from the middle of the Introduction to each game through the post tests are reported . While recording the heart-rates of the individual subjects, two measures of mood or involvement were taken . Both measures were based on the Mood Adjective . Check List developed by Nowlis (1970) . One was in self-report form :, (see Appendix B, Instrument I) ; the other (see Appendix B, Instrument II) was completed on each subject by the person conducting the game . The self reports and observations on mood or general affect were completed three times during each game : (1) immediately following the introduction to the game ; (2) approx- imately mid-way through the game ; and ;3) after the game was terminated (but before the post-test instruments were completed) . Variables The dependent variables of interest in the present study were : (1) heart rate on each subject throughout the game experience as a measure of general involvement ; (2) scores on an instrument dealing with beliefs and attitudes toward ghetto people ; (3) scores on an instrument dealing with the consequences"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"of living in a ghetto ; (4) scores on the Mood Adjecitve Check List (MACL) completed three times by each game participant ; (5) scores on the Modified Check List (MCL) completed by the game leader three times on each subject during game play . The belief and attitude instrument (see Appendix A, Instrument I) is based on the form and theory originally suggested by Fishbein and Raven (1967) . This approach is based on the measures of attitude suggested by Osgood at al . (1957) . Fishbein and Raven (1967) modified the approach somewhat bar including belief in the concept being rated along with the evaluative dimensions (positive or negative affect) of the concept . The form of the items on this instrument is provided in the following example : Ghetto people are honest . true - \t false impossible \t possible probable \t improbable Being honest is : bad \t good harmful \t beneficial wise \t foolish The dependent measures of interest then were the sum across the three seven-point scales on the belief component and the sum across the three se- ven-point scales for the affective component . These two sums on each con- cept were calculated for each subject before and after the game experience . 8"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"An attempt was made to, factor analyse the scales on the instrument designed to tap the cognitive aspects of attitude toward ghetto people in order to develop sub-test scores within the instrument . Unfortunately, there were too many scales and too few subjects to validate the obtained factor structure . Thus, scores from this instrument were not used in subsequent analyses . The Mood Adjective Check List completed by each subject and recorded by the game leader was obtained on the participants in the last two game sessions only . The instrument (see Appendix B) was based on those de- veloped by Nowlis (1970) . Each subject was simply asked to circle his choice on the following scale : angry \t vv v ? no where vv means you definitely feel this way at the moment v_ means you feel slightly this way at the moment ? means you cannot decide whether you feel this way or not no means you are definitely not feeling this way at the moment From these self-report measures taken by each subject at the beginning, middle, and end of the game, eleven factor scores were derived from the sums across particular adjectives checked . For instance, on each MACL, the symbols vv, v, ?, no are valued 3, 2, 1, 0, respectively . Then the values associated with particular adjectives (see below) were suumned to provide mood factor scores .

Each game was artificially tricotomized in order to provide better understanding of each game in progress . This was especially important with the heart-rate data because an attempt could then be made to find out if the involvement experienced by one player generalized more consistently during a particular portion of the game experience . A study was then made of the intercorrela- tions of heart-rate variability, mood indicators, and the affective compon- ents of attitude change scores in an attempt to validate some aspects of the study's original hypotheses .

This is a continuation of Graph 2, period 2 . One will notice that subject two maintains his high variability while subjects one and three maintain quite low variability and have begun \"fol- lowing\" each other . In fact subject three's affective response as re- flected in his heart-rate seems \"conditioned\" by subject one's responses . Subject three's heart-rate at times parallels subject one's, with a time lag of about two minutes .
