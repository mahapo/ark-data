[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Chronological History: The New World Order by D.L. Cuddy, Ph.D In the mainline media, those who adhere to the position that there is some kind of \"conspiracy\" pushing us towards a world government are virulently ridiculed. The standard attack maintains that the so-called \"New World Order\" is the product of turn-of-the-century, right-wing, bigoted, anti-semitic racists acting in the tradition of the long-debunked Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , now promulgated by some Militias and other right-wing hate groups. The historical record does not support that position to any large degree but it has become the mantra of the socialist left and their cronies, the media. The term \"New World Order\" has been used thousands of times in this century by proponents in high places of federalized world government. So me of those involved in this collaboration to achieve world order have been Jewish. The preponderance are not, so it most definitely is not a Jewish agenda. For years, leaders in education, industry, the media, banking, etc., have promoted those with the same Weltanschauung (world view) as theirs. Of course, someone might say that just because individuals promote their friends doesn't constitute a conspiracy. That's true in the usual sense. However, it does represent an \"open conspiracy,\" as described by noted Fabian Socialist H.G. Wells in The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution (1928). In 1913, prior to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act President Wilson's The New Freedom was published, in which he revealed: \"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U. S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" On November 21, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt wrote a letter to Col. Edward Mandell House, President Woodrow Wilson's close advisor: \"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government every since the days of Andrew Jackson...\" That there is such a thing as a cabal of power brokers who control government behind the scenes has been detailed several times in this ce ntury by credible sources. Professor Carroll Quigley was Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown University. President Clinton has publicly paid homage to the influence Professor Quigley had on his life. In Quigley's magnum opus Tragedy and Hope (1966), he states:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"There does exist and has existed for a generation, an international...network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies...but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.\" Even talk show host Rush Limbaugh, an outspoken critic of anyone claiming a push for global government, said on his February 7, 1995 program: \"You see, if you amount to anything in Washington these days, it is because you have been plucked or handpicked from an Ivy League school -- Harvard, Yale, Kennedy School of Government -- yo u've shown an aptitude to be a good Ivy League type, and so you're plucke d so-to-speak, and you are assigned success. You are assigned a certain role in government somewhere, and then your success is monitored and tracked, and you go where the pluckers and the handpickers can put you.\" On May 4, 1993, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) president Leslie Gelb said on The Charlie Rose Show that: \"...you [Charlie Rose] had me on [before] to talk about the New World Order! I talk about it all the time. It's one world now. The Council [CFR] can find, nurture, and begin to put people in the kinds of jobs this country needs. And that's going to be one of the major enterprises of the Council under me.\" Previous CFR chairman, John J. McCloy (1953-70) , actually said they have been doing this since the 1940s (and before). The thrust towards global government can be well-documented but at the end of the twentieth century it does not look like a traditional conspiracy in the usual sense of a secret cabal of evil men meeting clandestinely behind closed doors. Rather, it is a \"networking\" of like-minded individuals in high places to achieve a common goal, as described in Marilyn Ferguson's 1980 insider classic, The Aquarian Conspiracy . Perhaps the best way to relate this would be a brief history of the New World Order, not in our words but in the words of those who have been striving to make it real. 1912 -- Colonel Edward M. House, a close advisor of President Woodrow Wilson, publishes Phillip Dru: Administrator in which he promotes \"socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx.\" 1913 -- The Federal Reserve (neither federal nor a reserve) is created.

Author Philip Kerr, states: \"Obviously there is going to be no peace or prosperity for mankind as long as [the earth] remains divided into 50 or 60 independent states until some kind of international system is created...The real problem today is that of the world government.\" 1928 -- The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution by H.G. Well is published. A former Fabian Socialist, Wells writes: \"The political world of the into a Op en Conspiracy must weaken, efface, incorporate and supersede existing governments...The Open Conspiracy is the natural inheritor of socialist and communist enthusiasms; it may be in control of Moscow before it is in control of New York...The character of the Open Conspiracy will now be plainly displayed...It will be a world religion.\" 1931 -- Students at the Lenin School of Political Warfare in Moscow are taught: \"One day we shall start to spread the most theatrical peace movement the world has ever seen.

Co-author John Dewey, the noted philosopher and educator, calls for a synthesizing of all religions and \"a socialized and cooperative economic order.\" Co-signer C.F. Potter said in 1930: \"Education is thus a most powerful ally of humanism, and every American public school is a school of humanism. What can the theistic Sunday schools, meeting for an hour once a week, teaching only a fraction of the children, do to stem the tide of a five-day program of humanistic teaching? 1933 -- The Shape of Things to Come by H.G. Wells is published. Wells predicts a second world war around 1940, originating from a Germ an-Polish dispute. After 1945 there would be an increasing lack of public safety in \"crimi nally infected\" areas. The plan for the \"Modern World-State\" would succeed on its third attempt (about 1980), and come out of something that occurred in Basra, Iraq. The book also states, \"Although world government had been plainly coming for some years, although it had been endlessly feared and murmured against, it found no opposition prepared anywhere.\" 1934 -- The Externalization of the Hierarchy by Alice A. Bailey is published. Bailey is an occultist, whose works are channeled from a spirit guide, the Tibetan Master [demon spirit] Djwahl Kuhl. Bailey uses the phrase \"points of light\" in connection with a \"New Group of World Servers\" and claims that 1934 marks the begi nning of \"the organizing of the men and women...group work of a new order...[with] progress defined by service...the world of the Brotherhood...the Forces of Light...[and] out of the spoliation of all existing culture and civilization, the new world order must be built.\" The book is published by the Lucis Trust, incorporated originally in New York as the Lucifer Publishing Company. Lucis Trust is a United Nations NGO and has been a major player at the recent U.N. summits. Later Assistant Secretar y General of the U.N. Robert Mueller would credit the creation of his World Core Curriculum for education to the underlying teachings of Djwahl Kuhl via Alice Bailey's writings on the subject. 1932 -- Plan for Peace by American Birth Control League founder Margaret Sanger (1921) is published.

July, 1948 -- Britain's Sir Harold Butler, in the CFR's Foreign Affairs , sees \"a New World Order\" taking shape: \"How far can the life of nations, which for centuries have thought of themselves as distinct and unique, be merged with the life of other nations?
