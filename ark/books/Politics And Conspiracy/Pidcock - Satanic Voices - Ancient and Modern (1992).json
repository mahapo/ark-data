Nevertheless they deserve rec ognition. Nesta H. Webster deserves a very special mention. Her courage in taking on the occul t ‘Establishment’ is an inspiration to us all. Other sources are provided in the bibliography, and the rest mentioned in passing. Some important contributors do not appear in this partic ular work, and warrant an entire book dedicated to them, and their selfless dedication to justice a nd the establishment of a benevolent system of government. Foremost among these is Abraham Lincoln whose 1864 ‘Islamic’ monetary policy caused him to be assassinated, by the owners of the ‘Satanic Purses’ . For his tireless efforts in trying to expose the co rruption and instutionalised fraud in our occult banking and judicial system, a special thank you go es to John Derek Pett, co-founder of The National Association for Victims of fraud and Banki ng Malpractice; along with Mr and Mrs Alfred Cullinane, Paul Jenkins, Robert Owen, J.

The choice of Satanic Voices for the main title rel ates to the voices of anarchy, blasphemy and dissent that have been audibly polluting our enviro nment throughout history. In modern Rushdie’s Satanic Verses serve as an adequate illus tration. In Old Testament the Satanic Voice of Corah, the subversive financier, is raised loudly i n opposition to Moses and The Ten Commandments; pre and post-Flood examples also exis t in the “authorised Apocrypha”, to say nothing of the “unauthorized versions”, particularl y the Gospel of Barnabas, together with the Nag Hammadi Codices and the Dead Sea Scrolls. And o f course, last but not least, the Holy Qur’an. The ideas behind these Voices of Satanic di ssent and anarchy have been described along with atheism, blasphemy and revolution as:- “ The o pium of intellectuals”. We must now also add financiers and bankers to the list of addicts. THE RUSHDIE REPORT The Rushdie report was commissioned by the Islamic Party of Britain in order to obtain a clinical view of Rushdie’s mental state, following the Radio 4 announcement by Marjorie Wallace of S.A.N.E. - Schizoprenia A National Emergency - that Rushdie’s Satanic Verses contained the best descriptions of someone undergoing Psychotic S chizophrenic Breakdown that she had ever read. When speaking to a member of the Islamic Part y, she said that it had not been her intention to imply that Salman Rushdie was suffering from sch izophrenia, but when pressed she said, “...neither can I state categorically that he is no t.” The Qur’an is its own best defence, but because of our impatience we lack wisdom, allowing hope to overcome experience, following those who pr omote themselves at the expense of Islam. The fact that the former leader of the Bradford Cou ncil of Mosques stated that he didn’t want the Rushdie issue solving until the government gave in to their other demands, is a good example of ignorance in action. Former British diplomat Hasan Gai Eaton said, that while Muslims will sagely nod in agreement when you state that ignoran ce, hypocrisy and fanaticism do exist in the Muslim world, they usually assume that they themsel ves are not guilty. The fanatical book burning scenes in Bradford should be interpreted as the signs of repressed doubt. As C.G. Jung stated in his Tavistock Lectures : “Fanaticism is always a sign of repressed doubt. Yo u can study the history of the Church. Always in those Verdana when the Church begins to w aver, the style becomes fanatical, or fanatical sects spring up because the secret dou bt has to be quenched...” A SURFEEIT OF BLASPHEMY The Blasphemy Industry, like some other branches of the news media, rely heavily on book banning in order to stimulate the circulation of th eir bread and butter through adverse publicity. Peter Wright and the Spy Catcher affair highlight t he effects “Banning” has on sales demand. The primary objective of advertising is to first create the demand through publicity and then saturate the market."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"There are much earlier examples of Satanic Verses. “Oulanem ” by Karl Marx , for example, is a most revealing work. His father wrote to him saying that he did not know if the spirit that was driving his son was Angelic or Faustian . Edgar Marx , who died at 8, wrote to his father addressing him as “ My dear Devil ”. Nietzsche, Bukharin, Proudhon, Aleister Crowley & the Maquis d e’Sade all wrote in the same Demonic style . It is not surprising to learn that Stalin’s pseud onym was in fact “Demonshwile”, meaning Demoniac. FROM EDIFICE COMPLEX TO OCCULT THEOCRACY This section deals with members of Secret Societies and Subversive Movements who over the centuries have acted as Judas Goats to many of our leaders and potential leaders who wittingly or otherwise have betrayed the interests of their coun try and its people for financial institutions and personal advancement. For example, a recent Swiss P ublication [ Memopress, Ausgabe D , 4/1991] stated that Shadow Chancellor John Smith and Labour Party Spokesman Gordon Brown were among the guests at the Super Masonic One Worl d Government Bilderberger Conference held at Baden-Baden in Germany between J une 6 and 9th 1991 . Permanent members are people like Banker Lord Roll of S.G. Warburg & Co Ltd. On page 25 of ‘ The Global Manipulators’ Robert Eringer wrote in 1980: “Every British Prime Minister of the past 30 years has attended Bilderberg, so have Lord Carington, Davd Owen and Sir Keith Joseph . Dennis Healey was a regular attender of Bilderberg and was on the Steering Committee long before he b ecame Chancellor.” Apparently Oswald Spengler was perfectly correct when he said in his monument al ‘ Decline of the West’ (1918-1922): “ There is no proletarian, not even a Communist mov ement which does not operate in the interests of money, or move in a direction other th an the one indicated to it by money, or exist longer than the time permitted to it by money , and without the idealists among its leadership having the slightest notion of that fact .” JERUSALEM AND THE EDIFICE COMPLEX, JABULON AND OCCULT THEOCRACY The purpose of this section is to show how and why Palestine and the Temple site in Jerusalem were so important in the plans to create a World Su per Government run from Jerusalem in an enlarged State of Israel, extending from the Nile i n the West; to the Euphrates in the East . Freemasons of all ranks and degrees have been duped into working towards this goal in the belief that it is sanctioned with divine authority. Nothin g could be further from the truth. According to the Regus Manuscript and the Halliwell poem at The Grand Lodge of England the original spiritual home of Freemasonry was, until the early part of the 19th century , the Tower of Babel not the Temple at Jerusalem , and its first Grand Master was its builder Nimrod - God’s enemy, and definitely not King Solomon. The Zionists knew that Christians and Orthdox Jews would never support a movement that held Nimrod and the Tower of Babel in such high regard, so through the age old process which I call"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Generic Engineering they switched all the names and thus disguised thei r real intention , which was to expel the true believers in the God of Chris t, Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes of Israel by installing the forces of Anti-God and Anti-Christ in their place. This new greater Israel includes Jordan, Egypt, the Northern part of Saudi Arabia including Medina (but excluding Mecca), Kuwait, Iraq and Turk ey . Turkey was the first domino to fall in 1908, Saudi Arabia in 1915, Palestine 1948, Egypt at Camp David; the Gulf War has almost completed the circle. By using the United States ‘F reedom from War policy 7277’[The Rockefeller File, page 88-89], George Bush has fool ishly tried to enforce Isaiah 2: 3-4 without the necessary justice or mercy. The United Nations is the Super Government mentione d by master strategist Theodor Herzl and embodied in his notorious Master Plan drawn from Ma cchiavelli, The Talmud and Satanic Archives from the Luciferian Masonic Brotherhood: T he Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion - which in reality are only a dramatized version of his personal diaries and plagiarisms. The Edifice now under construction is the culminati on of efforts by successive generations of materialist Jews, Gentiles, Arabs, and Persians ali ke. Hamdan Karmath and Abdullah Ibn Maymun , for example, whose disciples have for centuries bee n working towards the construction of a New Tower of Babel on the site where the Proph et Solomon built the first Temple : the site of the second temple from which Jesus evicted the Mone y Changers and the site from where the Prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven. All opposition within the Islamic world towards thi s creeping annexation of Holy Land for unholy purposes was effectively removed when the We st literally blinded the Muslims with their own science and technology. This technology, which was in fact based on their own scientific legacy to the West, had the devastating effect of c reating the greatest threat to all systems of belief - “doubt”. The Prophet Muhammad had warned his followers that this pernicious doubt would affect them when they allowed themselves to be dominated by a W estern people professing to be followers of Christ on the one hand, but being in fact the great est liars the world has ever seen; followers of Anti-Christ or “Dajjal”, as the false prophet is ca lled in Arabic. This doubt, which almost proved terminal, and from which the Islamic World is only just beginning to emerge after 500 years, would not have had such lasting effects, had the West shown the same degree of gratitude to the Arabs as the Ar abs had shown towards the Chinese and the Greeks when recording their contribution towards Is lamic science. Under Islamic thinking science developed to reveal the existence of God. I n contrast, the learning of the academics and scientists of the West was intended for purely mate rial advancement and secular worldly power which, when combined with their false evidence and assumptions, seemed to establish conclusively that there was and is no God. Selective integrity is prevalent in the West and pe culiar to the Western mind. It will resort at Verdanato falsifying evidence, like the case of Sir Arthur Keith , the ‘Piltdown Faker’, “Who perceived that the only way he could become Br itain’s most eminent anthropologist was to concoct false evidence to pro ve his unfashionable scientific theories” [ Sunday Verdana 23/9/90]."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"If not, then the self-doubt within the Islamic worl d would have been short lived. However, one must remember the second rule and prevailing sentim ent of the Western academic who, like the Western diplomat, is often sent abroad to lie for h is country: “Never give the suckers an even break”. To counter this attack, the Muslims developed an os trich-like approach, burying their heads in the sand, pretending that it wasn’t really happening to them; forgetting that they, like the Children of Israel before them, were being tested by Islam’s ol d enemy - Pagan Rome -, but this time from the old empire’s most northerly outpost - Britain. Modern Muslims adopted the famous Saudi I.B.M. posi tion called Kismet-compatible; that is, when facing a problem that needs physical effort, t he only thing we can do or say is: I.B.M., which stands for In-sha’Allah: meaning it will only happen if God wills it; Bukra: meaning tomorrow something may turn up, but don’t hold your breath; and Ma-lish or Mish Mish: never in a month of Sundays, or when the Apricot blooms, whi ch is once every 75 years. Nontheless, some Afghan Mujahideen have shown how to stand and defend the honor of Islam and in so doing have earned the respect of the British and th e Russian Army - twin branches of the Gog- MaGog family axis. SATANIC PURSES To all but the most hardened atheist, freemason, or Zionist the evidence provided in this book shows beyond reasonable doubt, that the English, French, and Bolshevik Revolutions were all planned and financed by the same groups, i.e. banke rs, lawyers and establishment freemasons working in concert to bring about conditions favour able to their aims and objectives . Karls Marx mentions this in his political writings on the clas s struggles in France (1848-1850). He says: “After the July revolution [of 1830], as the libera l banker Lafitte was escorting his accomplice, the Duke of Orleans , in triumph to the Hotel de Ville, he let slip the remark: ‘ Henceforth the bankers will be in control .’ Lafitte had betrayed the secret of the revolution.” The same applies to the American Civil War, the two World Wars, the Cold War, and the Gulf War; all waged for a hidden agenda. This is however , as we will see, not a new phenomenon, it has just become more widely spread and better orche strated than at any other time in history. IS JEHOVAH JAH-BAL-ON THE DEVIL IN DISGUISE? Many well researched books have been written by Wes tern writers and journalists exposing the secrets of Freemasonry, but to my knowledge none ha ve attempted to seriously use material from Islamic sources in order to reach a better understa nding of the subject; out of fear, one suspects, that it might also provoke serious interest in Isla m as a viable alternative to the world’s problems. The Qur’an points out the dangers posed by secret s ocieties, in particular Masonic type brotherhoods who opposed practically every Prophet, and clearly condemns their practice of invoking help from the devil in their rituals, like the brotherhood of 9 who conspired to commit murder and perjury amongst the people of Thamud. The Royal Arch Degree actually invokes the devil in its rituals which consist of 9 men in groups of 3 incanting the ancient name of Satan in disguise : Jehovah Jah-Baal-On : The large phallic obelisk at ancient ON was calle d God, the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"father, by the priests of On. The Washington Monument is a much larger replica of that Satanic obelisk erected by Priapic Senuseret 1st at ancient On . Hence the term “ The great Satan” comes from this symbol. Therefore, contrary to the claim of Commander Micha el Bernard Shepley Higham RN, Grand Secretary of The United Grand Lodge of England, tha t Freemasonry is only an adjunct to religion, all those initiated into the higher degre es between the 30th and the 33rd know that they are in fact the world’s greatest society dedicated to the preservation of the Satanic Faith with its Luciferian Doctrine. JUDAISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM This is without doubt the most difficult subject to deal with, because of the litigious hypersensitive nature of one allegedly Semitic grou p who still believe that they meet the specification, which at one time qualified them to be considered as God’s Chosen People. Chosen to convey the Good News to all mankind, not to make it an exclusive club. They are a people currently preoccupied with the la test Holocaust they have had to face, a people who do not welcome any objective investigation into its real causes or the clear prophecies which relate to them, out of the fear that this might dev alue its currency value. The ‘Jewish Chronicle’ of April 3rd 1992 did just that by reporting the nu mbers killed at Auschwitz as being 1 1/2 million, not the 4 million originally claimed. It is beyond question that The Children of Israel w ere for a while chosen above all other nations by Almighty God. However, this was always condition al upon them upholding not only the letter of the Law but also the spirit of the everlasting c ovenant between Abraham and Almighty God. The renewal of this Covenant was made on Mount Sina i during the Exodus, between Moses, Aaron, the Elders of the twelve tribes of Israel an d the Almighty God of all Semitic peoples, Ellah or Allah. Remember Moses had to relearn his r eligion from his Arab father-in-law Jethroe, the Sheikh of Midian, whom Aaron and the Elders ack nowledged when they accepted him as their equal and his sacrifice to their Lord, having first kissed him and paid homage to him. [cf. Exodus 18:1-27] As stated elsewhere, it is very important to rememb er that the official religion of The Children of Israel was not Judaism, this being a much later dev elopment which related purely to the desire of the tribe of Judah to emerge as top nation and spir itual leaders of the first Islamic nation - Israel -, contrary to the Mosaic Law. The Law given to Moses was that the High Priests of Israel were all to be from the tribe of Levi, not Judah. Therefore Judaism would not have been th e name given to the religion by Moses. If a tribal name had been intended it would surely have been the tribe of Levi and Leviism, and not Judah and Judaism as we have been led to believe. The right to Levitical Priesthood could only be inherited from the tribe of Levi in the line of Amr an or Imran, as is confirmed in the Qur’an [ 3:33-37 ]. This posed a big problem for the early Christian Je ws, like Paul who was in charge of damage control for the Temple Elders and their masters, th e Money Changers . His task was to usurp the authority of Christ’s real disciples, like Barnabas the Levite , by successfully supplanting their true authentic monotheistic Testaments with his own brand of Greco-Roman polytheism ."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews in the Scofield Refer ence Bible states [whether written by Paul or another, the point of view is Pauline]: “We undoubtedly have here the method of Paul’s syna gogue address”, and “No book of Scripture more fully authenticates itself as inspir ed.” – Inspired indeed, but by what spirit? In Hebrews 5:1 , Paul begins his subversive attack on the Levitical Priesthood , casting doubt on the House of Levi in favour of the house of Judah, attempting to undermine the divine right and authority vested in the Levite family of Amran/Imra n, whose offspring include Moses, God’s Messenger; Aaron, Israel’s High Priest; Mary, the m other of Jesus, and Elizabeth, her cousin, who were of the daughters of Aaron, i.e. Levites (c f. Luke 1:5). Pat Boon, the American singer and evangelist, said there are two kinds of Judaism, one Orthodox and the other Christian. In other words, Christiani ty is Judaism with the ethics and sentiments intact. In trying to sell the idea of a ‘New Jewish Covenant’ to the more Orthodox sects, it was necessary for Paul and others to fabricate plausibl e stories and arguments in order to hijack control of the Priesthood through which he could th en propagate his heretical polytheistic ideas. In Hebrews 7 , the author uses the story of Abraham’s meeting wi th Melchisedec, the King of Salem, together with the fact that he blessed him a nd gave him one tenth of the spoils, indicating that the everlasting Covenant between God and Abrah am was in fact only a temporary one, subject to cancellation. It states: “Now consider how great this man was, unto whom eve n the Patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And verily they that are of th e sons of Levi, who received the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes o f the people according to the law, that is, of their bretheren, though they come out o f the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes fr om Abraham ... As I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham . For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. If therefore perf ection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the la w), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melch isedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there i s made of necessity a change also of the Law.” “For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe (Juda) of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priestho od. And yet it is far more evident that after the similitude of Melchisedec there aris eth another priest. Who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life ... for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a bett er hope did.” In Hebrews 7, verse 3 , Melchisedec, King of Peace, is described as being : “Without father, without mother, without descent, h aving neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abi deth a priest continually .” Hebrews 8:1 ,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"“Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the M ajesty in the heavens. A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lo rd pitched and not man.” 8:7, “For if that first covenant had been faultless, the n should no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with them, He saith, behold the day cometh saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the House of I srael and with the house of Judah.” This new covenant seems to allow the Children of Is rael to run with the hare and bite with the hounds. Consider the fruits of this new covenant: NEW YORK “ JEWISH LIFE ” MAY 1938 “Every Jew who is sincerely interested in the pligh t of Jews should realize that the best sons of the Jewish people are the Jewish Communists , and that the most faithful ally of the Jews is the Communist Party .” [ The Jews , page 135] Rabbi Moses Miller had this to say: “ SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM: THE BIG LIE ” “From the very first day of its existence the Sovie t Union took steps to eradicate anti- Semitism. On July 27th 1919, a special decree was i ssued against anti- Semitism.\" [ The Jews , page 135] The Encyclical of Pope Pius XI makes this comment: SATANIC VOICES 19 “DIVINI REDEMPTORIS” “...We blame only the system with its authors and a bettors who considered Russia the best field for experimenting with a plan elaborated years ago, and who from there continued to spread it from one end of the world to the other .” [ The Rulers of Russia , page 13] By their fruits you will know them! INTRODUCTION In 1917, when the second revolution took place and the Bolshevik government came to power in Russia, the hand that led the people may have been the hand of Lenin, and his words the words of Karl Marx, but the voice was unmistakably the voice of Satan. Hence Satanic Voices for the title of this book. In the course of this investigation we will try to establish without prejudice the objectives behind the writing, promotion and defense of ‘Satanic Vers es’, and identify the sources of its inspiration."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Hardly a day has gone by since February 14th, 1989, without someone, somewhere, in the name of freedom of speech, calling for a lifting of the judicial ruling, or fatwa, by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against the messenger of ‘Satanic Verses’, Salman Rushdie. The judgment was undoubtedly made with theological as well as na tional security considerations in mind: Security that is, of the International Islamic Nati on or Ummah, comprising over one thousand, two hundred million people and representing almost one quarter of the world’s entire population. Today, few if any interviews with members of the Mu slim community, pass off without the Rushdie issue being forcefully placed on the agenda and vigorously pursued, in accordance with: The Canon and First Article of Democratic Secular D ogma: ‘Freedom of Speech’. This has certainly been the experience of members of The Isl amic Party of Britain, even though it had been calling for a dialogue to take place between t he various factions since the party was launched in September 1989. Yet, when it recently c alled for a suspension of this very same Fatwa, on the grounds that, by his own admission, R ushdie had in fact suffered - the long suspected - Psychotic Schizophrenic breakdown, desc ribed so graphically in the book, the silence was, and has remained deafening. Out of 33 faxed copies of a press-release to this e ffect, sent out to the world’s media establishment, including Reuters, Associated Press and United Press International, which together with the British papers, TV and Radio, comprise the bulk of the world’s secular opinion makers, none but one brought a reaction. This same media wh ich had for the past six months been rigorously pressing the Islamic World to abandon it s position (while basking hypocritically in the protective censorship of its own policies of ‘Shoot to Kill’), revealed by its capricious lack of response to the evidence that could have been submi tted in legitimate mitigation of Rushdie’s death sentence a more sinister intention behind the humanitarian drama and high ideals so fervently enunciated by them during their Save Rush die Campaign. This will remain the view as long as they maintain their conspiracy of silence, preferring to ignore the clinical evidence which actually support s their vociferous demands for clemency, because it doesn’t suit their secret objectives, ev en though it offers a genuine solution to their alleged original concern, that of Salman Rushdie’s freedom, if that indeed was the burning issue? So why, all of a sudden, the loss of interest or Me dia-Amnesia? Surely all thirty-three organizations hadn’t gone down overnight with Legio nnaires disease or contracted E.S.E. en masse. (Journalism’s equivalent to B.S.E.? Better k nown as: Editoria Spongyform Encephalitis Lethargica, or in other words, Moral Torpor.

But the n again, on reflection, perhaps they had? CHRONOLOGY THE OBSERVER , SEPTEMBER 25th 1988: As early as the September 88 interview with Sean Fr ench of the Observer, Rushdie disclosed that his ‘Satanic Verses’ were more to do with autobiogr aphy than fiction. This is an open admission that the psychotic-schizophrenic fall and flying se quences of both Chamcha and Farishta were disguised, non-fictional accounts of himself [as we re other members of his family disguised, he says, in earlier novels]. He intended thereby to pr otect his own personal sensitivities and those of his close family members, while allowing him to mak e highly sensitive disclosures, unhampered"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"by either moral or social discretion. However, on t his particular occasion he uses the ‘Modern Novels Technique’ in order to avoid disclosing or r ecognising his own mental disorder directly, and more importantly, to prevent others from discov ering it and the self-avowed subversive nature of both his mission and his book. Sean French: “You’ve described their fall into England from a p lane as a ‘drastic act of immigration’. Is this ‘A Passage to India’ in rever se, ‘A Passage to England’?” Salman Rushdie: “It wasn’t conscious. It’s more to do with autobiography . Not that Chamcha [the devil] is me. I wanted to write about a thing I find difficult to admit, even to myself...” Satanic Verses must, therefore, be considered as an autobiography, in which the long established, split and grandiose personality of the narrator, Sa lman Rushdie, is represented by two ‘allegedly’ fictional characters from the archetypal world-stor e or pantheon of Satanic personalities. They receive blasphemous disintegrated revelations on hi s behalf, whilst either falling, flying, or in Rushdie’s own words, “plummeting in a concussed con dition”. This is a cunning device employed in order to be proffered later as “suitabl e mitigation” when the book provoked the inevitable outcry of blasphemy. “Gibreel [Farishta-Rushdie] greeted her. ‘You could n’t find your way to heaven or what?’ Insensitive words [one might think] to speak to a dead woman! But his concussed, plummeting condition, may be offered in mitigation. ” [Satanic Verses, page 7] Muslims were far more likely to be fooled with an e xtenuating aeronautical coma, than accept legal arguments protecting a U.K. author’s right to insult who or what ever he likes, providing he does so between inverted commas, or under the venee r of the novel formula. But unfortunately for him, this time they were not about to be bitten by the same snake twice. They neither accepted it as a fable - as he had hoped - nor as a semi-con scious work of fiction, but correctly identified it as an autobiographical account of out and out, poss essed, premeditated blasphemy. SEPTEMBER 13th 1989: LAUNCH OF THE ISLAMIC PARTY OF BRITAIN The Leader’s inaugural speech contained references to admissions by Miles Copeland, one time head of CIA Middle East operations, that contrary t o popular belief the CIA had more men guarding Gamal Abdul Nasser than the president of t he United States. Copeland also revealed that knowing that the press has the power to purcha se submission, they used it in order to overthrow the democratically elected, popular Irani an leader Mossadegh. And that it was Richard Cotton, a CIA operative in Washington D.C., who beg an the campaign of disinformation in Iran, by concocting over 4/5ths of all the Iranian newspa per reports and articles circulating during that period in Iran, falsely claiming that premier Mossa degh was a Communist collaborator. He also stated that the CIA, working in concert wit h the British authorities, including Churchill, Julian Amery, Sir Samuel Falle, and Sir George Midd leton (Charge d’Affairs at the Embassy in Tehran), brought about the Coup d’etat, which place d in charge more ‘Elastic‘ politicians over the Iranian people, for the West’s material benefit, pa rticularly in the interest of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., now called British Petroleum.

Here we have Rushdie , an agent of an occult establishment , well paid and praised for his contribution to this ‘Last Crusade’ . One can rest assured that if he had been a German war criminal, or a Jewish atomic expert telling the truth about the nu clear capabilities of Israel, the press would have treated the issue quite differently. As with Peter Wright’s ‘Spy Catcher’, the government would have reacted differently. But sadl y, today the only thing that seems to generate anything approaching an outcry of ‘Blasphe my’ in the media or in the press, is, in the words of one American Rabbi: ”Anything that devalues the currency of the Holocaust.\" The cancellation of Jim Allen’s Play ‘Perdition’ at the Royal Court Theatre, to be replaced not long after by ‘Persian Nights’, demonstrates clearl y that a double standard is in operation. Under the Islamic laws of Moses the punishments for blasphemy are no different to those of latter-day Islam, outlined in the Torah of Muhammad , the Qur’an. And just as you would not expect the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury to abrogate an y of the 10 Commandments, because the religion of Britain is now more ‘Bank of England’ t han ‘Church of England’, or ask the Chief Rabbi to exonerate Dr. Goebbels on the grounds that writing a few speeches never hurt anyone; likewise, the fatwa of Ayatollah Khomeini must not be viewed without first taking into account the duplicitous nature of past, present, and for th e foreseeable future British, American and European foreign policy, towards the strongly relig ious nations of Iran and Egypt in particular, and the strategically disunited Nations of Islam in general.

A spokesman said several psychiatrists had been approached to analyze the allegations, which if found to be true, would free the writer fr om the punishment because of his condition. The party announced the decision after hearing Marj orie Wallace, director of [SANE] Schizophrenia A National Emergency, argue on radio that some passages in the book strikingly resembled descriptions by her clients.” Ms Wallace also confirmed in her interview with Jack O’Sullivan that she had indeed said that the accoun t of the heroes or anti-heroes of ‘The Satanic Verses’ particularly in those sequences of the char acters falling and flying, were some of the best she had ever read of a person undergoing Psychotic Schizophrenic Breakdown, but emphasized that she had not said that Rushdie was actually mad . She, understandably, not wishing to be drawn into the controversy preferred to describe hi s condition to the ‘Independent’ as ‘Very Imaginative’. She added: “his descriptions of the f ragmentation of the mind, the dissolving of the boundaries between the self and reality, together w ith the sense that his hero had his life overtaken by alien forces is very similar to the de scriptions of how it feels when schizophrenics become split away from reality”. She also confirmed that she had agreed to review any psychiatric report on Rushdie. Following the February 5th edition of ‘Start the We ek’, Ms Wallace spoke to D. Bouilloire, a member of the Islamic Party in Sheffield, saying th at it had not been her intention to imply that Salman Rushdie had actually experienced the Psychot ic events described by him in his ‘Satanic Verses’, but on the other hand, when pressed, she s aid, “..Neither can I state categorically that he has not” [extracts from a monitored telephone conve rsation]. The Qur’an invites us to compare all information wi thout fear, because truth stands out clear from error. Nicolas Walter , in his book ‘ Blasphemy Ancient and Modern’ , points out many interesting facts about the Blasphemy Industry, and how it promotes and markets its wares. He admitted, however, that he had not studied an unbia sed translation of the Qur’an which was now the subject of dispute, and therefore was ignorant of the profound verifiable scientific statements in the Qur’an about, for example the origins of our expanding Universe and that this Qur’an is being exonerated daily by the investigations of sci ence. Data from COBE, ‘The Cosmic Background Explorer’, and Stephen Hawkin’s ‘Brief H istory of Time’ endorse the accuracy of the Qur’anic account of the ‘Big Bang’ and, of cour se, the ‘Big Crunch’. Other research reveals other proofs."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The mistakes and ignorance of Nicolas Walters about the Qur’an are understandable. He, unlike Salman Rushdie has not had access to the archives o f unbiased history, but has regrettably allowed himself to be satisfied with the dregs of p rejudice. Rushdie on the other hand has tried to confound the truth with blatant falsehood, assassinating the characters of noble people, rubbishing good manners and high ideals and assaulting not just a book, but The Book. The Book that contains the solu tions for all the world’s problems, The Book that if studied, can set mankind free from the slav ery of Interest, Poverty, Global Warming, Racial Discrimination, Social Injustice, etc., etc. , etc. And it is in these areas of vested interest that we find the ‘Rushdie faction’, those who benef it materially from inhumanely depriving others, like the Biblical Corah (known in the Qur’an as Qarun ), who do not welcome any form of liberating book, be it Islamic or otherwise. So, working on the principle that for a lie to succ eed it must contain some element of truth, and with tame Rushdies ever ready to wage secular Jihad in order to gain the approbation of the English speaking Literary World Order, he chose to sell what was left of his ‘Honorary White Soul’ for an alleged $850,000 dollar advance. He th us endorsed the long standing and widely held view that a well-financed, well-organized war of su bversion is still being waged; not only against Islam but all forms of moral order [see the chapter The Revolt against Islam on page 106 of this book]. This is not new; the only novelty is the use of the novel, rather than the older techniques of hiding or altering the wording of scripture or maki ng them apocryphal in order to accommodate political ambition by circumnavigating inconvenient moral or financial prohibitions. As to Rushdie’s rationalised externalisations and s elf-deceptive personations; these are first and foremost attempts to disguise from himself the emba rrassing and unwelcome realization that the narrative of his book, Satanic Verses, is merely a regurgitation of the neurotic dreams and nightmares he experienced during his ‘Psychotic Sch izophrenic Breakdown’, now disguised as a novel. The neurotic, or post-godly type, as Rushdie calls himself, will always cloud issues to avoid clear exposure of either his neurosis or his ‘God-Shaped Hole’; a method employed in order to maintain the illusion of normality, like t he vain ugly camel avoids drinking from clear water to maintain the illusion that it is handsome. THE RUSHDIE REPORT Preliminary reports for the Islamic Party of Britai n by Committees A & B investigating the suggestion that the author of Satanic Verses, Salma n Rushdie, is mentally imbalanced. As early as September 25th, 1988, in his interview with Sean French, Rushdie openly admitted that the classic “psychotic-schizophrenic fall and flying sequence” of his devil Chamcha and the Angel Farishta were, whilst ‘difficult to admit’, p urely autobiographical. Therefore, by his own admission we must consider th e voices of Farishta Rushdie and Chamcha Rushdie as co-authors of the book, along with its H onorary White title holder Salman Rushdie. In an interview with James Wood in ‘ The Guardian’ , September 21st 1991, Rushdie stated: “In my life I’ve always had to be a triple person.. .” His vocal cords and split-personality are taken ove r by extraneous powers, so that angelic- devilish ventriloquies issue from the same mouth, i n classic schizophrenic fashion:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"“it was me both times, baba, me first and second al so me... both the statement and the repudiation, verses and converses, universes and re verses, the whole thing, and we all know how my mouth got worked.” Actually we don’t all know, says D. J. Enright in his New York Review of Books, March 2nd 1989, who goes on to say, ‘It appears we are told that God is Satan, and Sata n is God , which adds up to one form of monotheism ... Rushdie’s book is copious in thesis and antithesis, but, not too surprisingly, synthesis hovers beyond it.\" [ The Rushdie File , pages 17 and 19] The admission by Rushdie is consistent with stateme nts in the Qur’an which refer to writers, poets and critics of Islam from its earliest days t o the present time, who falsely accuse God’s messengers and prophets of being either mad, posses sed or guilty of producing revelations from their own creative, psycho-mystical desires and exp eriences. These writers now include in their ranks Salman Rushdie, together with his friends and collaborators among authors in the American and English branches of PEN and the predominantly s ecular/occult governing establishments working in concert with news and media institutions ; populated largely by well-educated, highly sophisticated, clever (but regrettably, all too oft en) spiritually subnormal personalities, who because of their myopian vision see nothing wrong i n spreading alarm, despondency or disinformation in order to increase, or maintain th eir power to influence (for their own benefit, financial or otherwise) what people believe, think and worship. This is achieved in the way they edit or invent the news or the types of story they report, often allowing the bottom lines of balance sheets or view ing figures to exercise editorial control of the headlines and programme contents; as Randolph Hearst , ‘the original image manipulator’, said: “We don’t report the news - we make it.” A point confirmed in the famous 1930s response by John Swinton , retiring editor of The New York Times, to a toast to an ‘independent press’: “What folly is this, toasting an independent press? Everyone present here tonight knows there is no such thing as an independent press . You know it, and I know it . There is not one of you who would dare to write his honest opini ons, and if he did, you know beforehand it would never appear in print . I am paid 250 dollars a week to keep my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected wit h . Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar work. The business of the journalist is to destroy the tr uth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the foot of Mammon, and to sell himself, hi s country, and his race for his daily bread . You know this, and I know it , and what folly it is to be toasting an independent press! We are the tools and vassals of rich men beh ind the scenes . We are jumping jacks - they pull the strings, and we dance . Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are th e property of these men . We are intellectual prostitutes .\" [From The New Zealand Social Creditor , reproduced by The Social Credit Union ] In a chapter appropriately entitled ‘The Pen‘, the Qur’an defends itself and its messengers from the perennial attempts of either jealous or mentall y sick writers who try to invalidate it. Those"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"who spread doubt about its authenticity do so becau se of their consistent failure to meet its challenge to all men: to join together and write on e comparable verse. Ironically, the defenders of Satanic Verses and its author Salman Rushdie, the A merican and English organization of authors, have elected to be known as ‘PEN’, although perhaps in this case Poisoned PEN might be more suitable; and even his publishers have the mark Vik ing-PENguin.

The ones greedy and base-born, therewithal intrusive.\" (This more than adequately describes the modern pre ss which Neil Kinnock blamed for his election defeat in 1992; the Associates and Members of PEN, The Establishment, The Media in general and Tabloid Journalists in particular, toge ther with some disc jockeys and TV shows - including Kill-Roy, as distinguished from Kill-Rush die.) PSYCHIATRIC REPORT EXTRACT COMMITTEE B (1) The book, “Satanic Verses”, is anti-Islamic to the core. The particular passages that have aroused Muslim protests can be seen as being in the nature of gratuitous inflammatory devices, superficial to the underlying theme of the book, and strike one as bei ng essentially ‘ Nietzschean ’ in character and content . [Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900. German ph ilosopher. ‘The man who thought he was god’. He rejected what he called the “slave moralit y” and values of Christianity in works such as ‘Also Sprach Zarathustra’ (1883-91). He proposed a philosophy asserting the self and - the “will to power” - Nietzsche’s doctrine of the superman.] (2) The core theme in the book “Satanic Verses” is, that it is man who creates God or the supernatural through the force of and projection of his own desires. The Prophet Muhammad, in effect (according to Rushdie) desires a particular verse or ayat that will be accommodated to the Qureish tribal leaders. The Ang el of revelation, Gabriel, reflects back as it were, this desire, in the form of the Sa tanic Verses. However, when these ayat or verses cause offense to the prophet’s companions and faithful followers, the prophet in effect seeks a new ‘ayah’ or verse to reconcile the mess created, and Gabriel, according to Rushdie, obliges. The prophet then sees one vers e as being of the Devil and the other from God: Rushdie, however, in effect is saying tha t both are from the prophet’s own desire. The Qur’an, anticipating this suggestion, refutes i t in Surah 22, ‘The Pilgrimage’ . We read in verse 49-54 :"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"“Say (to the people): O mankind, I am only a plain warner unto you. Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and rich prov ision. While those who strive to thwart our revelations, such are the rightful owner s of the fire. Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before you, but when he reci ted (the message) framed he also a desire, and Satan threw some vanity into his desire : but Allah abolishes anything that Satan throws in. And Allah will establish His Revel ations. For Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom. In order that He may make these Satanic suggestions [Satanic Verses for example] but a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened : verily the evil doers are in a schism far from th e truth. And in order that those who have been given knowledge may learn that the (Q ur’an) is the Truth from you Lord, so that they may believe therein, and their hearts be made humbly open to it: for verily Allah is the guide of those who believe, to the str aight way.” (3) In a nutshell, Nietzsche’s philosophy is that m an has, in the past, projected outwards, power that resides within himself; and this resembl ent projection or image eventually came to be worshipped as God. Therefore, as man beg ins to realise this, he can take back the power into himself and by so doing become, as i t were, superman again. (4) As a philosophical notion, this idea is at leas t worthy of debate, and it would not be exceptional to explore and illustrate a philosophic al theory through a work of fiction. There is, however, a big difference between knockin g about the intellectual idea of Superman, on the one hand, and feeling one is perso nally becoming this Superman, on the other: This latter prospect can be indicative o f insanity. (5) C. G. Jung had some sympathy with Nietzsche’s p hilosophy - i.e. that man projects aspects of himself into or onto external images, wh ich he then imbues with power. [One can explain, for instance, some aspects of the Hind u pantheon of gods in these terms, and the age-old techniques used in the imitative magic process, with Aleister Crowley as one of its better-known adepts.] Recognizing this proce ss and then taking responsibility for these forces that properly originate within the sel f, was seen by Jung as an indispensable step in becoming a mature and whole human being. Ju ng emphasised, however, the need for humility in dealing with these normally unconsc ious forces within the self. Otherwise he warned that the Ego becomes solely inflated with a sense of power-producing or rather (in Rushdie’s case) paranoid and grandiose arroganc e, with the symptoms of disintegration of the self and frank insanity follo wing later. Nietzsche said ‘ There cannot be a God because if there were one I w ould not believe that I was not he .’ Remember, Jung attributed Nietzsche’s own insanity to his lack of Humility. After all, humility only comes from recognising that, whatever the powe r of the self, one is ultimately a servant of God. (6) It can be argued that in the ‘Satanic Verses’ R ushdie is not simply philosophizing in a literary form, but is describing his own internal e xperience of psychotic inflation of the ego, which he then projects onto his “fictional cha racters”. (7) The fact that some of Rushdie’s other books als o seem to illustrate a Nietzschean position, rules out the possibility that it is pure ly coincidental in Satanic Verses - and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"seems to demonstrate a fascination by Rushdie for N ietzsche, because his philosophy resonates on the same wave-length: This appears to explain the psychotic struggle experiences going on within Rushdie, and mirror clo sely, Hitler’s fascination with Nietzsche, and may be expressed in similar terms; t here are several indications that this latter interpretation may be the case. Recent state ments by Majorie Walace and others convert the possibility into a probability. [Rushdi e’s Mein Kampf could perhaps be next?] (8) The conclusions drawn by Dr. Mohammad T. Mehdi, in his book entitled ‘Islam and Intolerance (Reply to Salman Rushdie)’ 15/12/1989, the observations and comments of Marjorie Wallace, director of S.A.N.E. (Schizophren ia a National Emergency) and Rushdie’s own admission as early as September 1988 in his Observer interview with Sean French, leave little doubt that he should be s eeking psychiatric help. While not wishing to acknowledge outright that he a nd Chamcha the devil are one and the same, Rushdie nevertheless admitted that the fall and fly ing sequences were more to do with autobiography than he cared to admit even to himsel f. It was during the radio 4 program ‘ Start the week’ on February the 5th 1990, that Marjorie Wallace inadvertently drew our attention to Rushdie’s poss ible insanity by stating that Satanic Verses contained some of the best descriptions of s elf-experience, identical to those reported by schizophrenics, which mimic the schizophrenic sensa tion of falling, of being taken over by extraneous powers, of losing self identity and feel ing a blurring of the boundaries of self. Her comments followed a discussion on Satanic Verses wi th Bamber Gascoign, Edward Debono, and Professor Ahmed. In passing she said:- “ The area I deal with is what I feel far more prof ound. I am dealing with the ‘dark night of the soul’ area. I’m dealing with the disintegrat ion of thought, where the boundaries leak out, one into the other. I mean the whole defi nition of schizophrenia as the fragmentation of the personality, a splitting off f rom reality, and actually, going back onto the Rushdie, Satanic Verses (issue), I read, w ith absolute excitement in this (book) some of the best descriptions of Psychotic-Schizoph renic breakdown that I have ever read. This fall that he has, this use of imagery of flying, and in fact he even dedicates it to. This is a condition that most schizophrenics of ten find themselves in. He describes this as a condition that Satan lives in. Confined t o a vagabond, wandering condition...We don’t know the causes of schizophrenia, but it is p ossibly based in the bio-chemical pathways of the brain, where something is going wro ng, when the boundaries between themselves and reality have disintegrated and they are subject to torment”. “ This rootlessness is Rushdie’s (personal) problem, but the Muslim world has become his victim and is expected to pay the price.” [ New York Times, Book Review Section, January 29th 1989, Satanic Ve rses review by A. G. Mojabai ] Dr. Mohammad T. Mehdi said, “If he (Rushdie) does not believe that he has insul ted one billion, two hundred million Muslims [one quarter of the world’s population] the n he must be considered a man who is out of touch with reality .”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Any writer , Dr. Mehdi says, who even in a work of fiction were to call Moses “H itler” or the Blessed Virgin Mary a “whore”, while at the same ti me believing that he would not be causing offence to Jews and Christians, “must be a mental c ase ”. Furthermore Rushdie, he says, should acknowledge th at not only has he poured insults on the Muslims, but also on Judaism, Christianity, black p eople, white people, the Queen as head of the Church of England, not to mention Allah, His prophe ts and His angels, failing which, he should plead temporary insanity for what he has done to th e feelings of the Muslim world. Under the circumstances, and as it seems that Rushd ie is out of touch with the realities of life, hospitalization for him in a mental institution may be the best remedy and the only way out of the present impasse! Rushdie’s friends should examine t his suggestion and encourage the man to seek help. Otherwise for him the growing isolation and psychological torture he is destined to endure will serve as just punishment for his action s and suffice as a deterrent to others. The Old Testament Book of Leviticus declares: “ Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be pu t to death ”. According to St. Augustine : “Better a heretic should die than allow false teach ings of ridicule to lead others to eternal damnation”. EARLIER SATANIC VERSES AND THEIR POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES Rushdie’s Satanic Verses have parallels in the writ ings of political figures and anarchists such as Karl Marx, George Jung, Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, Moses Hess, Pierre Proudhon, Aleister Crowley and others. Marx, according to Robert Payne in his book entitled “ The Unknown Karl Marx ”, was under Satanic influence when, at the age of 23, he wrote a play which he entitled “ Oulanem ”. The title is an inversion of “Emanuel”, and it bears a striki ng resemblance to Rushdie’s psychotic, plummeting ventriloquies. Marx’s father wrote to him: “You are obviously animated and ruled by a demon no t given to all men. Is this demon a heavenly one or a Faustian one? Will you ever ... b e receptive to true human happiness ?” [ The portable Karls Marx , page 10] OULANEM’ BY KARL MARX \"Till I go mad and my heart is utterly changed, see this sword - the prince of darkness sold it me . Yet I have power within my useful arms to clench an d crush you. While for us both the abyss yawns in darkness. You will sink down and I shall f ollow laughing, whispering in your ears, ‘ descend, come with me, friend’, ruined, ruined. My time has clean run out."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The clock has stopped, the pygmy house has crumbled . Soon shall I embrace eternity to my breast, and soon, I shall howl gigantic curses on mankind . Ha, eternity, she is our eternal grief, an indescribable and immeasurable death, vile, artific ially conceived to scorn us, ourselves being clockwork, blindly mechanical, made to be the fool calendars of Time and Space, having no purpose, save to happen and be ruined; there is som ething which devours, I’ll leap within it, though I bring the world to ruins. The world, which bulks between me and the abyss, I will smash it to pieces with my enduring curses. I’ll throw my arms around its harsh reality . Embracing me, the world will dumbly pass away, and then sink down to utter nothingness. Peri shed, with no existence: That would be really living.\" SATANIC SUPERMAN PLAYS SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD In 1841, Moses Hess , brought Marx into a society called the League of the Just , and taught him collectivist ideologies. Hess wrote: “Dr. Marx, that is the name of my idol, is still a very young man who will give medieval religion and politics their death blow ...” [ The portable Karl Marx, page 22] George Jung , another friend of Marx, wrote in the same year: “ Marx will surely chase God from His heaven, and wil l even sue Him ”. [ Mystery 666 , page 144] Bukharin , one of Marx’s associates, in the ‘ First International’ was an anarchist and, by all accounts, an ardent satanist . He wrote: “ Satan is the first free thinker and saviour of the world . He frees Adam and impresses the seal of humanity and liberty on his forehead, by making him disobedient .” [ibid, page 45] Bukharin , who was secretary general of the Communist Intern ational, revealed that as early as 12 years of age, after reading the ‘Book of Revelation’, he longed t o become Antichrist . And realising that the Beast was the son of “ The Great Whore”, he insisted that his mother confess to having been a harlot. [ibid] Aleister Crowley also longed to be known as the Beast 666 of Revela tions, and was actually called it by his own mother:- “What, however, is pe culiar in Crowley’s case is not that he chose ‘evil’ but that, in his revolt against his parents and God, he set himself up [like Nietzsche] in God’s place. ‘ Why do you call yourself the Beast?’ I asked him on the occasion of our first meeting. ‘My mother called me the Beast,’ he replie d to my surprise .” “At first, he was a devout little Plymouth Brother, taking turns with his parents and the servants in reading passages from the Bible... He could not, he said, even conceive of the existence of people who were so foolish or so wicked as to doubt it. In his childish ardour he thought of himself as a Christian Knight, doing deeds of holin ess and valour. As he grew older his ideas took a strange turn... Now any description of torture or blood aroused his fee lings tremendously ...

And suddenly, after the death of his father - he was th en eleven years old - he discovered that his sympathies were entirely on the side of the enemies of heaven. He had gone over to Satan, and did not know why. He was still searching for the re ason when he came to write his autobiography at the age of fourty-seven.\" [ The Confessions of Aleister Crowley , page 14] Other early Communists, Rationalists and Freethinke rs made no secret of their sense of identification with, or “Sympathy for the Devil”, i n other words, that persistent and rebellious spirit in man. For the Satanic propensity is in our blood according to the holy prophet Muhammad. Its receptors circulate in the blood-stre am, waiting to respond to the 24 hour broadcast whisperings of ‘Radio Satan’ (no doubt tr ansmitting on 666 Mega Hurts). Fasting is recommended as the most successful method of jammin g or tuning it out, thereby screening ourselves from the relentless bombardment of his mo st successful group, ‘The Temptations’, which undenyably influence our thoughts daily, from the soul via the heart which handles all the blood, which reaches every feeling crevice of physi cal desire within the body and the brain. Temptations are monitored and weighed by our discer ning faculties, and then accepted or rejected according to the level of our refined awareness or God-consciousness. SOUL MUSIC? The Qur’an confirms that our own souls are responsi ble for our own problems:- Surah 4:78-79 : “If some good befalls them, they say, ‘This is from God’; But if evil, they say, ‘This is from you’ (o prophet). Say: ‘All things are from Go d’. But what has come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? Whatever good, (o man) happens to you, is from God; But whatever evil happens to you, is f rom your own soul. And We have sent you as an apostle to instruct mankind. And enough i s God for a witness.” The Qur’an clearly identifies the three phases of t he human soul which manifest themselves in the personal disposition and behaviour of the human bei ng: (1) The evil aspect is called An-nafs al-amaratun b i’l-su In Surah Joseph or Yusuf (12), verses 51-53, the lady who tried to seduce Joseph w as subject to this temptation, and Joseph says, “And I call not myself sinless; surely (mankind’s) soul is want to command evil, except those on whom my Lord has mercy. Surel y my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.” (2) The neutral or balancing aspect of the soul, i. e. the conscience or internal policeman, is An-nafs al-lawamah In Surah 75, ‘The Resurection’(A l-Qiyamah), verses 1-2, we read: “I do call to witness the Resurrection Day; and I do c all to witness the self-reproaching soul (which eschews evil).” (3) The completely positive phase is An-nafs al-mut ma’inna In Surah 89, Al Fajr, verse 27, it is referred to as follows: “O soul that art at rest , return to yourLord, well pleased and well pleasing. So enter among My servants and enter My G arden.” Here is an example of the evil aspect of the soul: According to Bakunin, Proudhon , who wrote the following Satanic Verses, like Marx, was a disc iple of Joanna Southcott. He said,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"“We reach knowledge in spite of Him (God). We reach well being, in spite of Him, Every step forward is a victory in which we overcome the Divine.” He exclaimed: “God is stupidity and cowardice; God is hypocrisy a nd falsehood; God is tyranny and poverty; God is evil. Where humanity bows before an altar, humanity, the slaves of kings and priests, will be condemned... I swear, God, wit h my hand stretched out towards the heavens, that you are nothing more than the executi oner of my reason, the sceptre of my conscience... God is essentially, anti-civilised, a nti-liberal, anti-human.” [ Mystery 666 \", page 145] Not all Marxists are Satanists, but the majority ar e ideologically aggressive, evangelising atheists, and to become a great communist leader, one needs t o be a devil. Bukharin wrote of his associate Joseph Stalin , “He is not a man, but a devil.” Marx had 6 children. Two daughters and one son-in-l aw committed suicide, two others died of malnutrition. According to Salman Rushdie, the first writer to in fluence him was the Pakistani communist writer Fez Ahmed Fez who was awarded an M.B.E. and ‘The Lenin International Peace Prize for Literature’ in 1962. (9) Rushdie’s own “sacred” revelations issued throu gh the mouth of his apostle, Harold Pinter, to the assembled faithful at the Herbert Re ad Memorial Lecture; show clear signs of ‘grandiosity’ and, that he is coming perilously close to believing himself to be “superman” in the Nietzschean sense. Rushdie appear s to be saying that great literature - in which category by implication he includes his ow n utterances - has replaced religion as the means of transcendence and is now the vehicle b y which man experiences his spirituality. At one point he even says, “I seem to be arguing in a messianic way ”. Authors, it seems, are now the high priests of the modern age. The implications of this claim, have disturbed even some of the Liberal Establishme nt. In Rushdie’s defense of Satanic Verses, reported in the ‘Independent on Sunday’, Rushdie likened himself to [1] Al-Hallaj, [2] Iqbal, and [3 ] Abdul-Hamid Al-Ghazali. And here we see more than a touch of “grandiosity” at work in his c omparison, particularly of placing himself in the company of Imam Ghazali. Of Iqbal the compiler knows too little to make a comment, except that he is extremely well known and revered in Paki stan. On the other hand of course, Al-Hallaj and Al-Ghazali clashed with the Ulema or Clergy of their day, but their opposition was based on their experiences of reality, which required them t o divest themselves of ego in order to achieve their high status. This can only be achieved throug h intense humility, and this is a quality altogether absent in Mr. Rushdie. It would seem, th erefore, that there is not the slightest comparability between Salman Rushdie and these Musl ims, who - being serious scholars of the subject - sought to divest themselves of wealth, po sition, and publicity. The fact that Rushdie has sought an identification with these three figures further suggests that he is fundamentally out of touch with reality."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Here is not the place to explore the meaning of Al- Hallaj’s utterance: Ana al-Haqq (I am the Truth). But the fact that Rushdie seems to be truly identifying himself with Al-Hallaj (who by the way was the only one of the three to be executed fo r blasphemy) further indicates that he has reached a rather advanced stage of grandiose delusi on. “Say (to the people, Muhammad): Whosoever is an ene my to Gabriel - For surely he revealed (the Qur’an) to your heart, by Allah’s com mand, verifying that which was revealed before it, and a guidance and glad tiding for the believers - Whosoever is an enemy to Allah, His angels and His messengers, incl uding Gabriel and Michael, then surely Allah is an enemy to disbelievers. And We in deed have revealed to you clear messages, and non disbelieve in them except the tra nsgressors”. [ Qur’an Surah 2, Al-Baqarah (The Cow) verse 97-99] ‘FANATICISM’ A PRELIMINARY REPORT BY COMMITTEE A 21 AUGUST 1990 The Tavistock Lectures by C. G. Jung contain important information crucial to understan ding the motivation and psychological reasons behind Salman Rushdie’s book ‘Satanic Verses’ and the reaction of present day Muslims to it. “Fanaticism (both secular & religious) is always a sign of repressed doubt. You can study that in the history of the Church. Always in those times when the Church [in this case Mosque] begins to waver, the style becomes fanatica l, or fanatical sects spring up, because the secret doubt has to be quenched. When one is really convinced, one is perfectly calm and can discuss one’s belief as a pe rsonal point of view without any particular resentment .” In the introduction to an earlier lecture, Dr. J. A. Hadfield , said: “Nothing convinces me so much of the truth of any c onception as when its creator is able to see it as a subject of humour, and that is what Dr. Jung did last night. Over-seriousness in regard to any subject very often displays the fa ct that the individual is dubious and anxious about the truth of what he is trying to con vey .” This is why Salman Rushdie fanatically defends the religion of literature and its pantheon of self- centered, self-promoting secular gods, idols and au thors. He asked via Harold Pinter at the Herbert Read Memorial Lecture: “Is nothing sacred?” As far as Rushdie is concerned, he sees the Qur’an not as a religious revelation of the truth, but part of the world-store of narrative whose function is to enrich rather than to dictate how life should be lived. The book Satanic Verses, he admits , is based partly on “a quasi historical incident, he picked up while studying Islam at Camb ridge ... racism at Rugby Public School ... his wanting desperately to belong ... a desire to make a reckoning ... settling old scores ... unmaking the veil of history ... and against the bearded and turbaned Imam Khomeini”. But that which he less readily acknowledges is where his fears and pr oblems reside: in the leven of the - books and bread - he reverenced as a child; leading on to the bread he has earned from the books he has written. Books written with Rushdie’s own personal political objectives in mind as a secular"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"prophet-novelist: Books promoting perpetual (secula r) revolution and subversion, be it moral, religious or otherwise. He points out that “Film, the most expensive art form, is the least su bversive. Bergman, Fellini and others made the most successful secular revolts into the t erritory of the sacred. I prefer the greater possibilities of the novel.” Rushdie’ s idolisation of literature, “ The most precious ar t”, and its worshipful masters, novelists like him, confesses: “I grew up learning to kiss books and bread. Devout households grew up kissing holy books. But we in our household kissed everything; d ictionaries, atlases, we kissed Enid Blyton novels and Superman Comics. If ever I’d drop ped the telephone directory, I’d probably have kissed that too. This was before I’d ever kissed a girl. But one never forgets ones first loves. Bread and Books. One food for the body, one food for the soul. What could be more worthy of our respect and love? It has always been a shock to me to meet people to whom books simply do not matter. Peo ple who are scornful of the act of reading, let alone writing. It is perhaps almost al ways astonishing to learn that your beloved is not always as attractive to others as sh e is to you. My most beloved books have been fictions, and I’ve been obliged to accept - for many millions of human beings, they are entirely without attraction or value.” “We have been witnessing an attack on the very idea of the novel- form. [is nothing sacred?]‘An attack of such bewildering ferocity, th at it has become necessary to restate what is most precious about the art of literature.” “ To answer the attack not by an attack, but by a d eclaration of love. Love can lead to devotion. A devotion of the lover is unlike that of a true believer, in that it is not militant. I may be surprised, even shocked that you do not fe el as I do about a given book or work of art. I may very well attempt to change your mind , but I will finally accept that your tastes, your loves are your business and not mine. The true believer knows no such restraints. The true believer knows that he is simp ly right. He will seek to convert you even by force, and if he cannot, he will simply des pise you, for your unbelief at the very least. Love need not be blind (but) faith must ulti mately be a leap in the dark.” “ The title of this lecture (Is Nothing Sacred?) is a question usually asked in tones of horror! When some personage [Rushdie for example] o r idea [that man’s need for God is obsolete] or value or place held dear by the questi oner is treated to a dose of iconoclasm, e.g. ‘white cricket balls for night cricket, female priests, a Japanese take over of Rolls Royce cars’, Is Nothing Sacred? However it was a qu estion to which I thought I knew the answer. The answer was no! Nothing is sacred, in an d of itself. I would have said, ideas, texts, people can be made sacred. The word is from the Latin - sacrare - to set apart as holy. But even such entities, once their sacredness is established, seek to proclaim and to preserve their own absoluteness (and) their inviola bility [like certain novelists perhaps?]. The act of making sacred [or un-sacred, like an act of blasphemy] is in truth an event in history. It is the product of the many and complex pressures of the time in which the act occurs. And events in history must always be subjec t to questioning, de-construction, even to declarations of their obsolescence."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"To revere the sacred un-questioningly [like the nat ional debt] is to be paralysed by it. The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas, e.g. uncertai nty, progress, change, into crimes.\" THE DEATH OF GOD “To take any one such declaration of obsolescence ( personally) I would have described myself as living in the aftermath of the death of G od! On the subject of the death of God! William H. Guss the American Novelist and Critic had this to say a s recently as 1984: ‘The Death of God represents not only the realisati on that gods have not existed. But the contention that even such a belief is also no longe r irrationally possible. But neither reason nor the taste and temper of the time condone it. The belief lingers on of course. But it does so like astrology or a faith in a flat earth.’' There were others, prior to William Guss and Rushdi e. Gherman Titov said, he and his fellow cosmonauts might defy God: “ Gherman Titov, the Russian cosmonaut, is reported to have proposed that some sort of anti-religious experiment should be carried out in space by Russian Spacemen . He is reported to have made the proposal in a speech to a conference on atheism held by the Communist Party several weeks ago. ‘Studying the co smos and penetrating further and further into the depths of the universe leaves no p lace (left) for God on earth or in heaven’, he said. Titov said the cosmonauts had decided to direct the ir activities more against religion . He did not elaborate on his reference to a possib le ‘special anti-religious experiment in the cosmos.” ( Western Mail, Cardiff , 1st February 1964) The above story confirms the predictions by the Pro phet Muhammad 1400 years ago that man will achieve his life long objective of mounting up to the heavens to see if God was there. Like Nimrod on his Tower of Babel, and the Pharaoh of th e exodus, both suffered from the ‘edifice complex’. Both destroyed themselves and many of the ir followers. “And Pharaoh said [like Nietzsche after him]: O chi efs! I know not that you have a god other than me, so kindle for me a fire, O Hamman, t o bake the mud bricks; and construct for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey the god of Moses; for behold, I deem him one of the liars.” [ Qur’an 28:38] The prophecy that the Marxist-Communists / Atheist- Capitalists will declare, having conquered space, that God is dead, and will ravage the earth, is as follows. “After they have devoured everything they will stil l not be satisfied, and will rush through the sky and begin to fire projectiles/arrow s into the heavens in order to bring about the death of Allah . And Allah will in turn fulfill their wish and comma nd the angels to put blood on their arrows/missiles [shuttles and satellites?] and return them to earth . When they see their missiles return with what appea rs to be the proof of Gods death, they will indeed believe that they have killed Allah. Th en they will say: ‘ We have killed God, now let us try to dominate the moon and the heavens .’ At that time Allah will send down some kind of disease upon them, which will consume the flesh of their bodies. And the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"stench of their corpses will spread over the world. Then it is that Jesus the son of Mary, with all other Muslims who have hidden in the mount ains, will pray to Allah to save them from the disease and death . Then a great cloud will cover the sky and Allah wil l send down rain for fourty days . At first the rain will be red, the colour of blood . It will then turn green and will wash away the smell and the bod ies . The rain will finally become clear and purify everything . The believing servants who were saved will live p eacefully and serve Allah, for their faith will be Islam.” [ Israel and the prophecies of the Holy Qur’an , page 120-121] BACK TO RUSHDIE’S ‘IS NOTHING SACRED’? “I have some difficulty with the uncompromising blu ntness of this obituary notice (God’s obituary notice). It has always been clear to me th at God, unlike human beings, can die, so to speak, in parts. In other parts, for example India, God continues to flourish in literally thousands of forms. So if I speak of livi ng after his death, I’m speaking in a limited personal sense. My sense of God ceased to exist long ago . So I was open to the great creative possibilities offered by surrealism, modernism and their successors. Those philosophies and aesthetics born of the realisation that, as Karl Marx said, ‘All that is solid melts into air.’ To me [Rushdie] however, my ungodliness, or rather my post godliness need not necessarily bring me into confli ct with belief. Indeed one reason for my attempt to develop a form of fiction in which th e miraculous might co-exist with the mundane, was precisely my acceptance that notions o f the Sacred and Profane both needed to be explored as far as possible without pr ejudgement in any honest literary portrait of the way we are. That is to say the most secular of authors ought to be capable of presenting a sympathetic portrait of a devout be liever, or to put it another way, I had never felt the need to totemise my lack of belief, to make it something to go to war about. Now, however, I find my world picture under fire, a nd as I find myself obliged to defend the assumptions and processes of literature - which I had believed all free men and women would take for granted - and for which all un -free men and women continue every day to struggle, so I am obliged to ask mysel f questions I admit to finding somewhat unnerving: Do I perhaps find something sac red after all? Am I prepared to set aside as holy the idea of abso lute freedom of the imagination and alongside it my own notions of the world, the text, and the good? Does this add up to what the apologists of religion have started calling “Secular Fundamentalism”?

FEAR AND BELIEF IN SUPERNATURAL BEINGS In the Qur’an, there are several accounts of the fi rst fall of man. Surah 20, Ta Ha, verses 114- 126 , covers the event, and the dialogue immediately pr eceding the event between God and Adam, and between Satan, Adam and Eve. What is not mentioned in any great detail are the e vents that preceded the arrival of Adam on the scene, which were indirectly responsible for inspir ing those gruesome acts of Racial and Spiritual Apartheid shown on a ‘Dispatches’ programme many th ousands of years later, which are covered in this chapter. According to the section “ Occult Sciences ” in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana of 1855, the story runs as follows: “Prior to the arrival of Adam, the earth had been s ubjected to a continual process of civil and physical revolutions, having been peopled by va rious races of different beings, who after a time were expelled or annihilated, on accou nt of their rebellion against their Creator . The prophetic Griffon Si-murgh tells the hero Cahra man, that she had witnessed twelve of these periods of seven thousand years, and that after his race was extinguished men would be suceeded by more perfect beings, who would be annihilated in their turn, and that the earth itself would be destroyed. The people who inhabited the world before the creat ion of man were the div’s, or deo’s, as the Indians pronounce the word; and the peris. These su perhuman creatures may be not inaptly compared with demons and angels of our ancestors; f or the former are represented as most hideous and malignant, the latter as most beautiful and beneficient. What these races were originally when created, and with what powers they were vested, does not seem to have been anywhere mentioned: But Jan ibn Jan, the father of the Jin, the last of the seventy-two Solomons who governed the world in succession before the cre ation of Adam, having rebelled against the Almighty, and been defeated by the Angel Hharis, wh o was sent to reduce him to obedience; that angel (too) was elated by his success, and in his t urn refused to obey (God)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Almighty having formed Adam, ordered all other creatures to bow down before him; but Hharis, sprung from the element of fire, scorned to make obeisance to a creature made of clay . In consequence of his apostacy, Hharis was called Iba, Iblis, or Shaitan [Satan] ... The divs supported Hharis in his revolt; the peris opposed h im; the greater part of the divs, therefore, were confined to Jehennem (gehenna or hell), but some we re allowed to roam about over the face of the earth, as a check upon men, and the peris were confirmed in the possession of their privileges.. .\" [Fairies, Daemons, Divs & Daivers, Occult Sciences, pages 19-50] The Qur’an informs us of these events in Surah 2, al-Baqarah , as follows: “30: And when your Lord said unto the angels: I am about to place a viceroy in the earth, they said: will you place there one who will do har m therein and will shed blood, while we, hymn Your praises and Sanctify You? 31: And He taught Adam the names of all things then showed them the angels saying: inform Me of the names of these objects if you are truthful. 32: They said: Be You glorified! We have no knowled ge except that which You have taught us. Behold! You, only You are the Knower, th e Wise. 33: He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, an d when he had informed them, He said: did I not tell you that I alone know the secr ets of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which you disclose and that which you hid e. 34: But when We said to the angels: prostrate yours elves before Adam all angels fell prostrate except Iblis/Satan who refused through pr ide, and thus became a disbeliever. 35: We said O Adam! Live with your wife in the gard en, and eat freely of its fruits, but come not near to this tree, in case you become wron g doers. But Satan lured them out and caused Us to expel them; and We said: Fall Down eac h of you a foe unto the other! There will be for you on earth a habitation and a provisi on for a time. 36: Then Adam received words of revelation from his Lord, and He relented towards him, for He (Allah) is The Relenting the Merciful.. .\" In another traditional account given in ‘ Occult Sciences’ , “ The male divs, according to the legends of Persia , were entrusted with the government of the world for seven thousand years anterior to t he creation of Adam, and they were succeeded by the female divs or peris, who under th eir chief Gian ben Gian, ruled another two thousand years . The dominion of the peris was terminated by Eblis (The devil in the Koran) who had been created from the elements of fi re, and whose abode was previously with the angels. Eblis or Hharis, became the leader of the rebelliou s angels when they were commanded to do homage to the first created man, and being jo ined by the whole race of genii, the male and the female divs, whom he (Iblis) had forme rly subjugated, he, like them, was deprived of grace."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Eblis and his immediate followers were condemned to suffer for a long period in the infernal regions, but the remainder were allowed to wander over the earth as a constant source of misery to themselves and to the human rac e, whose obedience is put to the test by their devices and secured by the example of thei r degredation and sufferings.\" [Fairies Daemons, Divs & Daivers; Occult Sciences , Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, page 19, 48, 50] Because of our sophisticated technological achievem ents we have allowed ourselves to become indifferent to, and insulated from, our origins and the purpose for our existence. We wonder why we have not yet managed to advance beyond, or eradi cate these persistent, some would say, irrational ideas. All attempts to do so have failed , and must continue to fail, because they are not irrational, but true. One has only to read the accounts of people sufferi ng from schizophrenia to recognise that the positive symptoms - “hearing voices” that no-one el se can hear; voices that keep up a running commentary on the victims thoughts and behaviour, o r two or more voices conversing with each other - are as the Qur’an describes it, the whisper ings of the evil ones. The final Surah in the Qur’an, An-Nas (Mankind), notifies us of this sickness and the cure: “Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of Mankind, the Own er of Mankind, the God of Mankind, from the mischief of the whisperer of evil, who wit hdraws after his whisper, who whispers in the hearts of mankind, from amongst the spirits and men.” The unfortunate problem for Schizophrenics is that they see and hear voices that “are not socially or culturally sanctioned” [SANE]. As Ken Palmerton , a former psychiatric nurse points out: “ Just because we say they are paranoid, doesn’t mean the devils aren’t after them .” The main problem we face in these days of spiritual subnormality and academic materialism, is not only one of failing to recognise a hidden adver sary as a possibile cause of our problems, but failing to admit the idea that serious Satanic wors hip still survives in 20th century Britain. Or, for that matter, that such beliefs and behaviour can st ill exist among apparently rational, and sophisticated individuals, conditioned by a secular western education and political system. At a time when disturbed and disturbing individuals are willing to submit not only the children of complete strangers, but themselves and their own ch ildren to bestial anti-human treatment, it is time to think again. Outrageous as it might seem, it must be accepted th at, unless we extricate ourselves from the mental serfdom, technical-enchantment and the occul t-escapism, seductively woven and operated by an unholy alliance of materialist mystagogues; i gnoring the falsehood, cant, and argotic dogma of the hypnotic and despotic priesthood; of Rushdie , Stoppard and Co.; we can all wave goodbye to peace of mind and all future happiness.

Eileen Fairweather , a researcher for the ‘Dispatches’ programme, speaking to a modern Satani c-cult survivor, recorded the following comments from a lady called Jennifer Evans who she describes as: “A pretty plump woman”.

They are used to pull out babies of about f ive months.

Mrs Wendy Savage, consultant obstetrician and gynae cologist at the London Hospital, estimated her pregnancy at ‘20 -22 weeks’- the age which Jenn ifer claims most foetal sacrifices take place. Jennifer told ‘ Dispatches ’ that she had been ensnared by satanism at 16 . She was introduced by Tarot Cards and Astrology. “ They told me I had psychic abilities I should devel op and of course I was flattered .” “I felt powerful. I wanted to find out more.” Eventually, she told the researcher, she was invite d to join their ‘spiritual awareness group’ and meditate. On the seventh ‘discussion session’ she was drugged . When she came round she was being initiated. She was being raped . A baby was then aborted. Superintendent Michael Hames, head of Scotland Yard ’s Obscene Publications Branch, points out that survivors are also scared to become witnes ses, because they too have perpetrated crimes. Jennifer did not go to the police, because like oth er victims, she says that police and other authority figures are also involved in the use of m ind control techniques. She says:"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"“I saw four children killed. All were boys. Three w ere Spanish-speaking, smuggled into Britain from Latin America. First they were sexuall y abused .” The fourth child she saw killed was a six-year-old white boy. She said she didn’t know where he came from. But many children, brought in for sexual abuse, she says, were from children’s homes . [ The recent disclosures that child abuse was allowed to continue for years in Health Authority Homes because of Masonic influence will come as no surprise when we come to investiga te the origins of Freemasonry. MP Greville Janner was alleged to have been involved.] The Video now in police hands was made by Jennifer’ s group. Lengthy sections deal with the drugging and whipping of a young man, who then has occult marks and symbols carved in his flesh. The video, says Eileen Fairweather , is often disjointed with ‘flash frames’ cut in, w hich Jennifer analyses, describing a ritual abortion, where a metal rod is inserted in to the girls cervix by a naked female abortionist who is also pregnant . Jennifer informs us that it is believed that spirits in the baby being killed pass into the abortionist’s b aby . Then when it is subsequently killed, the demonic power is multiplied . She said: “ I’ve been in those stirrups. I’ve also performed th ree abortions myself .” This was in response to Dr Stephen Hempling’s quest ion, who, although a police surgeon for 18 years, and a Fellow of forensic medicine at Guy’s h ad not been able to understand why another pregnant woman would be carrying out such an act. Consultant obstretician and gynaecologist Mrs Wendy Savage concluded: “I should have been paid danger money for watching something as horrible as this. This is not porn. It is very strange and disturbing.” Dr Hempling said: “ The violence and blood in this film are real, not s timulated. You can see incisions clearly made with a knife and the blood welling up gradually .” “ Even more distressing scenes ”, the observer states, “ show a young male whose genitals appear to have been amputated and a young female wh ose genitals seem to have been subject to mutilation or serious interference .” Dr Hempling concluded: “ Before I saw this film, I was 99 percent sure these survivors could not be lying. Now I am 100 per cent sure. But how I wish I was wrong .” Judging by the following remark little has changed in England in the last 137 years."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"“In the present degenerate age anodyne necklaces an d galvanic rings sufficiently show that the connection between science and superstitio n remains unbroken...” [Encyclopaedia Metropolitana 1855, page 344] CHUTZPAH: THE SHAMELESS IMPUDENCE As is all too often the case, it is usually the vic tors account of history which is recorded and preserved. Unfortunately, the victors are not alway s the good guys. Winston Churchill and Theodor Herzl , for example, kept hour-by-hour accounts of some of the world shattering events in which they were involved . And Herzl, like Churchill, kept a careful eye on just what things were preserved, in order to pre sent an untarnished image of themselves to posterity. To the less fortunate however, what is a ctually said about them, or what actually took place, very rarely sees the light of day or appears on the printed page. What does appear after all, is almost always contrary to the spirit in which it was said or done, and often completely out of its original context. Impudent reporters outweigh the r espectable ones by an average of about 100 to 1, while the one being interviewed has little or no editorial control over a programme’s content, with no automatic right of reply. Radio and T.V. interviews are often so twisted, tha t even when confronted with a monitored copy of the original, the one who made the report will o ften brush it aside, pleading artistic licence, freedom of speech and freedom of the press; even th ough the answers you originally gave were to entirely different questions. This is Chutzpah, and our history books are full of it, together with the products of our press, radio, cinema, and television industries who don’t just report the news, but invent it. Whenever they want to invade a country, or topple s omeone who has “exceeded his service function” - like Saddam Hussein, for example, or Ir an’s Mossadegh, all the goverment of the day has to do is to leak the idea, or feed it to the pr ess and the Masonic network, of 7461 British Lodges, and overnight you hear the captains of indu stry trotting out statements , like I heard in 1979 from a former employer of mine and prominent S heffield Freemason. “Dave”, he said, “We need 3 million unemployed”. In three other cities that same week, I heard simil ar views, from three other Masons involved in engineering. In 1983, I was shown a report sent to an American p lastics machine manufacturer I was representing in Europe and the Middle East by ‘Carl ’, a British based American consultant, notifying us that it would be safe for Americans to invest in Britain, because it had been “decided” that Margaret Thatcher would be returned for another term with a strict mandate to “Break the Unions”. At that time, ‘Carl’ listed amongst his friends Nat Rothschild, John Delorian, Colin Chapman of Lotus, Paul Hughes, Senior Vice President of Pur chasing Ford Europe, and Derek Gentle , both of whom we met along with other senior manag ers on June 30th 1983, at Ford’s"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"corporate headquarters in Brentford. Meetings at this sort of level could be arranged by ‘Carl’ almost at the drop of a hat. The Ford visit was repeated at a similar sort of ex ecutive level at Xerox, Austin-Rover, Vickers, Fiat, Peugeot, and I.C.I. The handshakes were almost entirely masonic . Not long after this, I travelled up from London to Sheffield on the same train as Arthur Scargill and Peter Heathfield. At an appropriate moment I we nt and asked them if they were aware of the plan. A week or so later, I heard Scargill making m ention of undue American influence at work in Britain (apart from Ian McGreggor). The plan obviou sly suceeded. And Scargill’s pit closure figures proved to be a lot more reliable than all o f Thatcher’s henchmen. Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies, and those of her successor, and those of his successor, be it Smith or Ashdown, will not be able to alter the course set for us by the international bankers. In a speech to an assembly in Bradford, on the 29th April 1990, to a mixed assembly of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs and Hindus; having drawn th eir attention to the fact, that since coming to power in 1979, Mrs Thatcher had managed to more tha n double our national debt, from around £84,000,000,000 to £175,000,000,000; I made the fol lowing predictions about the outcome of her policies and those of her chancellor John Major: “Politicians are only allowed into the Palace of We stminster on the unwritten understanding that they never seek to hinder the fl ow of money and wealth to the financial institutions in the City of London, throu gh adverse legislation... Mr Major’s confident prediction that the economy was successfu lly on course - without humbly adding on the other hand: Insha’Allah - providing G od allows it - will regrettably prove to be as ill-judged, and unfounded, as those of his predecessor Nigel Lawson and many others who have found themselves in No.11 Downing S treet with the instruction to tell us to pick ourselves up on our own shovels And in a li ttle while, they will rank alongside those of the captain of the Titanic, who made simil ar predictions just before driving “ The ship that even God couldn’t sink” full-speed into t he iceberg. This economy, along with all those, that use our crazy fractional-reserve, d ebt-credit system are heading for another crash, like the 1930s. The bankers know it. The ban kers need it. And the bailiffs love it.\" The outcome of Mrs Thatcher’s actions prove conclus ively that she was in fact working on a hidden agenda to eliminate any organised local Brit ish opposition to American interests which might hinder any military operations from their uns inkable aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean: The U.S. Great Britain. She has also carried out he r other task on behalf of the banks, earning for herself in the process the title of “ The best bail iff’s man since Cromwell” and their usual reward for services rendered - the sack. With an occult network of lodges to play with, it i s easy to bring about changes inimical to a country’s interests, and favourable to those who le nd their money to the state. The Young Turk movement and the Bolshvik Revolution prove that all that is needed, are pliant captains of industry and corruption on the bridge. The rest is history - but whose version? Let us look at specific historical events, and the claims made by the Jews that they were unjustly treated, punished, or persecuted. I am not for one moment suggesting that this has not sometimes been the case. But as the prophet’s cousin, Ali , stated over a thousand years before Newton: “ For every action there is an equal and opposite rea ction”."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"For example, why do they say they were persecuted a nd unfairly treated by Napoleon I, The Sultan, and the Tzar? In the case of Napoleon, they say that he was an opportunist who prevented the genuine implementation of their legally bestowe d civil rights; however, the main complaint about him was, that having already been emancipated by him in 1791, he had no right to make them subject to new laws. This even though it was h e who ordered them to tear off their official yellow badges of shame in Italy, on February 15th 1 798, which the Lateran Council had ordered them to wear since 1215. They say that following th is he went on to humiliate their “Notables” with a list of “impudent requests”. “The ‘Pictorial History of The Jewish People’ by Na than Ausubel gives the following examples ” Though the Napoleonic Code had the practical effect of helping emancipate the Jews of Europe, the Emperor’s twelve questions appear to have been deliberately insulting and humiliating to the ‘Notables.’ Some of the questions were: Were Jews a llowed to be polygamists? Was it allowed for a Jewess to marry a Christian? Did French Jews feel any obligation of loyalty to France? Did Jewish law forbid taking usury from Jews but sancti oned it from Christians? Probably the most constructive question the emperor asked was about the need of a plan for stimulating the Jews of the Empire to take up the p ractice of arts and crafts, in order that they might learn to substitute dignified callings for th e disgraceful occupations to which for generations and centuries they had largely devoted themselves...The Grand Sanhedrin assembled in the Hotel de Ville on February 9, 1807, and elec ted Rabbi David Sinzheim as its president. It readily confirmed the decisions of its parent body. It also issued prohibitions against usury and introduced an innovation: civil marriage for Jews.\" [Page 153] Napoleon’s ban on usury , naturally went down like a lead baloon with the “ Notables”, namely the Rothschilds, who were already working against him, following his conversion to Islam in 1798 . In ‘ Bonaparte et l’Islam , pages 105-125, Napoleon shows his deep knowledge and understanding of the subject. “ Moses ” he said, “ has revealed the existence of God to his nation, Je sus Christ to the Roman world, Muhammad to the old continent ... Arabia was idolatrous when, six centuries after Jesus, Muhammad (re)introduced the worship of the God of Abraham, of Ishmael, of Moses, and of Jesus Christ . The Arians and some other sects had disturbed the tranquillity of the East by agitating the quest ion of the nature of ‘The Father the Son and the Holy Ghost.’ Muhammad declared that there w as none but one God, who had no father, no son, and that the trinity imported the i dea of idolatry ...” “The Parthians, the Scythians, the Mongols, and the Tartars and the Turks, had shown generally themselves to be enemies of science and t he arts, but this reproach cannot be fastened onto the Arabs, no more than upon Muhammad . The first Omayad Caliph, was a poet and he granted peace to a Rabbi, because he ha d prayed for grace in four beautiful Arabic verses.” “Al Mansour, Harun-al-Rashid and Al Mamun cultivate d Arts and Sciences. They were fond of literature, Chemistry, and Mathematics; the y lived with savants, caused the Greek and Latin Authors, the Illiad, the Odyssey, Euclid, etc., to be translated into Arabic, and founded schools and colleges for, Medicine, Astrono my, and Moral Science. Ahmed corrected the tables of Ptolemy; Abbas was a distin guished Mathematician; Costa, Alicude, Thabit, and Ahmed measured one degree of m eridian from Saana to Kufa. Chemistry, Alembics, Sun-Dials, Clocks and Numerica l Signs owe their existence to"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Arab invention. Nothing is more elegant than their moral tales; their poetry is full of fervour.” “Muhammad extolled everywhere the savants and such men as devoted themselves to a speculative life and cultivated letters... In the l ibrary of Cairo there were 6000 volumes on Astronomy, and more than 100,000 on other subjec ts; in the library of Cordova there were 3,000,000 volumes... Sciences and Arts reigned under the Caliphs and made great progress, which was brought to naught by the Mongol s.” “I hope that the time is not far off when I shall b e able to unite all the wise and educated men of all countries and establish a uniform regime based on the principles of the Quran which alone are true and which alone can lead men t o happiness... Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence ...” The official French Newspaper of its day, Le Moniteur , carried the accounts of his conversion to Islam in 1798, and mentions his new Muslim name whi ch was ‘ Aly Napoleon Bonaparte’ . He commends the conversion of General Jaques Menou , who became known as General ‘Abdullah-Jaques Menou ’, who later married an Egyptian lady, Sitti Zoubeida, who was descended from the line of the Prophet Muhammad, pe ace be upon him . Few people are aware of this aspect to the Battle of Waterloo, because as w e pointed out at the beginning, the history was written by the victors. Unfortunately, the victors once again, were the fri ends and patrons of usury, coalescing as usual around the house of Rothschild. It should come as n o surprise to learn that The Duke of Wellington was a close friend of Nathan Rothschild , and it was the collusion between the French and English branches of the Rothschilds that enabled them to smuggle Gold through France to Wellington in the Iberian Peninsular to p ay the troops fighting against France during the Peninsular war of 1808 to 1814. Later on, when he became British Prime Minister, Wellington took the brunt of popular outrage, and w as rightly accused of turning a blind eye to the hardship caused by the very same Rothschilds fo r whom their family members had fought and died, proving once again that gratitude has a short shelf life. A William Heath Cartoon of the period shows Prime M inister Wellington with his eyes closed playing blind man’s buff, pretending not to notice their plight. This was particularly galling for a people and a country which had successfully waged w ar to defend these banking houses, which were now sitting on their hands when what the peopl e needed was help and action, much like today. They say that God deals with the nations, as the nation deals wit h their usurers . If it fails to control them effectively, war and poverty eventuall y become their lot, because the sin is both on the giver and the receiver of the interest . Napoleon tried to rid Europe of usury, but failed in what was a valiant effort. Wellington on the other hand, sacrificed 30,000 Bri tish and Irish lives in a battle ostensibly waged to preserve the interests of those who had ca used the problem in the first place - the House of Rothschild. Wellington prevented the justifiable closure of their operations in the interests of world peace and sustainable global prosperity for a ll. Once again the Arch Bishops of European Usury, The Rothschilds, had managed to prevent the further liberation of Jews and Gentiles alike, by s uccessfully preventing Napoleon’s clear Islamic vision for Europe becoming a reality."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"However, “it was not long before Napoleon fully rev ealed his duplicity”, says Nathan Ausubel . [Ibid] “He engineered a Jewish decree through his rubber-stamp Chamber of Deputies on March 17, 1808, which was referred to b y French Liberals at the time as ‘l’infame decret’ (the infamous decree). It bristle d with special restrictions against Jews in all their business affairs. For example, before a Jewish merchant or shopkeeper could engage in trade he had to obtain a licence from the local prefect. But before he could get a licence he had to present a ”guarantee\" of his mo ral character from the Jewish Consistory as well as from the city authorities. Th e decree also ordered the expulsion of Jews from the Rhineland unless they consented to be come farmers.\" “Napoleon”, says Ausubel, “was more concerned with ‘using’ Jews to his own ends than with freeing them. By imperial decree on March 17, 1808, he ordered the institution of the ‘Consistoire’ (Consistory for Jewish Affairs). There was to be a central consistory for the whole empire... Each consistory was to be run b y two Rabbis and two laymen...The idea behind the consistory was a practical one: to keep the Jews in line with his purpose and to let it serve as an agency for supplying the army with Jewish recruits.” [ibid] In answer to the above charges, Napoleon had this to say on April 30, 1806, in speeches bef ore the Council of State: “ The Jews provided troops for my campaign in Polan d, but they ought to reimburse me: I soon found that they are no good for anything but selling old clothes...” “One cannot improve the character of the Jews by ar guments . For them must be established special exclusive laws.” [ The Secret World Government , page 87] “Legislation must be put into effect everywhere tha t the general well being is in danger. The government cannot look with indifference on the way a despicable nation takes possession of all the provinces of France. The Jews have to be treated as a special people . They are a State within a state ... The Jews are the master robbers of the modern age; they are the carrion birds of humanity ... They must be treated with political justice, no t with civil justice. They are surely not real citizens. The Jews have practiced usury since the time of Moses [Corah], and oppressed the other peop les . Meanwhile, the Christians were only rarely usurers, falling into disgrace when the y did so. We ought to ban the Jews from commerce, because they abuse it. The evils of the Jews do not stem from individuals but from the fundamental nature of this people .\" [From Napoleon’s ‘Reflections’ and from speeches before the Council of State, Apr il 30 and May 7, 1806; quoted in Antizion, page 13-14] All Napoleon ever tried to do was to get the Jews t o uphold their own Covenant of the Ten Commandments. He said: “I was compelled to proclaim laws against them for their usury, and the peasants of Elace have rendered me their thanks.” [ The Jews , page 11] The Holy Qur’an has the last say in the matter:"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"“Because of the wrong doings of the Jews, We forbad e them good things which before (their misbehavior) were lawful unto them. And beca use of their incesant hindering from God’s ways. And of their taking Usury when they wer e forbidden it, and of their devouring of people’s wealth by false pretences, We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful doom .\" [ Surah 4, An-Nisa’ (The Women), verses 160-161] In her ‘ Secret Societies and Subversive Movements’ Nesta H. Webster informs us of Napoleon’s attempt to extinguish Satanic Illuminism . She says: “When in ‘World Revolution’ I asserted that during the period that Napoleon held the reins of power the devastating fire of Illuminism w as temporarily extinguished, I wrote without knowledge of some important documents which prove that Illuminism continued without break from the date of its foundation all t hrough the period of Empire. So far, then, from overstating the case by saying that Illu minism did not cease in 1786, I understated it by suggesting that it ceased even fo r a brief interval. The documents in which this evidence is to be found are referred to by Lombard de Langres , who writing in 1820, observes that the Jacobins were (only) inv isible from the 18th Brumaire until 1813, and goes on to say: ‘ Here the sect disappears; we find to guide us durin g this period only uncertain notions, scattered fragments; the pl ots of Illuminism lie buried in boxes of the Imperial police .’\" [Like the papers ignored by the Warren Commission i nvestigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy] “But”, she says, “ The contents of these boxes no l onger lie buried; transported to the ‘Archives Nationales’, the documents in which the i ntrigues of Illuminism are laid bare, have at last been given to the public. Here there c an be no question of imaginative Abbes, Scotch professors, or American divines conjouring u p a bogey to alarm the world; these dry official reports prepared for the vigilant eye of the Emperor (Napoleon), never intended and never used for publication, relate cal mly and dispassionately what the writers have themselves heard and observed concerni ng the danger that Illuminism presents to all forms of settled government .” “The author of the most detailed report is one Fran cois Charles de Berckeim, special commissioner of police at Mayence towards the end o f the Empire, who as a Freemason is naturally not disposed to prejudice against secr et societies. In October 1810 he writes, however, that his attention has been drawn to the I lluminati by a pamphlet which has just fallen into his hands, namely ‘Essai sur la des Ill umines’ which, like many contemporaries, he attributes originally to Mirabea u. He then goes on to ask whether the sect still exists, and if so whether it is indeed: ”an association of frightful scoundrels, who aim, as Mirabeau assures us, at the overthrow of al l law and all morality, at replacing virtue by crime in every act of life.\" ( Archives Nationales F 6563, No.2449, Serie 2, No 49.)\" “Further, he asks whether both sects of Illumines h ave now combined in(to) one, and what are their present projects . Conversations with other Freemasons further incre ase Berckheim’s anxiety on the subject; one of the best informed on the subject observes to him: ‘ I know a great deal, enough at any rate to be convi nced that the ‘Illumines’ have vowed the overthrow of Monarchic governments and of all authority on the same basis .’"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Berckheim thereupon sets out to make enquiries, wit h the result that he is able to state that the ‘Illumines’ have initiates all over Europe , that they have spared no efforts to introduce their principles into the (masonic) lodge s, and ‘to spread a doctrine’ subversive of all settled governmen t ... under the pretext of the regeneration of soci al morality and the amelioration of the lot and condition of men by means of laws founded on principles and sentiments unknown hitherto and contained only in the heads of the leaders.\" [Their oral Talmudic laws] “ Illuminism’, he declares, ‘is becoming a great and formidable power, and I fear, in my conscience, that kings and peoples will have much t o suffer from it unless foresight and prudence break its frightful mechanisms (ses affreux ressorts).’” From information in the same archive F6563, two yea rs later, on January 16th, 1813, Mrs Webster informs us that Francois Berckheim writes again to the Police Minister: “Monseigneur, they write to me from Heidelberg ... that a great number of initiates int o the mysteries of Illuminism are to be found there . These gentlemen wear as sign of recognition a gold ring on the third finger of the left hand . On the back of this ring there is a little rose ... by pressing this with the point of a pin one t ouches a spring, by this means the two gold circles are detached. (Inscribed ) on the inside of the first of these circles is the device: ‘Be German as you ought to b e’, on the inside of the second of these circles are engraved the words ‘Pro Patria.’” Mrs Webster adds: “Subversive as the ideas of the Illuminati might be , they were therefore not subversive of German Patriotism. We shall find this apparent para dox running all through Illuminist movements to the present day.” [1924] [ Secret Societies and Subversive Movements , page 259] In ‘ The War of Anti-Christ with the Church and Christia n Civilization’ (1885), page 30, in a reference to Adam Weishaupt, the founder of latter day Illuminism, Monsignor Dillon states: “Had Weishaupt not lived, Masonry might have ceased to be a power after the reaction consequent on the French Revolution. He gave it a f orm and character which caused it to outlive that reaction, to energize [Through Lucifer ” The Seething Energy on the Block\"] to the present day, and which will cause it to adva nce until its final conflict with Christianity must determine whether Christ or Satan shall reign on this earth to the end .\" Berckheim drew up his great report on the secret so cieties of Germany in 1814, which, Mrs Webster says, are of considerable importance. His t estimony, she says, gains greater weight from the vagueness he displays on the origins of Illumin ism, and the role it played before the French Revolution, particularly in the absence of any refe rence to Robison and Barruel. [Points for the benefit of Professor Norman Cohn, author of ‘Warran t for Genocide’] She states: “The oldest and most dangerous association is that which is generally known under the denomination of the ‘Illumines’ and of which the fo undation goes back towards the middle of the last century. Bavaria was its cradle ... The Bavarian Government recognized the necessity of employing methods of repression an d even of driving away several of the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"principle secretaries. But it could not eradicate t he germ of the evil. The ‘Illumines’ who remained in Bavaria, obliged to wrap themselves in darkness so as to escape the eye of authority, became only the more formidable, the rig orous measures of which they were the object, adorned by the title of ‘persecution’, gained them new proselytes, whilst the banished members went to carry the principles of th e Association into other States...” “The doctrine of Illuminism is subversive of every kind of monarchy; unlimited liberty, absolute levelling down, such is the fundamental do gma of the sect; to break the ties that bind the Sovereign to the citizen of a state...” “Berckheim continues: ‘It would be a mistake if one confounded Illuminism with Freemasonry. These two associations, inspite of the points of resemblance in the [baseless] mystery with which they surround themsel ves, in the tests that precede initiation, and in other matters of form, are absol utely distinct and have no kind of connexion with each other. [Berckheim, remember, wa s a Freemason] The lodges of the Scottish Rite, it is true, number a few ‘Illumines’ amongst the Masons of the higher degrees, but these adepts are very careful not to b e known as such to their brothers in Masonry or to manifest ideas that would betray thei r secret... It is above all in the Universities that Illuminism has always found and always will find numerous recruits. Those professors who belong to t he Association set out from the first to study the character of their pupils. If a student gives evidence of a vigorous mind, an ardent imagination, the secretaries at once get hol d of him , they sound in his ears the words Despotism, Tyranny, Rights of the People, etc , etc. before he can even attach any meaning to these words, as he advances in age, reading chosen for him, conversations skilfully arranged, develop the germs deposited in his youthful brain ; soon his imagination ferments, history, traditions of fabulo us times, all are made use of to carry his exaltation to the highest point, and before eve n he has been told of a secret Association, to contribute to the fall of a soverei gn appears to his eyes the noblest and most meritorious act... [Prince Charles beware] At last, when he has been completely captivated , when several years of testing guarantee to the society’s inviolable secrecy and absolute de votion, it is made known to him that millions of individuals distributed in all States o f Europe share his sentiments and his hopes, that a secret link binds firmly all scattere d members of this immense family, and that the reforms he desires so ardently must sooner or later come about. This propaganda is rendered the easier by the exist ing associations of students who meet together for the study of literature, for fencing, gaming, or even debauchery. The Illumines insinuate themselves into all these circl es and turn them into hot-beds for the propagation of their principles.’ ( Archives Nationales F6563) Berckheim proceeds to demonstrate that some writers on Illuminism had been wrong, at least up until the time of his writing in 1814, in equating the organisation as simply Murder Incorporated, specializing in regicide, having at that point only the assassination of King Gustavus the III to its credit. He claims that these writers were more inte rested in seeking an effect than reporting the truth, and says:"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"‘The sect would be much less formidable if this wer e its doctrine. On the one hand, because it would inspire in most of the Illumines a feeling of horror which would triumph even over the fear of vengence. And on the other hand, because plots and conspiraci es always leave some traces which guide the authorities to the footsteps of the prime instigators [as they did for District Attorney Jim Garrison, enabling him to put on trial C.I.A. agent Clay Shaw for organising the assassination of President John F. K ennedy]; and besides, it is the nature of things that out of twenty plots directed against sovereigns, nineteen come to light before they have reached the point of maturity nece ssary to their execution... The ‘Illumines’ line of march is more prudent, more skillful, and consequently, more dangerous; instead of revolting the imagination by ideas of regicide, they affect the most generous sentiments: declamations on the unhappy st ate of the people, on the selfishness of courtiers, on measures of administration, on all acts of authority that may offer a pretext to declamations as a contrast to the seduct ive pictures of the felicity that awaits the nations under the system they (themselves) wish to establish, such is their manner of procedure, particularly in private. More circumspec t in their writings, they usually disguise the poison they dare not proffer openly, u nder obscure metaphysics or more or less ingenious allegories. Often indeed texts from Holy Writ serve as an envelope and vehicle for these baneful insinuations...’ “ [ Secret Societies and Subversive Movements , page 260-264] SATANIC PURSES One cannot fail to recognise the striking similarit ies between the events described above and those surrounding Rushdie’s ‘Satanic Verses’ and th e literary blitzkrieg of his allies - or ‘All- Lies’ - in their latest offensive in this ongoing s ubversive war against Divine religion and all moral order. “By this continuous and insidious form of propagand a ”, says Mrs Webster , “ The imagination of the adepts is so worked on that if a crisis arises, they are ready to carry out the most daring projects .” A perfect embodiment of this is the motto ‘Annuit C oeptis’ surmounting the Luciferian eye on ‘The Great Seal of the United States’ adorning the obverse side of every single dollar note of the F.R.B.S. (the Federal Reserve Banking System) which too was set up amid great secrecy and daring on Jekyl Island in 1910, described by Rockef eller agent Frank Vanderlip as an occasion on which he felt every bit a conspirator. In his me moirs he says: “Despite my views about the value to society of gre ater publicity for the affairs of corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive - indeed as furtive - as any conspirator... I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyl Island as the occasion o f the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.

The new law wil l create inflation whenever the trust wants inflation .” [and vise versa] Lindberg adds: “The Federal Reserve Act was, and still is, hailed as a victory of Democracy over ‘The Money Trust’ Nothing could be further from the trut h. The whole ‘Central Bank’ concept was engineered by the very group it was supposed to strip of power .” [ibid, page 161] These are just some of the fruits of this same occu lt organization re-started by Kolmer and Adam Weishaupt in 1776. John D. Rockefeller , infected with its spirit said: “ Competition is a Sin ”. [ibid, page 19/21] While ‘Annuit Coeptis’ means ‘Favour our daring und ertaking’, the lower part of ‘The Great seal of The United States of America’ bears the inscript ion ‘Novus Ordo Seclorum’, meaning ‘The New Order Of Ages / The New World Order’. Garry Allen says that the world has been set up for another 19 29 style Crash and Depression. “To think that the crash of 1929 was an accident or result of stupidity defies all logic. The international bankers who promoted the inflationary policies, and pushed the propaganda which pumped up the stock market, represented too m any generations of accumulated expertise to have blundered into the great depressi on .” [ibid, page 163] As Congressman Louis McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Commit tee tells us: “It [the 1926 depression] was not accidental. It wa s a carefully contrived occurence...The International Bankers sought to bring about a condi tion of despair here, so that they might emerge as rulers of us all .” [ibid] “It was the old game of boom and bust, using econom ic crisis to consolidate political power at the top where it can be most easily contro lled .” [ibid] In 1913 America’s National debt stood at $1 billion dollars. Since Woodrow Wilson took his vote of office, the National Debt has sky rocketed. By 1 976 it had exceeded $500,000,000,000. The interest alone was $27 billion."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"By 1992 the US Debt reached $3 trillion. Texas Bill ionnaire H. Ross Perrot says that if you put $3 Trillion in dollar notes on a stack, it would st and 63 miles high. Interest alone takes 52 cents from every tax dollar collected, and soon it will t ake 102 cents in every dollar. Nobody wants to reveal, however, to whom all these monies and inter est are owed, and how the stack got to be so high. “The major cause of inflation and the economic coll apse was the deliberately created credit inflation by the ‘privately-owned’ Federal R eserve.” [Equally deliberately used here by Nigel Lawson and the still privately owned and privately controlled Bank of England] “ In six years it had inflated the money supply by 62 % inducing market speculations and unwise investments by middle Americans who were bei ng set up for a shearing . When the shearing came, the sheep took a realistic look at their economy and panicked. Optimism was replaced by economic despair; despair produced a willingness to accept a major expansion of government controls over the eco nomy.” “Now, the Rockefellers are sharpening their shears to give the sheep of the world another trimming. But this time may be the last time . In 1929, America was a long way from total government. The next depression will be used as the excuse for complete Socialist- Fascist controls at home and the creation of a Worl d Super State internationally. ” [ibid, page 163] “Years ago ”, says Allen, “ Nelson Rockefeller reportedly demanded and received , the privilege of naming his men to top administrative p osts on all important Republican committees . The effect on the Republican Party is all too cle ar. It has been reliably estimated that over the years the Rockefellers have placed at leas t five thousand persons in important positions at the highest level of the Federal Government . The Rockefeller influence and authority now runs the top Civil Serv ice bureaucracy, thereby transcending the administrations of mere republicans and Democra ts. Having a big stake in an internationalist foreign policy, the Rockefellers a lways make sure that the Secretary of State and the Director of the (CIA) Central Intelli gence Agency are ”Their boys\". Marshall, Acheson, Dulles, Herter, Rusk, and Kissin ger [at the time of writing in 1976] have all laboured to turn the backward Soviet Union into a creditable power to force the great merger, while at the same time fighting wars to make the world safe for Standard Oil. The C.I.A. has served as the State Department’ s and Standard Oil’s enforcement arm, destroying genuine anti-communist movements ar ound the world... The CIA was created and staffed by Rockefeller relative Allen D ulles .\" “American foreign policy has meant billions of doll ars for the Rockefellers. It has been paid for in many cases by the blood of our soldiers and in every case by the sweat of our taxpayers .” “In his ‘ Reminiscences ’ John D. Rockefeller informs us: ‘One of our greatest helpers has been the State Dep artment in Washington. Our ambassadors, ministers and consuls have aided to pu sh our way into new markets to the utmost corners of the world .” “Washington reporter Jack Anderson put it this way in 1967:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"‘...the State Department has often taken its polici es right out of the executive offices of the oil companies . When Big Oil can’t get what it wants in foreign cou ntries, the State Department tries to get it for them .

The State Department can be found almost always on the side of the ‘ Seven Sisters’ , as the oil giants are known ... Just as the Rockefellers make sure they are running our perenia lly disasterous foreign policy, you can bet your last devalued dollar that the Rockefel ler Mafia controls the national and international money game. The Rockefellers have mad e the (US) Treasury Department virtually a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank.’\" [ The Rockefeller File , page 159] Now that’s what I call Chutzpah! The Cheek of the D evil. The result of Illuminism and its Luciferian doctrine. But even more astonishing is the fact that these darlings of the Jewish establishment control all the oil in Arab lands . In a footnote on page 19 of the Rockefeller File , Allen quotes Dr Malcolm Sten’s genealogy from his book ‘ The Grandees: America’s Sephardic Elite’ , which convincingly establishes the fact that the Rockefellers are Seph ardic Jews . Yet, “ The family controls oil holdings worth hundreds o f millions in Arab lands, yet Nelson has remained the darling of organized Jewry in New York City. Without such support he could never have been elected governor of New York State four times. Just how the family manages this bit of wizardry boggles the the mind ...” MORE CHUTZPAH “The changes, which affected European society as a whole, brought both new opportunities and new perils to Europe’s Jews”, says Professor Cohn. In a footnote on page 13 of his ‘ Warrant for Genocide’ , Professor Norman Cohn also states: “A myth can mean a false belief; it can mean an ima ginative construction by which people try to interpret the world around them; and since Georges Sorel it can also mean a faith which gives people a sense of mission and sti mulates them into action . Belief in a Jewish world-conspiracy has shown itself to be a my th in all these senses .” The Professor seems to have conveniently forgotten just why the Jews were dispersed to all points of the compass in the first place, and allow ed by ‘their’ God to be persecuted. He also seems to be completely ignorant of the Bilderberg a nd Round-Table Groups, the C.F.R. and the Trilateral Commission and Freemasonry; or the role- played by Judeo-masonic freemasonry in the success of the Bolshevic Revolution in Russia, to s ay nothing of Salonika and the Young Turk movement. Jeremiah explains the reason in chapter 29:17-19 “ Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold I will send upon them the sword, the famine and the pestilence, and make them as vile figs that can not be eaten, they are so evil. And I shall persecute them with the sword, the famine and the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whit her I have driven them because they have not hearkened to my words ...”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The following evidence proves conclusively the exis tence of a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, which is no longer a theory. The facts speak for themselv es. Professor Cohn should have known that the fatal combination of usury and Baal worship were th e real reason for the banishment of the Children of Israel and the Jews from Palestine. His Bible is crammed full of their exploits. To pretend that it was all a mistake is, in the wake o f the overwhelming evidence thus far provided, further proof that a conspiracy of chutzpah to obfu scate is well established. CARVED TURKEY How the East was lost SECRET From Sir Gerard Lowther to Sir Charles Harding (Pri vate and Confidential) Constantinople May 29, 1910 “Dear Charles, Gorst’s telegram of the 23rd April about the rumore d appointment of Mohamed Farid as delegate in Egypt of the Constantinople Freemasons , “said to be intimately connected with the committee of Union and Progress”, prompts me to write to you at some length on the st rain of continental Freemasonry running through the Young Turk movement . I do so privately and confidentially, as this new Freemasonry in Turkey, unlike that of England and America, is in great part secret and political, and information on the subject is only available in strict confidence, while those who betray its po litical secrets seem to stand in fear of the hand of the Mafia . Some days ago a local Mason who divulged the sign s of the craft was actually threatened with being sent before a court-martial, sitting in virtue of our state of siege. As you are aware, the Young Turkey movement in Pari s was quite separate from and in great part in ignorance of the inner workings of that in Salon ica. The latter has a population of about 140,000, of whom 80,000 are Spanish Jews , and 20,000 of the sect of Sabetai Levi (zevi) or Crypto-Jews , who externally profess Islamism . Many of the former have in the past acquired Italian Nationality and are Freemasons affiliated t o Italian Lodges . Nathan , the Jewish Lord Mayor of Rome, is high up in Masonry, and the Jewis h Premiers Luzzati and Sonnino , and other Jewish senators and deputies, are also, it appears, Masons . They claim to have been founded from and to follow the ritual of the “ Ancient Scottish .” ...The inspiration of the movement in Salonica would seem to have been mainly Jewish [ Atatürk also came from Salonica ], while the words “Liberté,” “Equalité”, and “Fratern ité”, the motto of the young Turks, are also the device of Italian Fre emasons ... Shortly after the revolution in July 1908, when the Committee established itself in Cons tantinople, it soon became known that many of its leading members were Freemasons... it was no ticed that Jews of all colours, native and foreign, were enthusiastic supporters of the new di spensation, till, as a Turk expressed it, every Hebrew became a potential spy of the occult (Balkan ) Committee, and people began to remark that the movement was rather a Jewish than Turkish Revolution ...\" The Gorst, mentioned by Sir Gerard Lowther to Sir C harles Harding was none other than Sir Eldon Gorst, who in 1907 had replaced Lord Cromer a s Chief British Agent and Consul-General in Cairo, a post Cromer had held from 1883. Gorst h ad good reason to be concerned about the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"activities of the “Committee of Union and Progress” , because, according to ‘The Times History of The War’, [Vol 3, pages 281-3], during his tenur e of office the Christian Premier, Butros Pasha Ghali, was assassinated by a student connected with that same Judeo- Masonic organisation, which as we now know, according to Sir Gerard Lowth er, was serving strictly Jewish ambitions. The ‘Times History’ goes on to say: “After the sadl y premature death of Sir Eldon Gorst, Lord Kitchener was appointed in his stead.” Sir Eldon Gorst, it seems, was instructed to avoid friction and “incidents.” He attempted a policy of conciliation, which apparently did not meet with success. He was nevertheless able to detatch the Khedive from the Extremist Nationalist Party an d curb the licence of the extremist press. After the appointment of Kitchener, it says, the ex tremist Nationalists lost ground and fled to Turkey, but the Khedive and the Ottoman Special Mis sion continued their intrigues. Sedition was scotched, but not killed. It does not mention how, when and where Gorst died. DEBT ON THE NILE The reason for Britain being in Egypt, was as usual material self-interest. Having opposed the Suez Canal project to begin with, once it had becom e a fact of commercial life, the City of London had to make sure it was not held to ransom b y the French. The ‘Times History’ states: “Great Britain had been opposed to the construction of the Suez Canal, which opened a new and shorter route to India to the Mediterranian Powers. Its completion made the fate of Egypt largely dependent on the will of the leadi ng Sea Power - Britain. In 1857 Lord Beaconsfield [Disraeli] purchased [with the aid of the Rothschilds] 176,602 original founders’ shares from the [financially] em barrassed Khedive . England having thus acquired a definite stake in the country was bound to intervene both in the management of the Canal and in the organization of Egyptian Finance. The problem of Ottoman-Egypt, like Ottoman-Turkey i tself, was one of indebtedness to the European Powers, primarily France and England. The Khedive, like the Sultan, was heavily in debt, and having become financially embarrassed was forced to sell his shares [but not necessarily] to Lord Beaconsfield in 1875. The Khedive was deposed by the Sultan of Turkey in 1879, with anarchy resulting under his successor Tewfik, with military mutiny inspired par tly by the very real grievances against foreign usurers and corrupt officials. Great Britain interv ened on behalf of the Khedive and restored order at Tel-el-Kebir in 1882... There were indeed severa l occassions on which her statesmen contemplated the withdrawal of the Army of Occupati on, but after the failure of the Anglo- Turkish negotiations of 1886-1887 it was recognised that this could only be effected, if at all, after many years. Inspite of the jealousy of France, whose politician s had allowed themselves to be manoeuvered into an attitude of hostility towards England by Ge rmany, the hostility of reactionary elements and of the Khedive Abbas II., who succeeded his fat her Tewfik in 1892, the financial bondage in which Egypt was held by international jealousies, t he abuse... and the fact that none of the Great Powers had definitely recognised our special positi on and interests in Egypt, our influence increased."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"...Six years later came the Anglo French agreement of happy augury, by which France, in return for concessions in Morocco and elsewhere, recognise d England’s special interests in Egypt, while England undertook to make no change in the politica l status of the country. The other European Powers, except, of course, Turkey, some sooner, som e later, recognised the occupation...\" Egypt, it must be remembered, was still part of the Ottoman- Islamic Empire. And the Khedive only ruled by the Firman of 1879. He was not empowe red to sell off the family silver or the Suez Canal. “The Khediveate was hereditary in the House of Muha mmad Ali according to the law of primogeniture. But the same Firman debarred the Khe dive from the raising of loans without the consent of the Sultan, and of keeping an army of mo re than 18,000 men in time of peace, nor could he conclude any treaty beyond certain commerc ial conventions with any Foreign Power. At the Sublime Porte Egypt was regarded as an autonomo us Ottoman province ruled by an hereditary Govenor-General appointed by the Sultan, though possessed of greater independence than other Ottoman ‘Valis’.” It seems hardly surprising that the Caliph of Islam was upset by these carryings on, and it is also clear that no government should ever borrow any money from for eigners to conduct public works, like the Suez canal. It should always increa se its own domestic money supply at zero interest and end up with assets and not liabilities , which give those same foreign powers a built-in time bomb, which could be activated when a pretext was required to invade and occupy a country . The events described here were also predicted by the last Prophet of Islam - Muhammad, who warned that the forces of Anti-Christ would com e and divide their lands like a roasted sheep at a feast, or in this case - carved Turkey? The en tire world is now at the mercy of these same ‘Banksters’, not only the Islamic community. The Ne w World Order is just the old one in disguise. The Judeo-Masonic machinations of Turkey’s Finance minister and betrayal of Palestine have yet to be fully investigated together with those of the Bahai Movement, and if not all, most of the current Sufi movements. Sheikh Abdel Kadir al Murabit alias Sheikh Abdel Kader as-Sufi (aka Ian Dallas ) is now promoting Nietzsche amongst his followers , and in the light of their history the Sufi groups with Turkish links are to b e viewed with some scepticism. Sir Gerard’s warning from his vantage point at the British Embassy in Constantinople endorses Lady Queenborough’s contention that the powers that had taken over Tur key constituted an Occult (Masonic) Theocrasy . In her book of that title, in the section concern ed with Associations of the 20th Century, Chapter CXIII, pa ge 585, entitled ‘The Young Turk Movement’, she makes the following observation: “Not till 1900, when the Grand Orient virtually too k over the Young Turk Party which was composed chiefly of Jews, Greeks and Armenians, did this movement assume a serious aspect .” Vicomte Leon de Poncins in ‘ The Secret Powers behind the Revolution’ [page 66], giving the history and origin of the ‘Young Turk’ Movement, ad ds the following information, taken from the Masonic organ of the Grand Orient: “ The Acacia (October 1908) A secret Young Turk counc il was formed and the whole movement was directed from Salonica . Salonica, the most Jewish town in Europe - 70,000 Jews out of a population of 100,000 - was sp ecially suited for the purpose. It"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"already contained several Lodges, in which the revo lutionaries could work without being disturbed . These Lodges are under the Protection of European d iplomacy . And as the Sultan was without weapons against them, his fall w as inevitable ... On the 1st May, 1909, the representatives of 45 Turkish Lodges met in Con stantinople and founded the ‘Grand Orient Ottoman’. Mahmoud Orphi Pasha was nominated Grand Master... A short time after a Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites was also founded and recognised by the French and Italian au thorities.\" [In April 1908 Tel Aviv was founded] According to Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedea, The Grand Orient of France and Italy [preparing for the onslaught against the strongly Christian Caliph ate of Russia] established similar Lodges in St Petersburg and other cities, which provided a simil ar networking platform in the Bolshevik Revolution. Kerenski’s entire government were membe rs. These lodges were closed in 1911, but re-opened again to carry out their original objecti ves, as pure political clubs without rituals. “To complete this information ”, says Lady Queenborough, “ we may add that two of the Salonica lodges, those of Macedonia and Labour & Lu x were connected with the Grand Orient of Italy and France.” The above extracts, are from official documents, one from Sir Gerard Lowther of the British Embassy in Constantinople, the other, from an official Masonic publication . Both confirm that the City of Constantinople fell to an army of between 7 0,000 and 80,000 occult Masonic Jews and 20,000 crypto-Muslim Jews, without a shot being fir ed . Furthermore these events were clearly foretold by t he Prophet Muhammad 1300 years beforehand, who also warned of The Great War within 6 years of its occurence, with the emergence of the Anti- Christ one year later. In Sahih Muslim , Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet Muhammad inquired: Have you heard of a city, of which part is in the s ea? Yes, they said [understanding him to mean Constantinople]. He said: “ The Last Hour shall not occur until 70,000 of the children of Isaac shall attack it . When they will come to it they will land down, but they will not fight with arms, nor shower it with arrows . They will only say : ‘ There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest’, and one of i ts sides will fall. They will recite it for the second time: ‘There is no god but Allah, and Al lah is The Greatest’, and another side of the city will fall. Afterwards they will recite for a third time: ‘There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest’, and then it will be opened to them, and they will enter it and acquire booty. While they will be dividing the spoils, a proclaimer will come to them and say: Verily Dajjal/Anti-Christ has come out. Th en they will leave everything and return .” In Mishkat al-Masabih another Hadith is quoted with the following additi on: “Within six years look to ‘The Great War’. Then aft er one more year the emergence of the Dajjal (or Anti-Christ) and Revolution which wo uld enter every Arab House, followed by mutual hostility between the Arabs .” Within six years of the ‘Young Turk’ revolution of 1908 and the fall of Constantinople to the 70,000 Jews as prophecied, the Great War began on s chedule. By November 1st 1914, Britain"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"had declared war on Turkey - within the time frame specified by The Prophet Muhammad - peace be upon him. Other significant events resulting fro m the fall of the Islamic Caliphate and the rise of the Jewish Caliphate are as follows: On January 5th 1915 the Turkish army was defeated i n the Caucasus. On August 29th Italy declared war on Turkey. On December 13th French and British troops occupied Salonika. The Arab Uprising in 1916, the Balfour declaration in 1 917, and the Bolshevik revolutions in the same year, brought with them terror on a massive sc ale. Following the fall of Jerusalem on December 9th 1917, came the destruction of the Turk ish army at Megido (Armageddon) on September 19th 1918, culminating in the ‘Peace to e nd all peace’- conferences on January 18th 1919, and here again we see the same well-tried con spiracies at work. Before moving on, I wish to give a third and final account of the Young ‘Turk’ revolution. This time from ‘ The Times History of the War’ [Vol XIV, Chapter CCXVII, page 308]. This establishes conclusively and contrary to Professor Norman Cohn’s statements in ‘Warrant for Genocide’ that there is and always was a Judeo-Maso nic Conspiracy with a strong anti-Islamic, anti-Orthodox Judeo/Christian tendency at work in t he world; responsible for all past and present trials and tribulations. The Times History says:- “In European Turkey the Spanish Jews, or Sephardim, as they call themselves, found two conditions essential for their prosperity - a benev olent government and a country in a low state of economic development. They settled in the chief commercial centres - Constantinople, Uskub, Sarajevo and above all Salon ika - and rapidly supplanted Greeks, Venetians, Genoese and Ragusans .” WANDERING JEWS “The settlement of the Sephardim in Rumelia was a n oteworthy epoch in the history of the Jews, for it marked the first retracing of thei r steps in the direction of Zion. But these Sephardim never girded themselves for the final sta ges of the road.” “ Salonika, with its 80,000 Jews [70,000. on page 11, Vol XII] speaking their inherited Spanish dialect, was already a Jewish home ; and who could expect a Jew, with his history of wandering behind him, to abandon lightly so fair an asylum? Loyalty and material interest combined to make the Sephardim stay where they were and stand by the Turks. They became linked to the Turks more intimately thr ough a crypto-Jewish Moslem community, the Dönme, descended from Sephardim conv erted in the seventeenth century .” “ The Dönme were represented by [Turkey’s finance minister] Djavid Bey , the financier, on the Committee of Union and Progress, and through Oriental Free Masonry , which they controlled, the Salonika Sephardim were associated from the beginning with the Young Turkish movement . In Turkey as in Hungary, and from the same mixed motives of gratitude and ambition, they threw in their lot wit h the ruling race, and they supplied the intellectual element in the new Turkish Nationalism .” “The author of the standard exposition of the ‘ Pan-Turanian Movement’ , who calls himself by the pure Turkish name of ‘ Tekin Alp’ , is believed to have been a Salonika"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Jew; and there is also reason to suppose that the s ecularising, anti-Islamic tendency which is so remarkable a feature in Pan-Turanianism was p artly the effect of this Jewish influence .” 80 In 1881 the Ottoman Debt had been consolidated and reduced to £160,000,000 Sterling. It was administered by a commission of the Public Debt, re presenting the creditors and under the control of France and England. The Commission ran the State Monopolies on Salt, Tobacco, etc., as well as the collection of various taxes. “ The whole system impaired Turkey’s sovereign righ ts.” [ The Diaries of Theodor Herzl , page 139] On June 17th 1896, on the Orient Express, that othe r wandering Jew, Theodor Herzl wrote in his Diaries: “Nevlinski believes that the Sultan’s only salvation lies in an alliance with the Young Turks - who for their part are on good terms with the Ma cedonians, Cretans, Armenians, etc., and in putting through reforms with their hel p. He had given this counsel to the Sultan in a report. I [Theodor Herzl] said, that in addition to this pr ogram he should provide with Jewish help, the means to carry it out .” “Let the Sultan give us that parcel of land [Palest ine] and in return we would set his house in order, regulate his finances, and influenc e world opinion in his favour... ” “Unprepared as I was, I merely said to him that we were figuring that we could give some 20 million pounds for Palestine ...We devoted 20 million Turkish pounds towards the regularisation of the Turkish finances. Of that sum we give two millions in exchange for Palestine - the amount being based on a capitalisat ion of its present annual revenue (T80,000). With the remaining 18 millions we free T urkey from the European-controlled Commission.” [ Sir Vincent Henry Pensalver Caillard was one of the heads of the Ottoman Public Debt Council] “The first four categories of bond-holders are indu ced by the privileges we grant them - viz: increased rates of interest, extension of amor tisation period, etc. - to agree to the suppression of the Commission.” [The Diaries of Theodor Herzl, pages 140-141] The above confirms the following statement by the f ormer Bank of England director Lord Stamp: “Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them with the power to create credit, and with a flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it all back again . Take this power away from them, and all the great f ortunes like mine would disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this world wo uld be a happier and better world to live in . But if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then continue to let bankers control money and cont rol credit .”"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"GUILT-EDGED INSECURITY A warrant for genocide As previously mentioned, Norman Cohn’s Warrant for Genocide, The myth of the Jewish World- Conspiracy and The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, prove beyond all reasonable and reasoned doubt that the eminently capable Dramatist , Playwright, Journalist, Feuilletonist, and short story writer Theodor Herzl was in fact the mo st likely plagiarist who stole the ideas embodied in them, and used them to bring about the devastating conditions through which ordinary, innocent every day Jews were sacrificed t o form the ‘guilt-edged’ purchase price of Palestine, referred to as “ The currency of the Hol ocaust”. Jim Allen’s play ‘Perdition’ was banned because it exposed the co-operation between the Zionists and Nazis towards this end. Nor was it by accident that Adolph Eichman was an h onoured pre-war guest of the Zionists in Palestine, long before his Jerusalem trial in 1961. Blood and Land had been the joint ideology of both Zionist and Nazi alike. Neo-Nazi and Ashkenazi ? By June 1895 Herzl had already stated to Baron de H irsch, that he had decided to abandon his existing plan for the emancipation of Jews and a Je wish National Home in Palestine because of the apathy among the mass of poor Jews. He then hit upon the master plan, which he estimate d correctly, would enable the Zionists to obtain Pale stine through the sympathy generated by the mass sacrifice of some of these same “poor Jews ”. The media images of those, when coupled with their global-Masonic power to influence, would eventually wring out of the guilty consciences of Britain, Europe and America that ‘li ttle parcel of land’ with the promise of money and political advantage, to those who acquiesced. The postscript in his letter to Baron de Hirsch on June 18th 1895 exposes his design, not, of course, mentioned by Professor Cohn. However Cohn’s publication does include some valuable data, which ought to be studied by all those who ar e interested in establishing the truth of both the Holocaust and the price paid by Arabs, Jews and Bri tish servicemen for Palestine. Because of his ‘ignorance’ of the letters and telegrams of Sir Ger ald Lowther, The Acacia of 1908, the Times History of the War, and the Masonic aspects of the Young Turk and Bolshevik Judeo-Masonic Lodges, and Herzl’s diaries, professor Cohn’s Conclusions in ‘ Warrant For Genocide’ must be rejected. While serving well as a stop-gap, damage control me asure, Cohn’s appology however is both misleading, and in the long term even more dangerou s, because he fails to recognise or take into account - let alone challenge - all the forces at w ork; or alert the world of Jews and Gentiles alike to the real author and inspirer of these evil Satan ic Protocols and the Satanic Voices and visions they encapsulate. Cohn opens his very biased argument in Chapter one, whi ch he calls: “ The Origins of the Myth ” as follows: “Over very large areas of the earth Jews have tradi tionally been seen as mysterious beings, endowed with uncanny, sinister powers. This attitude goes back to the time, from the second to the fourth centuries after Christ (he obviously hasn’t read the Old Testament), when the Church and the Synagogue were competing for converts in the Hellenistic world, and when moreover each was still struggling to win adherents from the other. It was to terrorise the judaising Christians of Antioch into final breach with the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"parent religion that St John Chrysostom called the Synagogue ‘the temple of demons ... the cavern of devils ... a gulf and abyss of perdit ion ’ and portrayed Jews as habitual murderers and destroyers, people possessed by an ev il spirit . And it was to protect his catechumens against Judaism that St Augustine descr ibed how those who had been the favourite sons of God were now transformed into son s of Satan. Moreover the Jews were brought into relation with that fearsome figure, An tichrist, ‘the son of perdition’, whose tyrannical reign, according to St Paul and the Book of Revelation, is to precede the second coming of Christ.” “Many of the Fathers taught that Antichrist would b e a Jew and that the Jews would be his most devoted followers [this is confirmed in the Hadith] ... From the tim e of the first crusade onwards Jews were presented as children of the Devil, agents employed by Satan for the express purpose of combating Christianity a nd harming Christians. It was the twelfth century that they were first accused of mur dering Christian children, of torturing the consecrated wafer, and of poisoning the wells.. .” “ But above all it was said that that Jews worshipped the Devil, who rewarded them collec tively by making them masters of black magic... In the eyes of most Christians these strange creatures were demons in human form...” Contrary to overwhelming evidence in the Old and Ne w Testaments, to say nothing of other data, scriptural or otherwise, Professor Cohn is saying that no sections of the He brew community were involved in devil worship or Satanic rituals, parti cularly the sect who called themselves Jews . However, it is clear from the reverend T. K. Cheyney, M.A . and Lecturer on Hebrew and the Old Testament at Balliol College Oxford in June 1880, that even the use of the name ‘Jehovah’ as a title for God, constitutes blasphemy, and is, in fact, another name for Satan . More on this can be found in the chapter entitled ‘Unmasking Jehovah-Jah-Bal-On’ . The Rev. Cheyney states, he “has retained the familiar rendering ” The Lord\" fo r the name of God, feeling that without a lengthened explanation the correct form could hardl y be made palatable to ordinary students. The form “Jehovah” is unhesitatingly to be rejected, du e to a misunderstanding of comparatively modern origin.\" [Variorum Teachers Bible, page 2] There is an Elohist account of the Bible and a Jaha vist account. Some Jewish converts to Islam still continue their habit of not writing or pronou ncing the name of Allah, using All-h instead, even though the Qur’an begins all but one chapter w ith the opening lines “In the name of Allah ”. According to William Grimstad’s survey of 575 leading personalities on organised J ewry, ‘Antizion’, the 19th Century Occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky , founder of the Theosophical Society, who died in London on May the 8th 1891, ha d this to say in ‘ Isis Unveiled’ : “The Brazen Serpent of Moses was worshipped by the Israelites as a god; being the symbol of Esmun-Asklepius, the Phoenician Iao . Indeed, the character of Satan himself is introduced in the first book of Chronicles in the a ct of instigating King David to number the Israelitish people, an act elsewhere declared s pecifically to have been moved by Jehovah (the devil) himself. The inference is unavoidable that the two, Satan an d Jehovah, were regarded as identical .” “This, and Madam Blavatsky’s other major work, ‘ The Secret Doctrine’ ”, says Grimstad , “are rife with references to the ‘Jewish god’, Jeho vah or YHVH, as essentially a demonic force . It was for this reason, Blavatsky believed, that the Jews have always maintained"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"such clandestinity in all matters pertaining to the god - to the extent of keeping secret the true pronounciation of its name. And, in fact, ther e is even a ritual condemnation to death of those who discuss these matters with non-Jews.

This obscure group follow the “black book” written by Shaykh Hassan ibn Davasin or Danayye, which is based on “Manichae nism”, a syncretic, dualistic religious philosophy taught by the Persian founder of the sec t - Manes - in around the third century A.D., according to which God and Satan reign as equals. I t combines elements of Zoroastrian, Christian, and Gnostic thought. The Qur’an eliminat es this false concept, reminding us that there is only one God, and that we should seek his protec tion from the evil of what He created to test humanity.] The two bible references to Jehovah as the devil ar e: II Samuel 24:1; “And again the anger of the LORD was kindled agains t Israel, and he moved David against them, to say, go number Israel and Judah.\" And I Chronicles 21:1; “And SATAN stood up against Israel, and provoked Da vid to number Israel...\" THE USE OF THE NAME JEHOVAH ONLY BEGINS IN EXODUS It is clear from Exodus VI: 2-3, that the introduct ion and use of this name Jehovah never referred to the name of the God of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob. The reference to it being of relatively modern origin by the Rev T. K. Cheyney, and the war ning that it must be rejected “unhesitatingly\", are to be taken very seriously in deed, as should Madam Blavatsky’s confirmation that the illegal numbering of Israel b y David was at the instigation of the Satan, in I Chronicles 21:1, and that in II Samuel 1-9, Satan i s referred to as The Lord, i.e. Jehovah. Exodus VI: 2-3 ; “And God spoke to Moses, and said unto him, I am th e Lord: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.” To those familiar with the cover-up of facts relate d to monetary reform and the secret war against those who would try to bring to light the corruptio n and conspiracy of the usurers, it should be easy to realise that those same corrupters did not leave their scriputures unaltered or uncorrupted in their lust for absolute power. Only the Qur’an has survived unaltered, while the Gospel of Barnabas is the closest rendition of the original testament of Jesus, Isa Mac Mariam ."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"GENERIC ENGINEERING They say that Genetic Engineering deals with the mo dification of the structure of chromosomes in living organisms, in such a way to benefit man. Gen eric Engineering on the other hand, deals with the altering of names relative or relating to an entire group or class. In the drug industry for example a branded product may be prescribed under i ts generic chemical name without a trademark or title, either way the efficacy of the pill or potion is not affected by the missing label , although one must not discount entirely the placebo effect of a recognized brand name on a nation of consumers subjected to hours of TV advertising. But generally it is the chemical formulation that counts. The common or garden aspirin formula becomes many n ames in many different companies and countries. So what’s in a name? Obviously an awful lot, because companies spend fortunes on trade marking and copyrights which influence or mai ntain market share; to say nothing of patents and ubiquitous advertising. Even though the general public is swayed one way or other to buy this brand or that, the contents of the tablets in the b ottles remain identical. Much like certain brands of petrol that are refined at the same plant delive red in the same tankers, but sold at different prices under different names. Therefore, Generic Engineering, Badge Engineering, head swapping or product assimilation, call it what you may, is an ongoing process, and it is a process that has been going on for centuries. Particularly in the areas of theology, mythology, cults and legends. And no-where is the evidence of Generic En gineering more obvious, than in the mysteries, personalities, and festivals adopted by Western and Eastern Christianity; festivals and ideas, which pre-date the birth of Christ by severa l thousand years, and in themselves are products of a purely pagan nature and origin; casti ng doubt on the entire body of church opinion, morals and dogma. The identical stories and plays of a crucified son of God, leave one in no doubt that the process of generic engineering has played an indispensible and active roll in passing off and maintaining the ancient system of pagan beliefs and practices, unde r a generic name called Christianity, which has nothing what so ever to do with Christ Jesus, the s on of Mary, but everything to do with his antithesis. [Tadlees Iblis] Babylon more than Pharaonic Egypt heads the list of places where corruption and occult practices predominated. It was and still is called ‘ard al fi tna’ - the land of mischief. Saddam Hussein has once again demonstrated its ancient character and b rought upon the people of Iraq a similar fate, by an even greater devil. But that should not surpr ise anyone. What more can one expect from a man who squandered tens of millions of dollars reco nstructing the ancient city of Babylon, destroyed by God for its abominations, and boastful ly carving his name on every piece rebuilt, endorsing - wittingly or otherwise - all the evil d one during its turbulent history. ‘Babylon: that whore of cities.’ But Saddam Hussein is a mere novi ce when it comes to rebuilding Babylon. Western and Eastern Europe have constructed a hundr ed cities, as evil if not worse than the worst of Babylon. New York, Washington, Paris, London, Lo s Angeles, San Francisco, Sydney, etc. all out-do it in terms of perversion and occult practic es. London is now considered to be the occult capital of the world. However, the most worrying aspect of all this is it s effect on the Christian Church and the hundreds of millions of souls, which have been dece ived into acting-out, over the centuries, pagan rituals of mainly Babylonian and Egyptian ori gin, in the name of Jesus the Messiah. For example, the passion story of the Lord of Christianity and t he passion story of Bel, the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Babylonian Sun God, are identical . But through the process we call ‘Generic Engineerin g’, the names have been changed in order to hoodwink the pe ople . For a lie to succeed, it must contain an element of truth; therefore the true story of th e long awaited messiah, to be born of a virgin as a sign to all humanity, was currency long before hi s arrival; and during that time, many tried to claim that title for either himself, his friend, or his family. So by the time the Messiah did appear, the extravagant claims about his nature and his pur pose would not allow those who should have known better to believe him when he said that he wa s not God incarnate, only His faithful servant. As in the case of most forms of hero worship, they wanted him to be what he was not, and conform to their own desires, and be or claim to be , the God they had created in their own image. When they couldn’t get him to go along with their e arlier extravagant claims to Godhood, advising them, that it was the duty of the privileg ed to serve, not to exploit the less fortunate; and that he, like earlier prophets, intended to continu e in the practice of noblesse oblige; they tried to kill him, because under those conditions they would not be able to maintain their special status or continue to exploit the existing situation to their advantage, nor would they wish to abandon their pride. So they resorted to character assassination by calumny, accusing him of their own crime in order to get rid of him, and maintain the status qu o by the traditional method of execution: Crucifixion. Furthermore, if they could bring about the ‘death of god who had fallen into their power’, they would become more powerful than Him. A t least that’s the idea behind the imitative magic process; you act out or put into words, what your heart desires, like a spider in its webb, and wait for the unsuspecting to come along. Like t he story of Puss in Boots. Puss gets the Ogre to fall into the trap he lays for him. Puss says to the Ogre I bet you can’t change yourself into a lion, and like Saddam Hussein, his vanity gets the better of him and performs the magic act transforming himself into a ferocious lion, then th e cat with all his guile says, oh that’s very impressive, but I bet you can’t change yourself int o something as small as a mouse; a challenge to which the proud Ogre immediately responds; at which point the cat pounces on the Ogre-turned- mouse, kills him and eats his body and blood, and b y so doing becomes more powerful than the Ogre. Satan fell through pride, and Adam fell when Satan convinced him that he could become immortal and equal with God. The foolish notion that God would ever allow Himsel f, even if it were possible, to be pounced on and humiliated, let alone crucified in order to sat isfy man’s perverse narcissism, is folly raised to its highest power. This morbid love of self is one of the main causes of man’s continuing addiction to the idea of wanting to become equal wi th God. Allah says: “And verily we made a covenant of old with Adam, bu t he forgot, and We found no constancy in him. And when We said to the Angels: f all prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate all except Iblis; who refused. Therefore We said: O Adam! this is an enemy unto you and to your wife. So let him not drive you both out of the garden so that you have to toil. It is vouched safe unto you that you will not hunger there nor will you feel naked. Nor will you feel thirst or exposure to the sun’s heat. But the Devil whispered to him saying: O Adam! shal l I show you the tree of Immortality and Power that wastes not away? Then the two ate th ereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them...

In t he past, men driven by this impulse have brought into conformity some astonishing and outrag eous ideas relating to God, to the extent that now we are in a situation where the myth has become the reality, through a continuing process of self-deception by reason, rationalisation. Foremost among these deceptions is the continued ad herence by the Christian churches to the pagan Passion Story and its calendar, through which the process we have come to call ‘Generic Engineering’ has extinguished virtually everything relating to the authentic beliefs, teachings and practices of Christ, the Messiah, son of Mary the v irgin, who they call Jesus; and even that is not his proper name. His name in Hebrew was Yashuah or Joshua, in Arabic it is Isa, and in Gaelic he is called Isa Mac Mary or Mariam. The name Jesus is to do with the son of Ja-Zeus the Sun God, and is alien to the Hebrew name of God. “The story of Bel and the story of Jesus are one an d the same, and this not only deprives the evangelical records of the claims to be genuine but it convicts them of complete plagiarism”, says Kamal-ud-Din in his ‘ Sources of Christianity’ . The following is from the January 1922 edition of “ Quest” which describes the tablets belonging to the cuneiform documents, which were discovered b y German excavators in 1903 and 1904 at Kalah Shargat, the site of the ancient Assur formed in the 9th century BC or even earlier. There are, however, copies of still earlier Babylonian ta blets, says the writer, which also contain astounding facts, which would be perturbing to thou sands of honest minds in Christendom. [if only they were allowed to know of them] It is not ( only) the similarity between the two stories of Jesus and Baal/Bel that should excite their astonis hment: The two being one and the same. The Babylonian Passion Play 900 BC The Christian Pa ssion Story 1992 AD Bel/Baal is taken prisoner. Jesus is taken prisone r. Bel/Baal is tried in the house on the Mount and the (the Hall of Justice) of the High Priest. Jesus is tried in the house Hall of Pilate. Bel/Baal is smitten (wounded). Jesus is scourged. Bel/Baal is led away to the Mount. Jesus is led away to crucifixion on Mount Calvary. Together with Bel/Baal put to death. Another, who is also charged as a malefactor is let go, thus not taken taken away with Bel/Baal. Together with Jesus, two a malefactor is led away malefactors are led away and and put to death. Another, (Barrabbas) is released to the people, and thus not away with Jesus. After Bel/Baal had gone the to the Mount, the city breaks out i nto tumult, (Synoptic), the earth quakes, and fighting takes place in it. At the death of Jesus, the veil in the temple is re nt the rocks are rent asunder, the graves are opened, and the dead come forth into the holy city (Matt). Bel’s/Baal’s clothes are carried away.

Bel/Baal goes down into the mount away from sun and light, and is held fast in the Mount as in a prison. Jesus, in the grave, disappears from life, in the rock tomb (Synopt), goes down into the realm of the dead (1 Pet.III.19,Matt XII. 40, Acts II 24, Rom.X.17, “descent into hell” dogma) Guards watch Bel/Baal imprisoned in the stronghold of the Mount. Guards are set over the tomb of Jesus (Matt). A goddess sits with Bel/Baal; she comes to tend him. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sit before the tomb (Matt., Mark). They seek for Bel/Baal where he is held fast. In particular a weeping woman seeks for him at the “Gate of Burial.” When he is being carried away the same lamented “O, my brother!

Mary stands weeping before the empty tomb because they : have taken h er Lord away. (John) Bel/Baal is again brought back to life (as the sun of spring) he comes again out of the mount. Jesus’ restoration to life, his rising from the gra ve (on a SUN-day morning). His chief feast, the Babylonian New Year’s festival in March at the time of the Spring Equinox is celebrated also as his triumph over the powers of darkness. His festival, approximately at the Spring Equinox, is also celebrated as his triumph over the powers of s darkness (cp.e.g Col.II 15). The Sun was the Dying God of the ancient world. Aft er his birth on December 25th the young deity increases every day in his power and strength , and defies the demon of darkness in the struggle, till the final week in March comes, when his progress is retarded and he becomes stationary. [Note: Easter varies from around the 21st March up to the 19th of April, as it follows the sun’s cycle (Collins, Table of movable feasts)] The struggle between the two seems to have come to a climax, and the devil appears to be going to have the better of the conflict. Therefore, it i s a time of great anxiety and apprehension - a day of mourning and weeping for the maidens of Adonis; the suffering God undergoing his last ordeal; Herculese gone into Hades; Attis is nailed to the trunk of a pine tree - in short, the dead god is interred in the tomb, but two days after, al l sorrow and weeping change into merriment, the Sun-God has finally overcome the forces of darkness . The Sun God has passed the Rubicon, i.e. the Equator. Now, Herculese can begin ascending fro m the underworld. Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, Baal/Bel and Jesus can begin rising from their resp ective tombs. The date of the Dying God and that of the Rising Go d, therefore, become great events and are attended respectively with mourning and rejoicing - just what we would have found 900 BC in Ancient Babylon on Good Fridays and Easter Sundays then, so we find the same today in the Modern Pagan West where nothing has changed except the name of the Sun God. If we were living in York or Chester and the date w as March 31st 50 BC, we would be be preparing for the same Easter festival following th e same Christmas festival on or around the 25th of December during which time we would have commemo rated his birth to a virgin mother in a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"cave; one who had 12 disciples; one who was called saviour; and one who sometimes figured as a lamb; one whose disciples were initiated through ba ptism; and one in whose rememberance sacramental feasts were held.

All these deities were sun-gods, and it was believe d that they were born in a cave or underground chamber, of a virgin mother, on or about Christmas Day. They led a life of toil for the good of mankind and were called by such names as “Light-Bri nger”, “Healer”, “Mediator”, “Saviour”, and “Deliverer”. They were vanquished by the Powers of Darkness and descended into Hell or the Underworld. They all rose again from the dead to become the “Li ghts” to guide mankind to the heavenly world. They founded Communions of Saints, and churc hes into which disciples were received by baptism. They were commemorated by Eucharistic Meal s. Adonis - the Syrian god, born of a virgin was killed and rose again in the spring . Every year “ The maidens wept for Adonis (Ezekiel VIII 14) and t hen rejoiced over his resurrection .” Attis - The Phrygian god, was also born of a virgin named Nana . He was bled to death at the foot of a pine-tree. His blood renewed the fertility of the earth and thus brought a new life to humanity. He also rose from the dead ... In celebrating his death and resurrection, his image was fastened to a pine tree on March 24th, and the day was called “The Day of Blood”, since on that day the deity was bled to death. The image was then laid in a tomb with wailing and mourning, but the coming night changed sorrow into joy. The tomb was found to be empty on the next day , when the festival of the resurrection was celebrated. These mysteries seem to have inclu ded a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood. Bacchus - Sometimes called Dionysus , was born of a virgin named Demeter on the 25th of December [she is sometimes called Semele and sometimes Cere s from which we derive the word cereal, seen on Bank of England notes seated with a stem of wheat in her hand ]. Evil had spread over the world, the God of Gods was begged to save mankind. Jupiter hearkened to the prayer, and declared that his son would redeem the world fr om its misery. He promised a Liberator to the earth, and Bacchus came as a saviour. He was called “ The Only Begotten Son ”. “It is I”, says Bacchus to mankind, “Who will guide you; I who am Alpha and Omega.” He was also a great traveller, and brought the gift of win e to mankind.

On the other hand, we ignore the glaring similarities in Hebrew and Arabic , which are not merely phonetic. Their meanings are also very often identical . But from a reading of translations of scripture little or no reference is made to the fac t that the God of the Arabs and the Ishmaelites is also the same God as the one of the Israelites and the Jews. This fact is conspicuously absent from most, if not all books on the subject, because the establishment of a link would undermine the carefully created myth that Islam, by compariso n to Judaism and Christianity, is a relatively modern phenomenon, of Arabian origin, with no legit imate antecedents. The most disturbing aspects of this Myopic Paralogy, is the dreadful di shonesty of most non-Islamic commentators. The foreword in George Sale’s translation of The Ko ran, for example, is both spiteful and misleading, and contains a completely dishonest com mentary on the Gospel of Barnabas , confirming historic prejudices, caused by malevolen t envy towards God’s last prophet and His most favoured guest of honour, “ Machammad ”. Therefore, all scriptures containing news of his advent had to be confiscated and concealed in order to avoid embarrasment and injured pride. Jesus advised us not to seat ourselves at the head of the table in case the host has invited someone more worthy than you to sit by his side. Lucifer’s latent narcissism caused him to fail the test set for him. The love of self prevented him from accept ing Adam’s appointment to the position Lucifer had previously taken for granted. Likewise, the followers of Judaism rejected the appointment of Jesus, and together with Christians resent God’s final guest of honour, Muhammad - Machammad or “Desire” in Hebrew: The des ired prophet of all nations including the Gentile Goyim, as we will see from the followin g account. “One skilled in the law invited Jesus to supper, in order to tempt him. Jesus came thither with his disciples; and many scribes to tempt him w aited for him in the house. Whereupon, the disciples sat down to table without washing their hands.

Assur edly it is necessary that thou do something for love of God.’ Abraham answered: ‘Behold the servant of God, ready to do all that wh ich God shall will.’ Then spoke God, saying to Abraham: ‘Take thy son, thy first born Is hmael, and come up the mountain [Arafat near Mecca] to sacrifice him.’ How is Isaac first born, if when Isaac was born Ishmael was seven years old?’ Then said the disciples: ‘Clear is the deception of our doctors; therefore tell us thou the truth, because we know thou art sent from God.’ Then answered Jesus: ‘Verily I say unto you, that S atan ever seeketh to annul the laws of God; and therefore he with his followers, hypocrite s and evil doers, the former with false doctrine, the latter with lewd living, today have c ontaminated almost all things, so that scarcely is the truth found.

Allah answers: ‘Jesus, I will pardon him, only caus e him to say, ‘Lord my God, I have sinned, have mercy upon me’, and I will pardon him and restore himself to his first state.’ ‘I rejoiced greatly,’ said Jesus, ‘when I heard thi s, believing that I had made this peace.

Fre emasons and Illuminati followers are reminded that Solomon was not a freemason or involv ed in Illuminism, nor any sort of occult activities, nor was any other prophet or messenger. “There is no good in most of their secret counsels except in him who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation between people. And who ever does this, seeking Allah’s pleasure, We will give him a mighty reward.” [ Qur’an , 4:114] “...Seest thou not that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. There is no Secret Counsel between three, bu t He is the fourth of them, nor between five but He is the sixth of them, nor betwe en less than that nor more but He is with them where ever they are; Then He will inform them of what they did on the day of Resurrection. Surely Allah is Knower of all things. ” [ Qur’an, 58:7] “And they [the freemasons] follow what the devils f abricated about the Kingdom of Solomon. And Solomon disbelieved not, but the devil s disbelieved, teaching men enchantment...” [ Qur’an, 2:102] Like all prophets, Solomon was a Muslim! THE REVOLT AGAINST ISLAM The Origins of the ‘Enlightenment’ Tom Stoppard , mentioned ‘Enlightenment’ several times in connec tion with the recipient of Satanic Inspiration - author and novelist Salman Ru shdie. Rushdie also uses the expression quite freely . But where did the expression originate? The latter day revival of the Enlightenment movemen t or the Illuminati, as it is sometimes called, really begins with Adam Weishaupt, who was born in Germany in 1748. He studied theology and became a clergyman, and then abandoned Christianity , becoming an apostate professor at Ingoldstadt University. Later on, we shall let Albe rt Pike, the American head of both the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite and Universal Freemasonr y, spell out what they mean by enlightenment. But when did it all start?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The title of chapter two in Nesta H. Webster’s ‘Secret Societies and Subversive Movements’ catalogues the efforts of subversive sects hitherto directed at Christianity and Orthodox Judaism, but now preparing for the ‘Revolt against Islam.’ S he says until 770 A.D. or there about, no group of Muslims from either Sunni or Shia had ever devia ted from the fundamental doctrines of Islam, their only difference being the line of Imams. But on the question of the Unity of God, the Prophethood of Muhammad, and the divine authority o f the Qur’an there were no differences. Mrs. Webster points out that the revolt against Isl am was begun in a subdivision of the Ismaili Sect, by Abdullah ibn Maymun around 872 A.D., “An intriguer of extraordinary subtlety, who succee ded in capturing the movement”, and so a movement, which had thus far been only schisma tic “now became definitely subversive, not only of Islam, but of all religious belief.” She says: “This man, Abdullah ibn Maymun, the son of a learne d and free-thinking doctor in Southern Persia, brought up in the doctrines of gnostic dualism and profoundly versed in all religions, was in reality, like his father, a p ure materialist. By professing adherence to the creed of orthodox Shi-ism, and proclaiming a kn owledge of the mystic doctrines which the Ismailis believed to have descended throu gh Ismail to his son Mohammed, Abdullah ibn Maymun succeeded in placing himself at the head of the Ismailis.” But his advocacy of Ismail was merely a mask, she s ays, “his real aim being materialism, which he now proce eded to make into a system by founding a sect known as the Batinis with seven deg rees of initiation .” She quotes from ‘ Spanish Islam’ by Reinhart Dozy , who, she says, gives the following description of this amazing project: “To link together into one body the vanquished and the conquerors; to unite in the form of a vast secret society with many degrees of initi ation free-thinkers - who regarded religion only as a curb for the people - and bigots of all sects; to make tools of believers in order to give power to sceptics; to induce conqu erors to overturn the empires they had founded; to build up a party, numerous, compact and disciplined, which in due time would give the throne, if not to himself, at least to his descendants, which was Abdullah ibn Maymun’s general aim - an extraordinary concept ion which he worked out with marvellous tact, incomparable skill, and a profound knowledge of the human heart. The means which he adopted were devised with diabolical cunning... It was (however) not among the Shi-ites that he sought his true supp orters , but among the Gherbers, the Manicheans, the pagans of Harran , and the students of Greek Philosophy; on the last could he rely. To them alone could he gradually unfold the final mystery, and reveal that Imams, religions and morality were noth ing but an imposture and an absurdity . The rest of mankind - the ”asses,\" as Abdullah ca lled them - were incapable of understanding such doctrines. But to gain his end h e by no means disdained their aid; on the contrary, he solicited it, but he took care to initiate devout and lowly souls onl y into the first grades of the sect [like the blue degrees of freemasonry]."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"... His [Maymun’s] missionaries, who were inculcate d with the idea that their first duty was to conceal their true sentiments and adapt them selves to views of their auditors, appeared in many guises, and spoke, as it were in a different language to each class. They won over the ignorant and vulgar by feats of legerd emain, which passed for miracles, or excited their curiosity by enigmatical discourse. I n the presence of the devout they assumed the mask of virtue and piety. With mystics they were mystical, and unfolded the inner meanings of phenomena, or explained allegorie s and the figurative sense of the allegories themselves... By means such as these the extraordinary result was brought about that a multi tude of men of diverse beliefs were all working together fo r an object known only to a few of them...\" Mrs. Webster says, she quotes this passage at lengt h because of its immense importance in throwing light on the organisational methods of the modern secret societies, and says that it doesn’t matter what the end might be, political, so cial or religious, the system remains the same: The setting in motion of a vast number of people an d making them work in a cause unknown to them , and inimical to their well-being. That this was t he method adopted by Adam Weishaupt in organising the Illuminati and that it came to him f rom the East will be shown later on. She says, “We shall now see how the system of the philosopher Abdullah paved the way for bloodshed by the most terrible sect the world had e ver seen .” THE KARMATHITES “The first open acts of violence resulting from the doctrines of Abdullah were carried out by the Karmathites, a new development of the Ismail is. Among the many Dais sent out by the leader - which included his son Ahmed and Ah med’s son - was the Dai Hosein Ahwazi, Abdullah’s envoy to Irak in Persia, who ini tiated a certain Hamdan surnamed Karmath into the secrets of the sect. Karmath, who was a born intriguer and believed in n othing, became the leader of the Karmathites in Arabia, where a number of Arabs were soon enlisted in the society. With extraordinary skill he succeeded in persuading these dupes to make over all their money to him, first by means of small contributions, late r by large sums, until at last he convinced them of the advantages of abolishing all private property and establishing [Communism] the system of the community of goods an d wives . This principle was enforced by the passage in the Koran: ‘Remember the grace of God in that whilst you were enemies, He has united your hearts, so that by His Grace you have become brothers...’ Then Karmath had succeeded in establishing all this , and everyone had agreed to conform to it, he ordered the Dais to assemble all the women on a cer tain night so that they should mingle promiscuously with all the men . This, he said, was perfection and the last degree of friendship and fraternal union. Often a husband led his wife a nd presented her himself to one of his brothers when that gave him pleasure. When he (Karmath) saw that he had become absolute master of their minds, had assured himself of their obedience , and found out the degree of their intelligence and discernment, he began to lead them quite astray . He put before them arguments borrowed from the Dualists . They fell in easily with all that proposed, and t hen he took away from them all religion and released them from all those duties of piety, devotion, and the fear of God that he had"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"prescribed for them in the beginning. He permitted them to pillage, and every sort of immoral licence, and taught them to throw off the yoke of prayer, fastin g, and other precepts . He taught them that they were held by no obligations, and tha t they could pillage the goods and shed the blood of their adversaries with impunity [ like the Masonic conspiracy against the Prophet Sal ih, by the Brotherhood of 9 at Thamud ], that the knowledge of the master of truth to who m he had called them took the place of everything else, and that with this knowledge they no longer fear sin or punishment. [The reign of terror begins] As the result of these teachings the Karmathites ra pidly became a band of brigands, pillaging and massacring all those who opposed them and spreading terror throughout all the surrounding districts. Peaceful fraternity was thus turned into wild lust for conquest; the Karmathites succeeded in dominating a great part of Arabia and the mouth of the Euphrates, and in A.D. 920 extended their ravages westwards. They took possess ion of the holy city of Mecca, in defence of which 30,000 Muslims fell. ‘For a whole century,’ s ays von Hammer, ‘the pernicious doctrines of Karmath raged with fire and sword in the very bosom of Islam, until the widespread conflagration was extinguished in blood.’ But in proclaiming themselves revolutionaries the K armathites had departed from the plan laid down by the originator of the creed, Abdullah ibn M aymun, which had consisted not in acts of open violence but in a secret doctrine [now done th rough subversive ‘Novel’ literature] which should lead to the gradual undermining of all relig ious faith and a condition of Mental Anarchy rather than [its inevitable] material violence. Under the fourth Fatimite Khalifa, Egypt fell into the power of the dynasty, and, before long, bi- weekly assemblages of both men and women known as “ Societies of Wisdom ” were instituted in Cairo. In 1004 A.D. these acquired a greater import ance by the establishment of the ‘Dar ul Hikmat’ or ‘House of Knowledge’, by the sixth Khali fa Hakim, who was raised to a deity after his death and is worshipped to this day by the Drus es. Under the Dar ul Hikmat or Grand Lodge of Cairo, the Fatimites continued the plan of Abdul lah ibn Maymun with the addition of two more degrees, making nine in all . Their methods of enlisting proselytes and system of initiation - as Claudio Jannet pointed out in 1887 - are absolutely those which Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, prescribed to the ‘ Insinuating Brothers’ transcribed by the fourteenth-century historian Nowairi. The proselytes were broadly divided into two classe s, the learned and the ignorant. The Dai was to agree with former applauding his wisdom, and to impress the latter with his own knowledge by asking him perplexing questions on the Koran. Thus in initiating him into the first degree the Dai assumed an air of profundity, explaining that relig ious doctrines were too abstruse for the ordinary mind, but must be interpreted by men who, like the Dais, had a special knowledge of this science. The initiate was bound to absolute secrecy concerning the truths to be revealed to him and obliged to pay in advance for these revelations . In order to pique his curiosity the Dai would suddenly stop short in the middle of a discourse, a nd should the novice finally decline to pay the required sum, he was left in a state of bewildermen t, which inspired him with the desire to know more. In the second degree the initiate was persuaded that all his former tea chers were wrong and that he must place his confidence solely in those Imams endowed with authority from God. In the third he learned that these Imams were those of the Ismailis , seven in number ending with Mohammed, son of Ismail, in contradistinction to th e twelve Imams of the Imamias who supported the claims of Ismail’s brother Moses."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"In the fourth he was told that the prophets preceding the Imams descending from Ali were also seven in number - namely Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses , Jesus, the first Mohammed, and finally Mohammed son of Ismail. So far, then, nothing was said to the initiate in c ontradistinction to the broad tenets of Islam. But with the fifth degree the process of undermining his religion began , he was now told to reject tradition and to disregard the precepts of Mohammed , and finally Mohammed son of Ismail. In the sixth he was taught that all religious observances - prayer, fas ting, etc. - were only emblematic , that in fact all these things were devices to kee p the common herd in subordination. In the seventh the doctrine of Dualism, of a greater and a lesser deit y , were introduced and the Unity of God - fundamental to Islam - was destroyed . In the eighth a great vagueness was expressed on the attributes on the first and greatest of the deities, and it was pointed out that real prophets were those who concerned themselves with practical matters - Political institutions and good forms of government. Finally, in the ninth , the adept was shown that all religious teaching w as allegorical and that religious precepts need only be observed in so far as it was necessary to maintain order, but the man that understands the truth may disregard all su ch doctrines. Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets were therefore only teachers who had profited by lessons of philosophy. All belief in revealed religion was thus destroyed. It will be seen then, that in the last degrees the whole teaching of the first five was reversed and therefore shown to be a fraud. Fraud in fact consti tuted the system of the society; in the instructions to the Dais every artifice is describe d for enlisting proselytes by misrepresentations: Jews were won by speaking ill of Christians, Christ ians by speaking ill of Jews and Moslems alike, Sunnis by referring with respect to the orth odox Khalifas Abu Bakr and Omar and criticising Ali and his descendants. Above all, car e was to be taken not to put before proselytes doctrines that might revolt them, but to make them advance step by step. By these means they would be ready to obey any commands. As the instruc tions express it: If you were to give the order to whoever it might b e to take from him all that he holds most precious, above all his money, he would oppose none of your orders, and if death surprised him he would leave you all that he possesses in his wil l and make you his heir. He will think that in the whole world he cannot find a man more worthy th an you. Such was the great secret-society which was to form the model for the Illuminati of the eighteenth century, to whom the summary of von Hammer might wi th equal truth apply: ‘To Believe Nothing And Dare All was, in two words, the sum of this system, which annihilated every principle of religion and moralit y, and had no other objective than to execute ambitious designs with suitable ministers, who, daring all and knowing nothing, since they consider everything a cheat and nothing forbidden, are the best tools of an infernal policy. A system which, with no other aim than the gratification of an insatiable lust for domination instead of seeking the highest human objects, precipitates itself into the abyss, and mangling itself, is buried amidst th e ruins of thrones and altars, the wreck of national happiness, and the universal execration of mankind.’"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE DRUSES The terrible Grand Lodge of Cairo before long becam e the centre of a new and extraordinary cult. Hakim the 6th Fatimite Khalifa and founder of the D ar ul Hikmat became a monster of tyranny and crime whose reign can only be compared to that of Caligula or Nero. He was now raised to the place of a divinity by one Ismail Darazi, a Turk who in 1016 announced in a Mosque in Cairo that the Khalifa should be made an object of worship . Hakim believed that the divine reason was incarnate in him. Four years later he proclaimed himself a deity, and the cult was finally established by one of his viziers, the Persian mystic Hamza ibn Ali. Hakim’s cruelties, however, had so outraged the people of Egypt that a year later he was murdered b y a band of malcontents, led, it is said, by his sister who afterwards concealed his body - a circum stance which gave his followers the opportunity to declare that the divinity had merely vanished in order to test the faith of believers, but would return in time to punish apostates. This belief became the doctrine of the Druses of Lebanon, whom Darazi had won over to the worship of Hakim. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of this strange religion, which still persi sts today in the range of Lebanon; suffice it to sa y that, unlike the outcome of the Ismailis, the Druse s do not appear to have embraced the materialism of Abdullah ibn Maymun, but to have gra fted on a primitive form of nature worship and of Sabeism, the avowed belief of the Ismailis i n the dynasty of Ali and his successors, and beyond this an abstruse, esoteric creed concerning the nature of the Supreme Deity. God they declare to be ‘Universal Reason’ who manifests Hims elf by a series of ‘avatars’. Hakim was (according to them) the last of the divine embodime nts, and ‘when evil and misery have increased to the predestined height he will again appear, to conquer the world and make his religion supreme.’ THE ASSASSINS It will be seen that the Druses, distinguishing the mselves from other Ismaili sects by their worship of Hakim, yet retaining genuine religious beliefs, had not carried on the atheistical tradition of Abdullah ibn Maymun and of the Grand Lodge of Cairo . But this tradition was to find in 1090 an exponent in the Persian Hasan Saba, a native of Kho rasan, the descendant of Ali, a strict Shia, who, finding himself suspected of heretical ideas d eclared himself a Sunni. Hasan, brought up in this atmosphere of duplicity, was therefore well fi tted to play the Machiavellian role of an Ismaili Dai. Von Hammer regards Hasan as a mighty genius, o ne of a splendid triad, of which the two others were his school fellows Omar Khyyam and Nizam ul Mulk , Grand Vizier under the Seljuk Sultan, Malik Shah. Hasan, having through th e protection of Nizam ul Mulk secured titles and revenues and finally risen to office at the cou rt of the Sultan, attempted to supplant his benefactor and eventually retired in disgrace, vowi ng vengeance against the Sultan and vizier. At this juncture he met several Ismailis, one of wh om, a Dai named Mumin, finally converted him to the principles of his sect, and Hasan, decla ring himself now to be a convinced adherent of the Fatimite Khalifas, journied to Cairo, where he was received with honour by the Dar ul Hikmat and also by the Khalifa Mustansir, to whom he becam e counsellor. But his intrigues once more involving him in disgrace, he fled to Allepo and la id the foundations of his new sect. After enlisting proselytes in Baghdad, Isphahan, Khusista n and Damaghan, he succeeded in obtaining by strategy the fortress of Alamut in Persia on the Caspian Sea, where he completed the plans for his great secret society, which was to become forev er infamous under the name of the Hashishiyin, or Assassins . Under the pretense of belief in the doctrines of Islam and also of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"adherence to the Ismaili line of succession from th e Prophet, Hasan Saba now set out to pave his way to power, and in order to achieve this end adop ted the same methods of Abdullah ibn Maymun. But the terrible efficiency of Hasan’s soci ety consisted in the fact that a system of physical force was now organised in a manner undrea mt of by his predecessor. As Von Hammer has observed in an admirable passage, ‘Opinions are powerless, so long as they only confuse the brain, without arming the hand. Skepticism and Free -thinking, as long as they occupy only the minds of the indolent and philosophical, have cause d the ruins of no throne, for which purpose religious and political fanaticism are the stronges t levers in the hands of nations. It is nothing to the ambitious man what people may believe, but it i s everything to know how he may turn them for the execution of his projects.’ Thus as in the case of the French Revolution, ‘whose first movers’ according to Von Hammer ‘were the tools or leaders of secret societies’ , it was not mere theory but the method of enlistin g numerous dupes and placing weapons in their hands t hat brought about the ‘Terror’ of the Assassins six centuries before that of their spirit ual descendants, the Jacobins of 1793. Taking as his groundwork the organisation of the Gr and Lodge of Cairo, Hasan reduced the nine degrees to their original number seven, but these n ow received a definite nomenclature, and included not only real initiates but active agents. Descending downwards, the degrees of the Assassins were thus as follows: - First the Grand Master known as the Sheikh al-Jab al or Old Man of the Mountains. - Second the Dail Kebir or Grand Priors. - Third the fully initiated Dais, religious nuncios and political emissaries. - Fourth the Rafiqs or associates, in training for the higher degrees. - Fifth the Fadais or ‘devoted’ who undertook to de liver the secret blow on which their superiors had decided. - Sixth the Lasiqus, or law brothers. - Seven the ‘common people’ who were simply blind i nstruments. If the equivalents to the words ‘Dai’, ‘Rafiqs’, an d ‘Fadais’ given by Von Hammer and Dr. Bussell as ‘Master Masons’, ‘Fellow Crafts’ and ‘En tered Apprentices’ are accepted, an interesting analogy with the degrees of Freemasonry is provided. Designs against religion were of course not admitte d by the Order: ‘Strict uniformity to Islam was demanded from all the lower ranks of uninitiated, b ut the adept was taught to see through the ‘deception’ of ‘faith and works’. He believed in no thing and recognised that all acts or means were indifferent and the (secular) end alone be con sidered.’ (Dr. F. W. Bussell, Religious Thought and Heresy in the Middle Ages) Thus The fin al object was domination by a few men consumed with the lust for power ‘under the cloak o f religion and piety’, and the method by which this was to be established was the wholesale assassination of those who opposed them. In order to stimulate the energy of the Fadais/devo ted, who were required to carry out these crimes, the superiors of the Order had recourse to an ingenious system of delusion. Throughout the territory occupied by the Assassins were exquis ite gardens with fruit trees, bowers of roses, and sparkling streams . Here were arranged luxurious resting places with Persian Carpets and soft divans, around which hovered black-eyed ‘houris’ be aring wine in gold and silver drinking- vessels, whilst soft music mingled with murmuring w ater and the song of birds. The young man whom the Assassins desired to train for a career of crime was introduced to the Grand Master of the Order and intoxicated with Hashish - hence the name ‘Hashishiyin’ applied to the sect , from"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"which the word Assassin is derived. Under the brief spell of unconsciousness induced by this seductive drug the prospective devoted Fadia was th en carried into the garden, where on awaking he believed himself to be in paradise. After enjoyi ng all its delights he was given a fresh dose of opiate, and once more unconscious, was transported back to the presence of the Grand Master, who assured him that he had never left his side but had merely experienced a foretaste of the paradise that awaited him if he obeyed the orders o f his chiefs. The neophyte thus spurred on by the belief that he was carrying out the commands of the prophet, who would reward him with eternal bliss, eagerly entered into the schemes lai d down for him and devoted his life to murder. Thus by the lure of paradise the Assassins enlisted instruments for their criminal works and established a system of organised murder on a basis of religious fervour [one is reminded of ‘St’ Paul’s activities as leader of the Sicari Zelots wh o assassinated opponents of the Temple Elders and later assassinated the Gospel]. ‘ Nothing is true and all is allowed’ , was the ground of their secret doctrine, which, however, being imparted but to few and concealed under the veil of the most austere religionism and piety, restrained the mind under the yoke of blind obedience.\" [‘ Obey Masters even if you break owners’ , Masonic Imperative] To the outside world all this remained a profound m ystery; fidelity to Islam was proclaimed as the fundamental doctrine of the sect, and when the envoy of Sultan Sajar was sent to collect information on the religious beliefs of the Order h e was met with the assurance: ‘We believe in the unity of God, and consider that only as true wisdom, which accords with His word and the commands of the prophet.’ Von Hammer, answering the possible contention that, as in the case of the Templars and the Bavarian Illuminati, these methods of deception mig ht be declared a calumny on the Order, points out that in the case of the Assassins no possible d oubt existed, for their secret doctrines were eventually revealed by the leaders themselves, firs t by Hasan II, the third successor of Hasan Saba, and later by Jalal-ud-Din Hasan, who publicly anathematised the founders of the sect and ordered the burning of the books that contained the ir designs against religion - a procedure which, however, appears to have been a strategical manoeuv re for restoring confidence in the order and enabling him to continue the work of subversion and crime. A veritable reign of terror was thus established throughout the East; the Rafiqs and Fad ais ‘spread themselves in troops over the whole of Asia and darkened the whole face of the ea rth’; and ‘in the annals of the Assassins is found the chronological enumeration of celebrated m en of all nations who have fallen the victims of the Ismailis, to the joy of their murderers and the sorrow of the world.’ The Assassins like the terrorists of the French rev olution ended by turning on each other. The ‘Old Man of the Mountain’ himself was murdered by h is brother-in-law and his son Mohammed; he in turn, whilst aiming at the life of his son Ja lal-ud-Din, was anticipated by him with poison, which murder was again avenged by poison, so that f rom ‘Hasan the Illuminator’ down to the last of his line the Grand Masters fell by the hands of their next of kin, and poison and the dagger prepared the grave which the Order had opened for s o many. Finally in 1250 A.D. the conquering hordes of the Mongol Mangu Khan swept away the dyna sty of the Assassins. But although as reigning powers the Assassins and F atimites ceased to exist, the sects from which they derived have continued up to the present day . .. and in that inscrutable East the cradle of all the mysteries, the profoundest European adept of se cret society intrigue may find himself outdistanced by paymasters in the art in which he b elieved himself proficient."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The sect of Hasan Saba was the supreme model on whi ch all systems of organised murder working through fanaticism, such as the Carbonari a nd the I.R.B. were based, and the signs, the symbols, the initiations, of the Grand Lodge of Cai ro formed the groundwork for the great secret societies of Europe.

[page 218] THE CONTINUING SUBVERSIVE WAR OF D.M.J Against divine religion and all moral order The on-going subversive war against divine religion and all systems of moral order is best carried out (according to Salman Rushdie) through the novel . Particularly the paperback variety, which he says is far more effective than the medium of fi lm. “Film - the most expensive art form is [he says] th e least subversive. Bergman, Fellini and others made the most successful secular revolts into the territory of the sacred. I prefer the greater possibilities of the novel.” [The Herbert Read Lectures] Fellini, like Rushdie, incorporated much autobiogra phy into works like ‘La Dolce Vita’. In his famous ‘8 1/2‘ for example, when asked if his own p sychological problems corresponded to those of Guido, the hero of the film, Fellini said “I am Guido!” Professor Carolyn Geduld of Indiana University writes, “Guido would retreat into fantas y, a typical reaction of the extrovert who fails to adapt to external conditions.” [Fellini A Life] The magician in Fellini’s 8 1/2 was Ian Dallas alias Abdel Qadir Al-Murabit, the head of the Murab itun Sufi movement. All Rushdie’s protestations up to and including his most recent declaration that he had not intended to attack Islam or discredit Muhammad and the Qur’an are patently untrue, and should be totally discounted. His sermon issued through th e mouth of his apostle Harold Pinter during the 1990 Herbert Read Memorial lecture entitled “Is nothing Sacred?” confirms his real intention in writing the book, which was, without doubt, one of subversion, and helps to explain the reason for his insistence that the cheaper paperback versi on comes out.

According to Commander M.J.L. Blake, Royal Navy, and Colonel B.S. Turner C. Eng., M.I. Mech. E., in their observations on the Soviet “War Beneath the Level of Military Conflict” , Gorbachev declared on the 25th of November 1986 to Officials and Military personnel i n Uzbekistan that: “ There must be no let up in the war against religion , because, as long as religions exist, communism [the secular faith] cannot prevail . We must intensify the destruction of all religions, where ever they are being practiced and taught .” On November 1987 after announcing his Glasnost and Perestroika he said: “ In October 1917, we departed the old world and irre versibly rejected it. We are traveling to a new world, the world of communism. We shall ne ver deviate from this path .” [ Why has the country not been told , page 5] 104 years after Pike, Mohammed Boudiaf , 33rd degree freemason , accepted the same motto as Algeria’s undemocratic principle. Throughout recorded history believers have been con fronted with this sort of intolerance from tyrannical despotic leaders, and are probably nowhe re better catalogued, than in the excellent works of Nesta H. Webster , particularly her ‘ Secret Societies & Subversive Movements’ , published in 1924. In the preface she warns us not to expect any support from the aggressively atheistic and pro-anarchist literary establishment, whose recent darkness has been clearly visible since the debut of Rushdie’s Satanic Verses. A SAMPLE OF SATANIC PRESSES “It is a matter of some regret to me that I have be en so far unable to continue the series of studies on the French Revolution... But the state of the wo rld at the end of the Great War seemed to demand an enquiry into the present phase of the rev olutionary movement, hence my attempt to follow its course up to modern times in ‘World Revo lution’. And now before returning to that first cataclysm, I have felt impelled to devote one more book to the Revolution as a whole by going this time further back into the past and atte mpting to trace its origins from the first century of the Christian era. For it is only by taking a ge neral survey of the movement that it is possible to understand any particular phase of its existence. The French Revolution did not arise merely out of t he conditions or ideas peculiar to the eighteenth century, nor the Bolshevist Revolution o ut of political and social conditions in Russia or the teachings of Karl Marx. Both these explosion s were produced by forces which, making use of popular suffering and discontent, had long been gathering strength for an onslaught, not only on Christianity, but on all social and moral order. It is of immense significance to notice with"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"what resentment this point of view met in certain q uarters. When I first began to write on Revolution a well-known London Publisher said to me : ‘Remember that if you take an anti-revolutionary li ne you will have the whole literary world against you’ . This appeared to me extraordinary. Why should the l iterary world sympathize with a movement, which from the French Revolution onwards has always been directed against literature, art, and science, and has openly proclaimed its aim to exalt the manual workers over the intelligentsia? ‘Writers must be proscribed as the most dangerous e nemies of the people ’, said [Masonic] Robespierre ; his colleague Dumas said, ‘ All clever men should be guillotined .’ ... The system of persecution against men of talents wa s organised...They cried out in sections of Paris, ‘Beware of that man for he has written a boo k!’ Precisely the same policy has been followed in Russia. Under ‘moderate’ Socialism in G ermany the professors, not the ‘people’, are starving in garrets. Yet the whole press is permeat ed with subversive influences. Not merely in partisan-works, but in manuals of history or litera ture for use in schools, Burke is reproached for warning us against the French Revolution and Carlyl e’s panegyric [eulogy] is applauded. And whilst every slip on the part of an anti-revolution ary writer is seized upon by the critics and held up as an example of the whole [work], the most glar ing errors, not only of conclusion but of fact, pass un-challenged if they happen to be committed b y a partisan of the [revolutionary] movement. The principle laid down by Collot d’Herbois still holds good: ‘Tout est permis pour quiconque agit dans le sens d e la revolution.’ [ For an agitator of the revolution, everything is pe rmissible ] All this was unknown to me when I first embarked on my work. I knew that French writers of the past had distorted facts to suit their own politica l views [which is now common practice], that a conspiracy of history is still directed by certain influences in the Masonic Lodges and the Sorbonne; I did not know [however] that this conspi racy was being carried on in this country [Great Britain]. Therefore the publishers warning d id not daunt me. [I thought naively] If I was wrong either in my conclusions or facts I was prepa red to be challenged. Should not years of laborious historical research meet either with reco gnition or with reasoned and scholarly refutation? But while my book received many generou s and appreciative reviews in the press, criticisms, which were hostile, took a form, which I had never anticipated. Not a single honest attempt was made to refute eith er my ‘French Revolution’ or ‘World Revolution’ by the usual methods of controversy; st atements founded on documentary evidence were met with flat contradiction unsupported by a s hred of counter evidence. In general the plan adopted was not to disprove, but to discredit by me ans of flagrant misquotation, by attributing to me views I had never expressed, or even by means of offensive personalities . It will surely be admitted that this method of attack is unparalleled in any other sphere of literary controversy. It is interesting to notice that precisely the same line was adopted a hundred years ago with regard to Professor Robinson and the Abbe Barruel , whose works on the secret causes of the French Revolution created an immense sensation in their da y. The legitimate criticisms that might have"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"been made on their work find no place in the diatri bes levelled against them; their enemies content themselves merely with calumnies and abuse. An enemy of this same Professor Robinson describing himself as ‘A friend of truth’ wrote in ‘The National Intelligencer’ of January 1801 that Robins on was ‘a man distinguished by abject dependence on a party, by the base crimes of forger y and adultery and by frequent paroxysms of insanity. Adultery was the frequent pastime: Not of Robinson, but of Adam Weishaupt , the chief Illuminist who, on making his sister-in-law pregnan t said: ‘ I do not know what devil lead me astray, I who alwa ys in these circumstances took extreme precautions .’ Mounier goes even further in one of his pamphlets. Inspired by the Illuminatus Bode, he quotes a story that Robinson suffered from a form of insanit y, which consisted in his believing that the posterior portion of his body was made of Glass! no ted by Seth Payson in his ‘ Proofs of the Real Existence and Dangerous Tendency of Illuminism ’. (Charleston 1802) Seth Payson, a contemporary writer thus described s ome of the illustrations employed to discredit them: [and adds] ‘The testimony of Professor Robinson and Abbe Barru el would doubtless have been considered as ample in any case which did not inter est the prejudice and passions of men against them. The scurrility and odium with which t hey have been loaded is perfectly natural, and what the nature of their testimony wou ld have led one to expect. Men will endeavour to invalidate that evidence which tends t o unveil their dark designs. And it cannot be expected that those who believe that ‘the end sanctifies the means’ will be very scrupulous as to their measures’. Exactly the same method of attack has been directed against those of us who during the last few years [1924] have attempted to warn the world of th e secret forces working to destroy civilisation; in my own case even the plan of accus ing me of having attacked British Masonry has been adopted without the shadow of a foundation. Fr om the beginning I have always differentiated between British and Grand Orient Mas onry, and have numbered high British Masons amongst my friends. But what is the main charge brought against us? Lik e Robinson and Barruel, we are accused of raising false alarm, of creating a bogey, or of bei ng the victims of an obsession. Up to a point this is comprehensible. Whilst on the continent the impo rtance of secret societies is taken as a matter of course and the libraries of foreign capitals tee m with books on the question, people of this country really imagine that secret societies are a thing of the past - articles to this effect appeare d quite recently in two leading London Newspapers - w hilst practically nothing of any value has been written about them in our language during the last hundred years. Hence ideas that are commonplace on the Continent here appear sensationa l and extravagant. The mind of the Englishman does not readily accept anything he cannot see or even sometimes something he can see which is unprecedented in his experience, so like the Western American farmer confronted for the first time by the sight o f a giraffe, his impulse is to shout out angrily: ‘ I don’t believe it’."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Benjamin Disraeli on the other hand stood up in the House of Commons, on July the 14th, in 1856 and made the following pronouncement on the na ture and designs of these secret societies and their subversive anti-religious intentions. He said: ‘There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention in this House... I mean the secret societies... It is useless to deny, because it is i mpossible to conceal that a great part of Europe, the whole of Italy and France, and a great part of Germany, to say nothing of other countries, is covered with a network of these secret societies, just as the superficies of the earth are covered with railroads. And what a re their objects? They do not attempt to conceal them. They do not want constitutional go vernment, they do not want ameliorated institutions... they want to change the tenure of the land, to drive out the present owners of the soil [e.g. Palestine] and put an end to ecclesiastical establishments. Some may even go further.’’ Fifty-two years later Disraeli’s prediction proved to be well-founded. In May 1908 the Masonic Trojan Horse re-entered Russia; The Grand Orient of France constituting two Lodges; one in St. Petersburg the other in Moscow; a Chapter Rose Croi x was also established in Moscow, and by 1909 there were 6 Lodges which [having served their purpose] soon became dormant, re-opening in 1911 but significantly without rituals, being in the nature of Political Clubs. According to the entry on Freemasonry in Russia in Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia there was a Supreme Council which by 1913-14 had about 40 subor dinate bodies. These are credited with inspiring the first revolution in 1917, and it is s aid that all the members of Kerensky’s Government belonged to them, and there is evidence of a Lodge and even a Grand Lodge existing in the Ukraine in 1919, but [being expendable as in the French Revolution] these were put out of existence by the Communists very soon afterwards. Freemasonry was outlawed permanently by Tzar Alexander in August 1822 on the advise of its own Grand Master Kushelev who had warned him that ‘The fraternity was a danger to the State and that it ought to be suppressed or reorganized.’ The decree was renewed by his successor Tzar Nicholas I on April 21st 1826; it is said that secret gatherings continued until 1830; the decree remained in effect until 1930, when it was repealed by Kerensky who according to Coil’s Masoni c Encyclopedea later found Asylum in The United States of America, the Mecca of Freemasonry, and was still living there in the late 1950s.\" [Perhaps Gorbachev will follow] [ Secret Societies & Subversive Movements , preface] ILLUMINISM, LUCIFERIAN ZIONISM, AND FREEMASONRY In Life Magazine and Look Magazine of the 16th of J anuary 1962, Mr. David Ben Gurion , Zionist atheist and first prime minister of Israel stated while still in office: “The image of the world in 1987 as traced in my ima gination: The Cold War will be a thing of the past .

With the exception of the the U.S.S.R. as a federat ed Eurasian State, all other continents will become united in a world alliance at whose disposal will be an international police force .

And by 1987 the average life-span of man will reach 100 years.” [ The Struggle for World Power, pages 21-22] So far only the last item of the plan has failed to materialise, but it can only be a matter of time. David Ben Gurion is reported to having said on anot her occasion, that while he didn’t believe in God, he thought God believed in him: In this exampl e we see how divine scripture is used to sanctify and justify the secular ambitions of athei sts. It is a perfect example of how to engineer success by “working to a plan and planning the work !”, just like Herzl did in his Protocols. THE HEART OF THE MATTER: JERUSALEM & THE EDIFICE-COMPLEX BUILDING A SHRINE TO THE PROFITS? In order for the secular forces of Zionism to gain control of the Holy Land of Palestine, they had to enlist the aid or neutralise the opposition of a very large number of people, particularly those in positions of power and influence: kings, princes, a mbassadors, rabbis, bishops and clergy, generals, admirals, police chiefs and policemen, pr ofessors, doctors, journalists, bankers, security men, judges, barristers and solicitors, taxi driver s, dustmen and show business personalities, etc. So they employed their oldest and most successful d evice, the one called f reemasonry: ‘a cult of baseless mysteries ’ which promises and delivers (for a time at least, some advantages) for those who subscribe to its laudable ideals and plausible spiritual pursuits. And with the French, English and Russian Revolutions to its credit, it would be foolhardy for the ambitious to disregard its significance as a component of world power. No-one trying to understand how world events come about can afford to disregard its unique and u ndeniable roll. The bad news, however, for freemasons who genuinely believe in ‘The Great Architect of the Universe’ is, that neither the Craft Degrees nor the Royal Arch have a nything whatsoever to do with either the building or the re-building of King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem or for that matter anything at all to do with divine happenings in the Holy Land (or indeed anywhere else) . It always was and still is an elaborate fraud, designe d to deceive even the most sophisticated and educated members of any society , and has been doing so throughout its long and che quered career, which, however defended or described, is ir refutably Satanic in spirit, purpose and practice. The 33rd degree American freemason Alex Horne confirms this in his authoritative book “ King Solomon’s Temple in Masonic Tradition ”, which completely destroys the myth that freemasonry is predicated on the solid foundat ions of divine scripture or real estate. In chapter two, entitled “ Whence came You ?”, he says,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"“ But King Solomon’s Temple did not always hold the p re-eminent position it enjoys today , as the legendary base of reference to which pract ically all our institutions - including our very beginnings - are traditionally a ssigned. That position, in fact, was once held by the Tower of Babe l. Thus, in the very oldest of our old charges - Th e Regius Manuscript, or Halliwell Poem, said to date about 1 390 A.D. - our ‘ first most excellent Grand Master’ is declared to have been King Nimrod himself, the builder of that famous tower; and it was he and not King Solomon, who is said to have given the operative Masons of his day [1] their first ‘Charge’, the rul e of conduct, and [2] the regulation of the Mason-Craft by which they and their descendants were to be governed. This is even more pointedly brought out in some of the later versions of these ‘Old Charges’, the Thistle Manuscript dated 1756, and therefore toward s if not beyond the end of the ‘Operative’ period, elaborates upon the simpler account given i n the original Regius Manuscript and tells us that Nimrod not only ‘made Masons’ but also ‘taught them signs and tokens’, so that they should distinguish one another from all the rest of mankin d.\" WHAT DRIVES MEN TO BUILD TOWERS OF BABEL? “The men who planned to build the tower of Babel we re divided into three classes. One said, Let us ascend to heaven and dwell there; anot her said, Let us ascend and practice idolatry; and the third said, Let us ascend and wag e war (against God). The first class God dispersed; the second class, He confused their language; the third class was turned into apes, spirits, demons and night-devils .” [Sanh. 109a, Talmud Everyman edition] The Pharaoh of the exodus also suffered from insolence and an edifice comple x. Surah 28, al- Qasas (The Story) in the Qur’an, verse 4, informs us that Pharaoh ruled by dividing his subjects into casts and degrees like his predecesso r Nimrod , the builder of the infamous tower of Babel. In Verses 38 and 39 it reports that “Pharaoh said: ‘O Chiefs! I do not know for you any god but myself: therefore O Haman! light me a kiln to bake bricks out of clay and buil d me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: But as far as I am concerned, I think Moses is a liar!’ And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason, h e and his hosts: for they thought they would not have to return to Us!” The Qur’an contains all the evidence we need to kno w about these and earlier worshipers of Sion/Sirius Pro-sion and Betelgeux in the Constella tion of Orion the Mighty Hunter: hence the title Sionist or Zionist; Atheists amongst the remn ant of Israel, the backsliders, rejecters of revelation, and founders of an occult theocracy, of whom the Qur’an says: “And when there comes unto them a messenger from Al lah, confirming that which they already possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of Allah behind their back as if they knew it not. And follow what the evil ones gave out falsely against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers were not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men magic, and such things as came d own at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut . But neither of these two taught such things as ma gic without first saying: ‘ We are only a test for you; so do not blaspheme ’, and they learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But even so they could not harm any one thus, except by Allah’s permission. And they learned only what h armed them, not what profited them."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Even though they knew that the purchasers of magic would have no share of the hereafter.” [ Qur’an Surah 2, Al-Baqarah (The Cow), verses 101-2] On the Royal Arch, the Qur’an has this to say: “And to Solomon We made the winds obedient.. And we made a font of molten brass to flow for him; and there were jinns that worked in f ront of him, by the leave of his Lord... They worked for him, as he desired, making arches, images and basons as large as reservoirs...” [ Qur’an Surah 34, verse 12-13 ] It should, therefore, come as no surprise to learn that initiates are intentionally mislead in order t o conceal the true nature and purpose from all but th e chosen few. Otherwise it could not have succeeded the way it has. As Mrs. Webster points out, fascism did not triumph in Italy becau se it was a reactionary movement, but because it appealed to the noblest instincts in human nature, to patriotism and self-sacrifice, it rallied all eleme nts in a disorganised and disunited nation around the standard of a common cause. She goes on to say: “One cannot bring about any great movement without first kindling a sacred fire in the hearts of men; one cannot move masses of people merely by appeali ng to self interest, they must have a cause to fight for, a cause that i s not entirely their own . Socialism, whilst enlisting a large proportion of i ts following by appealing to their baser instincts, has nevertheless, by its false ideals an d promises, been able to kindle the fire in many generous hearts, and to persuade deluded enthu siasts that they are working for the welfare of humanity. The only way to combat sociali sm is to create counter enthusiasm for a true ideal. Even Mussolini found that a purely secular ideal wa s not enough, and that the spirit of religious fervour was necessary to defeat the spiri t of materialism and destruction. For behind the concrete forces of revolution - whether Pan-Germanic, Judaic, or Illuminist - beyond that invisible secret circle which perhaps d irects them all! is there not yet another force, still more potent, that must be taken into a ccount? In looking back over centuries at the dark episodes that have marked the history of the human race from its earliest origins - strange and horrible cults, waves of witchcraft, blasphemies, and desecrations - how is it possible to ignore the existence of an occult power at work in the world? Individuals, sects, or races fired with the desire of world domination, have provided the fighting forces of destruction, but behind them are the veritable powers of darkness in eternal conflict with the powers of light.\" [ Secret Societies & Suversive Movements, page 406] When the Great Liar, Dajjal, cannot bring the world under his control by his machinations and false beliefs, the Christian natio ns will gather under 80 banners [UN] in an attempt to bring peace to the world, but they wi ll fail and bring about its destruction.

This, together with the official format ion of the Friedrich Nietzsche Admiration Society in the spring of 1990 by Dr. Keith Ansell-P earson, the London University Politics Lecturer, leaves one in little doubt that the occul t establishment is desperate to replace its fallen idols of Marx and Margaret-Forces with even more ou trageous, but well tried substitutes. Remember Adolph Hitler derived some of his anti-Sem itic thinking from Friedrich Nietzsche’s ideas of the superman. In an article in the London Evening Standard in Apr il 1990, Melanie McDonnagh points out that even someone as evil as the Marquis de’Sade is now considered respectable by the liberal establishment and the one-time respectable high str eet emporiums such as W.H. Smith. She says: “In Britain, the best indication that the divine Ma rquis has been gently assimilated by the liberalism of the age is probably the fact that his most carefully worked catalogue of cruelty: ‘ The 120 Days of Sodom’ , has been published in paperback and is now on sal e in W.H. Smith.” In this year of his 250th anniversa ry, the present Marquis de’Sade had this to say about his notorious ancestor, who was, in his opinion: “Ahead of his time. A true liberal whose political ideas are modern [even] today. A lucid thinker who was opposed to the death penalty [no do ubt he saw himself as a prospective candidate]. A defender of personal freedom, and cit izens’ liberties.” As for his personal philosophy on cruelty, he remar ks: “In his time horror was commonplace. He did not inv ent horror, but had the nerve to record it and play it back.” At the end of the 20th century [he says] authoritie s at last admit that people can evaluate things for themselves. He said, “The Marquis de’Sade has become a symbol of this ne w freedom of thought, of the freedom to be ourselves and do what we want .” Miss McDonnagh goes on to say that “Ultimately, de’Sade rises above any attempt to red eem him. And his philosophy of self- interest is so thoroughgoing that it defies being b racketed with any other [sorry Salman better luck next time]. The contemporary intellectu al fashion [so prevalent today] that it doesn’t matter what you do so long as it doesn’t hu rt anyone, quails in the [face of his] rigorous conviction that: (a) If you are strong you can do what you like , and (b) That even if humanity destroys itself in the result ing anarchy that follows, it doesn’t particularly matter .\" But what else can be expected from a person who des cribed himself 250 years ago as being"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"“Imperious, choleric, irascible with a dissolute im agination the like of which was never seen, and atheistic to the point of fanaticism.” Nicolas Walter , managing director of the Rationalist Press Associ ation, in his book ‘ Blasphemy Ancient & Modern ’, says: “ The Marquis de’Sade, who is well known for the extr eme obscenity of his pornographic fantasies, is less well known for their extreme pro fanity .” He says his most objectionable novel was Juliette (1797). Friedrich Nietzsche was not a lot better. Nietzsche, according to the New Encyclopedia, is described as follows: “Nietzsche, Friedrich, German Philosopher, born at Rocken, in Prussian Saxony, Oct. 15th 1844. At the age of 25 he was appointed profes sor of philology at the University of Basel. Here he lectured until in 1879 ill health co mpelled him to resign. [He was declared clinically insane.] He died August 25th, 1900. Essentially a poet, Nietzsche never framed a philos ophy. He heatedly attacked pity and humanitarianism; and, on the ground that it had int roduced these things into Europe, bitterly assailed Christianity.\" [ The Modern Encyclopedia ] In some respects Friedrich Nietzsche may be even wo rse than the notorious Marquis de’Sade, but either way it is hard to understand how ‘modern’ me n and women of putative intelligence can harbour any interest, let alone respect and admirat ion, for the ideas, beliefs and activities of eithe r Nietzsche or de’Sade; except perhaps out of joint p sychiatric curiosity or interest in the pair’s mutual insanity. But in the aftermath of Satanic Ve rses it is only to be expected that there will be renewed popularity for these earlier heroes of Sata nic inspiration - issued via the whispering ventriloquies of the soul and altogether consistent with cases of possession and psychotic schizophrenia, with its imperious choleric irascibi lity, dissolute imaginings, obscene outbursts, violent behaviour, blasphemous outpourings and ferv ent proclamations of devout fanatical atheism; the bedrock of all ‘pornographic fantasies ’ including some of Rushdie’s works. And yet we are now expected to take seriously the p hilosophical aberrations of these delinquent, degenerated, disintegrated personalities and to reg ard them as worthy of serious consideration and possible emulation, as if the passage of time alone had rendered virtuous their insanity or deplorable conduct; or that either could possess wo rthwhile contributions for the problems of our time [except perhaps as examples of what caused the m in the first place, as these problems are caused in the most part by academics and their apol ogists being allowed to pass-off their vacuous philosophical irrelevancies as the well trodden pat hs to wisdom and learning, rather than the dead-ends they are, unworthy of even cursory pursui t]. What seems to be at work is the well known rule of marketing; the one that states “ first create the demand, or endorse it, then monopolize the market .” Or in the words of J. Dodds Esq ., “look for the earner.” Many academics are as notoriously ambi tious as any inside trader, and will promote any idea likely to advance either their career, aca demic standing or financial status. So on the question of either the veracity of a part icular philosopher or the reliability of his source s of reference and inspiration, when deemed advantage ous or when cornered, our intellectual will often resort to what we have come to call academic amnesia, which is particularly evident at"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"times of council grievances when members of staff, academic or otherwise, are asked to give evidence against a head of department or say anythi ng that may bring them into conflict with influential members of the administration.

So wrote Barry Hugill in The Observer : “One hundred years after being pronounced clinicall y insane, Friedrich Nietzsche is again emerging as a modern cult figure . Two hundred devotees filled London’s Goethe Insti tute last week for the official formation of Britain’s f irst Nietzsche Society. Since his death in 1900, he has been accused of man y things, mostly unpleasant, but never of modesty . He lived in fear of being considered ordinary. ‘I am no man, I am dynamite,’ he proclaimed, but added that his follow ers should not consider him ‘holy’. This from a philosopher who said: ‘There cannot be a God because, if there were one, I would not believe that I was not he.’ Anglo-Saxon philosophers were apt to dismiss him at best as an early, flawed exponent of existentialism, and at worse as a Nazi. Most regard ed him as Bonkers. For reasons not absolutely clear, a Nietzsche reviv al has hit British and American Universities. In the last six months, sales of the paperback ‘Nietzs che Reader’ have doubled, a spate of articles has appeared in the learned press, the doyen of Bri tish philosophy, Bernard Williams, has written favourably about him, and the American commentator Stanley Rosen declared Nietzsche the ‘most influential philosopher in the Western World’ [heaven forbid]."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"R.J. (Reg) Hollingdale, the English translator of N ietzsche, is cheerfully baffled by the revival. As the likely first president of the society, he ha s good reason to celebrate, having just received a bumper royalties cheque. ‘They say it’s to do with the decline of Marxism, but it doesn’t sound convincing, does it? [it does] I’m not complaining, though. Nietzsche won’t make me rich, but he’s doing me very nicely thank you.’ [moral to the story: always look for the earner] Dr. Keith Ansell-Pearson, the London University Pol itics Lecturer who convened Monday’s inaugural meeting, suspects the renewed interest st ems from the collapse of Communism and talk of a Federated Europe. Nietzsche he said, was an anti-nationalist who looked to the creation of a Europe without borders. This is an unusual claim. More orthodox reading of ‘Thus Spake Zarathustra’ or ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ reveal a man who hated socialism, was into lerant of female emancipation, favoured a rigid social hierarchy and had an unhealthy pre-occ upation with blood: ‘Of all that is written I love only that which is w ritten with blood. Write with blood and you will discover that blood is spirit .’ Dr. Ansell-Pearson accepts that his hero has had a bad press. He concedes that many people identify Hitler’s Aryan racial theories to Nietzsch e’s ‘Superman.’ A philosopher who apparently extols an irrational lust to rule must expect to be misunderstood. However! he feels that Friedrich was one of the good guys??? Dr. Ansell-Pearson hopes to rehabilitate him as a n ineteenth century ‘anti-racist, anti-nationalist’, a rebel who challenged orthodoxy and was reviled by those in power for so doing, a man to be read for ‘the sheer pleasure to be had from his joy ful wisdom’???\" [ The Observer , May 6th, 1990] If Nietzsche’s reward for following his own philoso phy is anything to go by, it bodes ill for those who intend to follow suit. Although people like Ber nard Williams, Reg. Hollingdale and Dr. Ansell-Pearson will all receive money and the appro bation of the occult liberal establishment, Nietzsche was in a state of mental and physical col lapse for the last decade of his life, and this is all the pleasure and joy to be gained out of his so rt of wisdom. The co-founder of the Nietzsche Society, art critic Michael Newman, believes the Nietzsche cult can be partially explained by his eclecticism [draw ing ideas from every school]: “You can get what you want out of him.” Nietzsche may have fores een his own revival, says Hugill, when he said: “My time has not yet come either; I was born posthumously.” Most people, even the non-religious, know the Bible story of the creation and fall of Adam and the events succeding it together with the murder of Abel by his brother Cain, and it therefore requires little or no introduction. But the subsequ ent events such as the revenge of Seth are little known or discussed even among those who come from a Judeo-Christian or Islamic background, amongst whom the story is an essential canon of fai th. But what is more astonishing and central to the core of our investigation is the fact that t his same story turns up in the accounts and the stories of pagan mythology, in particular those of Egypt which have continued to fascinate practically every subsequent civilisation and secre t society right up to the present day. Like the Bible, The Qur’an in several accounts repo rts on the creation. In its 20th chapter or surah entitled “ Ta Ha” [quoted earlier on page 92], the Qur’an informs us of the events prior to and following the creation of Adam, his covenant with h is Creator, his appointment as vice regent"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"over all creation, the refusal of Satan to submit h imself to Adam’s authority, Adam’s enviable standard of living in the garden of paradise and hi s subsequent eviction due to his desire to become equal with Allah in power and immortality. The Quranic scripture either expands, corrects, or corroborates the much earlier accounts contained in the Torah or Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him), which also, clearly establish Satan as the first rebel and anarchist, t he one who destroys the idyllic lifestyle of Adam and continues to prevent his offspring from re-expe riencing the blissful life they genetically recall and naturally long for, by encouraging humanity to pursue the misguided notions that they can regain or re-create the paradise-lost, by adopting an ‘anything and everything goes’ approach to life, by completely disregarding all the necessary and well proven guidelines for humanity’s common good and peace of mind. “And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, bu t he forgot, and We found no constancy in him. And when We said to the angels: f all prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate all except Iblis; who refused. Therefore we said: O Adam! this is an enemy unto you and to your wife. So let him not drive you both out of the garden so that you have to toil. It is vouched safe unto you that you will not hunger there nor will you feel naked. Nor will you feel thirst or exposure to the sun’s h eat. But the Devil whispered to him saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immor tality and Power that wastes not away? Then the two ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them, and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so went astray. Then his Lo rd chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him. He said: Go down here, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But if there comes unto you guidance from Me , then who so ever follows My guidance, he will not go astray or come to grief. But he who turns away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life, and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection . He will say My Lord! why have you brought me fort h blind when previously I could see? He will say: So should it be. Our revelations came to you but you did forget them. In like manner you are forgotten this day. Thus do we rewar d him who is prodigal and believes not in the Revelations of his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.

Conflicts which from the creation of Adam until tod ay, have been the result of man’s ambition to make himself equal with God, or like Nietzsche, to create God in his own image; or to proclaim, like Marx and Ben-Gurion , that there is no God and therefore man has no furth er need for moral laws . Man thus demonstrates his disdain by propagating ideas of complete freedom from conscience, and to think and act in absolute disreg ard and opposition to all the well established and necessary laws required for the maintenance of civil, moral and natural order, which has resulted in the environmental catastrophy, and glob al chaos we see all around us. Rebellious ideas which invariably lead to the mass worship of devili sh leaders who advocate these insane theories and who, unfortunately, are followed by the masses who, as previously stated, are either too shy or too proud to announce that the king has no cloth es or to ask him by what irrational authority he says that there is no god but scientific man. It is worth reminding ourselves again of the words of Bukharin , Karl Marx’s associates in the ‘ First International’ , an anarchist and Satanist who wrote: “Satan is the first free-thinker and saviour of the world. He frees Adam and impresses the seal of humanity and liberty on his forehead by mak ing him disobedient .” [ Mystery 666 , page ] It comes, therefore, as no surprise to find many of these same characters and similar stories turning up throughout history in one form or anothe r in practically all the various competing ideologies and schools of religious and quasi-relig ious thought, from ancient Babylon to the present day; With Ancient Egypt exercising tremendo us influence on today’s Judeo-Christian Masonic world order, with the worship of Osiris or substitute crucified son of God, betrayed and murdered by his brother or close disciple, who in t urn is killed by the son of Osiris and his sister Isis.

How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were once without life and He created and gave life to you! and He will return you once again to death and then resurrect you to life once more and then unto Him you will return [for assessment and judgme nt of your behaviour]. He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens, and He is the Knower of all things.

And He taught Adam the names of all things then sho wed them to the angels for identification saying: inform of the names of these [objects] if y ou are truthful. They said: Be You glorified! we have no knowledge except that which You have taught us. Lo! You, only You are the Knower, the Wise. He said: O Adam! inform them of the names of these things, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: did I not tell you that I alo ne know the secrets of the heavens and the earth? and I know that which you disclose and that which y ou hide.

But [the rebellious spirit] Satan lured them out of their idyllic state and caused Us to expel them; and We said: ‘fall down, each of you a foe unto the other! there will be for you on earth a habitation and a provision for a time’. Then Adam received words of revelation from his Lor d, and He relented towards him, for He (Allah) is the Relenting the Merciful.

THE UNACCEPTABLE FACE OF ZIONISM It is obvious, that not all Zionists are Jews, but not so obvious is the fact that not all Jews are Zionists . Taheen Basheer in the introduction to his booklet ‘ Edwin Montagu and The Balfour Declaration ’ draws our attention to the fact that many prominent and influential Jews at the turn of the century were completely opposed to the Balfo ur Declaration both in fact and in principle, and that it was contrary to religious Law . He says: When the Balfour Declaration, dated November 2nd 19 17, was made public, very little was known about its motivations and the interplay o f forces that had moved the British Government to promise the establishment of a “Natio nal home for the Jews that does not prejudice the civil and religious rights of the non -Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by the Jews in any other country”. [From the The Balfour Declaration ] The declaration included vague terminology like ‘th e National Home’ which was susceptible to many contradictory interpretations, the ambiguity a dding to the tense and secretive atmosphere surrounding the Declaration from its very inception , until the United Nations partition plan of 1947. Significant among the documents made public in the spring of 1966 are three major memoranda presented by the Honourable Edwin Samuel Montagu , son of the First Lord Swaythling and at that time Minister of State for India , concerning his vehement opposition to the propose d declaration. The Cabinet papers covering the 1915 t o 1920 period shed light on the role played by the Zionist movement in influencing British policy during that crucial period. Montagu was not only a member of the British Cabinet, but was also a practicing Orthodox Jew and a leading personality amongst British Jewry . His basic opposition did not stem from pro-Arab sentiment, but rather out of his strong dislike for the principles and personali ties of political Zionism , basing his rejection on the following points: 1. Judaism is a Universal Religion and not a nationality. 2. There is no Jewish Nation, only a Jewish Religion a nd tradition . Palestine is not the national home for the Jews, for the national home o f every Jew depends on the country he belongs to and of which he is a citizen. 3. Zionism is an untenable creed that sheds doubt o n the loyalty and patriotism of Jewish citizens of the United Kingdom. He said: “ If a Jewish Englishman sets his eyes on the Mount of Olives and longs for the day when he will shake British soil from his shoes and go back to agricultural pursuits in Palestine ... h e seemed to me to have acknowledged aims inconsistent with British Citizenship ”. He also stated that he would almost be tempted to proscribe the Zionist Organisation as il legal and against British national interests."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"4. While acknowledging the fact that Palestine play ed a large part in Jewish history, he also stated that it played equally important roles in th e history of Christianity and Islam. He maintained that the future of Palestine, as well as other parts of the former Ottoman territories, should depend on the will of its inhab itants and the exercise of self- determination. He also reacted the same way to the French proposals to establish a homeland in el-Hassa in Arabia. 5. He questioned the authority of the Zionist Organisa tion to represent the Jewish people, and affirmed that in his estimation Jews of British birth were in the main anti-Zionist and that the majority of Zionists were foreign born trouble make rs living in Britain . 6. He considered the Balfour Declaration to be an A nti-Semitic act, which also broke promises made to the Arabs. SECRET ZIONISM The Anti-Semitism Of The Present Government (Circul ated by the Secretary of State for India) 1. I am sorry to bother the Cabinet with another Pa per on this subject, but I have obtained some more information, which I would like to lay be fore them. 2. We have received at the India Office a series of valuable papers on Turkey in Asia from the pen of Miss Gertrude Lowthian Bell , the remarkable woman who, after years of knowledge gained by unique travel in these regions, is acting as Assistant Political Officer in Baghdad. She writes: ‘Not least among the denationalizing forces is the fact that a part of Syria, though like the rest mainly inhabited by Arabs, is regarded by a no n-Arab people as its prescriptive inheritance. At a liberal estimate the Jews of Palestine may for m a quarter of the population of the province , the Christians a fifth, while the remainder are Moh ammedan Arabs . Jewish immigration has been artificially fostered b y doles and subventions from millionaire co-religionists in Europe [the Rothschi lds and Baron Hirsch] : the new colonies have taken root and are more or less self supporting... The pious hope that an independent Jewish State may some day be established in Palestine no doubt exists , though it may be questioned whether among the loc al Jews there is any acute desire to see it realised, excep t as a means of escape from Turkish oppression: it is perhaps more lively in the breast s of those who live far from the rocky Palestinian hills and have no intention of changing their domicile.’ 3. The Cabinet has been informed that the French Government are in sympathy with Zionist aspirations . It has recently come to my knowledge officially t hat the French Ambassador has approached our Foreign Office with a proposal t o establish a Jewish Nation in El Hasa in Arabia , oblivious of the fact that although this is techn ically Turkish territory, we have concluded so recently as 1915 a treaty which r oughly promises to support Bin Saud and his followers in the occupation of that country ...

Lord Cromer took pleasure in relating a conversatio n which he had held on the subject with one of the best known English Jews, who observed: ‘ If a Jewish Kingdom were to be established at Jerusalem I should lose no time in a pplying for the post of Ambassador in London.’...two considerations rule out the concepti on of an independent Jewish Palestine from practical politics. The first is that the prov ince as we know it is not Jewish, and that neither Mohammedan nor Arab would accept Jewish Aut hority; the second that the capital, Jerusalem, is equally sacred to three faiths, Jewis h, Christian and Moslem, and should never, if it can be avoided, be put under the exclusive co ntrol of any one local faction, no matter how carefully the rights of the other two may be sa feguarded. I would beg the Cabinet to consider this matter as a practical proposition. I yield to no one in my admiration of the distinguished Russian, Profess or Weizmann, who looms so large in our discussions. His services to the allied cause have been great. He is a scientist of repute. But on this matter he is near to being a religious fana tic. His enthusiasm for this cause have been the guiding principle of a large part of his life. It is his overwhelming enthusiasm. How often do such enthusiasms lead to complete disregard of p ractical potentialities! How little likely is such an enthusiasm to take into account the suscept ibilities of those who differ from him among those of his own religion, [let alone] those of other religions whom his activities, if successful, would dispossess. I have chosen the above title for this memorandum, not in any hostile sense, not by any means as quarreling with an anti-Semitic view which may be held by my colleagues, not with a desire to deny that anti-Semitism can be held by rational men, not even with a view to suggesting that the Government is deliberately anti -Semitic; but I wish to place on record my view that the policy of His Majesty’s Government is Anti-Semitic in result, and will prove a rallying ground for Anti-Semites in every country i n the world. This view is prompted by the receipt yesterday of a correspondence between Lord Rothschild and Mr. Balfour. Lord Rothschild’s letter is dated the 18th July and Mr. Balfour’s answer is dated August 1917. I fear that my protest comes too late, and it may w ell be that the Government were practically committed when Lord Rothschild wrote an d before I became a member of the Government, for there has obviously been some corre spondence or conversation before this letter . But I do feel that as the one Jewish Minister in the Government I may be allowed by my colleagues an opportunity of expressing views wh ich may be peculiar to myself, but which I hold very strongly and which I must ask per mission to express when opportunity affords. ...Zionism has always seemed to me to be a mischiev ous political creed , untenable by any patriotic citizen of the United Kingdom. ...I have always understood that those who indulge in this creed were largely animated by the restrictions upon, and [the] refusal of liberty to Jews in Russia. But at the very time when these Jews have been acknowledged as Jewish Russian s and given all liberties [under Masonic Bolshevism], it seems inconceivable that Zi onism should be officially recognised by the British Government, and that Mr. Balfour should be authorised to say that Palestine was to be reconstituted as the ‘National Home of the Je wish people’. I do not know what this involves, but I assume that it means that Mohammeda ns and Christians are to make way for"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"the Jews, and that the Jews should be put in positi ons of preference and should be peculiarly associated with Palestine in the same way that Engl and is with the English or France with the French, that Turks and and other Mohammedans in Pal estine will be regarded as foreigners, just in the same way as Jews will here after be tre ated as foreigners in every country but Palestine. Perhaps also citizenship must be granted only as a result of a religious test. When the Jews are told that Palestine is their nati onal home, every country will immediately desire to get rid of its Jewish citizens, and you w ill find a population in Palestine driving out its present inhabitants, taking all the best in the country, drawn from all quarters of the globe, speaking every language on the face of the earth , and incapable of communicating with one another except by means of interpreter. I have always understood that this was the consequence of building the Tower of Babel , if ever it was built, and I certainly do not diss ent from the view commonly held, as I have always under stood, by the Jews before Zionism was invented, that to bring back the Jews to form a nat ion in a country from which they were dispersed would require Divine Leadership. I have n ever heard it suggested by even their most fervent admirers, that either Mr. Balfour or L ord Rothschild would prove to be the Messiah. ...I would willingly disenfranchise every Zionist. I would be almost tempted to proscribe the Zionist Organisation as illegal and against nationa l interest . I deny that Palestine is today associated with the Jews or properly to be regarded as a fit place for them to live in . The Ten Commandments were delivered to the Jews o n Sinai. It is quite true that Palestine plays a large part in Jewish hi story, but so it does in modern Mohammedan history, and after the time of the Jews, surely it plays a larger part than any other country in Christian history. The Temple may have been in Pale stine, but so was the Sermon on the Mount and the crucifixion. I would not deny to Jews in Palestine equal rights to colonization with those who profess other religions, but a relig ious test of citizenship seems to me to be only admitted by those who take a bigoted and narro w view of one particular epoch of the history of Palestine, and claim for the Jews a position to which they are not entitled . If my memory serves me right, there are three times as many Jews in the world as could possibly get into Palestine if you drove out all the population that remains t here now. So that only one-third could get back at the most, and what will happen to the remainder ? I can easily understand the editors of the Morning Post and of the New Witness being Zionists, and I am not in the least surprised that the non-Jews of England may welcome this policy. I have always recognised the unpopularity, much gre ater than some people think, of my community . We have obtained a far greater share of this coun try’s goods and opportunities than we are numerically entitled to. We reach on the whole maturity earlier, and therefore with people of our own age we compete unf airly. Many of us have been exclusive in our friendships and intolerant in our attitude, and I can easily understand that many a non- Jew in England wants to get rid of us. ...Palestine will become the world’s Ghetto . Why should the Russian give the Jew equal rights? [when] His National home is Palestine. Why does Lord Rothschild attach so much importance to the difference between British and fo reign Jews ? All Jews will be foreign Jews, inhabitants of the great country of Palestine... I feel that the Government are asked to be the inst rument for carrying out the wishes of a Zionist organisation , largely run as my information goes, at any rate i n the past, by men of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"enemy [German] descent or birth , and by this means have dealt a severe blow to the liberties, position and opportunities of service to their fell ow Jewish countrymen.

No. 24/24] “And We notified the Children of Israel in the Scri ptures, that: Twice will you work corruption in the earth and become great tyrants .” [ Qur’an, Surah 17 , al-Isra’, verse 4] The Right Honourable Winston Spencer Churchill was allowed to publish an apology for Zionism, an attempt to establish that Zionism and B olshevism were not in fact only two sides of the same Cohen. A more accurate differentiation wou ld however be, that being secular in nature, both Zionism and Bolshevism are diametrically oppos ed to the principles and original beliefs of Mosaic Law. This view is confirmed by Mr. Jacob Sch iff, the American Jewish financier of the Russian revolution on the 11th of May 1917: “...I believe I am not far wrong if I say that from 50% per cent to 75% per cent of the so- called Jewish Nationalists are either atheists or a gnostics, and that the great majority of Jewish nationalist leaders have absolutely no inter est in the Jewish religion... ” [ Edwin Montague and the Balfour Declaration , page 20-21] Earlier that same year, on March the 24th, 1917, th e New York Times reported statements by Mr. Kennan of the work of the ‘Friends of Russian Freed om’ in the revolution. He said that during the Japanese-Russian war he was in Tokyo, and was permi tted to visit the 12,000 Russian prisoners in Japanese hands. He conceived of putting revoluti onary propaganda into the Russian army with the blessing of the Japanese authorities. So he sen t to America for all the revolutionary literature to be had. Not long after a Dr. Nicholas Russell vi sited him in Tokyo, unannounced, and said he had been sent to help. Mr. Kennan states: “The movement was financed by a New York banker you all know and love ”, he said referring to Mr. Schiff , “ and soon we received a ton and a half of Russian re volutionary propaganda . At the end of the war 50,000 Russian officers and men went back to their country as ardent revolutionists. ‘The Friends of R ussian Freedom’ had sowed 50,000 seeds of liberty in 100 Russian regiments. I do not know how many of these officers and men were in the Petrograd fortress last week, but we do know what part the army took in the revolution .” [ The Jews , page 123] Winston Churchill drew our attention to the fact th at wherever general Denikin’s authority reached, protection was always accorded to the Jews of every shade and colour with many officers reduced to the ranks for alleged anti-semi tism, plus the fact that in most cases Jewish interests and places of worship were exempted by th e Bolsheviks from their universal hostilities which tended more and more to associate the Jews in Russia with the villainies being perpetrated.

Churchill wrote under the heading ‘Zionism versus Bolshevism; A struggle for the soul of the Jewish People’: “Some people like Jews and some do not; but no thou ghtful man can doubt the fact that they are beyond all question the most formidable an d the most remarkable race which has ever appeared in the world. Disraeli , the Jew Prime Minister of England , and Leader of the Conservative Party, who was always true to his race and proud of his origin, sa id on a well known occasion: ‘ The Lord deals with the Nations as the Nations deal with their Jews .’ Certainly when we look at the state of Russia, wher e of all countries in the world, the Jews were most cruelly treated, and contrast it with the [cur rent good] fortunes of our own country which seems to have been so providentially preserved amid the awful perils of these times, we must admit that nothing that has since happened in the h istory of the world [1868 to 1920] has falsified the truth of Disraeli’s confident assertion... Good Jews and Bad Jews The conflict between good and evil which proceeds u nceasingly in the breast of man nowhere reaches such an intensity as in the Jewish race. Th e dual nature of mankind is nowhere more strongly or more terribly exemplified. We owe to th e Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated fr om the supernatural, would [arguably] be incomparably the most precious possession of mankin d, worth in fact, the fruits of all other wisdom and learning put together. On that system an d by that faith, there has been built out of the wreck of the Roman Empire the whole of our existing civilisation. And [yet] it may well be, that this same astounding race, may at the present time [1920] be in the actual process of producing another system of moral s and philosophy, as malevolent as Christianity is benevolent, which if not arrested, would shatter irretrievably all that Christianity has rendered possible. It would almost seem as if t he gospel of Christ and the gospel of Anti- Christ were destined to originate among the same pe ople; and that this mystic and mysterious race had been chosen for the supreme manifestations , of both the divine and the diabolical.\" Of the national patriotic Russian Jews, orthodox in their beliefs, The non-atheist, non-secular, non-Zionist, non-Bolshevik, non-Masonic variety who have been expendable pogrom fodder for the actions of the other variety throughout history , Churchill has this to say: “ The National"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Russian Jews, in spite of the disabilities under wh ich they have suffered, have managed to play an honourable and useful part in the national life eve n of Russia...” The International Jews “In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy ar e mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most if not all of them, have forsaken the faith of their forefathers, and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among Jews i s not new. From the days of Spartacus Weishaupt [1748-1811, Founder of the Bavarian Illum inati] to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bella Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembu rg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States of America), this world-wide conspir acy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of Society, on the basis of: arr ested development, envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing . It played as a modern writer, Mrs. Nesta H. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognisab le part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every sub versive movement during the 19th century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personal ities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed master of that enormous empire. Terrorist Jews There is no need to exaggerate the part played in t he creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by the Int ernational, and for the most part atheistical, Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are J ews .\" Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the Jewish Chronicle, London , December 16th, 1932, said that Lenin had taken part in Jewish students meetings in Switz erland thirty-five years earlier . [The Jews, page 5] He is generally regarded as Russ ian, but there is doubt. The Rev. D. Fahey says: “ Mr. Field remarked in his book ‘ All these things’ [that] Lenin was married to a Jewess [and] spoke Yiddish i n his family circle... ” [ The Rulers of Russia , page 28] Others have this to say:- Lenin was born on April 10th, 1870, in the vicinity of O dessa, Southern Russia, as a son of Ilko Sroul Goldmann, a German Jew, and Sofie Goldmann, a German Jewess ; Lenin was circumcised as Hiam Goldmann. [ Common Sense , April 1963] Lenin was left behind by a company of prisoners, an d later his convict father, Ilko Sroul Goldmann, wrote inquiring his whereabouts. [Russia Under the Jews , page 86] Lenin was picked up and adopted by Oulianoff.

[ The Jews in Russia , page 5] Winston S. Churchill continued: “Moreover, the principle inspiration and driving po wer comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure blooded Russian is eclipse d by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukha rin or Lucharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky or of Zinovieff the Direc tor of the Red Citadel (Petrograd) or of Krassin or Radek - all Jews . In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principle, part in the system of Terrorism applied by the extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter Rev olution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bella Ku n [Cohen] ruled in Hungary . [In a period of rule lasting 133 days Bela Kun is reporte d as having murdered over 700,000 Hungarians] The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany e specially in Bavaria, so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temp orary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are m any non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish Revolutionaries, the part playe d by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing... The fact that in many cases Jewish interests and Je wish places of worship are excepted by the Bolsheviks from their universal hostilities has tended more and more to associate the Jewish Race in Russia with the villainies which are being perpetrated...\" LEADERS OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION George Armstrong pointed out in his ‘ Rothschild Money Trust’ that the Jewish Russian revolution occurred in 1917 when the y were fighting World War I against Germany which had at that time a cabinet completely dominated by key ministers who were predominantly Jewish. Bethmann Holweg , chancellor and spokesman, was a descendent of the Rothschilds , Walter Rathenau , treasurer, and Felix Warburg , head of the spy system, together with five other members of the Kaiser’s Cabinet, were Je ws . The Jews in 1914 were more completely in control of Europe than they were in 1 844 when Disraeli’s “Sidonia” (Rothschild) visited the various capitals of Europe . Sidonia then with words of prophecy visioned the revolution and world at war: ‘ That mighty revolution which is at this moment preparing in Germany ... is entirely develop ing under the auspices of Jews who almost monopolise the professorial chairs of German y .’ [page 59-61]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"“We told the authorities in London: We shall be in Palestine whether you want us there or not .

Paul Warburg , Jacob Schiff and other members of the firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co ., were naturalized citizens of the United States and therefore subject to prosecution for treason . They were guilty of high treason, but the power o f the Jew in our Government at that time and since, was and is such that they have escaped the consequences of their crime. On the other hand, despite this treasonable conduct, the Jews were given Palestine upon President Wilson’s i nsistence .” Furthermore he said: “It has taken 22 years to find out the whole story of our betrayal into World War I. We are indebted to Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota for digging into the records and bringing to light the Balfour-Lansing correspondenc e by which President Wilson is shown to have agreed to enter the war long prior to the sinking of the Lusitania ... In his tireless effort to keep this country out of war, Senator Nye discovered and revealed the truth and the real reason for President Wilson’ s change of front... Prior to these revelations we thought we entered the war because o f the sinking of the Lusitania and the violation of our rights as neutral ... but it was not the real reason , as conclusively shown by the Balfour-Lansing correspondence. It was only a pretext to secure the support of Congress and the people. There can be no doubt about the fact, that prior to President Wilson’s second election in 1916 [they used the slogan] ‘he kept us out of the War’...

In a Congressional speech in the United States Sena te on April 25th 1939, reported in the Congressional Record , 76th Congress, Vol.84, No. 82, pages 6597-6604, Senator Gerald P. Nye , of North Dakota, said: “There has been published a series of works under t he title ‘ The Next War .’ One of the volumes in this series is entitled ‘ Propaganda In The Next War .’ This particular volume was written by one Sidney Rogerson . I have been unable to obtain any trace of his background or of his connections; but the edito r-in-chief of all these works, including the one entitled ‘Propaganda in the Next War’ is a man whose name is recognised the world over as an authority in Great Britain. He is non other than Capt. Liddell Hart, associated with the London Times, a writer and a mi litary authority in Europe. The following are quotations from this authority: ‘For sometime the issue as to which side the United States would take hung in the balance, the final result was a credit to our propa ganda [i.e. British]. There remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world Jew populat ion of approximately 15,000,000, no fewer than 5,000,000 are in the Unit ed States; 25% of the inhabitants of New York are Jews . During the Great War we bought off this huge Americ an Jewish Public by the promise of the Jewish national home in Palestine, held by Lude ndorf to be the master stroke of allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to Jews in America but to Jews in Germany as well.’\" “They ‘bought-off the huge American Jewish Public’ with the promise of Palestine, and with them they bought the powerful metropolitan Jew ish press and the Wilson Administration, says George Armstrong. But the next time it would require an act of aggression. Liddell-Hart made the following suggest ion: “ To persuade her (the United States) to take our par t will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed . It will need a definite threat to America , a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home by pro paganda to every citizen, before the republic will again take arms in an external quarre l... The position will naturally be considerably eased i f Japan were involved , and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious object of our propagandists to achieve this, just as during the Great War they succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground . We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one.

Our minor propaganda will aim at attaching the supp ort of important sections, such as the Jews, probably by the declaration of a clear-cut po licy on Palestine, and of our intention, if victorious, to put an end to anti-Semitic persec utions; and of the Roman Catholic community in similar terms ... In the realm of the moving picture industry we may be able to depend on the natural bias of the United States film manufacturers in favour o f Great Britain as opposed to Germany, Japan, or Italy, and on their command of t he machinery of international film distribution. This will be an asset both with the stock entertain ment picture and the news reels. \" Mr. Armstrong informs us that at the time of writin g, 1939/40, “The President has dispatched the fleet to the Paci fic Ocean. This is for the purpose of war with Japan. It can be of no other purpose. If Japan will only torpedo one of these boats, the Jewish Press, the Jewish Radio and the J ewish Cinema will do the rest . The Jewish Admiral Taussig stated to a Congressional In vestigating Committee that ‘ War with Japan is inevitable .” [ The Rothschild Money Trust , page 64] Miles Copeland in his autobiography ‘ The Game Player ’ [pages 68- 69] confirms that president Roosevelt allowed the Japanese to destroy America’s Pacific Fleet and hundreds of his own people . Having already broken Japanese codes, Copeland’s new boss informed him about the meeting between CIA-Admiral Sidney Sauers and presi dent Harry Trueman. When Sauers promised that America would never again suffer an a ttack like Pearl Harbour, Trueman said that he obviously had not received his secret briefing, otherwise he would have known that “President Roosevelt got the intelligence, and he decided to l et the Pearl Harbour attack happen as a way of arousing an otherwise apathetic populace.” INTERNATIONAL INCIDENTS ARE OFTEN CAREFULLY CREATED CRISES Also in ‘ The Game Player’ , Miles (CIA) Copeland [Mr. Coup d’Etat] writes abo ut ‘the Nasserist Honeymoon’: “...When Sir Anthony Eden became so manic on the qu estion of Egypt’s President Nasser that our Secretary of State expected any day to be confronted with British insistence on an assassination plot. At this time, the CIA station chief received a message from Allan Dulles himself, sent at the insistence of his brother, di recting us to examine ways in which, if push came to shove, Nasser could be kille d . There was a negative tone to the message which implied that the Dulles brothers woul d welcome a carefully thought out reply to the effect that Nasser was invulnerable, b ut we were not, of course, to mention the fact that we were the reason he was out of reac h of would be assassins since we had ourselves designed the security arrangements around him."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The time, at long last has come for me to confess t o the one item in all the mendacious anti-Copeland propaganda that the Communists and ce rtain petty-minded Americans have been circulating in recent years.

While the ‘straights’ in Washington were increasingly displeased with the an ti-American content of Nasser’s public utterances and the anti-American propaganda that poured out of Radio Cairo , the Middle East’s most far reaching medium, can you guess who was writing a goodly portion of the material? We were . We understood as Nasser did that at that time the new regime’s hold on the country depended on its being consistently and convincingly anti- American, and that Nasser couldn’t even risk an ind ication of reasonableness towards our various Middle East policies...We took pains to mak e it subtly counter-productive, of course, and we included a lot of patent nonsense, b ut we kept virtually in control of its production .” [Page 167] “...I wanted to find and groom a messiah who would start out in Egypt, and then spread his word to Africans and perhaps other Third World peoples . Our Chosen One, I said, should be able not only to arouse hopes, but to tur n them into valid expectations and actually lead underprivileged peoples of the world to better well-being, health, security and, above all, ‘freedom’, and would at the same ti me, immunize them against false prophets.” [Meaning genuine Islam] [page 147] One is tempted to ask who was writing Saddam Hussei n’s speeches?

We gave unto Moses the Book of Scripture as an appo inted guidance for the Children of Israel, saying: “Choose no other guardian in place of Me.” You who are descended from those who We carried alo ng with Noah in the Ark, for he was indeed a most grateful devotee. And We gave clear warnings to the Children of Israe l in their Scripture, that on two occasions they would work corruption on earth, and elated with mighty arrogance, would become great tyrants."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"So when the first of Our warnings came to pass, We sent against you servants of Ours inclined to vehement warfare, who ravaged your coun try entering the innermost parts of your homes. And it was one of the warnings complete ly fulfilled. [As Jeremiah informed them in the Old Testament Par t II Chapter 30: “...for, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivi ty of My people Israel and Judah: ...and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to the ir fathers and they shall possess it. And these are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.”] Then we allowed you to retaliate against them and W e aided you with wealth and children, and made you more numerous in man-power.

It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you, but if you return to your crimes, [Judah and Israel] We will revert to Our punishment s: And We have made hell a prison for those who insolently reject belief.\" [ Qur’an, Surah 17, Al-Isra’ , verse 1-8] Malachi 4:1 warns: “...and the day that comethh shall burn them up, sa ith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave neither root nor branch.” THE LAST EXODUS - THE LAST ALIYAH THE 3rd TIME UNLUCKY! In a recent newspaper article by Andrew Billen, ent itled ‘Exodus - The Last Jews of Rumania’, he informs us of the work of Rumania’s Chief Rabbi, Mo ses Rosen and the run-down of Rumania’s Jewish population, due to the process of Aliyah, a Hebrew term for emigration to Israel, which was never prevented during the reign of Sir Nicolae Ceauscescu, whose family had strong Jewish connections and like all Communist regimes official ly suppressed anti-Semitism as standard policy, which in the case of Rumania gave it the th e lucrative Most Favoured Nation trade status with the foster father of Israel, The United States of America. Ceauscescu also had diplomatic relations with Israel. Rabbi Rosen says: “...It is my proudest achievement that 97% of Jews left.” Rosen was elected Chief Rabbi of Rumania’s Jewish c ommunity 42 years ago, says Billen, the final descendent of an 800-year-old line of Rabbis from Galicia in Poland. “Freedom brings its own dangers”, says Rabbi Rosen, not only must Aliya h be speeded up, but, he concluded, it may be time for him to advise every Jew in Rumania to l eave. “Democracy is a good thing, but let us not forget Hitler came to power through free electi ons...”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The achievements of Rabbi Rosen, on behalf of the J ews of Rumania, are celebrated by Jewish leaders world wide. But His Eminence, as he is desc ribed in official publications, is, says Billen, “...not only the supremely powerful lay and spiritu al leader of his community, but also a consummate national politician.” If he is now exaggerating the dangers to his people , he will not be doing so carelessly. Fiercely Zionist, he fears that without Talmud Tora h classes, to teach young Jews Hebrew, they will be unable to contribute to life in Israel and may even lose the will. To this extent, it is in hi s interests to play up tensions between the communiti es by, for instance, accusing Rumania’s national poet Mihai Eminescu of anti-semitism - at a time when social barriers in Rumania have a chance of coming down.\" [this is standard practice] Probably more interesting, is the fact that Rabbi R osen was also a member of Rumania’s puppet parliament, which, Billen reports, is bringing him under scrutiny for his links with the Ceaucescu dynasty. Furthermore, he says, there are fewer than 20,000 Jews out of a population of 23 million, yet there are many Jewish leaders of the front, inc luding Silviu Bucan, former ambassador to the United Nations, and current prime minister Petre Ro man. Billen says, “There is a disproportion here.” [And it is this disproportion, which has bee n the historic cause of anti-Judaism for generations]. “Although Rosen has always denied any knowledge of it, Israel was literally allowed to buy Jews from the Rumanian Government. And by 1978, accordin g to Ion Pacepa, Rumania’s former Head of Security who defected to the West, the amount co uld range from $2,000 to $50,000 depending on the citizen’s value to each state.” Ceaucescu’s overthrow meant some quick rewriting of Rosen’s memoirs, ‘Dangers, Tests and Miracles’, recently published by Weidenfeld and Nic olson. For to be accused of having been close to Ceaucescu is the most heinous charge that can be levelled against a Rumanian these days, worse, says Billen, than being called pro-Hungarian . “A 1965 picture showing Rabbi Rosen congratulating Ceaucescu has been removed at the proof stage. In the new and fraudulent text [again standa rd procedure] Rosen swears that he only met Ceausescu no more than eight or nine times, and por trays him as a covert anti-semite, who inspired articles against him in the press.” [This again is an age-old red-herring, it’s hard to credi t Ceaucescu being anti-Jewish, when evidence exists t hat he himself was of Jewish stock, and his wife was definitely Jewish.] Rabbi Rosen demonstrates that he is a great exponen t of ‘Chutzpah’, in other words he has the cheek of the devil. Remember, where Zionism predomi nates, mendacity always asserts itself. Andrew Billen further states: “It might be wise for Rabbi Rosen also to withdraw from the bookstand at the Choral Temple in Bucharest a 1973 selection of his speeches. One, an open address he gave to Ceaucescu, begins: ‘Permit me, o n behalf of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Rumania, my colleagues and fellow Je ws of The Mosaic Cult of this country and on my own behalf, the expression of most respectful homage, of the great gratitude and - let me say it - of the boundless affection we feel for you .‘ The speech was made in 1968 , but as late as last A ugust [88/89] on the annual Liberation Day celebrations, the diplomatic community saw Rosen re peatedly rise to join the crowds in interrupting Ceaucescu’s interminable speech with a pplause."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"If Anti-Semitism can be exploited to distract and c onfuse, by accusing others of it, [which is again standard procedure] let alone a whole nation, Rosen could be hoping to deflect attention from his own record. Assuredly, it would be a bad t ime for him to plead to a volatile and immature electorate the exigencies of realpolitik. The danger for Rumanian Jewry is the old one; of cr ying wolfe...\" NASTY WRITING ON THE WALL FOR THE JEWS Under this headline wrote Peter Hillmore from Bucha rest in ‘The Observer’ of February 11th 1990: “The young interpreter said she was reading a book called Protocol and it was very interesting and informative. I told her that Frederick Forsyth’ s novel was Mrs. Thatcher’s favourite reading, and this royal seal of approval seemed to please he r greatly. But her face grew mystified as I expressed my own r eservations about the plot and the far-fetched theories it contained. ‘No, no,’ she said vehementl y, reveling in the new freedom to argue, ‘it is not at all outrageous, it is all very possible, and it is quite certain that the Jews really do have a plan to dominate Europe’. It was not ‘The Fourth Protocol’ she was talking ab out, but ‘The Protocol of Zion’, a book that is available in a Rumanian translation in Bucharest bo ok shops. Dredging up my sketchy knowledge from history lessons, I explained that her ‘Protoco l’, published in 1897, was a brilliant and elaborate forgery by the old Russian Secret Service , purporting to be a Zionist description of its nefarious ambitions, designed to encourage and give historical respectability to anti-semitism. I’m not sure if I was completely believed. Anti-Semitism is becoming respectable again in Ruma nia. Or, if not respectable, then alarmingly noticeable. In the Bucharest underground stations, the walls are plastered with political slogans and posters... Many are healthy lampoons and politi cal insults - a picture of President Ion Iliescu with a hammer and sickle underneath. But some are d angerous; a picture of Petre Roman, with a hammer and sickle - plus a Star of David underneath , the same under pictures of Silviu Brucan, the same under pictures of other political figures who happen to be Jewish.

But, like Jewish communities almost everywhere, the ir influence has been far in excess of their numbers. And, like Jewish communities almost everyw here in Eastern Europe, many achieved positions of power in the Communist Party, the part y now in disgrace.\" However, a much earlier dispatch from Rumania tells another story: “ The Jews have caused an epidemic of corruption and social unrest.

He write s as if fearful of being accused of committing the ‘blasphemy of Jewish-criticism’. As if it is at all new, this notion of Jewish involvement in the Communist movement or the indisputable fact that Je wish planning, money, and terror have been the prime mover behind practically every revolution and insurrection in recent history, as we have seen from the evidence presented thus far in our in vestigation.

If not, we will try to refresh his memory with the benefit of information from un- doctored history and unsolicited Jewish testimony as to their part in originating revolutio nary global subversion and Zionism’s policy of malevolent terror. According to Dr. Fahey in ‘ The Rulers of Russia’ , Robert Wilton says on page 29 of the French version of The Last Days of the Romanovs, ‘L es Derniers Jours des Romanof’: “In order not to leave myself open to any accusatio n of prejudice I am giving (on pages 136-137) the list of the Central Committee, of the Extraordinary Commission, and the Council of Commissars functioning at the time of th e assassination of the Imperial Family...

The report confirms P etrovski’s assertion that the Russian Royal family had been exterminated by the Jews Yourowsky, Golostchokine and Voikoff in the ‘House of Special Purpose’ at Ekaterionburg. Wilton established from data extracted from officia l Soviet Press reports, that overall of the 556 important functionaries of the Bolshevik State, he now included an additional 69 Jews to the 388 submitted by Rev George Simons to the U.S. Senate . They were in charge of the administration, responsible for the brutal extermination of the Rus sian Royal Family, and the holocaust of countless millions . Of the 556, 457 were Jews, a trend that also ran th rough the American, British and French administration as well as those of most other prominent countries, then as of now .

If he is stil l unconvinced then, hopefully, the following examples will help him and others to come to their senses. It is patently obvious to any unbiased, unprejudice d mind that Bolshevism was the culmination of the age old conspiracy of evil against all humanity , Jew and Gentile alike. But still, in spite of all the evidence, ‘The human mind jeers at the theory o f mental manipulation’. [let alone its successful implementation] Commenting on the publication of ‘ The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion’ an editorial of the ‘ Christian Science Monitor’ said on June 19th 1920 under the headline of ‘ the Jewish Peril’: “It is necessary to plunge into the thorny question as to whether the Jewish Peril, of today, is as much a delusion of its prophets as was the Yellow Peril in its day? What is important to dwell upon is the increasing evidence of the existence of a secret conspiracy, throughout the world, for the destruction of organi sed government and the letting lose of evil. The human mind jeers at the theory of mental manipulation, yet prominent politicians, philosophers and soldiers are found, a t critical moments, giving expression to views of an absolutely non-moral description, which are not in accordance with their ordinary life ...

Our vows shall not b e vows; our bonds shall not be bonds; and our oaths shall not be oaths.” [ The American Jewish Year Book (1923-1924), volume 25, page 183] Samuel Roth says: “ No other religion in the world has offered a specta cle as contradictory, as malicious as the Jewish prayer [Kol Nidre] used during Yom Kippu r . The Jewish Prayer Book lists the following sins specifically, as amongst those which are unconditionally forgiven the Jew on Yom Kippur: - Sins committed with incestuous lewdness - Assembling to commit fornication - Oppressing one’s neighbor - Deceitful acknowledgments - Violence - Denying and lying - Taking and giving bribes - Calumny - Extortion and Usury - Haughtiness - Shamelessness - Lawlessness - Litigiousness - Treachery to one’s neighbor - Tale-bearing - False-swearing - Embezzlement - Stealing.

But throughout these changes of name, inevitable adaption of custom, and adjustment of Law, the spir it of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered. When the Jew reads his prayer, he is rec iting formulae prepared by pre- Maccabean scholars; When he dons the cloak prescrib ed for the Day of Atonement and Passover-Eve, he is wearing the festival garment of ancient Jerusalem; when he studies the Talmud he is actually repeating the arguments u sed in the Palestine academies.” [ The Pharisees , Volume 1, page XXI]"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1943) lists under “Pharisees”: “The Jewish religion as it is today traces its desc ent without a break, through all the centuries, from the Pharisees .

Have we been struggling these tragic years to extir pate the secret organization of world dominion, only to find beneath it, another, more dangerous because, more secret? ” [ The Times, London , May 8th 1920] Before discussing in more detail the claim of the P rotocols’ “forgery”, we reproduce a few quotes of what has been said about them. “Whosoever was the mind that conceived them possess ed a knowledge of human nature, of history, and of statecraft, which is dazzling in its brilliant completeness, and terrible in the objects to which it turns its powers ... It is too terribly real for fiction, too well sustained for speculation, too deep in its knowledg e of the secret springs of life, for forgery .” [ The Dearborn Independant , July 10th 1920] Henry Ford : “The only statement I care to make about the ‘Proto cols’ is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old and they have fitted the world situation up to this time. They fit it now .” [ New York World , February 17th 1921] Lord Sydenham of England: “What is the most striking characteristic of the Pr otocols? The answer is knowledge of a rare kind, embracing the widest field. The solution of the ‘Mystery’, if it is one, is to be found by ascertaining where this uncanny knowledge, on which prophecies now literally fulfilled are based, can be shown to reside .” [August 27th 1921, quoted from The Protocols, Kuwai t 1968] Norman Jaques, M.P ., Canadian House of Commons: “Those who feel libelled by the Protocols have the most obvious remedy in the world; All they have to do is denounce the policy of them, ins tead of denying the authorship ... But when you come to read them, how can any reasonable man deny the truth of what is contained in them.” [July 9th 1943] In fact the most likely author of the Protocols is Theodor Herzl . The disclosure by Dr Marcus Ehrenpreis , Chief Rabbi of Sweden in 1924, adds further weigh t to identifying Herzl as the author of the “compressed” version of the Protocols . Quoted in ‘ The Effective Judaism’ , Rabbi Ehrenpreis states:"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"“Long have I been well acquainted with the contents of the Protocols, indeed for many years before they were ever published in the Christ ian press . The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, were in point of fact not the original Pro tocols at all, but a compressed extract of the same . Of the 70 Elders of Zion, in the matter of origin a nd of the existence of the original Protocols, there are only ten men in the e ntire world who know .” These disclosures by Rabbi Ehrenpreis are altogethe r consistent with the evidence provided by Nesta H. Webster in her ‘ Secret Societies and Subversive Movements’ published in the same year, 1924. On page 408-409, she states: “Contrary to the assertions of certain writers, I h ave never affirmed my belief in the authenticity of the Protocols, but have always trea ted it as an entirely open question. The only opinion to which I have committed myself is th at, whether genuine or not, the Protocols do represent the programme of World Revol ution, and that in view of their prophetic nature and of their extraordinary resembl ance to the protocols of certain Secret Societies in the past, they were either the work of some such society or of someone profoundly versed in the lore of Secret Societies w ho was able to reproduce their ideas and phraseology .” “The so-called refutation of the Protocols which ap peared in The Times of August 22nd, tends to confirm my opinion. According to these articles the Protocols were larg ely copied from the book of Maurice Joly, Dialogues aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu .” [or Montesquieu et Machiavel] A point confirmed later by Professor Norman Cohn ,in his ‘ Warrant For Genocide ’ in 1967, in which he states on page 80: “In the autobiography which he wrote in 1870 Mauric e Joly has described how, strolling one evening by the Seine in Paris, he suddenly conc eived the idea of writing a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. Montesquieu wo uld present the case of Liberalism, Machiavelli the case for cynical despot ism. Open criticism of the regime of Napoleon III was forbidden. In this way [he thought ] it should be possible, through the mouth of Machiavelli, to present the Emperor’s moti ves and methods stripped of their usual camoflage of humbug. So thought Joly but he u nderestimated his adversary. The Dialogues aux Enfers was printed in Belgium and smu ggled into France for distribution, but the moment it crossed the border it was seized by the police and its author was quickly traced and arrested. On 25th April 1865 Jol y was tried and sentenced to fifteen months’ imprisonment; his book was banned and confi scated. Joly’s later career was equally unfortunate. Witty, aggressive, no respecter of persons, he proceeded from disappointment to disappointment unt il, in 1879, he committed suicide. He deserved a better fate. He was not only a brilliant stylist, he had fine intuition of the forces, whic h gathering strength after his death, were to produce the political cataclysms of the present century. In his novel Les Affames he shows a rare understand ing of those tensions in the modern world, which foster revolutionary movements, whether of th e right or the left. Above all, in his reflections on the amateurish despotism of Napoleon III he arrived at insights, which remain valid when applied to various authoritarian regimes of ou r own time. Moreover, something of Joly’s insights even survived when the Dialogue aux Enfers was transformed into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; that is one reason - though as we s hall see, not the only reason - why the Protocols"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"often seem to forecast twentieth-century authoritar ianism...Such is the book that inspired the forger of the Protocols. He plagiarized it shameles sly...\" But who was this shameless forger and what was the object of the exercise? Herzl, according to Rabbi Ehrenpreis, seems to have embodied all the qualifications; a man with both the vision and the ability to write and ignite the blue touch-paper, and retire immediately. After all, according to Marvin Lowenthal, the edito r and translator of Herzl’s Diaries:- “he was to all intents and purposes a man of letters: a Journa list, a Playwright, Feuilletonist, and Short story writer” who “aspired to be a Novelist...” [The Herz l Diaries, page x]. And as such he was more than qualified to reproduce the ideas and phraseolo gy of Secret-Society lore. Rabbi Ehrenpreis says: “I participated with Dr. Herzl in the first Zionist Congress which was held in 1897. Herzl was the most prominent figure at the Jewish World C ongress. Herzl foresaw, twenty years before we experienced them, the revolution, w hich brought the Great War, and he prepared us for that which was to happen. He foresa w the splitting up of Turkey [a proven 100% Judeo-Masonic Conspiracy], that England would obtain control of Palestine. We may expect important developments in the world .” [In 1962 David Ben Gurion made similar predictions] Back to Mrs Webster’s ‘ Secret Societies and Subversive Movements’ , page 409: “Now precisely at the moment when Joly published hi s Dialogues aux Enfers the secret societies were particularly active, and since by th is date a number of Jews had penetrated into their ranks a whole crop of literary efforts d irected against Jews and secret societies marked the decade.” “Now it will be remembered that amongst the sets of parallels to the Protocols quoted by me in World Revolution, two were taken from the sou rces above quoted - the documents of the Haute Vente Romain and the programme of Bakunin’s secret society , the Alliance Sociale Democratique. Meanwhile Mr Lucien Wolf had found another parallel to the Protocols in Goedsche’s book . ‘ The Protocols’ Mr Wolf had no hesitation in asserting, ‘are, in sh ort an amplified imitation of Goedsche’s handiwork’ (Spectator for June 12, 1920) , and he went on to show that ‘Nilus followed this pamphlet very closely.’ The Protocols were then declared by Mr Wolf and his friends to have been completely and finally ref uted. But alas for Mr. Wolf’s discernment! The Times articles came and abolished the whole of his carefully constructed theory. They did not, however, demolish mine; on the contrary, they supplied another and a very curious link in the chain of evi dence. For is it not remarkable that one of the sets of parallels quoted by me appeared in t he same year as Joly’s book, and that within the space of nine years no less than four pa rallels to the Protocols should have been discovered? Let us recapitulate the events of this decade in the form of a table and the proximity of dates will then be more apparent: 1859. Cretineau Joly’s book published containing do cuments of Haute Vente Romaine (parallels quoted by me). 1860. ‘Alliance Israelite Universelle’ founded."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"1864. 1st International taken over by Karl Marx. 1864. Alliance Sociale Democratique of Bakunin foun ded (Parallels quoted by me) 1864. Maurice Joly’s Dialogue aux Enfers published (parallels quoted by the Times). 1866. 1st Congress of Iternationale at Geneva. 1868. Goedsche’s Biarritz (parallels quoted by Mr L ucien Wolf). 1869. Gougenot Des Mousseaux’s Le Juif et la Judais ation, etc 1869. Bakunin’s Polemique contre les Juifs. It will be seen, then, that at the moment when Maur ice Joly wrote his ‘Dialogues’, the ideas they embodied were current in many different circles. It is interesting, moreover, to notice that the authors of the last two works, the Catholic and Roy alist Des Mousseaux and the Anarchist Bakunin, between whom it is impossible to imagine a ny connection, both in the same year denounced the growing power of the Jews whom Bakuni n described as ‘the most formidable sect’ in Europe, and asserted that a leakage of informati on had taken place in the secret societies. Thus in 1870 Bakunin explains that his secret society ha s been broken up be cause its secrets have been given away, ... and that his colleague Netchaieff h as arrived at the conclusion that ‘in order to found a serious and indestructible society on must take for a basis the policy of Machiavelli.’ ... Meanwhile Gougenot Des Mousseaux had related in Le Juif , that in December 1865 he had received a letter from a German statesman saying: ‘Since the revolutionary recrudescence of 1848, I h ave had relations with a Jew who, from vanity, betrayed the secret of the secret soci eties with which he had been associated, and who warned me eight or ten days beforehand of a ll the revolutions which were about to break out at any point of Europe . I owe to him the unshakeable conviction that all th ese movements of ‘Oppressed peoples,’ etc, etc., are de vised by half a dozen individuals [10 according to Rabbi Ehrenpreis ], who give their orders to the secret societies of al l Europe. The ground is absolutely mined beneath our feet, and the Jews are these miners .’ It is further important to notice that Joly’s work is dated from Geneva, the meeting place for all revolutionaries of Europe, in cluding Bakunin, who was there in the same year, and where the first Congress of the Internationale led by Karl Ma rx was held two years later. Already the revolutionary camp was divided into warring faction s, and the rivalry between Marx and Mazzini had been superseded by the struggle between Marx an d Bakunin. And all these men were members of secret societies. It is by no means impr obable then that Joly, himself a revolutionary, should during his stay in Geneva have come into tou ch with the members of some secret organization who may have betrayed to him their own secret or those of a rival organization they had reason to suspect of working under the cover of revolutionary doctrines for an ulterior end. Thus the protocols of a secret society modelled on the lines of the Illuminati or the Haute Vente Romain may have passed into his hands and been util ized by him as an attack on Napoleon (III) who, owing to his known connection with the Carbona ri, might have appeared to Joly as the chief exponent of the Machiavellian art of duping the peo ple and using them as a lever to power which the secret societies had reduced to a system."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"This would explain Maurice Joly’s mysterious reference to the ‘ political system which has not varied for a single day in its application since the disastrous and alas! too far-off date of its enthro nement .’ Moreover, it would explain the resemblance between all the parallels to the Protocols from the writings of the Illuminati and Mirabeau’s Projet de Revolution of 1789 onwards. For if the system had never varied, the code on which it was founded must have remained substantially the same. Further, if it had never varied up to the time when Joly wrote, why should it have varied since that date?... Might not the same process of evolution have taken place between the dates at which the works of Joly and Nilus were published? I do not agree wi th the opinion of the Morning Post that: ‘the author of the Protocols must have had the Dialogues of Joly before him.’ It is possible but not proven. Indeed, I find it difficult to imagine that anyone embarking on such an elaborate imposture should not have possessed the wit to avoi d quoting passages verbatim - without even troubling to arrange them in a different sequence - from a book, which might at any moment be produced as evidence against him. For contrary to t he assertions of the Times, the Dialogues of Joly is by no means a rare book, not only was it to be found at the British Museum but at the London Library, and recently I was able to buy a co py for the modest sum of 15 francs. There was therefore every possibility of Nilus being sudd enly confronted with the source of plagiarism. Further, is it conceivable that a plagiarist so uns kilful and so unimaginative would have been capable of improving the original? For the Protocol s are a vast improvement on the Dialogues of Joly. The most striking passages they contain are n ot found in the earlier work, nor, which is more remarkable, are several of the amazing prophec ies concerning the future which time has realized. It is this latter fact which presents the most insuperable obstacle to the Times solution of the problem. To sum up then, the Protocols are either a mere pla giarism of Maurice Joly’s work, in which case the prophetic passages added by Nilus or another re main unexplained, or they are a revised edition of the plan communicated to Joly in 1864, b rought up to date and supplemented so as to suit modern conditions by the continuers of the plo t. Whether in this case the authors of the Protocols w ere Jews or whether the Jewish portion have been interpolated by the people into whose hands th ey fell is another question. Here we must admit the absence of any direct evidence. An intern ational circle of world revolutionaries working on the lines of the Illuminati, of which the existe nce has already been indicated, offers a perfectly possible alternative to the ‘Learned Elders of Zion .’ It would be easier, however to absolve the Jews from all suspicion of complicity if they and t heir friends had adopted a more straight forward course from the time the Protocols appeared . When some years ago a work of a similar kind was directed against the Jesuits, containing w hat purported to be a ‘Secret Plan’ of revolution closely resembling the Protocols [ Revolution and War or Britain’s Peril and Her Secret Foes, by Vigilant , 1913], the Jesuites indulged in no invectives, ma de no appeal that the book should be burnt by the common hangman, resorte d to no fantastic explanations, but quietly pronounced the charge as a fabrication. Thus the ma tter ended. But from the moment the Protocols were published th e Jews and their friends had recourse to every tortuous method of defence, brought pressure to bear on the publishers - succeeded, in fact, in temporarily stopping the sales - appealed to the Home Secretary to order their suppression,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"concocted one clinching refutation after another, a ll mutually exclusive of each other, so that by the time the solution now pronounced to be the corr ect one appeared, we had already been assured half a dozen times that the Protocols had b een completely and finally refuted. And when at last a really plausible explanation had been dis covered, why was it not presented in a convincing manner? All that was necessary was to st ate that origin of the Protocols had been found in the work of Maurice Joly, giving parallels in support of this assertion. What need to envelop a good case in a web of obvious romance? Wh y all this parade of confidential sources of information, the pretence that Joly’s book was so r are as to be almost unfindable when a search in the libraries would prove the contrary? Why these a llusions to Constantinople as the place ‘to find dark secrets’, to the mysterious Mr X. who doe s not wish his real name to be known, and to the anonymous ex-officer of the Okhrana from whom b y mere chance he bought the very copy of the Dialogues used for the fabrication of the Proto cols by the Okhrana itself, although this fact was unknown to the officer in question? Why, furthe r, should Mr X., if he were a Russian land owner, Orthodox by religion and a Constitutional Mo narchist, be so anxious to discredit his fellow Monachists by making the outrageous assertio n that ‘the only occult Masonic organization such as the Protocols speak of’ - that is to say, a Machiavellian system of an abominable kind - which he had been able to discover in Southern Russ ia ‘was a Monarchist one’? It is evident then that the complete story of the P rotocols has not yet been told, and that much yet remains to be discovered concerning this mysterious affair.\" Does this leave any doubt in the exercise of undue, disproportional influence of Zio nist Jews in world politics? Benjamin Disraeli said: “An insurrection takes place against tradition and aristocracy, against religion and property... The natural equality of men and abrogation of prope rty are proclaimed by the Secret Societies which form Provincial Governments, and men of the Jewish race are found at the head of everyone of them . The people of God co-operate with atheists; most skillful accumulators of property ally themselves w ith Communists; the peculiar and chosen race touch the hands of all the scum and low castes of Europe; and all this because they wish to destroy that ungrateful Christ endom which owes them even its name, and whose tyranny they can no longer endure . When the Secret Societies, in February 1848, surpri sed Europe, they were themselves surprised by the unexpected opportunity, and so lit tle capable were they of seizing the occasion, that had it not been for the Jews, who of late years unfortunately have been connecting themselves with these unhallowed associa tions, imbecile as the governments were, the uncalled-for outbreak would not have rava ged Europe. But the firey energy, and the teeming resources of the Children of Israel mai ntained for a long time the unnecessary and useless struggle.

Albert G. Mackey’s 1921 revised edition of the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry states that “ Masonry is in every sense of the word - except one - an eminently religious institution, that is in debt solely to the religious element whi ch it contains, for its origin and for its continued existence, and that without this religiou s element, it would scarcely be worthy of cultivation by the wise and (the) good .” [ The Question of Freemasonry , page 3] Albert Pike , 33rd degree Grand Commander of the Supreme Counci l of America between 1859 and 1891, states in his now famous, or infamous Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, published in 1871: Freemasonry “is the universal, eternal, immutable r eligion, such as God planted in the heart of universal humanity; no creed has ever been long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is the base and they are the superst ructure. Masonry, then, is a religious institution, and on this ground mainly, if not alon e, should the religious masons defend it. ” [ibid] 33rd Degree Pike says that it is also"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"“The custodian and depository of the great philosop hical and religious truths unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems and allegories .” [ibid] Manley P. Hall , in his ‘ Locked Keys of Freemasonry’ , gives a clear picture of the ‘spirit’ by which freemasonry is led, and the disturbing reason for all the secrecy and disinformation surrounding masonic origins and religious beliefs: “When the mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the m ystery of his craft . The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands, and before he may step onward and upwards, he must prove his ability to properly apply (this) ene rgy.” [Ibid, page 6; The Oxford dictionary describes Luci fer as ‘the Morning Star; Satan.’ Hence all the subterfuge.] However, before the mason discovers this Luciferian aspect of ‘The Brotherhood’ (if at all), he has already agreed to submit himself blindly to the authority of his ‘worshipful master’ with a binding oath; Mackey in his Encyclopedia of Freemasonry , page 525, reminds us that: “The first duty of every mason is to obey the manda te of the master”, and that “ The order must at once be obeyed.” [ibid] Blind obedience is standard Masonic policy, perfect ed and ruthlessly implemented by the Arabian Masonic Order of the Assassins in 1090 AD under the Grand Mastership of the Persian Hasan Saba. And because of their murderous attacks on Chr istian Pilgrims going to Jerusalem precipitating the first Crusade of 1099 AD, present day masonic movements appear to derive all their operational policies from Abdullah ibn Maymun (872 AD) via the Grand Lodge of Cairo (1004 AD) through Adam Weishaupt and the Bavarian I lluminati between 1777 and 1811. But the Qur’an confirms it to be far more ancient than that. Mackey goes on to say: “Its character and its consequences may be matters of subsequent inquiry (but) the Masonic rule of (blind) obedience is like the nauti cal imperative: Obey orders even if you break owners .” [ibid] Arthur Waite , in his ‘ New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry’ , reminds us of the functions worshipful masters carry out for their subordinates . “The head and chief of the lodge (is) the source of light, knowledge and instruction in masonry. He personifies the sublime art of masonry, and is the spokesman thereof.” Misleading public statements are standard practice for official Masonic spokesmen, like Commander Higham. Statements which seem to contradi ct Pike, Mackey, Hall and Waite - all reliable experts on the subject, who categorically assert that freemasonry is indeed a religious order, with an unbroken tradition, and the deposito ry of great philosophical truths handed down from age to age - are essential for its continued s urvival. Truth and openness have never, and can never be part of masonic policy, as the following p assages will demonstrate: On July 14th, 1889, Albert Pike , as grand commander of ‘universal freemasonry’ mad e clear the reasons for all the lies and secrecy, when he said:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"“That which we must say to the crowd is [that] ‘We worship a God but it is the God that one adores without superstition’ . [However,] To you Sovereign Grand Inspectors Genera l [of the 33rd degree] we say this, that you may [in turn] repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The Masonic Religion s hould be by all of us initiates in the High Degrees maintained in the purity of the Lucife rian Doctrine .” [For] if Lucifer were not God, would Adonai [the Go d of Abraham] whose deeds prove his cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, his barbari sm and repulsion for science, would Adonai and his Priests calumniate him? Yes [brethren] Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonai is also God . For the eternal law is that there is no light wit hout shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the a bsolute can only exist as two gods! Darkness being necessary for light to serve as its foil. As the pedestal is necessary for the statue and the brake to the locomotive. Thus the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonai [Allah]. Lucifer, God of Light and Good, is struggling for h umanity against Adonai , the God of Darkness and Evil.\" [ibid, page 7] “To prevent the light from escaping at once, the De mon/s forbade Adam to eat the fruit of ‘knowledge of good and evil’ by which he would have known the Empire of Light as well as of Darkness. He obeyed; (but) an Angel of L ight, induced him to transgress, and gave him the means of Victory; but (then) the Demon /s created Eve, who seduced him into the act of Sensualism that enfeebled him, and bound him anew in the bonds of matter. This is repeated in the case of every man t hat lives.” [ Occult Theocracy , page 6-7] The ‘Principal’ or ‘Angel of light - Lucifer’ reapp ears to mankind much later on, according Albert Pike and his Masonic brethren of the 30th to the 33rd degree, speaking in support of their adherence to the Luciferian Doctrine. On this occas ion, we are informed, he only “Put on the appearance of a human body and took the name of Christ in the Messiah, only to accommodate itself to the language of the Jews. The light did its work, turning the Jews from the adoration of the Evil Principle [Adon ai] and the Pagans from the worship of Demons. But the Chief of the Empire of Darkness caused him to be crucified by the Jews. Still, he suffered in appearance only.” [ Pikes, Morals and Dogma , quoted in The Question of Freemasonry , page 6]. For every lie to succeed it must always contain an element of truth! The Qur’an informs us of this double, double-cross. First of all, Allah has said: “Take not for worship Two gods. For there is only O ne God: So of Me be only in Awe: To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on th e earth, and Religion is His forever: Then can you fear other than Allah?” [ Surah 16, An-Nahl (The Bee), verse 51-52] Secondly, like the original Gospels, the Qur’an tel ls us that Jesus was not murdered by the Jews, even though they boasted that they had killed him l ike so many of God’s messengers they had assassinated before him. The Gospel of Barnabas informs us that it was only the transfigured Judas who was crucified suffering the fate he had p lanned for Jesus at the instigation of Satan, perhaps in his Angel of Light disguise, the disguis e that according to St. Barnabas fooled Paul on the road to Damascus, hence their estrangement . The alternating Luciferian/Satanic emanations"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"are in reality only manifestations of the left and right aspects of the same Diabolical entity, but in his case they are both integrated and dedicated, wh ich helps to explain why the victim on the cross asks God why He had ‘forsaken him’ when he ha d only carried out his bidding. The Qur’an states that because The People of the Bo ok were presumptious, asking Moses to “show them God in public”, they were stunned for th eir presumption. And because they broke their covenants and rejected God’s signs they have incurred divine displeasure. And because they made a habit of killing God’s Messengers, God “seal ed their hearts for their blasphemy, for little is it they believe”. And that “ They rejected faith and uttered against Mary a grave calumny” that she was unchaste. And boasted “we have killed Chris t Jesus the son of Mary, the apostle of God”, “but they killed him not, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared so unto them. And behold those who disagree concerning it are full of uncertainties. They have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of conjecture, for c ertainly they killed him not. But Allah made him ascend up unto Himself; and Allah is exalt ed in power, wise. And furthermore there is not one of the people of the book but will believe in him before his (real) death; and on the day of judgment he will bear witness aga inst them .” For the iniquity of the Jews, God made certain good and wholesome foods unlawful, because “They hindered many from God’s way”, and also “ Tha t they took usury/interest though they were forbidden it, and [through it] devoured men’s substance wrongfully.” God says, “We have prepared for those amongst them who reject faith gr ievous punishment.” [Qur’an, Surah 4, an-Nisa’ (Women), verses 153-161] Pike states in his ‘ Morals and Dogma’ : “ Masonry, like all religions, all the Mysteries, Her meticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Elect, and uses false e xplanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to conceal the truth, which it calls light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy of it o r would pervert it.” The lower degrees are naturally kept in ignorance t hat Satan as Lucifer is their ‘Grand Architect’, until they are too far committed to think of leavin g. “The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portic o of The Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is inte ntionally mislead by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, b ut it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them .” [ The Question of Freemasonry , page 5] Henry Wilson Coil in his Masonic encyclopedia publi shed in 1961 apologises for Mackey and Pike, who he says both entered the fraternity in th e 1840’s when fabulist masonic literature was at its height suggesting that both walked unsuspecting ly into an American circle of magism, paganism, and occultism and published works before they “were properly seasoned in the history or doctrine of the Craft” while at the same time ig noring - he says – “Those things that were indisputably Masonic, such as the Gothic Constitutions”. Yet these same Gothic Constitutions confirm Mackey’ s and Pike’s view."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Freemasons are traditionally mislead into believing that their order derives its mandate from the Holy Prophet King Solomon whilst building the Templ e in Jerusalem, even though by order no iron tools were to be employed in its construction . A stone-eating worm called the Shamir (as in Yitsak Shamir) was deployed by Suleiman to carry ou t all the carving . Therefore, stonemasons had little, if anything, to do with its constructio n. King Suleiman or Solomon had the power to control all material and spiritual forces during hi s reign, and the Glorious Temple was built in the main by non-human agencies, and by the absolute pow er and authority of King Suleiman. Even rebellious Jinns or Genies were pressed into servic e and despised toil, creating by their genius lakes of smooth clear glass, beautiful monuments, a nd sculptures. But they toiled on long after the death of King Suleiman, because even they with thei r genius and miraculous capabilities had not recognised the fact, that the prophet-king, Solomon was dead, because he still appeared every day, standing in his usual place, resting on his st aff. O nly when his staff crumpled, having been weakened by a wood boring worm, and Suleiman fell, did the rebellious Jinn realise the truth . The Qur’an, as usual, sets the record straight on s uch issues. Practically all secret societies and subversive movements derive their spiritual directi on and inspiration from the genius of Lucifer/Satan. For they are one and the same, to fo llow one or the other is only the same as jumping out out of the frying pan into the fire. Th e warning in the Qur’an about occult freemasonry and all its associated ‘fringe organisa tions’ is as follows:- “And when there comes to them a messenger from Alla h, confirming that which they already possess from earlier revelations, a party o f those who have received the Scripture [Jews and Christians] conceal the Scripture of Almi ghty God behind their backs, pretending not to know! Preferring to follow what the evil ones falsely rel ate about the power of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved; but the devils who disbeli eved, teaching men magic, and that which was revealed by the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut . But neither of these two taught anyone anything without first informing them ‘ We are only here as a temptation for you; So do not blaspheme .’ The result was that mankind learned occult scien ces by which they could cause divisions between man and wife; but they could not harm anyone by these means, except by God’s permission. And they learned only what harmed them, not what was beneficial. Even though they knew from their scriptures that by trafficking in the occult they would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And surely evil is the price for which they sell th eir souls, if they but knew .\" [ Surah 2, Al-Baqarah (the Heifer), verse 101-102] According to some commentators the above Quranic st atements amount to the fact ‘that some of the Children of Israel, particularly the tribe of J udah instead of following the Word of God, followed certain evil practices which they falsely attribute to the holy prophet Solomon and two angels at Babel. Solomon is declared free of any su ch crime attributed to him, and the story against the two angels declared to be a falsehood i nvented by them in order to justify their continued use of magic and usury.

Of course they would say that it is all very symbolic, but Pike, o bjected to it even as a symbol.” The Pike referred to by Hannah, was the leading Mas onic authority of his day, Albert Pike, who was Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Supreme Council at Charleston U.S.A., a Masonic body which at that time (1873) di d not include a Royal Arch Chapter. As a 32nd degree Mason Pike was entrusted with reviewing and compiling a catalogue of all masonic rituals even upto the 33rd degree. His ‘ Morals & Dogma of the Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite’ are perhaps his best known published work. He wrote: “No man or body of men can make me accept as a sacr ed word, as a symbol of the infinite and eternal Godhead, a mongrel word, in part composed of the name of an accursed and beastly heathen god, whose name has be en for more than two thousand years an appellation of the Devil .” [ The Holy Triad, Washington 1873, quoted on page 35 of Darkness Visible ] Pike, however, for all his erudition, was also guil ty, on more than one occasion, of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Proving the point, tha t whilst one may be better informed than the next, he or she might not necessarily be any the wi ser.

It is useful to note the positions into which the f ollowers of Masonic belief have managed to establish and maintain themselves since the first G rand Lodge was convened in 1717. Today it still has among its dignitaries, members of the Ari stocracy, The Legal Profession, The Armed Forces, Bankers Financiers, Accountants, Politician s, Civil Servants, Doctors, Professors; Members of The Clergy, Show Business, Espionage, Th e Judiciary, The Police, Business, Commerce, etc., etc., etc. It makes interesting reading to see where some of t hese followers and upholders of the Masonic ‘Religion’ and its binding oaths are operating in t oday’s world. According to the official Masonic Year Book of 1985-86, there are 1,676 Masonic Lodges operating in London , with another 5,785 Lodges in Britain’s 47 Provinces: The following examples are from the London Lodges a lone. Institutions like The Bank of England have their own Lodges, in its case it is listed as No 263, one of the earliest. Lloyds Bank , not surprisingly is the Black Horse of Lombard St reet No 4155. The Chartered Accountants Lodge is Lodge No 3162, The Certified Accountants No 7582. Other organisations include The City of London Nati onal Guard; The City of London Red Cross; The City of London Rifles; The City of London Lodge of Installed Masters; The City of Westminster; City University; Grays Inn; The Guildh all School of Music; The Middlesex Hospital; The National Westminster (Bank) No 3647. Even Educational establishments have their own Lodg es, like the The Northern Polytechnic; Oxford & Cambridge University No 1118. Even the Public Schools Installed Masters have one, together with The Royal Air Force; The Royal Albert Hall; The Royal Colonial Institute; The Royal Dental Hospital; The Royal Engineers; The Roy al Naval College; and United Services. Even Borough Councils like St Marylebone and Westmi nster City Council have lodges of their own, as do The Stationers Company; Trinity College Dublin; along with the Universities of Durham, Edinburgh, and London. It can be seen from this small sample of organisations that Craft and Royal Arch influence is extremely wide sp read, and that no office, or branch of government is free from it’s influence; particularl y our courts which are full of Masonic Judges and officials.

Over 30 of them have taken the binding oath in the name of Jah-Bul-On Je hovah. Should a Judge promise to be partial; to look more favourably on one member of the public than another? The possibility that Masonic judges can and do prev ent non-masons from succeeding against ‘Companion Royal Arch Masons’, because of binding o aths they made to some beastly heathen deity, believing it to be Almighty God, requires ur gent attention indeed! So just who or what is Jehovah-Jah-Bul-On? I will describe in detail later how the discipherin g and correct analysis of the triple sound combination, which represents the Occult, Judeo-Mas onic god ‘Jehovah Jah-Bal-On’, was arrived at. What remains to be done is to see what it repre sents, and why it should be resisted. The book, ‘Inside the Brotherhood’ by Martin Short contains a good summaryof the continuing"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"controversy surrounding this word, even in Masonic circles. In chapter four - ‘Jahbulon - The sacred word to keep’, he quotes Canon Richard Tydem an, a previous Grand Chaplain as saying:- “The ‘secret’ of Masonry is completely indefinable ... it can only be obtained by those who come of their own free will and accord, properl y prepared and humbly soliciting. And the knowledge that this humility has been share d by everyone else in the room is the cement that binds Masons. The ‘secret’ is the share d experience... [ Inside the Brotherhood , page 62] On the other hand, Mr Short informs us that the Met hodist inquiry found that ‘the most serious objection’ for a Christian in all Freemasonry “lies in the Royal Arch ritual which reveals the Supreme Being’s true name as Jahbulon. Clearly each of this words three syllables conform to the name of a divinity in a particular religion. The wh ole word is thus an example of syncretism, an attempt to unite different religions in one, which Christians [and Muslims] cannot accept [but for different reasons].” Likewise the Church of England. In October 1987, Canon Brian Brindley in an article in the Reading Evening Post described Jahbulon as ‘An unholy compound of the Hebrew name of God Jehov ah, with the heathen names for Baal and Osiris’ . Martin Short says: “Springing to Jahbulon’s defence was Grand Secretar y Higham who doubles as ‘Grand Scribe Ezra’ of Royal Arch. The jobs go together at Freemasons’ Hall, London, where ‘Ezra’ Higham speaks for some 180,000 ‘Companions’ in 2,836 ‘Chapters’ in England and Wales. He now scribed that the Canon (Brindley) had got it wrong : ‘The tri-syllable word in the Royal Arch is a word and not a name of God. It is not an attempt to combine the names of gods of differing r eligions, nor does it have any reference to pagan gods. Attempts to relate its sec ond and third syllables to Baal and Osiris are simply semantic games played by uninform ed critics of Freemasonry.’\" Few Reading Evening Post readers, says Mr Short, co uld have made sense of this \"Not least because Mr Higham, like all Royal Arch C ompanions, has sworn never to divulge the word he was defending . Because if he ever ‘dares to pronounce’ Jah-Bul-O n outside Royal Arch circles ( it is pronounced Yahbulon, by the way ) the good commander risks having his ‘head cut off’ and according to so me versions of the ritual, his ‘brains exposed to the burning rays of the sun. ’ [Means the demonic infliction of pain by the burnin g rage of “Lucifer, the morning star” -- MC] If this was not a big enough impediment to free spe ech, Higham was labouring under a more practical disability: he was misrepresenting the Ro yal Arch ritual. This tells how the Jews were freed from captivity in Babylon in the sixth centur y B.C., and how they returned to Jerusalem to rebuild King Solomon’s Temple. The aspiring candida te is given a shovel to dig the foundations,"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"but during excavations another worker discovers a v ault from the original Temple. This contains a gold plate inscribed with two words: Jehovah, des cribed as the ‘Sacred and Mysterious Name of the True and Living God Most High’; and Jahbulon.Th e candidate is told these are Masonry’s ‘long-lost secrets’, which Hiram Abiff died for rat her than betray 500 years before. Helping to rediscover them wins the candidate ‘exaltation’ to the rank of Companion. Only then is he told that all the secrets he had learned in the first th ree degrees are ‘substituted secrets’, adopted ‘unt il time or circumstances should restore the genuine’. Thus Masonry’s ‘Supreme Degree’ drops the bombshell that all the hocuspocus in the Craft is c ounterfeit. [What a waste of life time and waste of energy to f ind out a what? NAME... Insane! And by the way why the name of the creator (if it is a name of True God) should be held in SUCH secrecy? – MC] To enact this rediscovery, the top of the Royal Arc h ‘altar’ is adorned with a plate not of gold but of brass. This is inscribed with a circle on which is written JE-HO-VAH, split into three syllables. Within the circle is a triangle . On each side of the triangle is written JAH-BUL-ON , also split into three. In England this ritual is performed in dozen s of variations or ‘workings’ but most include a ‘Mystical Lecture’, which all Companions must drink in: ‘In times of antiquity, names of God and symbols of divinity were always enclosed in triangular figures... They gave it the name of God. .. This sacred Delta is usually enclosed with a square and circle, thereby expressing its vi vifying influence... The word on the triangle is that Sacred and Mysterious Name you hav e just solemnly engaged yourself never to pronounce.’ This leaves little room for doubt that ... Jahbulon is a name of God and not just a word. Indeed it seems to be the ‘Sacred and Mysterious Name’ ... Th e lecture continues. ‘It is a compound word, and the combination forms t he word Jah-Bul-On. It is in four languages, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syriac, and Egyptian. JAH is the Chaldee name of God , signifying ‘His essence and majesty incomprehensibl e.’ It is also a Hebrew word signifying ‘I am and shall be’, thereby expressing the actual, future, and eternal existence of the Most High. BUL is a Syriac word denoting Lord, or Powerful, it is in itself a compound word, being formed from the preposition Beth, in or on, and Ul , Heaven or on High. ON is an Egyptian word signifying Father of All , as in that well known prayer, Our Father, which art in Heaven. The various significat ions of the word may thus be collected: I am and shall be; Lord in Heaven or on High.’ This demolishes Higham’s claim that Jahbulon is ‘no t an attempt to combine the names of gods of differing religions... The Mystical Lecture clea rly asserts just that. In ancient times the Chaldeans, Syrians and Egyptians all worshipped pag an gods , to whom their alleged words meaning ‘God’, ‘Lord on High’ and ‘Father of All’ m ust be understood to refer. What of Higham’s last swipe: against the ‘semantic games’ [anti-Semantic?] played by those ‘uninformed critics of Freemasonry’ who attempt to relate BUL and ON to Baal and Osiris? Clearly the Church of England Working Group fall in to that category, for they were perturbed by the meaning of both Jahbulon and the three Hebrew letters A, B and L - Aleph, Beth, and Lamed"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"- set at the triangle’s corners. The Mystical Lectu re explains these letters may be juggled to spell the divine incantations: AB BAL (meaning Father Lor d), AL BAL (Word Lord), and LAB BAL (Spirit Lord). The group said the obvious result is to emphasize BAL, which they clearly felt was simply another spelling of Baal...\" [Inside the Bro therhood, page 65] The Qur’an points out the error of Baal worship, un der all its guises, including the above sample of Luciferian doctrine. It also warns us not to dis pute with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be wi th those amongst them who inflict injury. [ Qur’an, Surah 29 , verse 46] “Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! Lo! thus do We rewa rd the good. Behold! they are two of our believing servants. And also Elias was of th ose sent to warn. When he said unto his people: Will you not ward off evil? Will you cry unto Baal and forsake the best of Creators - Allah ; your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ?But they denied him, so they will surely be hailed forth to the doom... Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say Allah ha s begotten. And verily they tell a lie... What aileth you? How judge you? Will you not then r eflect? Or have you a clear warrant? Then produce it if you are truthful. And t hey imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before Him. Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute to Him.” [Qur’an, Surah 37, verse 120-127 and 150-159] The false idea of ‘God The Father - begetting’ in t he way described in the Athanasian Creed, was imported from Egypt along with a whole range of con cepts alien to Hebrew Monotheism. The Roman Catholic catechism states, that Jesus was the begotten son of God, “begotten not made, one in substance with the Father, and through him a ll things were made”. A concept that is completely alien to Hebrew Islam, which views the w hole idea as loathsome. One of the most frequently recited Surahs or chapte rs in the Qur’an related to this issue, is called ‘The Sincerity’ or ‘Al- Ikhlas’. Some authorities t hink that it was revealed in answer to a question from Jewish doctors concerning the nature of God. “In The Name of Allah, the Beneficient, The Mercifu l. 1. Say: He Allah, is One (Ahad)! 2. Allah is He Who we all depend on! 3. He begets not, nor was He begotten 4. And there is no one comparable to Him\". [Qur’an, Surah 112] Jehovah-Jahbulon, or Atum , the aboriginal deity, as he is described by R.T. Rundle Clark , in ‘The Magic of Obelisks ’ by Peter Thompkins , was ‘ The Rock That Begot’ , the phallus of Ra- Atum, symbolised as an Obelisk. The self-engendered Atum-Ra rises up as a primeval hill [‘jabalon’ in Arabic means hill or mountain], the T emple Hill of the Sun at Heliopolis-ON, the dwelling place of the High God manifesting himself as light and symbolised as an obelisk, or the Pillar of Heaven, the Rock of Ages. It continued th e cult of Terrestial-Phallicism, started by Nimrod and his Tower of Babel, and commemorated the following prayer:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"“Oh Atum, when you came into being you rose up as a high hill. You shon as the BenBen stone Obelisk, in the Temple of the Phoenix at On-H eliopolis.” According to Hargrave Jennings, in ‘Phallicism -Cel estial & Terrestial’ [page 73] “The Egyptians, among whom of ancient nations the O belisk and the Pyramid were the most frequently employed as significant objects, he ld that there were two opposite powers in the world perpetually acting and reacting against each other... The Obelisk always means the male instrument, while the Pyramid signifies the female corresponding tumefactive, or rising power - power not submissive , but answerably suggestive; synchronised in the anatomical clitoris, - root, in the Greek, probably, from clyte, ‘Sun- flower’ as turning to the sun, that eccentric, minu te object, meaning everything in the Rosicrucian mystic anatomy.” Clark states in ‘Symbol and myth in ancient Egypt’ that: “For the Heliopolitan morning was marked by the shi ning sunlight on an erect pillar or pyramidion on a support shaft which could reflect t he rays of the rising sun. In the beginning, a light-bird [i.e the Phoenix, the holy spirit] had alighted on the sacred stone, an obelisk, known as the Benben, to initiate the gr eat age of the visible god... When Atum, the aboriginal deity and ultimate but hi dden godhead, at first alone in the Universe, came into being, symbolised by the primeval serpent in the dark waters of the abyss, his act was symbolised as Autoerotic.\" “In one sense”, says Rundle Clark, “he is the Atum figure of Heliopolis, performing creation by masturbation...” The Qur’an identifies the source of this blasphemous thinking in Surah 72, ‘The Jinn’ : “In The Name of Allah, the Beneficient, The Mercifu l. 1. Say (to the people Muhammad): It is revealed to me that a company of the Jinn listened (to the Qur’an), and said: Behold! This is a marvel lous Recital! 2. Which guides unto righteousness, so we believe i n it, and shall not associate (in worship) any (false gods) with our Lord. 3. And exalted is the Majesty of our Lord: He has t aken neither a wife nor a son. 4. And there were foolish ones amongst us, who used to speak an atrocious lie concerning Allah. 5. And be assured, that we had also supposed (wrong ly) that humankind and Jinn would not (dare) speak a lie concerning Allah. 6. And indeed, (O Muhammad) there were persons amon gst humankind who used to invoke the protection of individuals amongst the people of the Jinns, but they only increased them in rebellious folly.\""},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Occult Masonic activities, such as invoking and ban ishing the ‘gods’, i.e. Jinn or Genies, through the ‘Greater Ritual of the Hexagram’, or ‘Star of D avid’, as it is incorrectly called, is still practiced today. In Apendix VII, pages 452-457, of Aleister Crowley’s ‘MAGICK’ he demonstrates its continuing practice in 20th centur y Britain. As far as the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram is con cerned, and similar Occult practices, the Qur’an reminds us of the ultimate outcome of these activities: “When We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam’, all prostrated themselves except Satan, who was a Genie, disobedie nt to his Lord. Would you then serve him and his offspring as your [Masonic] maste rs, rather than Myself, despite their enmity towards you? I did not call them to witness at the creation of t he heavens and the earth, nor at their own creation; nor would I take those who mislead others as helpers. One day, He will say: ‘Call on those whom you claim ed to be My partners’. They will invoke them, but will receive no answer; for We shall plac e a deadly gulf between them... In this Qur’an, We have set out for men all manner of parables, but man is in most things contentious.\" [Surah 18, Al-Kahf (The Cave), verses 50-54] This then is the true origin of Jehovah-Jah-Bul-On, and helps to explain the choice of, or preference for Obelisks, as national monuments. The Washington Monument, at 555ft tall, weighing close to 90,000 tons, can and should be ca lled “ The Great Satan”. 555 corresponds to JAH numerologically in Hebrew. [5+5+5=15; 10=Y, 5=H : JaH or YaH] Jehovah Jah-Bul-On is quite definitely the devil in disguise, and this na me when invoked in Masonic Royal Arch rituals and elsewhere, calls forth the ‘Compelling force of Gehenum or Hell’, which compells its adherents to do evil. The first clue came from Rev T. K. Cheyne, Fellow o f Balliol College, who said: \"The form Jehovah is unhesitatingly to be rejected due to a misunderstanding of comparatively modern origin.\" Seeking as we must, the protection of Allah from th e accursed devil when pronouncing this triple combination of sounds, I will explain how the unmas king came about. In 1975 I was approached by a representative of The British Crane Hire Corporation to go to Saudi Arabia as a Machine Tool Consultant. As I had nothing better to do I agreed, and after the lengthy delays finally departed for Jeddah via Beir ut. Ironically we arrived on the first day of Ramadan, which if my memory serves me well was on t he 6th of September that year. Being like most Westerners totally ignorant of Islam or its cu stoms - believing as we do, that we were the good guys and they were the bad ones - my colleagues and I were totally unaware of what to do or what to expect. We arrived at Jeddah, and were overwhelmed by the h eat and 98% humidity that greeted us. I was quite ready to get on the next plane home, but curiosity and the fact that there were no planes back I had to grin and bear it. The fun started whe n a zealous Saudi telex operator at ‘The Red Sea Palace’ refused to send my first message home a nnouncing our safe arrival, because he insisted they were not allowed to send coded signal s. The message read “Arrived safe and well,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"but it aint arf ot mum...” All the Brits desolved i nto laughter and after a lot of explaining the message was finally sent. What we had not expected was the time table of appo intments which fasting in hot climates made necessary. Our first serious meeting began late tha t evening finishing at approximately 2 am. On arriving back at the hotel we found to our annoyanc e that we could not get anything to eat or drink because they were serving ‘Sohur’. None of us , of course, had the slightest notion who or what Sohur was, or meant, and so we sat in the hote l restraurant arguing with the waiter. At which point a very deep American voice intervened i nquiring if we were Limeys, and if so, we could join him at his table. When we turned, we fou nd a large black man, with a long white beard, dressed in mid-eastern clothes, with his wif e who was also American. He introduced himself as Sheikh Kamil Wadud from Newark New Jerse y, and his wife as Kareema. It was decided that the only way round the problem was to go into the lounge and he would order extra food for himself, and we could join him, whic h is in fact what happened. One of the other English people with us did not like the idea of sit ting too long in the company of black people, so eventually they excused themselves and left me in t he company of the Sheikh and his wife. It was not too long before we were discussing all sorts of subjects, including American Indians, politics, and inevitably, religion. He said to me, “What do y ou know about Islam?” I said, nothing! He then said, “what do you think the Qur’an says about Jesus and Mary?”, to which I gave the same answer; or about the virgin birth, and so on, and s o forth, until it became clear to me, that what we in the West had been conditioned to believe about I slam, was no more than a farrago of twisted facts and malevolent absurdities . The following day we met again and resumed where we had left off, continuing our discussions all through the nig ht, interspersed by the various calls to prayer, which he like all the others attended to promptly. The point that I recall making at the time to one of my companions, was: “If these are the infidels, what on earth are we ?” On or around the fourth day of our stay at the Red Sea Palace we became acquainted with an Ulsterman called Mike Mullin who was staying in the hotel temporarily, while his permanent accomodation was made ready, together with his preg nant wife Penny and their young son. Mike at that time was working for a Saudi Company called G.A.C. (General Agencies Corporation), and in the course of the conversation we learned th at his father was the head of the Northern Ireland Prison Service. And that G.A.C. were having trouble with a particular road contract which he was responsible for, and they were at their wit’ s end trying to find a solution to a technical problem which was causing the Tarmac to blister. Al l the Western technical experts had drawn a blank and he was quite worried about it. At this po int the Sheikh said, if you write down in simple every day language the problem as you see it, my wi fe, Insha’Allah, may be able to find the solution to your problem. Mike wrote down the points and gave them to the She ikh, who in turn gave them to his wife. She then started to write, and prepared a several page response, which he alone was allowed to read but not allowed to keep. The next day Mike left for the project and I did not see him until my return trip the following month, when I was invited to his house for dinner. During the evening he made mention of the problem, and said, “By the way, your friend’s wife was right.” I said, really, what was it then? He informed me that Kareema had c orrectly identified the problem as being in the water, which they were purchasing from the desa lination plant in tanker loads; however on further investigation it turned out that some of th e drivers were pocketing the money and delivering raw sea water to their aggregate washing plant, which was causing the chemical reaction. Mike was delighted and astonished at the same time, how she could have known what the experts on the spot had failed to recognise. He asked me to convey his sincere thanks to both"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the Sheikh and his wife, which I did in the Novembe r of that same year when visiting them in the States. Nine years later, in January 1984, I, too, was face d with a problem, which took me back to the United States, to Des Moines Iowa, and to Washingto n D.C. The Sheikh by this time had passed away. So I telephoned his wife and informed her of the probl em for which I needed a completely independent, unbiased answer . I told her that I needed to understand the meaning of a certain combination of words and what they represented . I told her nothing more than that. On March the 19th 1984 she sent me the following answer: “In the Name of Allah, The Compassionate The Mercif ul. I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil. Jabulon the power of the compeller and the power of the Lord Jehovah. If we take the spelling in English with its sound, it would mean J a is the existing object. Releasing of air from one’s self as if to bestow upon. While one doe s not hold back a thing or restrain self. There is no stimulation to the brain or the s pinal cord, this is a sound of the seeker of the path. The giving up of self to receive new insp iration or force: Soul force. To empty out. This same sound applies to jeem with a fatha a bove. Yet if we spell this word in Arabic - jeem is a phy sical letter moving from right to left... Thus Ja as established above is, as is stated: the sound. Bu: is expelling again but without the total expell ing for this sound, is a cut-off sound and is only partially open as a sound. Mild yet within the realm of understanding as a subtle awareness. Lon: The sound of the mentally aware or spiritually aware as it would be in the case of the mystic. Quickly its appearance, thought, and de liberate connotation is to utilize or act upon. This is the sound of the oyster that contains the pearl. If the seeker is not swift enough, the shell closes and the pearl is lost: Thi s is the sound of the opening of the soul and the closing of the flesh. Jabulon is in its entirety a word, which begins spiritual giving and contains the fles h of the seeker or those who arrive at repeating or call ing upon this word . Yet Jabulon compells its subjects, and those who use it compel others. Remember that Ja or Jah the sound, means Jehova or Yahweh (and) are the same word as well as the same sound. Jabulon and these words are sound words that call e ntities into being . For every sound and combination of sounds there is an entity . For although these sounds are the releasing of or cause the releasing of one’s soul force, we find great problems when a combination of sounds are not noted with some form of stimulation to the brain or spinal cord. This is in the case of calling something into being . This word is an unfamiliar combination of sounds that are positi ve in nature . This word Jabulon and the sound is used to call forth the demon of the co mpelling force of hell and hellish beings or entities . My mind’s eye sees the ghoul like creature ... I do not like this word or any form of this word ... After I returned from making Istakarah I received t he rest and was even more uncomfortable in feelings . Then my mind’s eye was seeing the ugly creature . I disliked this . It’s bad enough to feel bad about a word, but to ap proach seeing what it brings into"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"being, it’s just too much . Do not use this word, limit your saying of this wor d, it is not good! “ Suddenly a compelling force had arisen, and he domi nated us with his personality, with his gestures, his manner and speech, his ardor and vision .” [ Rabbi Mondecai Braude, recalling Theodor Herzl’s performance at the 1st Z ionist Conference at Basle in 1897; The Diaries of Theodor Herzl , page XXV] Allah says: “ Shall I inform you, on whom it is that the evil one s descend? They descend on every lying, wicked person in whose ears they pour hearsa y vanities, and most of them are liars . And the poets, - it is those straying in evil who f ollow them . Do you not see that wander distracted in every valley, and that they say what they practise not? Except those who believe, work righteousness, engage much in the rem embrance of God, and defend themselves only after they are unjustly attacked. A nd soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!” [ Surah 26, al-Shu’arah (the Poets), verse 201-227] APPENDIX The Rebirth of Illuminism in Europe On May the 1st 1776, Adam Weishaupt, re-established the “Insinuating” Brotherhood, to which all the following organisations & individuals becam e affiliated in some form or another, proving that Kufr or disbelief is all one: 1776: Bavarian Illuminati formed; Kolmer - Cagliost ro; Grand Lodge Nationale; Philosophy; Mabley; Diderot; Grand Orient; Rousseau; Voltaire.
