Congratulations to you and your new bride, the former Amy Ballard. Doctors Mike Esposito and Glenys Thomson of the University of California at Berkeley's Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics--for feeding me lavish meals time and again while being my sounding boards late into the night as we explored wide-ranging perspectives.

It has been seen as a necessity for planetar y survival and heralded by a multitude from among the world's most esteemed and renowned leaders in every field. It h as been a long time in the making, its pieces fitting into pl ace from divergent realms. The arguments calling for its ex istence are formidable. There is the ecological argument of Greenpeace , The Club of Rome, and other groups stating that mankind has c ome of age--that now we must be planetary stewards of the earth's ecology before the world's ecosystem is irreversibl y damaged from industrial pollution by selfish nations who ar e accountable to none but whose irresponsibility directly affects the lives of other nations. The neighboring nations al ong the coast of the Mediterranean Sea have watched as unch ecked sewage has turned a once sapphire-clear sea with en dless underwater vistas into a murky grayish soup. All t his in 20 years! There is no denying the even greater global dange rs as we see the ozone layer being eaten away daily, with co nditions changing before our very eyes. So too with the gre enhouse effect, from other atmospheric pollutants, that is changing weather patterns around the world. Meanwhile indus trial pollutants flow out by the millions of tons into oc eans, seas, lakes, and streams, causing in mere decades what it may take thousands of years to reverse. This ecological arg ument for globalism is so compelling as to be almost beyond q uestioning. There is the \"global village\" argument of Mars hall McLuhan--that modern technology has altered the lan dscape of the earth, and that what were once great natural ba rriers of distance, thought, and language have been collapsed by the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"myriad jets and airwaves filling the sky. All the world can watch rock stars perform for a global audience in t he \"Live Aid Concert\" singing \"We Are the World\" as billions of satellite-linked television sets show the same well -known stars to what were once remote cultures. Scandinav ian rock groups sing in English, while Parisians are suddenl y becoming addicted to \"Dallas\" and fascinated with JR. Scientists use the analogy of computer interfa cing and neurology to show that as parts of the earth hook u p, it becomes almost an organism with an intact nervous system. Cambridge scientists like Peter Russell then come up with the term Gala to give this a metaphysical aspect--that in a way the earth is a goddess coming alive as human consciousn ess becomes unified. Recent media guru Joseph Campbell talks about th e need for a shared mythology for the earth--that this ear th which has now come of age needs a unifying nondivisive pl anetary religious experience and a more universal creed fro m this awakening. Campbell's erudite and mature syncretism s are seen as true peacemaking in a world whose disharmon y comes from immature religious creeds at odds becaus e they misunderstand each other's language. They are chil dren throwing stones, this pundit observes. They must g rasp the true underlying unity that already lies beneath the m all, flowing like a universal archetypal stream of colle ctive human experience. Thousands of television stations repla y this Bill Moyers series again and again. One soon gets the i dea that the media barons are pushing it from backstage. A flood of New Age thinkers are there to pick up the ball from Joseph Campbell. Bantam starts its New Age book line. Bestsellers dealing with New Age themes fill The New York Times bestseller list. Compelling arguments for a c ommon global creed based on mystical experience mount up. New Age thought goes on to penetrate almost every aspec t of life, always pointing to global unity. The landmark best seller of this trend--Marilyn Ferguson's The Aquarian Conspira cy-- quite frankly admits that this movement is a conspi racy coming"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"from many divergent groups who see a global creed a s the final hope for man if he is to survive. On board a re Buckminster Fuller, the scientist and architect, Robert Muller, former assistant secretary general of the United Nations, plus many other impressive people. The argument is compellin g. There is the economic call for globalism. Vir tually every major name in banking from Rockefeller to Rothschild to Robert McNamara (president of The World Bank) has spo ken of the reality of an interlocking global economy--t hat what happens on Wall Street one minute is felt in London or Tokyo the next, that the complex jigsaw puzzle of world e conomy is moving into an oscillating ball that will eventuall y unify nations and currencies in the global marketplace, a nd that the economic forces of the earth are moving relentlessl y toward a unified world system. On top of that, certain social and political v oices talk about the unfair distribution of wealth and resources--th at a global system of sharing and redistribution could remedy t he social problems of cross-national envy, and that if this w ere addressed, a major component of international strif e and war would be removed forever. A pooling of resources for medical care, for f eeding, and for clothing the underprivileged and the Third World is another argument. Good health is seen as a right that ever y citizen of the earth must be guaranteed. Toward this end ther e is the World Health Organization. Brock Chisolm, director o f the World Health Organization, has been an outspoken vo ice for globalism. He and many other world leaders have ag reed on the basic agenda. Brock Chisolm spelled it out: To achieve world government, it is necess ary to remove from the minds of men their individuali sm, loyalty to family tradition, national patrioti sm and religious dogmas....

The reinterpretation and eventual eradica tion of the concept of right and wrong which has been the basis of child training, the substitution of intelligent and rational thinking for faith in the certainties of the old people, these are the b elated objectives ... for charting the changes of hum an behavior.*1 One of the most compelling arguments for globa lism is the danger of global annihilation. A multitude of voic es warn that this danger alone warrants the final sacrifice requ ired to bring about global peace--that if nations surren der their sovereignties and armaments in a manner consistent with United Nations planning, this will end the threat o f global war and inaugurate an era of unprecedented peace an d safety. But this will require the supreme sacrifice of natio nalism. Only then will the world be one. John Lennon, the rock legend and visionary, ca me up with the consummate creedal statement and description of what a New World Order would be like in his most famous so ng of all, \"Imagine.\" Lennon entreats a divided world to imagine with him no heaven, no countries, all people living in peace as one brotherhood of man, with the final and only option if it is to survive, a world united as one. \"Imagine\" ha s been compelling beyond belief as its melodic lyrics cont inue to fill the airwaves of the world again and again until one day it really happens. Now let us look behind the scenes over the cen turies at the incredible building blocks of this enormous structu re coming together from all sides. The various rainbow filam ents pulling together the disparate pieces are a thing of wonder as we peer behind the main stage of the world. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"1 Contact The course of modern history has been changed by contacts with the other side, contacts with nonhuma n or superhuman intelligences. Since the 1960's, these events have greatly increased in frequency. It has been like t he faint crackles of a Geiger counter going wild as it appro aches the heart of a radiation zone. Spiritually, we have be en opening one door after another, and what were once faint cr ackles have become thunder. There seems to be a reason fo r all this, but it takes layers of examination to reveal that t he outward manifestations are only one level of operation. There has been vast and elaborate background p reparation for this present reality. It did not happen overni ght; it has been building up. One could even say that it has b een building up for centuries, as we shall later discover. With these contacts have come messages. What is interesting is that these messages have woven together to form an interesting pattern--indeed, a belief system. T he synchronicity of these messages and their divergent points of contact keep suggesting that these communications a re most deliberate, and that something is being orchestrate d from beyond our known world. But for what reason? And wh y is it happening now at an accelerating pace? The answer: To bring on the New Age. CONTACT: A Famous Medical Pioneer James Pearre of The Chicago Tribune had some in side information on a celebrated medical authority and p ioneer in the field of death and dying. It could have been a sce ne out of Steven Spielberg's film Poltergeist. The incident occurred in the office of Dr. Eli zabeth Kubler-Ross"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"at the University of Chicago, where she was an assoc iate professor of psychiatry. Pearre reported: Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, whose work has revolutionized attitudes about death and dying , says the spirit of a deceased former patient helped dis suade her nine years ago from abandoning her work... she since has become convinced that it was a \"spontaneous materialization of somebody who h ad died almost a year before.\" Kubler-Ross discussed th e mysterious incident reluctantly. She said her experience \"will sound so crazy that I wouldn' t be surprised if people think, 'Oh, she's now beco ming an occultist, a spiritualist.' Here are the details. A woman appeared at her office and introduced herself as a patient who had died ten mo nths before, Kubler-Ross says. The visitor looked identi cal to the former patient, but Kubler-Ross refused to believe i t could be the same person. \"She said she knew I was consider ing giving up my work with dying patients and that she came to tell me not to give it up,\" Kubler-Ross recalls. \"She s aid the time was not right. I reached out to touch her. I was reality testing. I was a scientist, a psychiatrist, and I didn't bel ieve in such things. \"I told her a white lie and said I wanted her to write a little note I could give to her minister. \"She smiled in this all-knowing way, like she knew very well what my intentions were.\" But the woman wrote the note and signed it, and handwriting analysis indica ted that it matched the handwriting of the deceased patient. Kubler-Ross says the incident \"came at a crossr oads where I would have made the wrong decision if I hadn't li stened to her,\" and that her subsequent work has convinced he r that \"there is fife after death.\" Pearre then proceeds t o quote Kubler-Ross's involvement with mediumism as a source of evidence of afterlife. She has even worked out a s ystem so"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that her deceased patients can get in touch with he r. That short visit has resounded around the world. Since that time, Kubler-Ross has gotten to know her spirit guide, \"Salem,\" well enough for him to materialize in her room. For those who understand spiritism, that sig nifies a very advanced involvement. Yoga Journal, that same year, 1976, that Pearr e reported the incident, had an article entitled \"Elisabeth Kubler -Ross: Messenger of Love\" describing Kubler-Ross's appearan ce before a large gathering. The famous doctor admitted: Last night I was visited by Salem, my spi rit guide, and two of his companions, Willie and Anka. T hey were with us until three o'clock in the mornin g. We talked, laughed and sang together. They spoke and touched me with the most incredible love and tenderness imaginable. This was the highlight of my life. Kubler-Ross wrote the bestselling and authorita tive book on death entitled Death and Dying. Her peers in th e medical establishment use it as the primary textbook on the subject. Nurses, doctors, psychologists, and psychiatrists u se that and her other books constantly. She has been at th e vanguard of the hospice movement. Kubler-Ross is an ally of another medical doctor, Dr. Raymond Moody, who wrote the mos t famous book of all on near-death experiences and co ntacts with \"beings-of-light\": Life After Life. Moody and Kubler-Ross have repeatedly addressed conferences and symposia together. What has Kubler-Ross learned about the other s ide through her contacts with the dead and with spirit guides? She wrote Death: The Final Stage of Growth (Prentice Hall, 19 75). It could be a preamble to what has since been called the New Age movement. Its message to the world in the midseven ties was: There is no need to be afraid of death .. . death is the key to the door of life.... The answer is within"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" you.

There i s no total death. Only the body dies. The Self or spirit, or whatever you wish to label it, is eternal.... CONTACT: The Super-Channelers Jane Roberts was perhaps the most famous and p rolific of all contemporary channelers. She became the channe l for an entity named Seth. It started on an early Septembe r day in 1963 in her apartment in Elmira, New York, when thi s aspiring novelist suddenly began to have some very strange experiences. Her encounters changed her life as we ll as the lives of countless thousands of people who have sin ce read her numerous bestsellers that fill the New Age/Occu lt sections of countless bookstores. In her book The Seth Material Roberts tells her story. She portrays herself as a liberated graduate of Skidmor e University who was an honest seeker of truth. One day she and her husband decided to write a book on ESP. To prime t he pump, they used a Ouija board the night of December 8. Af ter a few sessions they were able to receive messages from so meone who initially identified himself as \"Frank Withers. \" Soon, however, it claimed to be more than this, and no lo nger wanted to be known as Frank Withers. \"To God, all names are his name.\" Then it said, \"You may call me whatever you choose. I call myself Seth; it fits the me of me.\" Jane soon reached a threshold where she went f rom being able to race the pointer all over the board to bein g able to anticipate the whole words in her mind before the p ointer "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"spelled them out. At that moment the pointer pause d, and she felt as if she were standing at the top of a hi gh diving board. It was as if she were trying to make hersel f jump as spectators below egged her on. She took the leap a nd immediately began speaking for Seth. Jane Roberts was now a full-fledged channel. Seth initially acted like a jocular, wise, paternal old friend from some past life. Yet it ma de no mistake in showing that it was fully superhuman and, among other things, had a mission to get across to our world th e wisdom that it was only now ready for. Jane decided to conduct a seance for her ESP b ook. Her tone was that of a high school girl following a cooking recipe. She got her money's worth; Seth stunned Jane, her husba nd, and friends: He transmogrified her body. It was not ex actly a thing of beauty, but it was, after all, a supernatu ral manifestation. Those at the seance table were told by the voice to concentrate on Jane's arm. One witness, Robert Butts , said that the hand began to change in appearance and res embled a paw. It gave him an eerie feeling. He said the ha nd became stubby and thick for a moment. Then it resumed its pawlike appearance. Then Seth told Butts to reach out and touch the hand. He touched it cautiously. It felt very cold , wet, and clammy, and seemed unusually bumpy. Then Seth made the whole forepaw glow before the stunned table. But as if this gesture were not enough, Seth h ad another sign for them. They faced a mirror, and Seth told them to look at their reflections in the mirror. As they watche d, Jane's image was suddenly replaced with another image. Th e head dropped lower and the shape of the skull and the ha irstyle changed. The head in the mirror leaned down even t hough Jane was sitting erect, looking straight ahead. Na turally, it would take the three people a while to acclimate th emselves to such bizarre antics, but they would soon triumph and transcend their visceral horror. The Seth sessions continued. The next breakth rough in the taking over of Jane's body was the appearance of a deep masculine voice, which issued from her body. Seth told Jane's"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"husband that he had been an extremely vain woman in a former life. Seth also started calling Jane \"Ruburt ,\" a male name. Then Seth commented philosophically that the name \"Jane\" would sound rather unmelodious as a man's vo ice. Jane, who was by now called Ruburt, observed th at they did not realize she would receive what was known as the Seth material through \"the psychic structure.\" She ackno wledged a sense of great power in Seth's voice. It made he r feel very small, as if surrounded by a great energy. In time she would learn to remain in a deep trance while being able t o talk, walk, and gesture. She would even learn to sip wine at t imes when Seth spoke through her. But there was an incident that almost ended th e sessions. Jane, who by now had had a series of out-of-the-bod y experiences, said she was in her bedroom when she suddenly became aware of a dark, looming figure menacing her . She had not previously believed in demons, but changed her mind when the attacker dragged her around and even bit her hand. Finally the thing tried to kill her and she screamed. Seth explained it all away. It was merely a p rojection of her own mind, the energy of hidden fears. Seth assured Jane and her husband, who transcribed the sessions, that the evil that Ruburt imagined did not exist. Later, a fairly well-known psychologist interv iewed Seth to see if it was a double personality. It was his opi nion that Seth had a \"massive intellect\" and did not seem to be a secondary personality, as in the case of multiple personality . This was further borne out by a number of telepathic and cla irvoyant tests. Seth, in a ten-year period, produced over 5 000 typewritten records and analogues of higher esoteric truth. So me of this material was most subtle indeed, though much o f it was a redundant weaving of semantic spells, as Seth formu lated the same ideas again and again. Invariably it was in a bstract and often abstruse, erudite, and elusive language, with as much scientific and technical jargon as possible. In th is sense Seth's material greatly resembled the earlier teach ings coming through Edgar Cayce, who was the most prodigious"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"channeler of the modern era. Seth's teachings are almost identical with those of one of the most famous \"ent ities\" of the 1980's, \"Lazaris,\" who channels through Jach Pu rsel. What are some of Seth's revelations to the wor ld? God is an \"energy gestalt\" who has passed thro ugh human stages, and in a Hegelian sense is still evolving. This energy forms all universes. Seth names God \"All That Is.\" God is not personal but is the sum of all consciousness. Huma ns are cocreators who contain this God within them; they e volve through reincarnation. Apparently Seth evolves too . Something came along named \"Seth II,\" an ancie nt friend of Seth I who gave Seth I a punt out of Jane, as th ough he were a soccer ball. Ruburt, or Jane, tells what happened one night in Aped 1968 during the fifth year of the Seth sessions. By then Jane had been forbidden by Seth to read \"religious books .\" With massive power the voice started to break through, and Jane was hurled off into a void. The voice sounded clear though distant. Jane felt as if a cone had come do wn over her head. The voice claimed to come from an alien dime nsion-- so alien that the contact was almost a miracle. Two months later, the pyramid effect started a gain. Now the voice was plural, speaking of itself using the royal \"We.\" They described themselves as an entity which existe d before our own time frame, and which was instrumental in b uilding the physical cosmos--this entity helped form pure e nergy into physical matter. Jane said that under this new Seth's influence , her body became like a puppet and her face expressionless. After the visitation, Jane encountered difficu lty getting back into normal consciousness, and Seth had to hel p her. When Jane went back into a trance, she had a t rauma. She had been not only the recipient of words, but of di rect spiritual revelations and experiences as well. She says that the entity referred to individuals returning in the fut ure to peer into physical reality like giants upon the floor. At that point"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"she saw a giant's face peer into her living room, i ts face filling up the entire window. Then her body, the room, and its contents all grew to enormous size. She screamed a nd began to tremble violently. Jane had one more bout with the higher Seth, S eth II, but she became so shaken that the regular Seth did not allow it to continue for a long time. Again she felt the cone above her head and saw the giant looking in at her. At this point she struggled to get in touch with her vocal cords. Sh e was beginning to feel violated by this being, a problem she had never felt with the lower Seth. Yet the unpleasant ness of the experience, she conjectured, could have been due to her lack of evolution of consciousness. The last statement from Seth II was a godlike declaration; it claimed to have given man the mental images from wh ich man formed the known world and his own physical sel f. By 1984 the pluralistic Seths had written a compendium of revelations for the human race. Today these teachi ngs are readily available to anyone who walks into just about any b ookstore. \"'Ruburt\" has gone on to be with Seth, and newe r channels have come on the scene to replace Jane Roberts (Rubur t). New entities have in turn replaced Seth--such as \"Ramtha \" and \"Lazaris\"--who feature among the bright new stars o f Shirley MacLaine's autobiographies such as Out on a Limb and Dancing in the Light. Yet these newer entities have arrived with exq uisite timing to a world in waiting. The advance work has been d one. Unlike Seth, who only muttered in dark rooms before a handful of observers, Ramtha and Lazaris have spoken on five television before hundreds of millions of viewers. Both Ramtha and Lazaris have appeared on the Merv Griffin Show, the Phil Donahue Show, and the Oprah Winfrey Show, among oth ers. And news teams such as ABC's 20/20 have done special s on these entities and their human channels. Compared to Seth, they have achieved superstar celebrity status. Time magazine's December 1987 cover story on t he New Age movement mentioned that the enormous gate fees of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"these entities and their channels comprised only on e indicator of the surging popular interest. That month's New Age journal featured channeling on its cover story and stated that J.Z. Knight, who channels Ramtha, \"on an average wee kend draws up to 700 participants at $400 apiece (280,00 0 dollars); she admits to earning millions of dollars from 'Ramt ha.' 112 If you wander through Marin County's Corte Madera Ma ll, up Highway 101 from the Golden Gate Bridge, there is an elaborate art store there that stands out from ever ything else. The expensive lettering says ILLUMINARIUM. In the spacious plate-glass window displays are expensive carved gems, ancient Chinese curios, lifelike porcelain statues o f Diana the goddess of Wicca, gnomes, and paintings of Atlantis . Then there is this brilliant formless being who keeps ap pearing in different paintings. He is what Ray Moody in his be stseller of the 1970's, Life After Life, called a \"being-of-lig ht.\" It is Lazaris. And his channeler, jach Pursel, happens to own the Illuminarium. In the doorway stands a large, impressive fountain with the goddess Diana cast in bronze, kneeling ove r the flowing water. At the front desk are videocassette s of Jach Pursel channeling Lazaris. The New Age journal cover story reported: \"Lazaris's\" themes should by now seem qui te familiar to us, since they closely echo what w e have already found in \"Seth,\" Course in Miracles, \"Ra mtha,\" and Ryerson material. It is basically a spirit ual, united universe, \"Lazaris\" says, and we are essentially evolving, spiritual, immortal bein gs within and at one with it. Self-empowerment includes the causal, creative, intuitive ability to access what we need from our higher selves and from the unive rse as \"'God/Goddess/All That Is.\" And to realize these two truths, we must work to overcome our negat ive programming, our debilitating self-image, and our limited world view.3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" We will later examine exactly what these entit ies consider to be negative programming. When jach Pursel, owner of the Illuminarium, t uned in on Lazaris, he had been a regional insurance superviso r in Florida and had started to dabble in meditation. On one of these occasions his wife addressed him and a different vo ice came through Jach. It was \"Lazaris.\" The voice had a Ch aucerian Middle English quality that has over the past 14 ye ars \"stayed impeccably consistent throughout thousands of hours of channeled talking, as has the personality supposedl y doing the talking.\"4 CONTACT: A Bestselling Author Whereas Jane Roberts was out there eagerly fish ing for entities with a Ouija board, offering herself as a willing vessel, this was not the case with several others w ho have gained notoriety recently. And some of the things they ha ve hooked into have been a little more strange and a little l ess friendly than some of the more famous entities. This would be a little hard to take for Harvey Cox, a noted Harvard theolog y professor, whom The New Age Journal quotes as sayin g of such entities as Lazaris, \"They're so cuddly and friendl y. They seem to be yuppified versions of the demons and spi rits of another time.\"5 Some contactees seem less fortunate . In the case of one of these \"victims,\" a well- known author by the name of Whitley Strieber, he has parlayed hi s chilling encounters into the number-one spot on The New York Times bestseller list twice--first as a hardback and then , in January 1988, as a paperback, earning more than he ever did writing horror novels like Wolfen. In fact it makes you wo nder if his present bestseller, Communion, is not somehow his ul timate horror novel. He is certainly the right man for th e job as \"a chosen one,\" according to the aliens that abducted him. Who else is better suited to report on the sheer terror of such an en counter than a horror novelist?"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Strieber has changed his mind a number of time s about who these aliens are. In early 1988 Strieber was o n the Larry King Show and was formative in his speculations abo ut the origin and purpose of these beings. But he remained vehemently defensive about the authenticity of his encounters. One could say he looked almost paranoid about them, and with good reason; according to what he learned unde r hypnotic regression, these beings have been spying on him from the time he was a small child. But the big trauma happened one night rec ently. Whitley Strieber, on the night of December 26, 1985, was in his secluded log cabin in upstate New York with his family. In the early hours of the morning he had a visitation. Small, terrifying humanoids crept up to his bedside. They mentally controlled him by paralyzing him. Then they quietl y carried him out of his house naked. They seemed to levitat e him to an examination theater in the sky from some spot in th e snowy woods. Once in the small, round theater, he felt like an animal in a medical experiment, one of those monkeys whose skul lcap has been sawn off and replaced by diodes. He sat n ude and helpless. This was by no means a positive experien ce: The fear was so powerful that it seemed t o make my personality completely evaporate...... Whitley\" ceased to exist. What was left was a body in a state of raw fear so great that it swept about me like a thick, suffocating curtain, turning paralysis into a condition that seemed close to death. I do not think th at my ordinary humanity survived the transition t o this little room.6 The gray-and-brown-skinned creatures closely r esembled the two types of aliens that emerged from the sauce r in Spielberg's film Close Encounters, except that these were fierce. There were the three-foot variety and the elongated,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"delicate, and spindly five-foot variety. But unlike the creatures in the film, there were two other types a s well. The massive eyes of these creatures seemed like infinit e shafts, black abysses. They had an insectlike quality, alm ost an exoskeleton. The smallest ones moved with rapid, u gly mechanical movements as they sped around Whitley Strieber. As he was examined, one creature in particular --the spindly leather-skinned, five-foot variety--observed him: \" She had those amazing, electrifying eyes ... the huge, star ing eyes of the old gods.... They were featureless, in the sens e that I could see neither pupil nor iris.\"7 In her presence he \"had no personal freedom at all.\" When he looked into her e yes, \"It was as if every vulnerable detail of my self were k nown to this being.... I could actually feel the presence of tha t other person within me--which was as disturbing as it was curiou sly sensual. Their eyes are often described as 'limitl ess,' 'haunting,' and 'baring the soul.'\" Later on, Strieber would think of this creatur e as being like Ishtar, the ancient Mesopotamian \"Eye-Goddess\" with the huge staring eyes. He would observe that the close st he could come to an unadorned image of these beings was \"the age-old, glaring face of Ishtar. Paint her eyes entirely bl ack, remove her hair, and there is my image as it hangs before me now in my mind's eye, the ancient and terrible one, the br inger of wisdom, the ruthless questioner.\"8 And like the anc ients with their goddess Ishtar (or Ashtoreth), Whitley Strieb er cited a sexual side to the encounter. The examination room was untidy, even dirty. The creatures had a bad smell. A probe was jammed into his head. Then the hideously sexual aspect of this examinatio n unfolded: \"I was being shown an enormous and extrem ely ugly object, gray and scaly, with a sort of network of w ires on the end. It was at least a foot long, narrow, and tria ngular in structure. They inserted this thing into my rectum ... at the time I had the impression that I was being raped, a nd for the first time I felt anger.\"9"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" During this period the \"Ishtar\" creature asked him why \"it\" was not fully hard. Under deep hypnosis Strie ber was questioned in detail about this event. He was horr ified, later likening the event to a human copulating with an in cubus or succubus. The creatures couldn't have cared less about h is rights; all they told him was that he was chosen for something- -perhaps to be a messenger to the world. But were these cre atures space aliens? Not necessarily so. At times they ha ve seemed to be more like the ancient pagan gods and goddesse s, or spirits, or incubi and succubi. Strieber has been confused.

Whitley Strieber conjectures about them: As the ages roll along, it could be that what changes is not our visitors but our way of installi ng them in the culture.

B y the midsixties, Kubrick was both a change agent and a prophet who spoke through the medium of the 70-mm film. He cre ated whole new realities before audiences of millions. Long before New Age terms were popularized by the masses, Kubri ck showed the world what a \"paradigm shift\" was really like in his portrayal of Arthur C. Clarke's mystical science fiction epic 2001. It was quite an experience sitting in a huge cinerama theater, in a packed audience, while the v ast screen engulfed us with this new vision of reality. QUANTUM LEAPS Kubrick had us sitting in his Darwinian time m achine, as the vast solar orb rose slowly to illumine the dawn of human intelligence in reddish-golden light. Simian packs roamed the scarred primitive face of a prehistoric world. Som e of the ape-man faces were less monkeylike and more human. The camera angle seemed to show intelligence in the eye s. Grunts were on the verge of becoming words. Then one type of simian tribe began to move in on another. They mov ed in place for battle. Mounting shrieks became physical attacks. It was a war between the species. Suddenly one of the more intelligent ape-men picked up what was to be the fi rst weapon in history, a large thigh bone. That gave him the critical edge. He beat the opposing simian to death. Others of th e same species, with their greater intelligence, imitated what their leader had just done. Suddenly, they all held larg e bones and started smashing their enemies, the more apelike cr eatures."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" In the silence after the battle, the winning s pecies yelled in exuberant triumph. Apelike screams filled the air. One superior species suddenly replaced another. But something fa r more significant was going on than one species repl acing another. What was really happening was the indwell ing faculty of consciousness suddenly leaping to a grea ter magnitude on the earth, from one type of simian to another. In reality it was a moment of pure Hegelian consciousness evoluti on. It was a glimpse at the real subject behind the shifti ng actors. Consciousness was the true timeless protagonist of t he vast epic--\"the eternal charioteer,\" to use an expressio n from the Bhagavad Gita, and apparently it \"was up to somethin g.\" Then came Kubrick's supreme moment of genius. The humanoid ape leader then hurled his large thigh bon e into the air in triumph. The bone filled the screen as it s pun in slow motion. It kept ascending, and then suddenly its s ame basic shape became enormous, filling the whole sky. It h ad suddenly become a vast machine as it drifted in out er space. Below it shone the huge, bright, bluish-green planet earth. It was no longer a bone. Th e leap of intelligence ha d dwarfed time and turned the simian bone into an interplanet ary vessel whose inhabitants--evolved human simians--were a qu antum leap beyond the ape creatures. Soon the third quan tum leap would begin when this vessel reached Jupiter a nd its human inhabitant crossed the next catalytic thresho ld into some kind of supermind, represented by the star bab y. This epic is not about creatures but about evo lving consciousness reaching what New Agers call critical thresholds for the next transformation of consciousness. Kubrick' s vision is indeed the stuff out of which pantheism, monism, an d cosmic humanism are built. As old as the Vedas of India, consciousness is portrayed as ascending up the evolutionary ladde r in the act of becoming godlike. The leap in conceptua l understanding is called a paradigm shift by the New Age movement. Stanley Kubrick's paradigm shift represented t he new"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"myth. The biblical/monotheistic view of existence had become eclipsed by the pantheistic-mystical New Age view. It was dazzling, electric, and seemed hauntingly insig htful. A generation was wooed. Opinions and lifetimes of th ought were shifted in a few brief hours on the screen. I t was almost like magic. To many in the audience, this film was a seed which would work away in their minds on a subconsci ous level. In time it would emerge as a worldview. Th ose on the mystical fringe of the 1960's had already caught th e vision. In the sixties there were many apostles of the new consciousness. One avenue for the new consciousnes s to manifest itself was through mind-altering drugs. Personal e xperience was key. Beliefs could easily be attached to experi ence, especially with mysticism. As it happened, Doctor Albert Hoffman, a pharmacologist, discovered one of the most potent mind-altering drugs ever known: LSD-25. It was in Switzerland in the late forties when by accident a few milliont hs of a gram lodged under Dr. Hoffman's fingernail. The re sulting mystical experience was soon reported to other elit e scientists. Not long after that Aldous Huxley, famed British nov elist and intellectual, tried his fortune with mescaline and psilocybin, eliciting mystical experiences from the se natural hallucinogens. Various shamans had been doing this for thousands of years. If ancient Hindu rishis could ingest a plant c alled soma, thousands of years ago, and write the Upanishads in their altered states of consciousness, the same scenario could work again. But it would require finding the right mind- expanding drug, as well as respected members of society to sa nction the drug. Well, the drug was in place. LSD had entere d the world. CONTACT THROUGH ALTERED STATES The idea of chemically altered states would ha ve to receive further sanction from the intellectual elite to rea ch the critical threshold of public experimentation--and it did. H arvard Professor Timothy Leary began to administer hundred s of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"doses of LSD-25 to his graduate students. His assi stant was Harvard psychologist Dr. Richard Alpert. They were a team, and their psychedelic road tours across the United States were famous. Meanwhile, another Harvard professor, Dr. Alan Watts of the Oriental Religions Department, had prev iously taken LSD and written The joyous Cosmology, discussi ng his own mystical encounters while \"tripping\" on a New E ngland farm. By the time Leary and Alpert left Harvard, they were packing university auditoriums, conference centers, and civ ic centers with their exciting alternative to the stra ight society. This new secret, which defied the present system, c arried the potent sense of mission that the early church had a s it met in the catacombs beneath Rome to receive the startling message of the Christian faith. Now again there were harbin gers of a new reality. And the West was like Rome, ready to c rumble under its old system represented by the futility of Vietnam, the banality of Lyndon Johnson's \"Great Society,\" t raditional moral do's and don'ts, Pentagon marches, and protes t rallies which all seemed to culminate in the Kent State Mas sacre. Leary had become the academic celebrity-turned -guru. His cause was in high fashion among the vanguard of the counterculture. Playboy interviews popularized his views, and countless cover stories featured Leary's broken smi le. He was a bodhisattva in tennis shoes and white chinos who merged psychedelic mystical experiences and modern psychol ogical theories with timeless Eastern holy writ. In the mid-1960's I encountered Timothy Leary for the first time in Washington, D.C., in a large church sanctuar y overflowing with my contemporaries. In the dim lig ht of center stage, leaning against the podium, was Tim Leary, h is face creased with a strange wisdom. His soothing voice soon drew us in. It was evident that he had found a key to t errible power and knew that when it was used the world would not remain the same. Whether through flower power or mass ecs tasy the world would be transformed, and nothing that the \"s traight society\" did could stop the momentum of the truth t hey had"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"found. Leary began talking under the spotlight, op ening a major doorway into the New Age: \"LSD does not produce the transcendent experie nce; it merely acts as a chemical key. It opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structu res, and releases an enormous amount of awareness--energy. Understanding, describing and using these released energies intelligently has puzzled scholars for thousands of years. Yet here is a key to the mystery which has been passed down for over 2500 years; the consciousness expansion experi ence, premortem death and rebirth. The Vedic sages, the Eleusinian initiates and the Tantrics all knew the secret; in their esoteric writings they whisper the message. They f igure out the pathways and landmarks. It is possible to get beyond ego consciousness, to tune in to the neurological proce sses which flash by at the speed of light, and become aware of the treasury of ancient racial knowledge welded into th e nucleus of every cell in the body. Psychedelics can open t his door.\" We were dazzled. Leary then asked the audienc e, \"Are you aware of the complexity of the human nervous system ? For us, the voyagers, the following neurological number s take on the significance of mantras (sacred Hindu words). The human brain receives one thousand million signals a secon d. We possess between ten and thirteen billion brain cell s. Each neuron is connected to, on average, twenty-five tho usand neighboring neurons.\" Leary paused, an amazed look on his face. His tone became confidential, almost a whisper, as he went on to sh are profound secrets. \"During an ecstatic experience these billions of signals, which are normally registered and decoded, are no l onger hindered by the conscious-logical-censor. Without the censor, we become unable to describe our experience because the mechanisms of language cannot contain the experienc e. It all happens too fast.\" Leary's tone of amazement was th at of the explorer finding the secret Egyptian vault. It cam e from his"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"personal experience. What was our twentieth-century reference point in relation to this huge new discovery? Leary gave us a means o f comparison as he flew through psychological and neu rological models. He had walked us from Carl Jung's archetype theory to modern neurology. Now he was about to sh ow us how language--a descriptive and conceptual medium-- had limits similar to attempting to drive a Chevy, which performs reliably on land, through the Pacific Ocean depths where only a submarine can go. It was hard to argue with the full clout of Leary's credentials as an Ivy League--indeed, a Har vard-- psychologist. Our academically competitive generat ion held intellectual accomplishments in awe. (\"Getting into the Ivy League is hard enough. Try being a professor i n that league!\") Leary resorted to anthropological and linguist ic comparisons: \"Picture in some barren, primitive region of Austra lia an aboriginal tribe that has been completely screen ed off from present-day civilization. They have not seen the world beyond a 20-mile radius of their cave dwelling; the y have never seen a two-dimensional picture, and when they are shown a photograph, they are unable to decipher it, even if it is of something from their surroundings. They have never seen the wheel or woven cloth. Their only implemen ts are stones; their only garments are animal skins and le aves. They have not even seen a truly straight line, a metalli c or glassy surface. Their language possesses fewer than a tho usand words, and none of them has abstract meaning. Thei r food is not cooked; it is wild and so depends upon the mood s of the forests and the generosity of the seasons. \"Now picture the savage standing alone in the woods, then suddenly hurled into the very center of Manhattan, in front of the United Nations building or Park Avenue. Unless the savage has a stable grounding in some form of religious tr uth, he will experience utter terror. \"If he is later teleported back to his own cul ture, hopefully sane, he still has to cross the gulf of semantics t o tell his"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"tribesmen of his amazing experience. To do this, h e must invent a completely new language. Yet even this is not enough. For even if he has catalogued memories of sensation s into new words, he has still failed to understand the ne w sensations in their own context. The chances are his memory w ill be scrambled since his nervous censor is used to on ly a fraction of all that input, unlike those used to a modern city. He will be in a chaos of car horns, sirens, constru ction jackhammers, jukeboxes, underground subways, jets a nd helicopters, rumbling cars and whining engines. An d while hearing this cacophony, he will be seeing Millions of tons of glinting glass and steel, shining metallic objects traveling at frightening speeds, colored lights and glowing n eon as evening sets in. He will smell anything from Aqua Velva and Chanel No. 5 to ozone, propylene, phenylhydrazine, c hewing gum, super detergents, germicides, gasoline, synthe tic flavors and all manner of esters and ketones, metha ne and assorted sewage gases, exhaust and restaurant smell s. \"After an LSD experience we emerge just as ove rwhelmed, intrigued, frightened and ecstatic as the savage tr ansported to New York City. But our task of finding a language and creating a road map may well be even more difficult than his.\"' A stroboscope flickering in the auditorium seemed t o punctuate Leary's statement. The blinding flashes turned everyone's movements into an insect dance. Leary closed the session with the parting admo nition: \"Remember that throughout human history, millions ha ve made this voyage. A few whom we call mystics, sain ts, and Buddhas have made this experience endure and communi cated it to their fellowmen. The experience is safe. At worst, all you will do is return as the same person you we re before.\" Only months after Leary's talk, I had the myst ical experience of my life after taking ten times the normal dosage of LSD-25 (pure Swiss Sandoz LSD). I experienced a tr ansformation of consciousness that would take me years to unders tand"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"in its true context. For the moment, everything se emed to be going my way. Leary and Alpert (who himself was yet to go to India and become Ram Dass, a New Age celebrity guru in his own right) soon transliterated The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Mahayana Buddhist text on the rite of death. They turned thi s ancient rite into a manual for taking LSD and entitled it T he Psychedelic Experience. It further popularized the Eastern mys tical teachings of reincarnation, karma, and the self being a spark of the divine. STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER Meanwhile, LSD had come a long way from that m odest molecular sample under Dr. Hoffman's fingernail. I n Kool-Aid \"acid tests\" in Golden Gate Park during the \"Summer of Love\" in 1968, gallons of spiked Kool-Aid were hand ed out to thousands during \"Be-Ins\" and rock concerts. Youth chemists such as Stan Owsley in Berkeley became famous for taking an esoteric molecule like LSD and synthesizi ng it for the masses. Now there were new batches coming off the production fine like colored candy: mellow yellow, blue cheer, and blotter acid. Leary's dream of nirvana from a pill for the youth culture was becoming a reality overnight. In deed, much of the labor force for building the Rainbow Brid ge came from the counterculture, which exuberantly explored new modes of living. Hippie communes suddenly appeared on America's historical horizon. They creatively explored new a lternatives for abandoning civilization and going back to nature. Men and women, boys and girls cohabited communally in the c ountryside. Colored Indian tepees, tents, geodesic domes, and ot her innovative structures suddenly filled the landscape as old farms and ranches were bought. Other groups invade d the woods. Bright scarves and headbands, bell-bottoms, and beads appeared in all patterns and shades.

The ideals of marriage, college, and striving for a successful career in order to fit into traditional society wer e replaced by semi-Gandhian values: aesthetics, pacificism, no nviolence, and antimaterialism. But the move for more freedom became obsessive--for sexual freedom, for freedom from all restraints on personal choice. \"Be bound by nothing .\" Freedom from responsibilities and commitments meant the fre edom to explore, to fly like a bird. When the hero in Neil Simon's The Graduate was advised to go into \"plastics,\" the six ties generation saw that as a cue to sneer collectively at such dull and myopic advice. Their collective response was, \"What a compromise of the human spirit... what a sellout .. . what a way to spend your life.\" Underground journals such as The Berkeley Barb, The East Village Other, The Village Voice, and The Rolling St one proliferated the radical new viewpoint from coast to coast. A t errific sense of solidarity and mission resulted. It was a lmost a conspiracy, the generation gap became so vast. The counterculture had what seemed almost unlimited energy, and their mystical ideals would remain as the sixties generat ion replaced their peers by the 1980's and became corpo rate leaders and college professors. Meanwhile, it is doubtful that Dr. Hoffman in the late 1940's, apart from his wildest acid visions, could have pictured Woodstock Nation, where a half a million y ouths invaded upstate New York for a Super Rock concert, e nding the decade of the sixties stoned on his discovery of LS D and similar psychedelics. Their rock bands reflected d rug synesthesia with names like: Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and The Holding Company, The Strawberry Alarm Clock, The Grateful Dead, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer (a name for acid), Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Doors, Pink Floy d, Led Zeppelin, The Cream, Riders of The Purple Sage, The M oody Blues, Tangerine Dream, Buffalo Springfield, Credence Clearwater Revival, and so on--all names that are metaphors of psychedelicized perceptions of reality or a return to ethnic"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"innocence. Acid had even touched music. Every chord seem ed to be played for the first time ever, with no repeats. F resh and original lyrics and images filtered through million s of minds.

Psychedelic rock became the collective theme s ong for an explosively radical era that entered the world stag e like a musical extravaganza. It made the era of the fifti es, with its straight society, its decency, and its gray churche s look flat, like a Lucky Strike wrapper lying on the ground. W ho wanted to turn back the clock? No one from the youth cultu re, that's for sure. America had never had an era like this. Unlimited horizons seemed to flash into view now that this in credible bridge of consciousness was being built. New mater ials had suddenly appeared on the world scene to help build the Rainbow Bridge from our present world to a New World Order.

He fails the test because he went against his intuition at the last moment. The old village magi cian tells him that he has the whole universe inside of him. But like Luke Skywalker of Star Wars, he has to \"believe\" an d trust the Force. George Lucas' Willow is a film that is itse lf supposed to be a microcosm of what is inside each individual vi ewing the film. The characters in Willow are living \"myths\" existing within all of us, according to Lucas. The mythic e pics of Lucas are to inspire the unleashing of these inner realit ies. Lucas calls these creatures and characters in all of his epics his \"best friends.\" Joseph Campbell, the guru of George Lucas, has said that myths are representations of inner realities and tr uths. Joseph Campbell spelled this out in his book Hero of a Thou sand Faces. When I read it 20 years ago, it hit me the same way it hit George Lucas. It was outrageously seductive. It w as compelling and ingenious. It stated that we carried the sum t otal experience and knowledge of the race. We were walk ing microcosms; we had the universe inside, and carried the inner secrets to our own unfoldment. The name of t he game was consciousness expansion through confronting inn er and outer worlds, escalating to higher levels of energy and consciousness. Fifteen years before Shirley MacLaine ever discover ed New Age thought, many of us on the pioneering edge of t he sixties were pursuing the identical path.

We wanted simultaneous access to supramundane planes and dime nsions, and command of occult realities that only a fractio n of our"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"world even knew about. In short, I and my contempo raries believed in the reality of cosmic consciousness, or superconsciousness, or enlightenment. I felt that life's greatest jewel was to attain it, and that finding this great secret was the real reason we were here. Was there outward eviden ce for superconsciousness? It seemed so. Leary had spoken about it--but so had Joseph Campbell, Carlos Castenada, and many others. Analogies already existed. It was already plain to see that the elevator shaft of consciousness went from the lower floors of the ani mal world to the incredible levels of man's greatest achievement s. If this shaft continued to the vast levels of angels, highe r beings, and beyond, then by speculative extension the mysti cs were right and human potential did not stop until it arr ived right at the seat of godhood. We were in a continuum that i mplied we could ride the elevator to the top floor. Lower ru ngs of consciousness could be used as an argument for exte nsion. Even among people there was a huge range of co nsciousness. In the same way a savvy internationalist can adeptl y work through London from Belgravia to Kensington to Soho or Mile End or Hammersmith on one day, Paris the ne xt, from the Left Bank of the Seine to Saint-Cloud, then midto wn Manhattan the next, and 50 other cities with equal adroitness --flashing through a million nuances of language an d culture, mastering customs and cuisine--as compared to an unschooled and unsophisticated villager living in a n adobe hut or a backcountry hillbilly farmer, who would be helpless at any of these supercosmopolitan points. The same analogy points to the full range of human differences in co nsciousness --from a fully empowered yogi and master to someone with the depth awareness of a formica countertop, l iving in a world of Wheaties and McDonald's hamburgers. The s pan from idiot to genius had upper and lower floors to which we were only beginning to wake up; indeed, the elevato r shaft broke through new levels all the time. There were other analogies. If insight could increase a little, it could increase massively. There were a number of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ways I pictured superconsciousness. One was by tak ing the process of insight and extending it with no upper l imits. I recalled the time that I wrote a university paper o n Plato's cave allegory, and had sudden breakthroughs of insi ght into the meaning of the concept \"abstract.\" My awareness changed in a moment of time and would never go back. Then when I studied jean Piaget, I realized that the mental dev elopment from childhood to adulthood had tangible barriers t hat were approached and transcended as growth continued. A child at the \"concrete operational level\" was incapable of t he gear shift of more mature abstract thinking, and so on. It was like the evolutionist's maxim, \"ontogeny recapitulates p hylogeny.\" In the microcosm of the womb, the human organism, they claimed, seemed to mimic prior stages in anima l evolution. Consciousness had stages as well. \"Heaven and Hell and all the gods are within u s,\" Joseph Campbell suddenly told Bill Moyers. Yet if Joseph Cam pbell became the guru of George Lucas of Star Wars fame, Carl jung was the source of inspiration and the teacher of Jo seph Campbell. jung's depth psychology was the source of almost every major insight that Campbell ever had. And during th e six-part series by Bill Moyers on Joseph Campbell, Cam pbell payed homage to Jung repeatedly. Jung talked about consciousness. The famed Sw iss thinker was an important key for many of us in the sixties. Jung had revolutionary ideas about the mysteri es of the self. To jung, man contained the universe within: The entirety of racial knowledge was welded within ever y cell. Within the mind lay the vast collective unconscious containing every type of character in every Shakespearean play , every mythological figure, and more. These were th e inner archetypes. Jung stated that the supreme voyage--a nd jung was a mystic, having written the introduction to th e Evans-Wentz Oxford translation of The Tibetan Book of the Dead-- was to boldly encounter and absorb every archetype with in, to come to terms with the forbidden, the inner shadow, and ultimately to discover the higher self. To jung, w hen this huge"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"collective unconscious, this microcosm within, was fully searched out and no longer a mystery, then one was \"individuated.\" This was a form of enlightenment. Jung's theories did not merely go beyond Freud 's psychoanalysis, but jungian depth psychology antici pated the eventual merger of the new psychologies of the mids eventies with Eastern thought. jung was 50 years ahead of Es alen and the transpersonal psychologists of the New Age move ment. Indeed, jung was the true grandfather of transperso nal psychology. In the sixties another fan of Jung, Al an Watts of Harvard, an orientalist, wrote The Supreme Ident ity. The supreme identity, of course, was the divine inner n ature that Watts had learned from studying Zen Buddhism which h e then melded with modern psychological theories. Fo r opposites to be resolved and to merge, they had to be encountered: good and evil, male and female. The male, jung said, had to come to terms with his opposite valence, the feminine within--an archetype known as the \"anima.\" Where did Jung see this archetype mani festing itself? In Renaissance paintings, novels, and a thou sand other places. But there was one novel in particular, H. Ri der Haggard's She, that Jung felt most fully portrayed the anima. \"She\" was the embodiment of the shrouded feminine n ature that had to be encountered by males, especially tho se who had all the defense mechanisms of modern culture. The anima also enabled men to appreciate the truly feminine i n women. It was a deeper tug than the purely physical sexual drive, which was only one manifestation of the interplay b etween the forces of masculine and feminine. They were un iversal forces, and Jung turned to Taoism to explain the in terplay of opposites. The masculine and feminine polarities w ere but one aspect of the cosmic dance. Jung's pathway through the mysteries of the se lf to us in the sixties was tailor-made for the taboo-ridden We sterner with all his hang-ups, who had such an ordeal in lo oking within, especially when it came time to face \"the s hadow\" and the \"inner demons.\" Evil was now relegated to a reas"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" within the individual that were projected out; it w as the other hall of good. To jung, there was no really absolut e evil. It was merely one more opposite out of which the cosmos wa s composed--light and dark, male and female, good and evil, and so on. As Taoism stated, all life is an interplay between these opposites until they are merged into one. This was an attractive universe indeed. In a way, it made that irritant o f a continually gnawing guilty conscience now obsolete and irrelevant. That carryover from Old Testament mora lity, the Pentateuch within, could now be \"outgrown.\" There w ere times when my conscience weighed me down greatly. I welcomed a way to be rid of it if it could be trans cended as taboos and fears, the dragons at our inner gates, were def eated. Thus, as the myth of the ego dissolved, our inner p otential would increase exponentially as we worked toward su perconsciousness. Superconsciousness, I believed, could more tha n encompass the range of intellectual knowledge. The supercons cious individual could look into people and read them lik e a book. He was equally able to adeptly frolic through any f ields of knowledge like Horowitz at the keyboard. Such a Mi nd could picture DNA or glycolysis at a glimpse; inhale Witt genstein or Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (appreciating why he e volved the solipsism he did, in T.U.A., in answer to Hume) ; or see all nuances of literary brilliance in James Joyce, Will iam Blake, or Tolstoy. But beyond all this, the superconscious on e was able to know all these things with an infinite depth aft er having attained full awareness of \"the Self.\" It was this latter achievement that gave full scope to his awareness. It is this mystique that Westerners see in a Rajneesh or a Krishnamurti. They represent the mystical masters of superconsciousnes s. It was easy to romanticize the potentials of h uman consciousness and its evolutionary expansion into s uperstates of being. Hegel had talked about it.

ENCOUNTERING THE GROUND OF BEING It was a balmy evening in the late spring of 1 966 when I rode my motorcycle deep into the countryside of Vir ginia away from civilization. The meadows seemed like a vast armchair. I sat atop a smooth, warm, grassy knoll, slightly higher than hundreds of acres of surrounding meadows and w oods. My knapsack and sleeping bag were propped against a lone tree that arched into the night sky like a giant ne uron or antenna reaching into the cosmos. I took ten times the normal dosage of LSD-25-- 3000 micrograms --and watched my own consciousness explode open as the celestial powers seemed to speak to the deepest core of my being. The LSD I took was the purest you could fin d in the world--Sandoz LSD made in Basel, Switzerland, right out of the labs of the inventor, Albert Hoffman. The resu lt of the experience is that I was sure that I was a mystic a nd had seen things only privy to a few. I was a master in the making, an adept. In order for me to show the lure and power of this type of experience, I shall record what happened to me. It is written up in my book Avatar of Night [published in India in 1982 by Vikas Publishing]: At a fraction past midnight, I swallowed the c apsule. I accepted the fact that I was, in effect, sitting on top of an atom bomb. And I would either come out on the leve l of Gautama Buddha or the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoo n.

Down to the deepest root, there were a thousand ast ral levels at war within me, as my uppermost self was f ighting to stay aloft through the aid of a million subordin ate parts that were straining and tugging. Even below these, there were endless rumbles and shifts, like a subterranean city, while every archetype that I had ever encountered was presently being held at bay. Soon I was above even the dazzling beings and demigods that were so special before. The celestial cities and realms were like the lower strata of a pyramid whos e fascination I had sacrificed--things great enough t o inspire the master poets and painters, I later refl ected, in order to approach the level of the truly abstract, pure thought, pure knowing, pure being.

Even the ants walk over you. How tiny you are. Your delusions end. Can yo u bear this, and yet live?\" Then the sheer jet-like force of what was happ ening to my mind became too great. I became a twig riding a tidal wave. I clutched that Virginia meadow as though cl utching the rigging of a hurricane-swept deck of a Galleon. It seemed that something other than the drug had taken over, something supernatural perhaps. As a force drove my mind at a speed greater th an thought, I could feel something far older than I su ddenly start navigating my course. I passed ten thousand crossroads per second, and took the proper turn on each one of them. I feared that if I tried to grind down th e gears at this point, I might wake up on the outer edges of t he galaxy not much higher up on the phylogenic scale t han a cucumber. And after all the billions of years it took me to work my way up to to becoming a human being, I d id not want to blow it now, and enter a form of loneli ness that was unthinkable. My speed increased even more, as I became a diamond wedge cutting the finest possible arcs, fro m one juncture to another. Then it occurred to me that o n some level I was being asked questions in which a correc t turn could only be made by means of a totally spontaneou s truthful answer. Anything else would veer me off c ourse. Like the Day of judgment, a lie would be impossible damnation, because there was not an atom of time to deliberate.

I saw a doorway into a new universe. It was a pinpoint of light. To fight the acceleration req uired to approach it was to fight the mass of the entire uni verse. I could not tell whether the distance within the pinp oint of light was as minuscule as the angstrom units bet ween atoms, or almost infinitely huge, as the distance f rom one side of the universe to the other. At the barrier of the pinpoint of light--I ent er the eternal present. All thirteen billion brain cells within m e seem to turn inside out, as though jumping to a higher gestalt a nd forming into a higher structure that was previously latent. Each cell recites one of my former names, and I as a nation h ear the thirteen billion names of my subjects and former ea rthly identities on the wheel of reincarnation. Once I enter the pi npoint of light, all ties with the world vanish. I enter the Unborn. A caterpillar cannot experience the butterfly transition and remain a caterpillar. One structure cannot be smuggled across into the other, that is impossible. You are either one or the other. That also applied to me. At most, my experience could be paralleled from one universe to another, but nothing could cross the ba rrier. I have never been able to summon what happened to me during that stretch of time after entering the pinpoint of light. Months later, I assumed that I had entered into the ocean of being... \"the void, also known as the clear light or the Ocean of Brahman.\" That I had bee n allowed to experience the highest mystical state, w hat the Hindus call Nirvikalpa Samadhi.1 By the time I went to India in 1969, I had pore d through thousands and thousands of pages of mystical revela tions.

I bega n to tune into things that I had never noticed before. I fel t part of a great pattern. Suddenly I sensed that history was unfold ing according to plan. A hidden army of advanced adepts were pioneering the coming of the New Age and I was amon g them. Overnight, my conceptual universe had altered radic ally. Perhaps similar changes could happen to the whole w orld--a global alteration of consciousness. Before I took that leap to India, I felt new ex periences beckoning me on, preparing me for new leaps in cons ciousness. I had to leap off the diving board of uncharted experience. I had to explore new thresholds beyond the mind-set of our materialistic culture which had demystified the universe. America had become a society of people w hose intellectual curiosity rarely ranged beyond the mun dane and the prosaic. It was intimidated by the unknown and seemed to easily settle for a McDonald's spiritual diet an d a K-Mart lifestyle. The grand summits of ancient wisdom tow ered above our distracted and busy culture which had los t its roots with eternity. We were ants absorbed in disposing of some small speck of waste food at the base of a grand ed ifice. The vast and splendid columns of the Parthenon dwarfed us into insignificance. We never looked up. The challenge for me was to plug back into the ancient secrets of existence that our modern world had cast away. Yet in this alien and uncharted universe, I also needed some sort of compass. Like most of us in the army of mystics , I felt that my ultimate navigational instrument was my deepest intuitive promptings. Now a new door appeared and I had to open it."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" THE ASTRAL TRAVELER On many a freezing winter's night in 1968, I m otorcycled down the rustic wooded lanes weaving from Charlottes ville, Virginia, to the spectral ranch house of Robert Monr oe, author of journeys Out of the Body, poised on its ma ny acres and beaming multicolored lights like an airport control tower. We often met several times a week. Monroe was gaining increasing fame across America among connoisseurs of the underground new-consciousness movement as a legitim ate astral projector--one who was able to leave his physical b ody. Twenty years later, Monroe's writings were to become among the most recognized of New Age advocates, and Monroe wo uld be a key conference speaker at New Age conventions. At the time, Dr. Charles Tart and an array of n otable parapsychologists had run a whole gamut of double-b lind tests on Monroe. Skeptics were invariably baffled each t ime by Monroe's unaccounted-for powers. Robert Monroe woul d whoosh out of his body at midnight and travel to an anechoic chamber beneath Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, or the University of Californi a at Davis, where Tart and others awaited. On the west coast i t was only nine in the evening. Monroe would look around the room, noting people, conversations, and furniture arrange ment. Then he would whoosh back to his body in Charlottesv ille and give them a long-distance phone call describing what he saw. He was right on target repeatedly, astounding these scientists with the fact that there are other force s operating behind the machinery of the physical universe. But what was really important to Monroe were not these trips aro und the country, but trips somewhere else. Monroe and I met regularly to make sense out o f the whole phenomenon of astral travel, catalyzing one another in the process. He was approaching the subject in terms o f the \"higher teachings\" he had received while out of the body in his encounters with \"higher beings,\" astral masters , and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"other entities. Monroe combined this with his dive rsified readings in yoga, Eastern thought, and scientific t heory. I approached his bizarre exploits and spirit encounte rs from the viewpoint of Indian monistic philosophy syncret ized with a new emerging \"mystical Christianity\" that came thr ough channeled teachings of Edgar Cayce, Levi Dowling, an d others combined with Jung, Tillich, and Teilhard de Chardin. From Monroe's lonely perspective, perhaps my m ost important credential was that apparently I, too, ha d been able to leave my physical body sporadically. It had starte d when I was a ten-year-old battling the mumps in London, at around the same time I had started toying with a Ouija boa rd. Half asleep in bed in our old Victorian house in Knights bridge, I would become paralyzed, hear the sound of jets, and apparently go ripping through the roof to hover abo ve our house. Occasionally the same thing happened during my teen s, and it was starting again in college. Monroe's out-of- the-body symptoms matched mine point for point. Monroe and I were also working on the technolo gy to elicit astral experiences in ordinary people. Monroe was getting his ideas from his \"contacts.\" This became the M-50 00 program, a complex, multichannel recorded tape whic h the subject listened to on going to sleep. Cables and s ound equipment trailed through the house from central command, an isolated geodesic chamber of pyramidal glass which rippled with colored lights, while pulse generators whirred and hummed to the syncopated beat of a synthesizer/orga n. Monroe had been the child prodigy of a medical doctor fath er and college professor mother, spending much of his life dabbling with inventions. Much of what we were doing now wi th sound equipment came from his experience as a vice president of Mutual Broadcasting in New York City. What was most momentous about this was that we were on the pioneering edge of occult technology. We were not closing the gap to enter the spiritual dimensions by blindl y putting together the machinery. Rather, the powers on the o ther side "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"had bridged the gap, with Monroe as medium, and wer e the ones telling him what to do. Monroe cited a long l ist of technological breakthroughs that came from the othe r side to various inventors, including the benzene ring and t he Xerox copier. We pictured the transformation of America into a spiritual technology. The story of Atlantis came to mind. Ch annelers such as Edgar Cayce stated that Atlantis had risen t o great heights until it destroyed itself. This time, hope fully, we were wise enough not to let the power get out-of-hand. But there was something even more profound than getting milli ons to have occult experiences by a new technology. There was, on a deeper level, a number of revolutionary spiritual i mplications behind astral travel; namely, these experiences imp lied a whole metaphysical reality that was completely new to America. Implicit in soul travel among the living--thos e who have bodies to leave--is soul travel among the dead, who se souls can freely range through other planes without need of bodies. Implied in this is soul travel from life to life, i ncarnation to incarnation, hence reincarnation. Further implicit in all of this is the concept of \"old souls\" who have an almost en dless history of reincarnations. And what is the reason for reincarnation? The answer is central to Eastern thought itself: We reincarnate up the evolutionary ladder for the purp ose of ultimate perfection and self-realization into pure consciousness. When consciousness realizes its identity with ultim ate consciousness, and the mystery of being is over, th en the separate ego-self ceases to exist. Then the \"true self\" unites with the ocean of being, the godhead. in short, as the Hindu masters have stated all along, the self or Jivan At ma, merges with God or the Paramatma, thus attaining eternal l iberation or Moksha, Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Sat-Chit-Ananda. As our past records of karma are worked away, we evolve spiritu ally and climb the ladder of being. We are a composite of m illions of former characters in the cosmic play. And some of us have very long dossiers of former lives. This brings up the question of past-life specu lation. For instance, if Monroe and I had been in Atlantis at t he same"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"time, playing around with dangerous cosmic devices, perhaps we helped blow up the whole works then. Ou r karma, therefore, was to correct now what we had blown up then when the ancient civilization of Atlantis went up i n a vast explosion so great that there is no longer any reco rd of it (this eliminates the archeological question). I remember , after all, at 12 years of age going to the great pyramids of E gypt with my parents and later doing drawings of how they wer e built using antigravity \"Atlantian\" technology; colossal blocks hovered in the air above the Sphinx en route to Cheo ps. I also remember an epiphany I had in the Egypt ian city of Alexandria at the age of 14--I suddenly felt this b lissful sense of connectedness--that I was experiencing a deja vu from a past life. As we took a horse-drawn carriage throu gh the royal gardens of Alexandria, I had this overwhelming name less emotion, a timeless yearning. Later in India I was told such signs in my early childhood indicated I was an adva nced adept. Now I could see these bits to the puzzle fi tting together. I speculated about my own past lives just as p eople do in today's New Age circles. These days you can go to a Hollywood cocktail party where all kinds of incredible past l ives are spoken of with this sense of profound knowing, hero ic lives from King David to Abraham Lincoln, to Atlantian pr iests. Five people present all claim to have once been Abr aham Lincoln. A means of sifting was needed. How do yo u discern the real Abe Lincoln? Then you might encounter some one trying out for a bit part with Metro Goldwyn Mayer. He announces he was once Lao Tse or a top disciple of Gautama Buddha. You quietly wonder about his Hollywood inca rnation as he is now playing a werewolf in some horror movi e. It seems a bit disconcerting for a former pupil of the Buddha to be playing a werewolf. The answer: He is working o ff some last traces of karma. There was an aspect to some of Monroe's and my encounters with the other side that threatened our notions of a peril-free universe void of absolute evil.

One morning, Monroe looked quite shaken as he rubbed his bleary eyes over a cup of coffee at our usual m eeting place, the kitchen table. I had spent a fitful night alon e in a far-wing bedroom, with earphones on while lying flat on my b ack in an attempt to enter what I called \"the buzz region.\" I had been trying to discorporate, kick out of my body and con trol it s sojourn. Monroe, meanwhile, had been assaulted by alien beings at about 3 A.M. That and other encounters ha d lasted till dawn. I was absolutely fascinated by his repo rt at the breakfast table. \"I felt about as significant as an ant compare d to these two beings,\" Monroe confessed. He said he had perceive d clairvoyantly two massive beings of light, brighter than stars and of vast power, drifting deep in the heavens like tw o meteors. Then they stopped their drift and honed in on him, beginning a terrible drilling down upon him like huge, sparki ng hornets. They descended with great speed while Mon roe remained in the paralyzed \"buzz region.\" These bein gs soon reached his room and went through the hidden r ecords of his mind like speed-readers flipping through a c ard file. After about ten minutes they evidently had gotten w hat they wanted--or as he suggested later, implanted wh at they wanted--and then pulled away, much like a huge hypo dermic being pulled out of a patient. This experience bro ught Up the question of victimization and cosmic bullying, and individual worth and privacy, but we preferred to t heorize more in the direction that the incident was an act of ch arity, that the two beings had probably left a subtle implant which would germinate when Bob Monroe was ready, perhaps years i n the future. In a guarded manner, Monroe said that these tw o beings might have had some connection with UFOs which he believed were not necessarily machines, but celesti al beings,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"almost angels of a sort. Since that time in 1968, Robert Monroe has writ ten several sequels to his bestseller, Journeys Out of the Body . They follow up on his experiences and contacts with the beyond. He has also entered the New Age movement as a sort of guru --as have several other friends of mine from that era, s uch as RaYmond Moody, who wrote the bestseller Life After L ife. By the time I left for India after graduating from the University of Virginia, fellow student Raymond Moody was gettin g a Ph.D. in philosophy. Later Moody returned to the U niversity of Virginia as a medical intern while he was a loca l celebrity with his Bantam paperback bestseller filling shelves all over the country. By then I was back from India, having lived through something that felt like a motion picture. INDIA I had been absolutely compelled to go to India . After my psychic dabbling, I realized that my first love rem ained the sheer genius of India's spiritual philosophy. Its depth and range were light-years ahead of what I considered t o be our psychic hobbies in the West. We were just discover ing spiritual realities that Indian sages had exhausted millennia ago. We were exulting over novel toys that the ancients had abandoned as tokens of spiritual infancy. Astral travel to a rishi is like the neon lights of Broadway to a native New Yor ker who looks on in disdain as some visitor from the Third World stands with his mouth hanging open over the blips a nd flashes of neon at Times Square. Or it's like a Ne w Yorker watching some foreigner who can't get over discover ing and reveling in, time and again, some techno-trinket at Toys-R-Us--say a dayglow robot that follows you arou nd the store speaking in metal-voiced banalities. To a jaded Ne w Yorker, such foreigners are mental midgets. So are we when we go into silent awe before some Indian yogi who makes d eep penetrating insights into our character or family h istory. These are party trinkets to an advaitin, the cream of the crop of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"India's spiritual elite, who admit of no subject-ob ject distinctions in the universe including between self and God. In truth, Monroe's contact teachings did not r each what I considered to be the highest truth of all: the ulti mate oneness of all things, which is at the kernel of India's pe rennial philosophy. To me, his contact teachings from astral classes se emed little more than the low-level pyrotechnics that th e Indian masters had been warning against all along. His te achings were fragmented interpretations of reality taught b y demigods and entities which, though higher up the e volutionary scale than your generic citizen, still fell vastly short of the absolute. These entities were way down the scale o f consciousness compared to an enlightened master who had reached unity with the godhead. Such entities ulti mately had to take up human form anyway in order to make that final leap into enlightenment in the first place. The teaching of the enlightened masters is sim ply this: The very highest state of being in the cosmos exists in the one who has become enlightened, when the overmind, the void , suddenly becomes incarnate or manifest in a human b ody. Even the hierarchies of celestial beings are subject to such a one. Bingo: Seth or Ramtha are to sit at the feet of Krishna, not the other way around. The last leap-off point was when a superevolved being joined once again with God; this was the stage of enlightened master. Therefore, why ask a disincarnate Tibetan priest a question that only a full master c an answer? The entity or being would not be an entity or being in the first place unless it still had things to go th rough, lessons that awaited it before it could merge with the abso lute. It was in the karmic classroom and could never be any more than a pupil of a fully enlightened master as long as it r emained \"an entity.\" That was the very uppermost peak of the ev olutionary ladder in the entire cosmos. So why, I asked, both er hooking up with space visitors or drifting entities who are still learners themselves and have only incomplete answers at best? Inevitably, the next major door to open in my life was India."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"But as always, there were dragons at the gate. En route to India, I met the head swami of the Ramakrishna Mission in London. He walked with me through Holla nd Park to quiz me on my understanding of India's nond ual philosophy known as advaita. I was considering joi ning the Ramakrishna Mission in Bengal. Yet I knew only a handful of Westerners ever made it. Then, the day after ou r initial encounter, the swami amazed me. He gave me a lette r of recommendation. I had apparently passed his tests. I knew in my heart of hearts that my awareness came only part ially from reading the great mystical books. The main so urce of my understanding came from that massive mystical exper ience induced by LSD. The swami's parting words were enc ouraging: \"Your understanding of advaita philosophy is as advanced as the best young Brahmin men I have seen i n India. I will write a letter of recommendation to the Ramakri shna Mission in Calcutta recommending you for sanyas (ini tiation as a renunciant and monk wearing the ochre robe).

But other things awaited me in Ind ia than ordination into the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society . Within six months of my arrival in Delhi, I wa s rewarded by the powers that be for my costly leap of faith. I became, after some months of wandering across India, the top West ern disciple of Sai Baba, India's most powerful miracle- working godman. His following numbered over 20 million in India alone. I lived with him in South India for two yea rs, gaining a rare residence permit in the process. I meditated and practiced a range of yogas under Baba. I also becam e a privileged spokesman under Baba. A number of times I joined Sa i Baba onstage at his massive ashram, Prasanthi Nilayam, t o speak before vast crowds.

I was intrigued by their ultimate endorsement of Eastern mystical revelation . They brought me to the shores of India, to the heartland of Vedanta, but no further. Their truth value seemed to stop there. But perhaps psychic/channeled information had another purpose: Since the world was being prepared for a l eap in evolution, new paradigms of the ancient wisdom were needed to reach that critical threshold of people sent to catalyze \"the time of changes.\" Therefore, hidden in these channe lings were personal directives to us, the agents of chang e. We were among the predicted higher souls to incarnate in ou r time to help bring in the New Age. Cayce described our \"des cent into the earth plane.\" The cosmic teletype had some upda ted information on today's events that the rishis of an cient India did not need to write about in their time. Later, many of the sixties pioneers would aban don their mystic attire, join the establishment, and become y uppies. But their understanding of reality would infiltrate the world. They would remake the corporation. They would fill the ranks of influential occupations and, from their pr estigious vantage points, they would then parlay this new bel ief system into acceptability as it descended down the slopes of the pyramid into the average living room of middle Amer ica. These embryo mystics of the sixties were desti ned to grow up and take over the gears of society: publishing, movies, news magazines, television shows, schoolrooms, gove rnment agencies, science labs, academia, banking, even Wal l Street. It was a coup of quiet succession, of one generation replacing another. A whole new world was waiting i n the wings. It just needed time. It also needed a line of credit from some quiet insiders behind the scenes. There were many players in this drama of shaping global history. S ome were actors in the parade, some were movers and shakers. The plan for a New World Order was not a new one. But certain things needed to be aligned before it could even be discussed.

This axiom is universal among New A ge luminaries. Ken Wilber, David Spangler, Fritjof Cap ra, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Marilyn Ferguson, Shirley MacLaine, and other well-known figures emphasize the need to be guided by higher powers. They have been foremost among the n ew wave in letting go and letting the process of guida nce from beyond take hold in their own lives. There are man y forms of guidance. It is an open field. Any technique that works is fair game in this new renaissance, whether it has come o ut of the ancient mystery religions, India, or the very newes t experiments in producing altered states. To the zealous mystic, the smallest perception or event can be loaded with significance. Intuition alone can g o a long way. Then there are higher octane methods such as the tarot, visualization, meditation, shamanistic techniques, drugs, the Ouija board, astrology, and the I Ching. The higher powers can use these things as mediums through which to gu ide inquiring minds.

He would receive mental pi ctures of distant events like a cosmic television station. H e blanked out his mind and in they would come. He also received images from people's minds that we called \"pictures.\" We e ngaged in a kind of psychic voyeurism. We sat at the back of the class, eyes closed, waiting for impressions to come from t he prettiest girls in the class. What usually came through was fragmented and odd. But we were compelled by the sh eer fascination of the unknown. By high school there was a lull as new interest s filled the gap, yet cosmic tidbits did come through. I was in an advanced English class under a teacher who had just come bac k from Oxford. J.D. Salinger was required reading. There it was, another tidbit--the short story entitled \"Teddy.\" I t was about an \"embryo mystic,\" a precocious ten-year-old boy c rossing the Atlantic on an ocean liner (at age ten I too cr ossed the Atlantic on an ocean liner). I walked home rehears ing Salinger's story in my mind. It brought back my fa scination. One passage in particular between ten-year-old Teddy an d an adult had great impact: \"From what I gather, you've acquired certain information, through meditation, that's given you some conviction that in your last incarnation you were a holy man in India, but more or less fell fro m grace--\" \"I wasn't a holy man,\" Teddy said. \"I was jus t a person making a very nice spiritual advancement.\" \"All right--whatever it was,\" Nicholson said. \"But the point is you feel that in your last incarnation you"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"more or less fell from grace before final Illuminat ion.

Nicholson was looking at him, studying him . \"I believe you said on that last tape that you were six when you first had a mystical experience. Is that right?\" \"I was six when I saw that everything was God, and my hair stood up, and all that,\" Teddy said. \" It was on a Sunday, I remember. My sister was only a very tiny child then, and she was drinking her milk , and all of a sudden I saw that she was God and that the milk was God. I mean, all she was doing was pouring God into God, if you know what I mean.\"1 It kept echoing in my head on the way home fro m high school: \"... all she was doing was pouring God into God, if you know what I mean.\" THE BIG PICTURE When I was a bit younger than Teddy, we lived in Georgetown, Washington D.C., not far from Dumbarton Oaks. One day I wandered down to the Georgetown theater after school. I used to go to movies alone so I could concentrate without interruption. On the marquee it read: THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. I was haunted, invaded by the film. It touched a primal nerve in me. There it was, the earth in c haos, a hostile planet whose nations were at war. Suspicio n and weaponry were everywhere. The earth was like a big ship out-Of-control, with no one at the helm to steer it . People battled and tugged on the wheel--frightened, warlike people with "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"hair-trigger responses to threats, real or imagined . At any moment the ship might collide with any number of th ings and that would be it--down it would go. So too wit h an earth run by unenlightened people who were always on the brink of war.

The alien visitor, played by Michael Rennie, is an infinitely noble-looking man whose handsome, refined, and intelligent face i s grieved by people who cannot handle their own affai rs. The earth is given an ultimatum. If it wants to surviv e and join the planetary confederation, it must abandon national r ights, surrender to global government, and immediately dis arm, otherwise the earth will be reduced to cinders. An elite of the world's top intellectuals, of course, understood th is like the ABCs. Presumably they would be among the elite of th e global government. But military men and politicians needed a show of power, which they got. Gort, the robot w ith the one eye, a supertitanium cyclops, could melt anything i n sight if he so chose, from Sherman tanks to the entire plane t. Idiots with guns finally got the point and backed off afte r he vaporized numbers of them. The alien visitor was what all earthlings need ed to become: an infinitely noble and wise being with a cosmic ou tlook and who detested violence, valued all things--including the sacredness of life, was impartial, peace-loving, an d who held an air of unshakable superiority. He was among the enlightened. He was the ultimate role model. The producer, Mr. Blaustein, made a deep point to my tender young mind in a post-World-War-II world. After the afternoon matin ee, I walked through Dumbarton Oaks--an ironic act, though I did not know it at the time. Indeed, I used to love exploring Dumbarton Oak s, the beautiful estate where a handful of intellectuals, some who were acquaintances of my father, had held strategy meetings preceding the formation of the United Nations. It was also the meeting place of another group of intellectuals, ph ysicists"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"such as Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, and Edward Teller, who had met eight years before the first gr oup. Their purpose was to explore the feasibility of building the world's first atomic bomb--what was known as the Manhattan Project. All this was just around the corner from where I lived--a peaceful and innocent-looking place with stunning fountains, flower gardens, woods, and red-brick bui ldings, and where global war and global unity had been discusse d and planned. It implied a planet in chaos, without pea ce and order, where perhaps an elite group of men might in tervene to keep a great tragedy from happening. All someon e needed was to go along with the plan. It was democracy in action. In those days, all I could see glinting within the wal ls of Dumbarton Oaks were the bright coins shining at the bottom of the fountain. The truth seemed simple then and many years la ter: All the world needed was a change of consciousness, of mind -set. That was it. Then people could put down their arms and live in peace, sharing selflessly the resources of the w orld. Indeed, a new viewpoint was needed--a sense of the Cosmic and, of course, a change of self-orientation so tha t universal love could take root. This didn't seem to be askin g too much. By the time I went to India I was convinced tha t there was a fundamental and supreme basis for unity that few pe ople saw or understood. It was a unity that we already had in our very deepest natures--that if we were all sparks of the divine, then to be anything but united in global peace and love was a miscarriage of highest truth. \"I am you as you are me\" sang Lennon and Harrison of the Beatles in \"I Am the Walr us.\" If I am shooting a fellow human being, then I am shoot ing myself--that is what the mystic finally realizes. Once you can see the divine within, then you can see the divine without-- because it is within others. Then boundaries of th e ego dissolve and only love can exist. This was cosmic love \"for all people\" about which the yogis . of India and the my stic masters spoke. This was also an essential tenet of New Age th ought.

This was the true cement for global unity--a change of consciousness. New Agers use the term \"Planetization.\" Until we did th at, the threat of a planet in chaos capable of destroying i tself almost any time in nuclear fire loomed on the horizon. Th is is the platform of Greenpeace and a thousand other New Age groups. But there is a hidden work: networking groups have to reach a critical threshold of people, a minimum num ber required to catalyze the New Age planetary transfor mation. This is viewed as a necessary evolutionary event wi thout which the planet might not survive. The catalytic threshold occurs when that minimum number of people experienc e \"consciousness-raising.\" Events like Hands-across-America and the Harmo nic Convergence are events that the public can role-play which have far deeper significance than they realize in acclim ating them for globalism and the new consciousness. It is lik e getting millions of people to recite a mantra on a TV progr am; the act itself is an unconscious invocation. Hands-across- America was the seeding among the people of a mind-set. It was a dress rehearsal for universal brotherhood, gearing the public for world cooperation. It is the fishnet approach. First you identify and then catalyze those among the masses w ho will be future beacons to help steer this process of pub lic influence. The film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, c arried this message--the gathering together of those from out o f society who were receptive to higher guidance. They were r eady for change and ready to take the leap to leave the old world behind. Again, it involved alien intervention. It inc luded a seeding process and a gathering process. By the late seven ties, people were ready for aliens who did not need to look like the ultimate role model. We could now accept things th at were more dehumanized and alien.

The experts are baffled. Those tha t are being called learn to surrender to a deeper impulse behin d the tune. They zone out, trance out.

It is a global Rice Kris pies commercial. Guidance continues. The meeting point is Devi l's Tower, Wyoming. Many have telepathic images of it. Only the chosen will get there, and that includes little Johnny. A wed faces drift along. The same faces that were once awed at Christ in Ben Hur and The Robe now shine with reverent awe at t he strange-looking aliens. But this new awe has taken a left-hand turn; it is zoned out. The players in th e game look like a long line of Rajneesh disciples staring at their gur u. The aliens coming out of the saucer greatly re semble what Whitley Streiber reported in his contact. It is a cosmic omelette of mixed emotions--\"love the alien\"--not t he powerful romantic love of Zeffirelli's Romeo and Jul iet, where your guts are on fire. No, this is different. This is the zoned-out grin of the Zen master or a member of a transperson al encounter group--not always a thing of beauty, but cosmic.

The message was Love that which is strange , breaks convention, is unacceptable, monstrous, even grotes que; and Only those who are ready can experience such cosmic love.

Esoteric spiritual paths that I had ex plored for years, placing me in a distinct minority, have become by n ow almost the consensus view of America. The plan is unfoldi ng with the force of a charging freight train. Perhaps the few are becoming the many. 1987 starts out with a bang. As 1986 passes b y on New Year's Eve, millions have gathered in convention ha lls and stadiums and even churches to invoke the New Age. It is International Meditation Day for World Peace. Hund reds of organizations in 60 nations have sponsored this eve nt.

The year of 1987 closes out with Shirley MacLa ine on the front cover of Time magazine. The cover story is a bout the New Age movement, and Shirley is smiling with cryst als in her hand. The TV miniseries \"Out on a Limb\" is key. Fif ty-million-plus American homes are treated to the following scenes: Shirley MacLaine walks Malibu beach with her a rtist companion David who has wiggled his way into her co nfidence with fortune-cookie observations dropped with impec cable timing. He is ready to give her another dare. A s lightly crooked, all-knowing smile passes across his face. \"Now open out your arms, face the ocean, and repeat afte r me. 'I am God.' Go ahead, say it.\" Shirley looks awkward, embarrassed. Tentative ly she mouths the words, \"I am God.\" Inhibitions keep her from a full-hearted acclamation. Dave is like a surfing instructor dealing with a novice who keeps wiping out. \"Come on, yell it out, don't be c hicken, say it convincingly. I am God.\" Shirley's chant mounts in volume. She forces herself to act out the conviction. \"I am God, I am God, I am God. \" David has chimed in, helping her to build up steam. She is breaking through the resistance, the co ld barrier. \"Hey, it isn't so hard. just say it.\" By the end of her repetitions,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Shirley is celebratory, liberated. That wasn't so painful. Wow! What a lesson. Fifty million Americans get the message: \"Hey, we are God.\" That is the cornerstone of the New Age moveme nt: Man is God. So how does Shirley go from just chanting it t o experiencing it? She needs a little consciousness-raising. It w ill soon be time for her to go to Peru, to the Andes. She must follow the paths of the mystics. Meanwhile, she is to go to t he Boddhi Tree bookstore on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles--the biggest occult bookstore in America--and buy stacks of book s, from Edgar Cayce, Gurdjieff, and Ouspinsky, to Muktananda and Sai Baba. Then she meets some channelers--first the one in Sweden. Then she is ready for Kevin Ryerson. Later it will be J.Z. Knight and jach Pursel. The entities speaking through the channelers have the same message: Man is God. But Shirley still has an area of resistance. It's that old puritanical conscience. The old paradigms from the West's bibl ical foundation are still hanging on. Shirley needs some signs and wonders and so do es America. The miniseries takes us with Shirley and David to Peru. David is doing the Harrison Ford routine--time for the old Panama hat and Banana Republic gear. He's still spor ting the all-knowing look. It is bitingly cold outside that night, high u p in the Andes, even in the summer. Shirley and David have discree tly disrobed and are experiencing one of nature's wonde rs. They are in a bubbling pool carved out of the rock and fed b y a warm natural spring. They have talked about Atlantis, a bout soul-mates. Shirley is still hung up over her Engl ish lover, a married laborite member of Parliament who is a this -world-only materialist. She is unable to share her deepest an d most sacred passion with him--her new emerging spiritual awakening. He will have nothing to do with it. He mocks her. There is a strong sense that they were married befo re, in Atlantis. One of the channelers has already said t his. But they had the same sort of spiritual disagreement they ha d had in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Atlantis. Shirley has moved on and the Englishman is back into changing the world through politics: a kind of updated Fabian socialism. Shirley goes in and out of a tru sting vulnerability with David, her present spiritual men tor. \"Have you ever left your body?\" David asks blu ntly. He is preparing the famed actress for astral projection. \"I have, scores of times. It's really no big deal. Just re lax, trust the process, let go. Go on, let go.\" Shirley MacLaine is surrounded by bubbling wat er. Then her voice narrates what is happening to her in a stream-of-consciousness musing. She becomes stunne d, overwhelmed. This incredible feeling comes over her. It's reall y happening. She feels this incredible oneness with all things, that she is experiencing universal reality. Then her body beco mes paralyzed, and this blissful charge of energy runs through her like electricity. The next thing is that she fires up i nto the mountain sky looking down at her body lying in the pool. She sees a long silver cord attached to her body. When it is over, David is nonchalant. He now begins teaching again. He is t he nonchalant guru, full of deep mystical truth. The message to watching America is: You are no t your body. You are a timeless soul evolving through man y life-times to a definite goal. Each life is a clas sroom experience, a chance to learn. Every time you learn, you move on to the next lesson. In doing this, you are working off ka rma. Sin is really ignorance. There is no personal, transcende nt God to sin against. God is impersonal consciousness, an o cean of being. It, God, is in all things. Now that you kn ow this, then you know that our world is only an illusion. It ca n keep us from knowing the deeper realities going on. These foundational truths of the New Age movement are abs olutely central. Shirley MacLaine gains credibility with her ma ssive TV audience by well-timed moments of skepticism of the you-can't-really-mean-that variety.

The reason is that David is now beg inning to prepare her for the next phase of training.

Not just that, but one extraterrestrial with whom David has been in touch for a long time, named \"the Mayan,\" is strangely present. She is a being, an entity, w ho is nonphysical and is from Pleiades, a distant star sy stem. \"She\" is to become Shirley MacLaine's guide. To prove it, \"the Mayan\" tells David in his mi nd to utter the following words to Shirley MacLaine: \"In order to g et the fruit of the tree you have to go out on a limb.\" These ar e the identical words that \"John,\" an entity channeling t hrough Kevin Ryerson in Los Angeles months before, told Sh irley. David could not have known this. Now things have gotten too far-out. Shirley's laugh becomes the kind of laugh that people have when it is time for the men in the white coats. It is fractured, shrill, loony --time for her to get away from David immediately. She insists on leaving him. We can read her thoughts. He is nothing more than a spiritual opportunist, a con artist, a flunky witho ut a track record bragging his way into her graces. She gets the Land Rover and goes off to be alo ne for several days.

Shirley now becomes especially aware that a no nphysical hierarchy exists and is waiting to intervene in the affairs of the world. It is New Age lesson number three.

America now knows that they are out there as well. We just need to get ready to surrender to the intuitive impulse. THE NEXUS OF NEW AGE BELIEFS Shirley MacLaine's TV miniseries, \"Out on a Li mb\" has pulled together the central nexus of New Age belief s. Virtually all New Age thinkers are in basic agreeme nt. For the sake of clarity, these central beliefs will be reit erated below. The core can be found in the basic tenets of Easter n mysticism with some modern ideas added from the West. Eastern Influences 1. THE IMPERSONAL GODHEAD. God is the Brahman of Hinduism. It is impersonal, like the Force in Star Wars, or the ocean of supreme consciousness. It is the Ground o f Being and non-being, the static eternal, the overmind, th e consciousness within all things and sustaining all things. Hence, New Agers talk about the sacredness of all things. It is beyond all attributes and all polarities. The yin/yang symbol of Taoism expresses the On e as being beyond all polarities. It is indeed composed of th em: light and dark, masculine and feminine, good and evil, etc., for all polarities are composed of the godhead. White ligh t going into a prism comes out as differentiated colored ra ys on the other side. The phenomenal universe is like the di fferentiated colored rays. They are no longer unified. But if you examine the unified white light, the source of all color, t he colors can no longer be differentiated. Blue, red, yellow cann ot be seen"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"in the white light. There is not even a hint of th eir existence without the prism. This is how consciousness emerg es from the godhead and forms the phenomenal universe. On the other side, within the ocean of pure co nsciousness, all seemingly separate forms are perceived as being the One. It is their appearance of differentiation that is t he illusion. An impersonal god has no forgiving grace, no personal love, no higher morality, and is not the transcendent person al creator of the universe. To an impersonal consciousness, t he lives of struggling individuals rate no higher on the scale than ants being swept off a tree trunk in a summer thundersto rm. Older cultures, such as the Hindus of India who have live d under this perennial philosophy for many centuries, under stand the downside of an impersonal godhead, and it can b e a source of great despair as they struggle to escape the great wheel of karma. 2. THE DIVINE WITHIN. The mystery of man's ult imate identity is finally revealed as his divinity within . It is the basic tenet of pantheism, the core belief of Hinduism: Al l things are One, since all energy is divine consciousness \"froz en\" into matter. Since all things are made of God, man in h is deepest self is none other than God. But without \"enlighte nment,\" he does not know this and, in effect, lives as an amne siac. The purpose of man is to realize that he is God, thus e nding the \"illusion\" of separation. 3. THERE IS NO DEATH. As parts of God we are im mortal, and death is only an illusion as we evolve througho ut eternity. Death is only a veil between one lifetime and anoth er. Reincarnation is one element of this scheme. Others speak of continuation on other planes; the Tibetans use the term bardos in Mahayana Buddhism. 4. GOOD AND EVIL ARE ILLUSIONS. Evil is just th e reverse side of the coin of good. It is the back side. Ea ch is incomplete without the other. In effect, both good and evil a re part of the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"illusion of existence. Good and evil merge at an u pper threshold, and both are necessary in the phenomenal universe. Indeed, both are parts of the godhead, as polaritie s that unify in the One. An aspect of the godhead is evil, as w e see represented in Kali and Siva who wreak death and de struction as the dark underbelly of reality. Because of this, sin is ignorance. Both polarities are to be transcended; they are not absolutes in the biblical sense. 5. ALL PATHS LEAD TO GOD. Through a higher understanding, it can be seen that all world faiths point to the same spiritual reality and are all paths up the mountain to the godhead. The goal is to show that all religions ar e saying the same thing. Syncretism is a central goal of the Ne w Age movement. New Western Hybrids 6. SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION. The New Age view of his tory is one of spiritual evolution, almost in Hegelian term s. History is seen as a kind of cosmic genetic code that unfur ls the divine dimensions of man as consciousness evolves. Conscio usness, in the act of self-discovery, must answer the riddl e of its true nature. The cosmos is purposeful as it moves inexo rably toward its final goal: global enlightenment and the deification of man. New Age theoretician Ken Wilber says, \"... if men and women have ultimately come up from amoebas, the n they are ultimately on their way towards God.\"2 7. SHIFTING PARADIGMS. This is the shift in th e way reality is perceived due to the inevitable momentum of the evolution of consciousness. Virginia Hine, the respected soc iologist, has mentioned this shift as our leaving the Faustia n myth of scientism. And Ferguson spoke of the need to shatt er the confines of the present \"crust of custom.\" In short , New Agers anticipate the collapse of the Old Age and th e birth of the New Age by means, in part, of the paradigm shif t in the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"way reality is perceived. Rationalism and Christian monotheism will be supplanted by mystical monism, a s the intuitive right hemisphere of the race is brought i nto equal footing with the long-reigning logical left hemisphere of W estern consciousness, as Peter Russell observes.3 8. OPTIMISM. Though New Agers are deeply aware of the precariousness of human existence due to such thing s as the nuclear threat and the ecological and population cr ises-- from which they cite dire statistics such as the Gl obal 2000 Report (to show how the old paradigms have failed)-- they nevertheless brandish a positive spirit, rising abo ve contemporary despair. With Marilyn Ferguson this m ood of optimism is almost a manic expectancy. Secretary G eneral of the United Nations Robert Muller exults, \"The next stage will be our entry into a moral global age--the global age o f love-- and a global spiritual age--the cosmic age. We are now moving fast towards the fulfillment of the visions of the great prophets who through cosmic enlightenment saw the w orld as one unit, the human race as one family, sentimen t as the cement of that family, and the soul as our link wit h the universe, eternity, and God.\"4 9. CRISIS AS TRANSFORMATION. The dark and forebod ing horizon of impending global holocaust is an importa nt catalyst that will help thrust the planet into a ne w awakening, breaking down walls of resistance like a tidal wave crashing through a seacoast village. Man stands at the cros sroads about to make a quantum leap forward. Such things as atomic threat raise the global temperature to the boiling point where human ego structures are forced to break down in th e manner that hostages trapped in a hijacked airplane sudden ly feel the futility of worrying about their belongings. Outwa rd necessity forces the dire realization and the transformation. 10. HOLISM. We must relate to our world from t he viewpoint of the solidarity of all reality, the \"all is one\" of Eastern"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"thought. When we do, things that are presently out -of-balance will be restored--whether ecological, political, or geophysical. Human health will be restored and ear th itself will reach a kind of planetary consciousness that Cambrid ge-educated New Age apologist Peter Russell calls \"Gala Consciousness.\"5 In short, for those who are ready i t will be a new heaven on earth, a New Age millennium.6 TRIGGERING THE GREAT EVENT Alice Bailey spoke of \"The Externalization of t he Hierarchy\" (also the title of her major work) to he lp bring on the New Age. It would be a broad-range release of forc es on every level of the continuum of consciousness, from ascen ded masters to impulses coming from deep within \"the godhead.\" These were all seen as manifestations of the One in a grand concert. In a talk in Geneva, Switzerland, before the Arcane School, which she founded, Bailey thrilled her audie nce with descriptions of this release of forces: The decision to release the Shamballa force du ring this century into direct contact with the human kingdom is one of the final and most compelling acts of preparation for the New Age. The Shamballa force is destructive and ejectiv e... inspiring new understanding of The Plan... It is this force ... which will bring about th at tremendous crisis, the initiation of the race into the mysteries of the ages.7 These mysteries of the ages are now being reve aled before the world. We glimpse them in Shirley MacLaine's t elevised account of her own birth into the New Age. In this lies the central creed of New Age beliefs. Most central of all is the discovery of the divinizing of man. Not just the d iscovery of the divine within--the heart of pantheism--but a gl obal"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"process of objective and conscious divinizing of th e race that will change the entire earth. If true, it is a titanic event. And it cannot help but affect all and everyone. Those that go along with it are told that they will apparently experience heaven on earth as they become gods. Those that resist it because of outmoded bel iefs will apparently have some rough lessons in store for the m. And why should it be any other way? The brutal facts of evolution, they point out, have told us this. Life is a spect acular passing show of variant creatures, from bright-green frogs to behemoths. But invariably some species are discarde d as they are replaced by more evolved species. It is just one m ore a cappella note coming from the voices from out of th e rainbow."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"7 Wheels of Influence: The Therapist's Office The current wave of New Age beliefs may endure or it may change, but it is this: Given that the self is God, then once it is unleashed, it can control reality. Indeed, this Go d-self can remake the world by its own power. The more minds that awaken and tap this reality, the faster the great c hanges can occur. At a certain critical mass, the process wil l become a millennial explosion. A critical threshold of coll ective human minds that have been \"awakened\" and are working in synchronicity would have the power to transform the world in the twinkling of an eye. If this is done right, a utopian world will emerge. Man can literally wish away the probl ems that have plagued the earth for millennia, from disease to poverty. Consciousness is the hidden messiah. Those who stop and question this emerging conv entional wisdom, wondering if it doesn't sound like The Empe ror's New Clothes, are perceived to be among those in the resi stance whose force fields of doubt are keeping the global event from happening. They must either be converted or render ed ineffectual so that their \"negativity\" does not int erfere with the great plan. The plan is this: Enlighten through various wh eels of influence as many people as possible. A critical t hreshold of people must be reached. It is like electing someon e into office. Campaign rhetoric can only become a reality once tha t person is elected into office and then empowered by the of fice. But enough votes must be gathered to get that person into office first of all. Germany soon changed once Hit ler became chancellor. Novels like Frederick Forsythe's The F ourth Protocol illustrate the historical reality of someone with a hidden agenda trying to acquire the power of political off ice. Forsythe pictures a top KGB mole using the English l abor party"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"platform to gain the office of prime minister. Whi le the film version merely emphasized the drama around the KGB e ffort to create a nuclear explosion at a U.S. air base, t he more sinister underlying theme of the novel involved the progress of the KGB candidate into the most powerful office i n Britain. If we pictured that critical threshold of peop le spoken of by New Age advocates as representative of Forsythe's K GB mole, then it would mirror the type of conspiracy describ ed by Marilyn Ferguson in her 1980 bestseller, The Aquari an Conspiracy. It is a conspiracy of gradualist penetration and ta keover. It is a numbers game that involves such key arenas as the marketplace, the schoolroom, and the therapist's of fice, for these are all places with captive audiences where t he power to influence is considerable. THE THERAPIST'S OFFICE One highly captive audience is the hurting, vu lnerable, and receptive client sitting in the therapist's off ice. The mind and heart of such a client are wide open for direct ion, for answers, for the truth about the meaning to life. The power to influence that lies in the hands of the psychotherapist is considerable. His guidance, ins ights, and beliefs can affect the patient for life. The therapist's v iew about the nature of reality becomes the foundation stone upon which his therapy is based. It can be no other way. His understanding of reality cannot help but influence the patient di rectly or indirectly. The therapist is a guru about reality and the self. He is both an authority as well as a confidant--per haps more intimate than a best friend or spouse. If he is am ong the many humanistic or transpersonal psychologists or psychi atrists, the winds of New Age thought will inevitably blow i nto the soul of the willing client. The field of psychotherapy has gone a long way since it first started. During the course of this century, from F reud to Ken Wilber, it has covered the entire map of belief s, from"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"atheism to mysticism, from nihilism to existentiali sm. Over this same period, it has gathered under its umbrell a over a hundred different schools of thought about the natu re of man and the universe and the appropriate therapy requir ed. It has tried to call itself a science, but how can it be! It is so complex as to defy verifiability. How can the unseen worki ngs of the psyche--the very consciousness of an individual--ev er be exposed and examined by any device for scientific v erification? And how can any individual psyche ever be subjected to scientifically valid lab experiments? We're still s truggling to pinpoint the electron--is it a particle or does it sometimes lapse into waves? What scientist could ever create the identical individual and then grow him up in a thousand different enviro nments, to test the effects of those different environments --each time perfectly monitoring them and controlling them? And if you say that each one is the same test-tube clone, can you prove you gave him the same soul? (Are you so sure there is not a soul?) And if there were, could you ever discover t he soul through science? And here is an added problem: Which mortal sci entist could ever live long enough to do this experiment? Likewise, how can the scientist even come to terms with all t he environmental influences of a single day within a single environm ent? The problems of verifying the psyche through pure science are titanic, insurmountable--indeed, beyond the range of science. In the end, the gurus of human nature, the psy chotherapists, are forced to generalize. They must play the role of wise pundits, and so they claim to be. But when they dis agree, as when Carl Jung parted ways with Sigmund Freud, what court of wisdom is able to prove which one is right? Agai n, psychotherapy is no science at all; it is a battleg round of different schools of belief. Inevitably, it comes down to a faith issue about the nature of human identity and ultimate rea lity. Is Freud's psychoanalysis right or is Jung's depth psy chology right? What if they are both way off base?"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis reflected his b eliefs and opinions. Freud's sample cases were mostly affluen t and neurotic Viennese women. His subjects by no means encompassed all peoples and cultures. Freud synthe sized the reigning beliefs of his day--the popular conception s of humanists on the vanguard of liberated thought--into a pseudoscience. Above all, Freud was an atheist. F or him, quite simply, neither the universe nor psychoanalysis had a place for God. That was a closed issue. In Freud's day, philosophers believed in a con tingent and closed universe. At the head of the pack were the Logical Positivists of Cambridge. Scientific determinism wa s the order of the day. Popular wisdom claimed that we w ere all products of long, complex causal gateways confining the course of our existence to a choiceless determinism . Man was merely a by-product of genetics and environment. Freud propounded the above and also borrowed f rom Darwin and assorted anthropologists. The biblical God was now seen as an internalized surrogate father figure ori ginally projected out into the world by a tribal people. F reud used Greek mythology to press this theme into respectability. As in the story of Oedipus Rex, Jehovah was seen as the jealou s and feared father figure holding back the threat of inc est. Morals and religion were built on these strange ancestral psychodynamics of tribal rule. The conscience was a learned response to taboos created by the tyrannical father type who became a tribal god. The Judaism of Freud became the random saga of a tribal horde that imagined its God from its ancestr al memories of wandering. It was the cosmic \"no\" to lust and a ssorted hedonisms in order for the tribe to survive and not dissipate into chaos and anarchy. There was no ultimate hope in the universe for Freud. And the fruit of despair that came with this was inevit able. What psychoanalysis did offer to sophisticated society, in the same era that D.H. Lawrence was breaking ground, was fre edom from the dictates of the conscience and moral restr iction. It offered sexual liberation to a world still under th e dictates of"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"moral propriety and biblical moral law. Moral cust oms still created pangs of conscience; they still inhibited f ree expression. And liberated intellectuals were trying desperately to break down the doors of sexual \"repression\" and fin d a haven of free expression. Freud helped provide the door but behind that door, as was noted, was the deeper despair of determinism, of man's lack of significance in a godless universe . Some people got their orgasm, but it took place in a hug e cosmic vacuum. Others, seeing through the implications of the psychoanalytic system, became dysfunctional and des pairing in other ways. Woody Allen is a living example of the psychoanalytic mind-set. Sex and death are his obs essions. He looks into the mirror to remind himself what will be eras ed from the universe when he dies--himself. His angst keeps hi m frustrated, forever kept apart from the illusory se nsual moment. It is like watching a dog slobbering at a ham sitti ng in a plate-glass window. The void becomes too close to escape into the sensual dreamland. By the sixties, people had had it \"up to here\" with Freud and the impasse of scientific determinism. Now tha t they had finally acquired their freedom from moral restraint , they were tired of the downside of Freudian deterministi c gloom. Freudian psychology was referred to as First Force PSYchology. Then came behaviorism which utterly re jected the theories of Freud as scientifically unfounded specu lations and opinion. The behaviorists resolved to camp out in the lab with animals and not venture beyond this. They wer e the Second Force psychologists. Anything that could no t be scientifically verified they considered to be myth. They were hard-core materialists. Beginning with Fechner and Wilhelm Wundt and going through Pavlov's stimulus-response experiments, the behaviorists have logged thousands of lab hours testing simple things that can be tested. Their mo st famous recent pioneer has been B.F. Skinner of Harvard, in ventor of the Skinner box. Skinner took determinism to its limits in his book Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner announced that basica lly man"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"was a soulless animal who had no free will, no guar antee of meaning or happiness. Therefore man had no basis t o object when social engineers came on the scene to behavior shape him to fit into a world that the intellectual elite planned to create. War could be driven out of the human race in the lab. With the right probes and enough current, the job c ould be done. Skinner's daughter grew up under the Skinner box (Skinnerian behavioral conditioning) and ended up i n a mental institution not far from Harvard. She knew no love (for love does not exist), merely positive and negative reinforcement. The scientist who had assumed the task of changing the world through operant conditioning had failed o n his own daughter. His behavior modification had starve d her soul and dehumanized her. Yet Skinner proclaimed h is school of psychology as bearing the solution to human ills . To the generation of the sixties, the above mi nd-set summed up the grotesqueness of the humanistic experiment. They could not wait to enter Freud, Skinner, and others into the museum of obsolete thought. So when the Eysenck st udy was released at the University of London, there was a f uror. Eysenck's study simply showed that among neurotics divided 50/50, those that underwent psychoanalysis had no b etter recovery rate than those who just lived life and sa ved the massive therapy fees. The recovery was the same, p lus or minus a .02 percent statistical error factor, In ot her words, psychoanalysis did nothing. Eysenck drove home the fact that psychoanalysis was anything but scientifically proven. All it could do was hide behind its terminology and verify itself by its own closed definitions of reality. F reudian psychoanalysis became discredited among all but the most loyal followers and/or those who had spent 20,000 dollars in training to become highly-paid psychoanalysts. When the sixties hit, there was a rediscovery of the spiritual and the intuitive, realms that such intellectual Mo del-T Fords as Freud and Skinner had not sanctioned. The birth of Third Force humanistic psychology took place in the sixties, arriving on the scene in time to restore dignity an d value to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"men after Freud and the behaviorists had confiscate d them. Though they could not prove the foundation upon whi ch they stood, humanistic psychologists like Abraham M aslow and Carl Rogers assured the world that there was mea ning to life after all and that there was a good deal of ro om for optimism in the universe. Humanistic psychology de clared that people had free choice and were not the random collocations of molecules deterministically gathere d into human biocomputers, but rather were part of a larger spir itual dimension. \"Feel-good\" psychology made its entranc e. At the forefront of this was Carl Rogers, at one time presid ent of the American Psychological Association and winne r of numerous awards for his nondirective therapy. At o ne point, I tried it and liked it. I too had felt the despai r of atheism in the sixties and hated the small space into which I was boxed. Under Rogerian therapy and transactional analy sis (I'm okay, you're okay) I felt good because I could writ e my own ticket to reality. That gnawing conscience that bu rdened me with guilt was being selectively cut away by a s calpel of permissiveness. This new psychology brought a sweet-sounding creed--that conscience and guilt wer e like vestigial organs, such as the appendix, that no longer served a useful function. The conscience was part of my primitive brain holding me back from full self-expression, from fre edom, creativity, and joy. In Rogerian client-centered th erapy, I the patient had all the answers within. All I needed w as a good psychic plumber to help me find them. In time my a ngst began to lift away. My mood became an almost reckl ess abandon-- the Zorba the Greek approach. Respectability and conformity were limitations to radical human freedo m that were carryovers from the old order. I was assured that human nature was basically good, so why be afraid to chan ge? Experience and change became prized ideals in this psychic gold rush. Humanistic psychology pointed to the idea that self-actualization could be speeded up by exploring within and overcom ing all inner fears and areas of darkness by a total nonjudgmental self-acceptance. Then the unfathomab le depth of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"human potential could be tapped. It was upbeat and optimistic. Change was never bad; it was always good. Rogers spo ke of the next evolutionary leap into the new man. But society would have to be radically changed first. A revolu tionary agenda was needed for this to happen, a kind of psy chological Marxism that repudiated institutions and traditions . By the midsixties, Esalen at Big Sur had become a think tank for many of these famed psychologists: Fritz Perls, Rol lo May, Carl Rogers, and the rest. Their message was that it was a no-lose universe. Yet there was an underside to such positive ac clamation. As Barbara Ehrenreich observed in her article entitled \"The Psychology of Growth,\" which appeared in Mother Jon es, April 1983: \"If the human potential was intrinsically goo d, then there was no firm ground left from which to attack the deviant or nonconformist. All trajectories were possible a s each unique and groping 'self' reached toward fulfillment.\" Thu s there were no standards left to judge undesirable devianc e, nor could you find standards to judge what desirable gr owth was. As long as the self was doing its own authentic thi ng, it was okay. Growth and fulfillment were life's new ideal s. It was a perfect creed for a culture of narcissism. Indeed, humanistic psychology undermined the traditional structures of society while using the m ost gentle and accepting language. Such stabilizing institutions as marriage were questioned. After all, they confined the new freedoms. Ehrenreich observed in her above article: \"Psycholo gists had always seen marriage as 'work'; the doctrine of gro wth transformed it into a navigation feat which would h ave challenged a ballistics expert.\" Self-interest could now be se lfish and morally blind. Hedonism was okay, and feeling good was okay. Anything could be questioned, especially sac rosanct institutions. Freedom meant you could do almost an ything. The creed of Third Force psychology indeed sou nds like the slogans of the sixties. Maybe we could say tha t the slogans and peoples movements of the sixties got much of th eir impetus from humanistic psychology, which became the specia l"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ally of the sixties revolution. What were the new directives of the sixties youth culture? Christopher Lasch's The Cu lture Of Narcissism spells them out: nonbinding commitments, freedom from guilt or failure, personal fulfillment, the ne urotic need for affection, reassurance, and gratification, as well as an inability to internalize clearly defined criteri a of right and wrong. Under these new rules what you end up with are manipulators who are on the take. They can quickly assess how to use others to get what they want from them, then dump them as soon as they have used them. Loyalty is not their strong point. Communal experiments become a free-for-all without reference points--from egalita rian tribes to cultish dictatorships. Communal anarchy brought out the full fruits of character traits which pointed to a new b arbarism further down the road. The founders of humanistic psychology anticipa ted and then built the bridge to transpersonal psychology. Again, Esalen Institute rates high as a power point in thi s bridge. Abraham Maslow traced a hierarchy of seven levels o f need. When basic needs like food and shelter were taken c are of, the higher needs--which were the spiritual ones--could then be addressed, leading to self-actualization. This was the key part of the bridge that led from the humanistic psycholo gy of the sixties to the transpersonal psychology of the seve nties. Posturing as \"experts,\" these psychologists ha d clearly left all pretense of science and entered the domain of f aith. It was indeed a creed of humanism, and it was most definit ely in opposition to the creed of the cross. However, the other mystery creed--the creed of the pyramid--had an ope n door through which to pass. Not surprisingly, a number of the founders of humanistic psychology had their own exp eriences which took them into the cosmic humanism of transpersonal psychology. Maslow inaugurated transpersonal psychology by making popular the idea that human consciousness could be the link between man and the fundamental realities of the un iverse. He was deeply into oriental metaphysics, even coaut horing a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"book with Zen adept D.Z. Suzuki. Maslow pointed tow ard Buddha constantly. Carl Rogers crossed a different ba rrier. Prior to his wife's death, he tried spiritism. Tod ay we would call it channeling. The spirit that addressed Carl Rogers spoke to him in the language of a nondirective ther apist. It seemed the guru of unhooking the debilitating effec t of the conscience was feeling a few pangs himself. He had had an affair on the side and needed positive reinforcemen t (forgiveness, if you like) from his wife. The spir it, claiming to be Ruth, told Carl: \"Enjoy, Carl, enjoy! Be free! Be free!\" These words certainly anticipated the permissive creed of Indian guru Acharya Rajneesh. Here was a form of spiritual ity without the inhibiting moral influences of biblical faith. Indeed, it had arrived just in the nick of time. When Carl Roge rs wrote A Way of Being, he could say: \"I now consider it pos sible that each of us is a continuing spiritual essence lastin g over time, and occasionally incarnated in a human body\" (p. 17 7). Psychology had just fused with the faith of its cho ice, Eastern mysticism. It would now be hard for this growing b ranch of psychology to be neutral to other faiths and tradit ions. By the late seventies large gatherings of trans personal psychologists, representing the wave of the future, met in major cities across the United States. Harvard-trained p sychologist Dr. William Kirk Kilpatrick attended the Fifth Inte rnational Conference of Transpersonal Psychology in 1979. He came, he saw, and he was concerned. In a brilliant essay in his book The Emperor's New Clothes entitled \"The Brahmin in th e Bahamas,\" Dr. Kilpatrick described a group who used the respectability of science to wear the ochre robes o f the priesthood of a new mystery religion. Swami Muktananda, whom I had met nine years ea rlier in India, graced the convention as the guest of honor. He was one of India's preeminent \"Shakti-Pat\" and kriya po wer yogis who claimed to be fully self-actualized into God-co nsciousness. He had attained what Maslow anticipated was at the top of his scale of consciousness. Muktananda was the living example, the proof of cosmic consciousness. Psycho logists"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"could touch him and hear him. He was also the form er guru of Werner Erhard and Da Free John, among many others. Psychology's most recent progeny had fully ent ered the New Age. At the conference, as Kilpatrick describe s, were cowbells from India, pamphlets from a Tibetan monas tery, polarity charts on the wall, mantra meditation bead s for sale, and so on. The theme of the annual conference was \"The Nature of Reality.\" Reincarnation was taken for grant ed. Past-life recall through regressive hypnosis was a hot topic. Now one's problems could be explained by a radical new viewpoint: Problems today stemmed from events in fo rmer lives. The Hindu concept for this is past karma. And now twentieth-century psychologists were learning how to unearth this esoteric information from past lives by regressive hypnosis. Everything could be viewed as a learning experience of the self--from life to life--on up the scale of conscio usness to godhood. The transpersonal psychologists were a legitim ate branch of the American Psychological Association and by fa r their fastest-growing branch. They had the following sem inars at their fifth annual conference: \"Shamanic and Spirit ist Modes of Healing,\" \"The Tibetan Image of Reality,\" \"Ancien t Indian Concepts of Sex and Love,\" \"Siddha Meditation,\" \"Liv ing Tao,\" \"Archetypal Stages of the Great Round,\" \"Evolu tion of a Yogi Trip to Awareness,\" \"Kundalini Awakening and Spiritual Emergency,\" and \"Aikido as a Spiritual Discipline.\" William Kilpatrick relates an encounter of the transpersonal variety among psychologist professionals at the conference. At the time he was reading a book enti tled Profound Simplicity. The psychologist who wrote the book re lates the following theories that are consonant with Eastern thinking: * There are no accidents. * Events occur because we choose them to occur. * Every death is a suicide. * A rape \"victim\" is choosing to be raped. * Social minorities are oppressed only if they allow themselves to be put in a position they call oppression."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" One of the psychologists at the conference com mented that it was a great book. He too was in the business of past-life therapy. Kilpatrick was not so sure. He relates: I asked if he thought there was anything of va lue in the Western tradition or in Christianity. Christianity, he explained with an amused smile, mak es people feel guilty; guilt is a crippling emotion. The others at the table nodded assent, and the psycholo gist settled comfortably back in his chair. It was an open and shut case.1 To this enlightened crowd, reincarnation settl ed the problem of evil, the problem of suffering, and the problem of life's victims, such as the girl born crippled. By this ne w view, everyone gets what he deserves, what he wishes for. It's just that some people are not very good at wishing. The crippled girl's present sufferings stem from her past life. She is now getting what she deserves for failing to make the r ight choices in former lives. It is her own fault.2 One psychologist observed: \"You choose everyth ing that happens to you, and you pretty much get what you de serve.\" He had learned this at an est seminar. At this poi nt, his wife, a social worker, added that the same ideas were corro borated by the Seth journals. Kilpatrick responded that this is the most gui lt-provoking scheme he had ever heard. \"You're telling this cri ppled girl, in effect, that she has no one to blame for her han dicap but herself.\"3 He might have also noted that she cannot even remember what she did in the first place to deserve such a condition (a statistical microfraction even claim t o have past-life recall, which itself is far from being beyond the r ealm of dream material). If you cannot remember what you d id to deserve punishment, it is a wasted and cruel lesson . It is like punishing a dog a month after it did something. It howls and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"cringes in ignorance. The dog's suffering is futil e since it cannot connect what it did to deserve punishment, n or will it learn its intended lesson. So too with us and the hypothetical mistake we made 20 million years ago. To make it f air, all of us should remember millions of past lives for these le ssons to make sense, whether we are mongoloids or millionair es. As one Indian critic of the East told Kilpatri ck later, \"Being a Hindu means never having to say you're sorry.\" Sh e noted it was a doctrine that left India's caste system uncha nged for millennia in a land groaning under travail. Now In dia's philosophy had become the darling of Third and Four th Force psychology. To quote \"The Brahmin in the Bahamas\" ab out the crippled girl, \"She's only getting what she des erves.\"4 Freud, who had declared God irrelevant, was now as dead as a fossil to the psychologists of the late 1970's . And Jung, Freud's rival, was now the favored figurehead of ps ychology. The search for the self had led the way to the over self, the Atma/Paramatma of Hinduism. Alan Watt's book The S upreme Identity had anticipated this fusion. And now we h ad living examples of psychologists who had turned into holy men. One of them was Ram Dass, the former Doctor Richard A lpert, Harvard psychologist. He had gone to India and fou nd his guru and a new name. Today he speaks at many trans personal and New Age gatherings. Alpert had watched Skinner and other behaviorists; he had also done his psycho analytic stint, and found them all wanting--indeed, bankrupt . In the end he looked east to the watering hole of India. Perhaps Ram Dass (Sanskrit for \"the Servant of Ram\") would be th e first Westerner to become the new man of Carl Rogers. Tim e would tell. But what cannot be denied is the current growi ng army of transpersonal therapists, moving across the land fr om seminars to conventions, spreading the good news. They are a growing storm. They call themselves the Fourth For ce psychologists, after the Third Force of humanistic psychology. Maybe they should just call themselves The Force as their wheels of influence spread through society."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Transpersonal psychology has embraced the New Age views that were stated at the beginning of this cha pter. Now this core of beliefs will be repeated. If the self is God, then once it is unleashed, it can control reality. Inde ed, this God-self can remake the world by its own power. Th e more minds that awaken and tap this reality, the faster the pl anetary change will occur. At a certain critical mass, the process Will become a millennial explosion.

Why? Because they live in a competitive environment that is full of peer pressure, the need for corporate approval and advancement, as well as one of the deepest human needs: the need for financial security. The latter is a survival need. Upon it rests the family. For these reasons there is considerabl e stress in the workplace. There are fears of failure, fears of mi ssing a promotion, insecurities about job stability, and so on. This stress is a gauge of the power the workplace has over live s. When employees are told to attend a seminar or undergo further training, they are indeed a captive and vul nerable audience. Their careers and their very livelihoods are at stake. They have conformed to get where they are, and they will continue to conform to get ahead. If the semi nars they attend employ the very psychotechnologies that have emerged from breakthroughs in behavior shaping over the las t decade or two, this audience becomes very malleable indeed . They are willing and eager to believe, and they do belie ve, for it is in their best interests to believe. But what is it tha t they are to believe? Those who shape beliefs in the marketplace hav e formidable power. In the last few years The Wall Street Journ al and The New York Times have begun to write about an eme rging trend in corporate America. In the July 24, 1987, issue of The Wall Street journal, Peter Waldman described the trend in a headline article: Abuzz with buzzwords, corporate America has launched one of the most concerted efforts ever t o change the attitudes and values of workers.

Waldman cites numerous examples, among them th e Krone seminars put on by Pacific Bell that would ultimatel y cost 30 million dollars and either come out of the ratepaye rs' or stockholders' pocketbooks. Publicity brought the p rogram under scrutiny: ... Pacific Telesis (Pac Bell) began a series o f quarterly two-day training seminars for its 67,00 0 workers to give them a common purpose and common approach to their work. To foster greater creativity, for example, tra iners discussed different \"levels\" of thought, energy, and behavior. (In ascending order, the six levels of energy were described as automatic, sensitive, conscious , creative, unitive, and transcendent.) That sessio n, loosely based on the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, an early 20th century Russian mystic, was supposed to inspire more analytical thinking among employees. In it, workers broke into groups to discuss issue s like the difference between \"knowledge\" and \"understanding.\" . . . Shortly after the program began, workers were quoted in articles about the trainin g in local newspapers as saying that the workshops smacked of mind control, Eastern mysticism, and coercion. \"Dissenters are referred to as 'roadblocks' or having 'Bell-Shaped Heads' \" by supporters of the training, wrote one company employee, in response to a California Public Utilities Commission survey on the sessions.1 Fortune magazine on November 23, 1987, had a f eature"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"article on New Age corporate seminars and workshops . One is called MSIA and pronounced \"Messiah\" and is led by Mystic Traveler Consciousness in the person of John- Roger. It is an offshoot of John Hanley's Lifespring, another potent New Age consciousness-raising group that has also i nvaded the business world as well as the military establis hment. One observer notes in the Fortune article: \"It 's one thing if an individual walks in off the street and signs up for a course, but quite another if your boss sends you. Then the re's a level of coercion. Does my boss have the right to put me through training that conflicts with my religion and world view?\"2 Some protest at what seems forced vulnerability. One of the more potent New Age seminars/worksh ops was once called est, then out of it came The Forum. Fr om out of that has come a franchise called Trans Tech or T ransformational Technologies. The Forum is one of hundreds of seminars, but we will look at it as a case in point . The man behind it is not new to New Age seminars. He is Werner Er hard, who invented est (Erhard Seminars Training) which in th e 1970's had 500,000 people who passed through the course. Erhard has commented that it is interesting that most of t hese half million graduates are today holding positions in co rporate America. They are also loyal converts willing to o pen the doors of their companies to Trans Tech and its affi liates. How did est philosophy come about? Through mys tical peak experiences that Werner Erhard underwent. Whe n I was in India under Sai Baba, Werner Erhard made several trips to India to sit under Swami Muktananda, the power yogi whose headquarters were in Ganeshpur, near Bombay. Muktan anda came to America on one occasion by invitation from Werner Erhard, who gave large contributions to the guru. Erhard used to boast that Muktananda hit him with a power touch on the third eye, Shakti-Pat, giving him an enlightenm ent experience. But as his success with est grew, Erhard went more a nd more on his own and became a self-styled guru. Lik e Bubba Free John, another American ex-Muktananda disciple, Erhard left the guru's fold claiming equality of conscious ness with"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the Indian power yogi, but some of Muktananda's tec hniques-- such as psychically disemboweling the chelas or pupils--have appeared in the est seminars. In the est seminars, people were undone and sh ocked as barriers were broken. Few of them had anything in their field of experience to prepare them for the barrier-break ing ruthlessness, albeit watered down and with a Wester n slant, that came out of the tradition of Indian Kriya Shakti-Pa t yoga. Muktananda had been on the receiving end of this fr om his own guru, Avadhut Nityananda, the famous Siddha Gur u or power yogi. Some of these same techniques can also be found in the Rajneesh camp. The explanation is simple: To find the overself, the false identity that keeps us from div ine realization--known as the ego or self with a small \"s\"--must be destroyed. The \"proof\" that the method works is se en in the many crisis and transformational experiences that a ccompany these techniques. This is straight Vedanta, nothin g else. The leaders in est seminars were dictatorial. Picture a lady whispering to a leader for permission to go to the bathroom. She is publicly railed at with shocking obscenities and told to hold her bladder. She is then made to take part in a psychodrama before 500 people. You bet she will have a transformational experience. She will be broken do wn. There will be real tears, real horror, and real peak experienc es. John Bode of The Chicago Tribune writes about Th e Forum and est and interviews former est graduates to see if The Forum is any different. First of all est: Steve Bro wn claimed that est training gave him new insights, but thinks est robs people of their identity. Brown is quoted as saying , \"The control Werner exercises over his followers is real ly frightening.\" Suzanne Perkins, a former est worker, said that dur ing her est training she was deprived of food and sleep by confrontational, abusive trainers. \"They broke dow n my moral and emotional standards,\" said Perkins. \"They said it was all right to sleep with your friend's husband because y ou can create the feeling of being guilty or feeling fine. You are your own God.\"3 Such was est."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The est teaching was that people had \"total re sponsibility\" for creating reality and had to claim that they had created everything in their lives, positive and negative. Now The Forum uses the word \"choice.\" People choose things to happen. They formulate life scripts. The Forum do es not have est's guided fantasies preceded by body-relaxa tion techniques, and the old \"rules\" are now \"suggestion s.\" But people are still encouraged to reveal themselves on the mo st intimate levels in order to free themselves from the need of protecting their images and the fear of being stigmatized. Wi th this \"sharing\" comes a breakdown of personal autonomy. Participants are still abused by leaders, and the est exercises known as \"Truth Process,\" \"Fear Process,\" and \"Danger Pro cess,\" are carried over into The Forum. In essence, The Forum has been repackaged for business and is sleeker, more professional, and milder, but its philosophy and central techniques are the same as est--and lit tle wonder if you learn how the founder has repackaged his own identity while remaining the same. What is hard to imagine is that the Fortune 500 companies that have spent mill ions to be trained by The Forum would outlay that sort of capi tal with so little scrutiny--or worse, they don't care for othe r reasons. What companies has The Forum and Trans Tech trained ? Fortune magazine in its November 23, 1987 issue in an article entitled \"Trying to Bend Managers' Minds,\" mentions Allstate and Sears, General Dynamics, the Federal A viation Administration, IBM, Boeing Aerospace, and Lockheed , among others. Image magazine, October 12, 1986 (p. 25), quotes Werner Erhard's partner, Jim Selman, as saying that Trans Tech franchises have made inroads in 100 of the For tune 500 companies including Ford, TRW, General Electric, McDonald's, Manville, and RCA, plus eight federal age ncies, the Justice Department, NASA, and The White House. Aga in, who is Werner Erhard and what kind of experience co uld launch him into having this wide-ranging effect? Mark Dowie in his article \"The Transformation Game\" in Image magazine (Oct. 12, 1986, p. 24), reveals the moment of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"change for Werner Erhard: His first major metamorphosis occurred somewhere between Corte Madera and the Golden Gate Bridge one morning in 1971 while commuting to work at an encyclopedia company, when the wisdom of Est was suddenly revealed to him. \"I realized that I knew nothing,\" he later recalled of that magic moment. \"In the next instant, I realized tha t I knew everything ... Suddenly I held all the information, the content of my life, in a new way, from a new mode, a new context.\" Earlier in life, Erhard had made less lucrativ e leaps, transforming himself from Philadelphia used car salesman Jack Rosenberg to San Francisco encyclopedia peddler Jack Frost ... The second big transformation in his life began about the time his wife of 24 years filed for divorce. John Bode in his Chicago Tribune article mentio ned that Jack Rosenberg \"married at 18, but abandoned his wife and four children in the early '60s and ran away to Californi a with another woman. To conceal his identity, he changed his name to Werner Erhard, and for the next 13 years worked selling used cars, correspondence courses, and encyclopedia s. (His own biographer, referring to this period, calls Erh ard 'a liar, an impostor, a rogue.') In the meantime, he began t o explore the then emerging human potential movement, studyin g Zen Buddhism and hypnosis, taking courses from Dale Carnegie, Scientology, and California's Esalen Instit ute.\" It is interesting that he has become one of the gurus of New Age business workshops and commands millions of dollars --an interesting foundation stone on which to build the New Age.

The reality of influence in the schoolroom spurred John Dewey, the father of American progressive public ed ucation, to write My Pedagogic Creed.

But John Dewey's ideas did not just come out o f a vacuum. He was influenced by an insider group of intellectu als in England known as the Fabian Socialists. Dewey was an American ally of this clique. It is important to glimpse th e Fabian agenda of gradualist global penetration and their v iews of using education as a tool of influence in this proc ess. THE FABIANS OF ENGLAND AND THEIR AGENDA The Bloomsbury Fabians of London were an elite intelligentsia of world socialists who envisioned a n end to war and poverty by a united world order dedicated to the id eals of socialistic humanism. The Fabian Socialists formed within a year of the death of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Karl Marx, who died in London. They were captivate d by Marx and Darwin. Dewey was one of the first of the liberal elite in America to embrace their beliefs. He late r signed The Humanist Manifesto. His meetings with key leaders of the British Fabian society allowed Dewey to incorporate their ideas of socialist penetration in their mutual educ ational agenda. The League for Industrial Democracy (which before 1921 was the Intercollegiate Socialist Society) of which Dewey was president in 1938-39 as well as honorary presid ent for the next 13 years, was one of America's cousins to the British Fabian Society. Unlike Marxists, who advocated bloody revoluti on for world socialism, the Fabian Socialists of Britain ad vocated a more gradualist path to socialistic globalism. The plan of these early one-worlders was to use intellectual pe netration, from the top of the pyramid down, into key areas of influence on society. Elite minds were to influence and chan ge the social order. Their symbol was the slow-moving tur tle which would pass the sleeping rabbit. Bertrand Russell ref erred to the Bloomsbury group as a mutual admiration society. But they penetrated one major field after another--lite rature, politics, education, science, and the media--and ha d some of the most renowned figures in the world. English Fabians such as H. G. Wells, Rupert Broo ke, Aldous Huxley, George Bernard Shaw, G.M. Trevelyan, Lord Haldane, Arnold Toynbee, Sir Julian Huxley, Virgini a Woolf, Arnold Bennett, Rebecca West, E.M. Forster, J.B. Pries tly, and other similar luminaries greatly influenced the public mind and the academy through literature, letters, a nd the laboratory. Oxford and Cambridge became central rec ruiting grounds. One recalls the Fabians at Cambridge Unive rsity in the film Chariots of Fire, with their large banner n ext to the Gilbert and Sullivan Club. One of the most effective Fabians was famed Cam bridge University economist John Maynard Keynes who turned Harvard on its ears when he came and charmed the st udents "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"and faculty with his socialist economics. Keynes s aid that the state should guarantee welfare for all, that it sho uld provide guaranteed employment through government programs, and that all of this could be financed by his revolutio nary scheme. How? By supreme Keynesian alchemy--that of tur ning paper into gold! The gold standard could be dropped for paper currency, then deficit spending through gover nment loans would open up a money vault of endless supply . Indeed, it was a \"New Deal,\" to use the Roosevelt expressio n--maybe too good a deal to be true. Another Fabian to hit Harvard was Harold Laski , who with avowed socialist Lord Haldane eventually started th e London School of Economics. He later obtained an instruct orship at Harvard in 1915 through invitation of Felix Frankfu rter, Byrnes Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School. Frankfurter became Laski's closest friend. During the four yea rs Harold Laski taught at Harvard, he edited the Harvard Lazy Review, inoculating the prestigious publication with social ist ideas. The Harvard Law School eventually adopted a sociali st leaning through its Fabian liaison. justice Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court, a member of the Harvard faculty, as w ell as his former pupil, justice Louis Brandeis, also a Sup reme Court judge, kept a line of communication going with their Fabian friends in England. This was important for the agenda of penetration. Laski, for 25 years, remained an honored house guest of Supreme Court justice Frankfurter, especially when t he latter was a member of Roosevelt's New Deal brain trust. By that era, Harold Laski was chairman of the Fabian Societ y of Britain (from 1946 to 1948). Employing Fabian gradu alism, one of the most long-range and penetrating legal st atements that Frankfurter ever made was that \"through the us e of due process the justices could read their own economic and social views into the neutral language of the Constitution.\"2 Thi s statement has spelled out the very agenda adopted by lawyers in dismantling the U.S. Constitution. This Trojan hor se rolled through the Fabian doorway right into the U.S. Supr eme"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Court and has affected legal decisions across Americ a. Meanwhile, the far-ranging effects of the Bloom sbury group is seen in England today after its decades of socialist penetration. The Fabians started England's influen tial labor party and never looked back. Edwardian England and the era of the aristocracy is no more. A more plebian Engl and has replaced it, though it has used those from the inte llectual aristocracy to bring this about. The glamor of the left remains a compelling mystery as it seduces bright and ambit ious university youth, artists, and assorted aspiring in tellectuals. THE TROJAN HORSE OF PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION John Dewey, who remained close with Fabian lea ders, had his own circle of academic disciples at Columbia Uni versity, especially Kilpatrick and Counts, who influenced tex tbooks and school curricula for decades. Through Dewey's influence, Harold Laski, right before becoming chairman of the British Fabian Society, lectured at Columbia Teacher' s College for a semester in 1939 amidst John Dewey's best and brightest disciples. What did all this mean for American public edu cation? Columbia Teacher's College influenced other graduate schools and colleges of education. Before too long, progres sive education-- Dewey's tool for reshaping America--was a public school reality all across America. Dewey knew that to penetrate the existing soci al order a united front of educators, who embodied the new vie wpoint, needed to emerge from graduate schools. These teac hers of teachers would then influence future teachers. Amo ng the new views was a national self-criticism that spurne d narrow patriotism for a broader globalism. At the same ti me all traditional values were to be questioned, from pare ntal authority to the validity of established religion. Rather than equipping the child to handle the d emanding academic and moral standards of the old order, with its"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"McGuffey Reader and its implicit moral virtues, Dewe y's progressive education considered behavior-shaping a s its highest educational priority. \"Socialization\" was now defined as a type of learning at least equal to traditional learning. Now the old morals and ethics could be replaced by situ ational ethics or \"values clarification.\" Reading, writing, and arithmetic took a backseat to an array of experimental program s such as \"sensitivity training.\" The virtues of hard work were replaced by new permissive standards that would pas s a failing child rather than \"harm\" him by labeling hi m a failure. Total equality was the new ideal: It would jealousl y guard against too much excellence in any child that might show others to be less endowed, thus implying that abili ties were unevenly distributed. FROM PROGRESSIVE TO NEW AGE EDUCATION Since Dewey's time, public school programs hav e been behavior-shaping children without even pretending t o impart useful skills or academic knowledge. \"Confluent edu cation\" is a recent example. One contributor to this was t he late Dr. Beverly Galyean. Galyean's beliefs are part of her program. In 1981 she said: Once we begin to see that we are all God, that we all have the attributes of God, then I think the wh ole purpose of human life is to reown the Godlikeness within us; the perfect love, the perfect wisdom, th e perfect understanding, the perfect intelligence, an d when we do that, we create back to that old, that essential oneness which is consciousness.3 Scores of children, starting from Los Angeles and moving across the country, have been affected by Dr. Galye an's approach. Picture first graders being made to lie down on the floor of their classrooms while being told to relax and then visualize such \"positive\" things as the sun radiati ng within"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"them. They picture the light of the sun filling th eir entire being. Then the teacher tells them: \"You are inwar dly perfect and contain all the wisdom of the universe within yourselves.\" First graders are introduced to spirit guides in the Galyean approach, although as she remarked at a ple nary session at the conference entitled Education in the 80's, \"Of course we don't call them that in the public school s. We call them imaginary guides.\"4 The Supreme Court, although banning prayer, has no laws against simple classroom exercises in visualization which are seen as merely creative exercises expanding the pup il's imaginative and creative potential. Besides, positi ve affirmations such as, \"You contain the wisdom of the universe,\" might elevate the pupil's self-esteem. Knowing educators argue that first graders certainly won't take this too serious ly. The legal system has agreed, winked, and looked the other way . Lawyers and not professors of philosophy are being asked whether there are issues of ontology and metaphysics beneat h such exercises and \"affirmations.\" An Ivy League philoso phy professor like Allan Bloom, who wrote The Closing of the American Mind, or my old mentor at Princeton, Dr. Diogenes A llen, could see through this issue in a fraction of a sec ond. But then again, they do not write the laws of the land or go vern public school curricula, which is very convenient for educ ators with a particular agenda. In 1984, the U.S. Department of Education cond ucted hearings to gauge public opinion and propose regula tions regarding the implementation of \"The Protection of Pupil Right s Amendment\" otherwise known as the Hatch Amendment. Testimonials that went on record across the country consistently wove a pattern of classroom activities that reveale d the new agenda was well under way. \"Values clarification\" had been included and surpassed. Earlier door openers like MACOS, for fifth graders in the 1970's, introduced open di scussion of what were once taboo topics in the schoolroom su ch as genocide, homosexuality, and euthanasia. Teachers could talk about alternate sexualities with liberal cando r, while"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"dissenting voices with old-fashioned views could be easily quashed by majority consensus. This door opened so widely that by 1988 parents of kindergartners in Marin Cou nty learned that the latest sex education programs requ ired their young children to learn slang terms for body parts, including genitals. According to The San Francisco Chronicle (April 5, 1988, p. A2), kids in lower primary grades were als o to explore the meaning of sexual fantasy and discuss alternate lifestyles. In the 1984 hearings, one witness displayed a future studies publication, produced with support from the Nationa l Institute of Education. It was entitled Future Stu dies in the Kindergarten Through Twelve Curriculum by John D. Ha as, and it recommended how teachers might subtly introduce cer tain key topics into the classroom such as: fertility co ntrol, contraceptives, abortion, family planning, women's liberation, euthanasia, New Age consciousness, mysticism, ESP, new religions, changing older religions, guaranteed inc ome, and so on. These issues had become hot stuff in many c lassrooms anyway. But how might the system reach down into th e lower elementary school grades to expedite the process of preparing children for the new order? There was a time when Johnny was happy to be a boy and Susan was happy to be a girl. Now the kids of the eighties, with the help of the experts, believe in the new my th of androgyny. A case in point is the Title IX-funded Sex Equity Program, or the Women's Educational Equity Act Prog ram tested in five counties across the United States as test sites. The plan is to change the thinking patterns of Amer ica's children, starting with the kids in these five coun ties who have acted as guinea pigs for the greater national experiment. What happens in classrooms under this program? On March 13, 1984, in Seattle, Washington, at the official proceedings before the U.S. Department of Education , one observer described this program--the Sex Equity fie ld experiment--in Lincoln County, Oregon: One of the demonstrations was in a 1st grade r oom."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The students each had two naked paper dolls, one ma le, the other female. They were asked to dress the dol ls in work clothing to show that both genders could work at any job. The thing I found interesting was there were n o dresses. All clothing was male oriented. Then the teacher h ad the students sit in a circle while she pulled out objec ts from a sack, like a pancake turner or a tape measure. She asked, \"Who uses this, mom or dad?\" If the student did not answer the way she had wanted, she would say, \"Well, who else uses this?\" Finally, one little boy raised his hand and said, \"I don't care. Men ought to be doctors, and ladies nurses.\" The teacher then asked how many students agree d with the little boy. By the tone of her voice, they knew no one should raise a hand, so no one did. The little boy was so humiliated by the peer pressure and class manipu lation by the teacher that he started to cry. This is cla ssic of the type of discrimination, bias, stereotyping, and harassment that this program has included. As I reviewed different manuals that teachers were using in the schools... questions on family values, self-analysis, opposite role-playing, unisex ideas, discussion of family roles in students' homes, and sex-role va lues were discussed. One book said, \"'Students are no l onger to be called helpers, or boys and girls, or student s, but WORKERS\" (a part of the Socialist lexicon). Another book showed only pictures of opposites to traditional roles, such as the father feeding baby, or mother holding a firehose in her \"fireperson\" job. The children didn't realize they were being fed only on e side of the picture. ... Our school district received federal funds to teach \"Sex Equity.\". . . The teaching is firmly intact in the system after five years of funding. Teachers are r equired to attend sex equity workshops sponsored by Northwest Regional Laboratory in Portland, which received fede ral"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"funds. They provide resource material and teachers . I discovered there was no set curriculum. Tea chers chose what to teach from several manuals. They wer e to integrate the teaching into the entire day's classe s. Women were really exalted in all the material I viewed, w hile male minorities were almost ignored. The goal of t he Sex Equity program was to eliminate traditional roles o f male and female. Clearly the above is a behavior-shaping program that uses the classroom as a laboratory under the cloak of ed ucation. More and more, the classroom has become a test site for human guinea pigs. Dr. Benjamin Bloom, the father of mastery learning, in his recent book, All Our Childr en Learning, states, \"The purpose of education is to change the thoughts, feelings, and actions of students.\" Again and again two names keep appearing in this effort of changing thoughts and feelings: Sidney Simon, the \"expert\" who introduced values clarification, and Lawrence Kohlberg, who introduce d moral reasoning. Both programs annihilate traditional va lues. Again, the Fabian theme emerges: A handful of \"experts,\" i n this case psychologists, presume their views upon millio ns with impunity. They arrogantly become founts of wisdom about the family, about sexuality, and about ultimate rea lity. In a sweep they can destroy the student's faith, beliefs , and moral system. Occasionally we learn of their handiwork. On October 9, 1987, The Los Angles Times headlined a story wit h the words: \"Alcohol Used by 45% of 7th Graders.\" That i s merely the tip of the iceberg. England might even be ahead of us in this aren a of shattering boundaries of morality. In the news recently was a book introduced by English liberal educators for childre n. The San Francisco Chronicle on March 16, 1988 in an article by Adrian Peracchio described outrage in Britain: \"It began la st year with parents' howls of outrage at the publication b y local municipal councils of Jenny Lives with Eric and Mar tin, a graphically illustrated pamphlet showing a cherubic little girl"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"smiling at her father, naked in bed with his live-i n gay lover.\" The Chronicle then reported: \"The pamphlet, pri nted with British government funds, attempted to prove that yo ung children brought up by homosexual couples could adj ust and thrive just as well as those reared in more traditi onal households. \"It appeared in local school libraries alongsi de, How to Be a Happy Homosexual, and The Children's Playbook of Sex , two other publicly financed pamphlets in which homosexual the mes were explicitly treated.\" But the values barrier is only one barrier. In breaking the New Age barrier, the Unit ed States might be ahead of England. In other testimonials before the U.S. Departme nt of Education, which were compiled from across the country in 1984 , there were numerous examples of New Age thought flo oding classrooms. Common activities involved learning how to do horoscopes, conduct seances, cast the witch's circl e, use a Ouija board, meditate, and role-play such character s as warlocks and spiritists which appeared in required readings. Wiccans (witches) and neopagans were invited on pub lic school premises to speak about their alternate view s (they do not use the word \"religions\"). Witches could now e nter where ministers were forbidden to tread, a new milestone in America's \"liberation.\" Children also partook in the visualization of invisible guides not just through the Galyean ap proach but through Silva Mind Control. They would lie on the f loor and empty their minds, invoking the invisible presences within them. In Buffalo, New York, students were required to learn Silva Mind Control and reportedly contacted the spir its of various long-deceased historical figures--a new way to study about George Washington and Lincoln! Why read about historical figures when you can invoke them from th e dead? The State of Connecticut presents a case in poi nt of how New Age curricula is creeping through the doors of the public school system. First of all, there comes the feder al grant. In the case of Connecticut, several million dollars wer e granted to develop the Connecticut Teachers' Center for Huma nistic Education. The loophole was the Department of Heal th,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Education and Welfare's allocation of 75 million do llars for the teaching of humanistic education nationwide via the 1978 amendments to the Higher Education Act, Title 5. St ratford's Board of Education initiated the first grant for one million dollars to have humanistic education taught in the Connecticut public school system, thus becoming the legal educa tion agency and employer. This was the machinery of how the door opened up. For input, the Connecticut center had a number of resources including the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studie s in Aspen, Colorado, which has a worldwide reputation. A close r source of input was the Institute for Wholistic Education in Amherst, Massachusetts, codirected by Jack Canfield and Paula Klimek, who came and led workshops at various Conne cticut Teacher's Center sponsored programs. They were feat ured in a brochure entitled \"Education in the New Age,\" a t raining program that took place in Madison, Connecticut, No vember 17-18, 1979, and sponsored by the then fully operat ional Connecticut Teacher's Center for Humanistic Education . One workshop was entitled \"Meditation and Centering in t he Classroom,\" the other was \"Guided Imagery.\" The conference \"facilitators,\" Canfield and Kli mek, had written an article for The New Age journal, Februar y 1978, entitled \"Education in the New Age,\" which essentia lly spelled out the New Age agenda for penetrating and using the public school system across the United States. Their biography in The New Age Journal stated, \"They cons ult with schools, train teachers, and have coauthored numero us books such as, The Inner Classroom: Teaching with Guided Fantasy, and Wholistic Education.\" Not surprisingly, some Connect icut parents began to take note when their children retu rned home from school with new ideas. They were quietly movi ng into the new paradigms, beyond the obsolete mind-sets of their parents' generation. It was all happening with the quiet sense of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A consortium of parents described what was happening in the classroom with the words, \"In the name of discovering their 'life purp ose,'"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"children are encouraged into trance-like states of mind where they communicate with 'guardian spirits.' The use o f Yoga exercises and mind control techniques are other exa mples of the format of this program.\"5 The media followed the footsteps of jack Canfie ld and the high-powered groups of educators and lawyers he was addressing. A Canadian journal, The Editonion journ al, on October 11, 1979, had an article by Marilyn Moysa e ntitled \"Improving Images Seen as a Key to Help.\" It report ed: Imagine more than 800 of North America's top judges, lawyers, education professors, social worke rs and just plain parents chanting an Indian mantra. Even Meyer Horowitz, University of Alberta President, sang along in the guitar-accompanied cha nt. \"What ever happened to the keynote address? I kept asking myself. Wasn't this supposed to be the big opening number of a national conference on children with learning disabilities?\" What happened, quite simply, was Jack Canfield. Director of the Institute for Wholistic Education i n Amherst, Mass.... Images, claims Dr. Canfield, can have power beyond the will of an individual when it comes to change. The article then showed how Canfield took a lea rning-disabled sixth-grade girl and had her go through guided imagery with a \"wise old woman\" up a stairway of li ght. Through this the girl discovered the meaning of lif e. The 800 lawyers and educators applauded this profound exper iment and its insight. Canfield's extremely long feature article in Th e New Age journal is packed with material, techniques, and in sights. Canfield and Klimek state that New Age education has arrived and that \"more and more teachers are exposi ng children to ways of contacting their inner wisdom and higher selves.\"6"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The coauthors diagnosed breakthroughs in the sixtie s when the educational system began to break down, saying: At the same time, an influx of spiritual teach ings from the East, combined with a new psychological perspective in the West, has resulted in a fresh lo ok at the learning process.... People everywhere are looking for a new vision, a new approach, a new paradigm of life.... A new vision is beginning to manifest.7 Much of guided imagery begins with Roberto Assa gioli's psychosynthesis. This is the creative root to reac hing the all-knowing higher self within. Canfield and Klimek's article states: Within the past five years we have also witnes sed the birth of \"transpersonal education,\" the acknowledgment of one's inner and spiritual dimensi ons, through working with such forms as dreams, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, centering, mandalas, and so forth. Now is the time to combine both of these focuses, for the New Age means integrating the soul and personality... Holistic education... views the student as being engaged in an integral process of unfoldment under the direction of his/her higher self. This process is perceived as taking place in a universe that is also constantly evolving: each of us is seen as an important part o f the larger planetary and universal evolution of con sciousness.8 There were endless pointers: \"Children of all a ges love physical exercise and seem to be particularly fasci nated with yoga: they move easily into all sorts of contortion s.... There are numerous books on yoga for children. One of ou r favorites is Be a Frog, a Bird or a Tree, by Rachel Carr (New Yor k: Doubleday).\"9"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Intimacy games are described, as are sensory awaren ess games, in which children get over inhibitions again st touching one another. \"Centering\" becomes the more acceptabl e word for meditation. \"Relaxation and centering exer cises are a fundamental process for New Age education, becaus e they provide a space for listening to the voice within.\" 10 Sufi dances are mentioned. Chanting is recommended to reach the transcend ent within. The best place to learn chanting is at workshops an d yoga retreats. Resources listed are: Jewels from the Eas t and Spiritual Nation by the Khalsa String Band as well as Baba Ram D ass' Love, Serve, and Remember. One chanting method is c alled \"seed planting\" (in India we used to call them Bija mantras) in order to plant the chants deep into the consciousne ss. It is a group event with one child sitting in the middle of the room. They take turns sitting in the middle.11 Then there are meditation techniques that use media ideas. Canfield observes: A wonderful way to do this, we have found, is to use the tools the media are providing. An example might be to ask, \"What's this thing called The Forc e in Star Wars? How does Luke communicate with it? How does it help him?\" The next question is, \"Well, would you like to have this kind of experience?\" (The answer is always an overwhelming \"Yes!\") \"Well, we can try this and see what happens. There are some ground rules you will need to follow.\" At this point the kids are more than ready. The media has done a lot of the work for US.12 Canfield and Klimek conclude their extensive ar ticle with some telling insights regarding children of the New Age. They no doubt share these same insights in their co ast-to-coast teacher training seminars. They conclude:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" We believe that guided imagery is a key to fin ding out what is in the consciousness of New Age children.... Children are so close to spirit if we only allow room for their process to emerge. We celebrate to fantasize what is in store for all of us.... Additional emphases in the transpersonal dimension are using nature as teacher, and aligning and communicating with the other kingdoms such as the elemental and devic* realms ... working with children's psychic capacities (such as seeing auras ); working with astrological charts.... The souls that are presently incarnating seem to be very special.1 3 The coauthors end their article on education i n the New Age with the words: \"We must not get caught in the trap of putting them into developmental models which will s oon be irrelevant.... The only requirement is to provide a space and an environment where these beautiful young spirits can open up and allow their wisdom to be seen.\"14 *The term Devic is a Vedantic Sanskrit word for the realm of the gods. The complete Sanskrit term is Deva Loka. The present generation of latchkey kids, whose parents are busy with dual careers, operates almost unsupervise d in a permissive world. They are indeed a lonely and cap tive audience, ready to sponge up the new agenda. As former Yale professor Allan Bloom observes in his bestseller, ea ch succeeding group entering college from public schoo l comes less equipped to deal with the university world--an inde x of a tragic and costly experiment. Bloom says they are c oming out of the educational experiment \"impoverished.\" High school \"grads\" of the 1980's come out sem iliterate, passive, hedonistic, as they live for the moment, h ave no goals, no concept of history, no discipline, no rea l mental furniture, no sense of what is noble or good.

It is surprising how many groups have an obsessive preocc upation with Christ and with hammering him into place. It se ems they feel a need to have his sanction, as though th eir consciences cannot rest until they have somehow inc luded him into their beliefs. But these same groups insist on taking Christ t o the make-up artists and tampering with his attire. What they ne ed is a broad-minded, nonjudgmental, cosmic Christ. Somehow he must be unearthed from history or rediscovered; a Ch rist who sanctions all paths as leading to God, who is not e xclusive or judgmental, who in fact teaches the ancient mystery religions of the divine within, that spark of divinity within all men waiting to be awakened. This cosmic Christ is to be one facet of the ca pstone atop the massive pyramid now being built.

But only c ertain \"advanced\" teachers will know these hidden meanings --a closed union of mystics who will appear before the world, as they did during the ancient era of the Gnostics and mystery religions. The new teachers will announce, as some alread y have, that these higher teachings have been hidden and su ppressed by the church--that they were quashed at the ancien t councils, such as Nicea and Constantinople.

These teachers will show that, instead, the historic church has become a divisive obstacle that is not tolerant of all paths. It obstructs the smooth flow of this effort at world unity. But now it is time for a universal creed. Plan etary needs demand it. A universal, nonoffensive creed will be a major element in providing so that the world might be one .

For histori cal accuracy, it must be observed that this mystery Chri st is far from the Jesus who hurled accusations at the Sanhedrin, overturned the tables of the money changers, and bodily rose from the dead.

The mystery Christ is a different Christ altogether from the New Testament Ch rist, and he emerges from countless peripheral sources--e xcept from the canon of the New Testament. From this seal ed canon he cannot emerge, for the early manuscripts and aut ographs don't breathe a word about this other cosmic Christ. This presents a problem which must be addresse d. It must be dealt with from all sides in a pincer movement, logistically and strategically. It is a little like the problem of the Marxist who wishes to change the common understanding of th e United States Constitution so that a gradualist skew ing of word meaning can enable a socialistic interpretatio n of words whose intended meanings in the original were clearl y different. He must deal with language manipulatively. On one level, it is a problem of hermeneutics and exegesis. In the case of the Bible, if you can editorially can cel out certain words and phrases, or invent new contexts s urrounding statements, you can skew the entire meaning of a ma jor passage. Literal realities can be conveniently thru st into a symbolical context. Paul Tillich did this all the t ime. Then you can look for \"Jungian\" meanings behind ordinary eve nts as these moments in history are doubted and now ascrib ed to being symbolic. Academic criticism provides this mo de of attack. You begin by absolute doubt. You doubt the books and parchments; you doubt the writers and their motives . You throw it all away and defy the canon to prove itsel f to you first. Dates are doubted, methods of copying are doubted, and so on. And indeed here we have the German and continen tal schools of biblical criticism: redactive, historica l, and form criticisms. Academic criticism turns out to be a mo st effective means of frontal assault on the historic Christian f aith. It is one way to get Christ to the make-up artist and extr act his prophetic and judgmental aspects that so grate agai nst the modern tempo.

Once conformity-minded students ta ke the cue that this is the only acceptable position among their fellow students and academic peers, it is a rare in dividual who will dare to step out of line. As someone said, the y have come up with an emasculated Christ. This Christ of academia is such a conciliator that he loses ground at every strategy meeting in which he is dis cussed. These days he is a champion of the lesbian/gay cauc us and radical feminists. He is even pro-sodomy--as long a s it is \"responsible,\" \"caring,\" and \"safe\" sex among \"pers ons of alternate sexual preferences.\" This pallid inventio n of the academy is ready to fall right into line with the m ystery Christ of the New Age. It is a rare faculty member who wil l risk tenure to stand against this wave. Each faculty mem ber can grin knowingly--these doctors of knowledge--as they add the emperor's new clothes to their already consider able collection of vestments and tassels. They can still walk in ponderous academic lines with furrowed brows, borro wing from their lineage of intellectual profundity, whil e passing on the mantle to those whom they choose. Individual s, especially brilliant \"individualists,\" who differ with their a genda are instantly \"marked\" for opposition. By conformity in the academy, Christ has been remade in a few generations . This is a remarkable pincer movement indeed--one of pondero us faces and furrowed brows, ambition, peer pressure, personal agendas in some and moral cowardice in others. But there is an equally effective pincer movem ent composed of dizzyingly optimistic faces. These are the ones in touch with the cosmic Christ, and the messages that are coming in are compelling. Hundreds of thousands who attend New Age conferences and millions reading New Age books are feeling \"confirmed\" by these messages. En ter the cosmic Christ. THE COSMIC CHRIST"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" Though Edgar Cayce died in 1945, the books concernin g this famous channeler still flood bookstores. They are top sellers among Bantam's \"New Age\" paperback series. Ca yce spent years going into trances in which he claimed to gain access to the hall of records of the cosmic mind--b etter known as the Akashic records. He had the look and bearing of a simple Bible Belt Christian. His demeanor of kindly in nocence made him believable. For years all he did was diagn ose physical illnesses in this trance state. Even if th e subject were halfway across America, the impersonal \"we\" voice w ould almost always accurately diagnose the problem of a subject whom he had never met, giving the method of cure. O ne day a wealthy Jewish theosophist in the Midwest paid fo r his trance time, but then started asking the Akashic mi nd questions concerning the nature of ultimate reality. The star tling revelations that came through confused and even fri ghtened Edgar Cayce. When he woke out of a trance he never r emembered anything, nor had he \"met\" the \"voice\" that worked through his body, using it as a medium. When this g roundbreaking channeler heard what he had said in his first nonmedical reading, he was almost undone, for he wa s revealing a cosmos identical to that of the theosop hists, mystics, and Hindus. The loving personal God whom Edgar Cayce had re ad about in the Bible as a child turned out to be a \"my th of the dualistic mind.\" What Cayce's channeling revealed wa s the impersonal godhead, like an infinite ocean of consc iousness, without attributes, yet composed of and beyond all qualities and forms of being. The cosmos was made not ex nihi lo, out of nothing, but out of God. The pantheistic system was therefore the true one after all. Along with reincarnation came the inevitable l aw of karma, the Akashic records simply being the records of all prior events and past lives. Cayce began to give \"life rea dings\" of past lives. Presto! What came out were accounts of Atlantis, the occult civilization that blew itself up. Now we learn that"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"these same \"evolved\" souls who had perished in Atla ntis were streaming into rebirth on \"the earth plane.\" T hough Cayce died in the forties, this would have been the sixties generation he was talking about. These same advance d souls had a mission: to restore to the earth the Atlantia n spiritual secrets while taking civilization beyond Atlantis. Thus there would soon be a New Age with new powers unleashed. There would also be the return of the occult priesthood a nd adepts, oracles, psychics, astrologers, channelers, high my stics, and godmen who were here to change the \"earth plane.\" ( This revelation helped spur me to meet my spiritual dest iny in India--at any price!) Not just God, but the character of Christ chang ed as well. Christ was the perfect yogi, avatar/incarnation of t he godhead, and god-man. He had already reincarnated on the ear th a number of times to set up his messianic mission, perfecting himself even more each time. Melchizedek was but on e embodiment in Christ's genealogy of past lives. In that sense he is a model for all men to follow in order to att ain what is now called \"Christ-consciousness.\" Strategically, th e Akashic \"voice\" channeling through Cayce targeted the hidden years in Christ's life about which the Bible is silent. Now there was room to fill in the blanks. With an elaborate explanation of astrological forces, the Akashic voice depicted the young \"perfect master\" t raveling to Egypt to study at the temples of wisdom and beau ty, where he learns certain psychic arts. Then the young Jesu s goes on to India and Tibet to learn levitation and transmut ation from certain Tibetan masters; while in India, he learns healing, weather control, telepathy, and ultimately reaches \"at-one-ment\" (the real meaning of atonement) with the cosmic ove rmind. From there, at about age 29, he returns to the Holy Land as the fully promised Messiah. Perhaps what initially bothered Cayce most abou t this channeled revelation was the fact that the apostles left all these critical bits of history out of the New Testa ment. Cayce knew that the Bible does not mention so much as a hi nt about"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"any of these mystical sojourns. None of the histori ans of antiquity ever saw the dimmest traces of any of thi s nor, from all the hundreds of letters from out of the era of the early church soon after the life of Christ, was a word eve r uttered about these trips to India. You would think someone would have gone along and written about it then. No, Cayce had to trust the invisible voice coming through him, and t his took a certain leap of faith. Thomas Sugrue, the major biographer of Edgar Ca yce, in There Is a River, makes an observation about Cayce an d all other channels of the cosmic Christ: The system of metaphysical thought which emerg es from the readings of Edgar Cayce is a Christianized version of the mystery religions of ancient Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, India and Greece. It fits the figur e of Christ into the tradition of one God for all peop le, and places Him in His proper place.... He is the capstone of the pyramid. But Edgar Cayce was by no means the first chann eler to come up with revelations about the cosmic Christ. An other major source was Levi Dowling, a late nineteenth-ce ntury medical practitioner who traveled from town to town in the Midwest in a covered wagon. In the early hours of t he morning he channeled and recorded through automatic writing the famed occult classic, The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ. Dowling records how he gave his body to a \"higher f orce.\" Its purpose was to complete what the apostles had l eft out, updated for our coming \"Aquarian Age.\" Dowling had already rejected the New Testament source. Dowling consider ed his channelings to be higher scriptures and numbered th em chapter and verse like the Bible. One could almost l ament at this point--oh, if only the scholars would bring th eir weighty redactive and critical methodology to bear on these channeled teachings from around the world, surely they bounce all over the map. What is a believer to do? Which c hanneled"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"revelation do we trust? According to Dowling's revelations, Christ lear ned herbal arts in Benares, India. The Aquarian Gospel reveals in chapter 23, verses 2-4: \"Benares of the Ganges was a city ri ch in culture and learning; here the two rabbonis tarried many days. And Jesus sought to learn the Hindu art of he aling, and became a pupil of Udraka, the greatest of Hindu hea lers. Udraka taught the uses of the waters, plants, and e arths; of heat and cold; sunshine and shade; of light and dar k.\" We also learn that \"Jesus was accepted as a pu pil in the temple of Jagannath: and here learned the Vedas and Manic Laws\" (21:19). Yet the reality is this: The only Sc riptures Christ quotes from in the New Testament are from the Jewish Torah. Not a breath about the Vedas, but plenty fro m the prophets, psalms, David, and Moses. Not a reference to Udraka or the Jagannath temple with its thousands o f Hindu gods. Perhaps in a pantheistic mood, the Aquarian Ch rist reveals: \"With much delight I speak to you concerning life-- the brotherhood of life. The universal God is one, yet he is more than one; all things are God; all things are one\" ( 28:3,4). At the feast of Persepolis honoring the Magici an God, the Aquarian Christ has some good things to say at the i nvitation of the ruling magician: \"Your purity in worship and in life is pleasing unto God; and to your master Zarathustra, praise is due\" (39:5). When he goes on to Delphi, he has some great things to say about the oracle: \"The Delphic age ha s been an age of glory and renown; the gods have spoken to th e sons of men through oracles of wood, and gold, and precious stone.... The gods will speak to man by man. The living oracl e now stands within these sacred groves; the Logos from o n high has come\" (45:8-10). By the time Dowling's young master gets to Egyp t he is ready to go through the seven tests of mystical bro therhood to become a full master. In the chamber of the dead he becomes a pupil of the Hierophant. Here he learns the mysteri es of life and death and \"the worlds beyond the circle of the sun.\" Faced with the body of a young boy whom he is to em balm,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the cosmic Christ tells the boy's grief-stricken mot her that \"Death is a cruel word; your son can never die\" (54 :6,7). Indeed, these words can be found in the Bible, but a re spoken by one other than Christ, to be sure: \"Ye shall sur ely never die.\" Today, we are 10,000 channels down the road fr om the days of Levi Dowling and Edgar Cayce and there have been a lot of history and words added to the cosmic Christ. It has been a most extensive and elaborate dress rehearsal. Curren tly, contemporary channels such as J.Z. Knight who chann els Ramtha, jach Pursel who channels Lazaris, and Elizab eth Claire Prophet, figurehead of the Summit Lighthouse, who channels multiple ascended masters, echo similar te achings to those of Cayce and Dowling. They have added sophi sticated make-up to this cosmic Christ. A COURSE IN MIRACLES Now, in the last ten years, there has come a m ajor new revelation to hit the stands and it has created a N ew Age furor. It is A Course in Miracles, channeled through a Jewish atheist-indeed, a woman in the department of psychi atry at Columbia University who even as an atheist took down what the voice told her. A Course in Miracles is one of t he most-sought-after sources of teaching among New Age rs and even some churches. Here too is an event, a phenomenon, that should not entirely escape our scrutiny. In short, Helen Schucman, Ph.D., who in the mi dsixties was an associate professor of medical psychology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, wor ked in a department riddled with strain, tensions, and acade mic competition. This job stress ate into her personal life, creating anxiety and pessimism as it did also with her boss, Dr. Thetford. Department and faculty meetings were like war zones as medical egos displayed themselves. The two--at odds -- made a joint commitment to straighten things out at almost any cost. One technique involved acknowledging and selectively seeing only the positive in the other person."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Yet Helen Schucman, an avowed atheist, had alw ays possessed a strange psychic faculty that she had only periphe rally acknowledged. Her \"mental pictures,\" which she had been seeing in her mind for as long as she could re member, changed from black-and-white to color, then they st arted moving, motion-picture style, and invaded her dream s. In the summer of '65 the psychic process heightened. S chucman got a flash of herself as an Egyptian priestess. Th en in a \"vision\" she discovered a large black book in a tre asure chest. An inner voice began to accompany the moving psychi c pictures. It told her that it was \"her\" book. Schucman told Dr. Bill Thetford that she might need to undergo a p sychiatric examination herself, but that it might be pathologi cal. Thetford was drawn to Edgar Cayce in looking for exp lanations. Cayce was a vital link, Thetford felt. By September o f '65 Helen had a premonition that something major was ab out to happen. The inner voice was appearing more and more . Doctor Schucman finally phoned her boss, repor ting that the inner voice would not leave her alone. He asked her what it was saying. \"You're not going to believe me,\" sh e responded. Bill countered with \"Try me.\" Helen announced, \"It k eeps saying, This is a course in miracles. Please take n otes. What am I going to do?\" Dr. Bill Thetford encouraged her to ta ke notes. That night the voice came through loud and cle ar with the first words: This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. The atheistic scribe resisted but then followed her col league's recommendation, skeptically doubting every word tha t came through. At first the inner dictation frightened he r, but she went through with it anyway. This was in the fall o f 1965. In seven years time, by 1973, the entire course was tr anscribed, resulting in a 622-page text and a 478-page workboo k, as well as a short manual. Since then, the three-volume set has sold well over 500,000 copies. Years later her colleague , Dr. Thetford, described A Course in Miracles as \"a spiri tual document very closely related to the teachings of the non-du alistic Vedanta of the Hindu religion.\" What was interestin g about this was that the voice never divulged its identity . It stayed"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"anonymous. Adherents of the course, however, have a dopted Helen Schucman's hunch that the voice is really Jes us. It implies as much in the first pages of the course. The emerging document produced by \"the voice\" was coherent and authoritative, but Schucman did not in tellectually believe in its source. Should the dictation be brok en at any point, when it was taken up again, hours or day s later, it began exactly where it had broken off--like a co mputer modem, beginning again after a pause in protocol. A powerful intelligence was behind this event. Helen Schucman' s biographer, Robert Skutch, observes with irony: \"On the one hand, she resented the Voice, objected to taking do wn the material, was extremely fearful of the content and had to overcome great personal resistance, especially i n the beginning stages, in order to continue. On the othe r hand, it never seriously occurred to her not to do it, even though she frequently was tremendously resentful of the of ten infuriating interference.\" Skutch also observes: \"T hroughout the writing ... the acute terror Helen felt at the begi nning did gradually recede, but part of her mind simply never allowed her to get completely used to the idea of being a c hannel for the Voice.\" It was only a matter of time before Hel en Schucman surrendered herself to this unfolding revelation an d became a believer. When Dr. Schucman asked the voice why it was c oming through her, it responded with the statement: \"The world situation is worsening to an alarming degree. Peopl e all over the world are being called on to help, and are maki ng their individual contributions as part of an overall prea rranged plan.... Because of the acute emergency however, the usual slow, evolutionary process is being bypassed in wha t might best be described as a 'celestial speed-up.'\" The c oming changes were near, very near. World events meant that the c risis became a catalyst. A Course in Miracles is not concerned with fill ing in the missing \"bio\" of Jesus. It is a spiritual teaching couched in Christian terms but giving them new cosmic meanings. As"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Dr. Thetford observed, it is essentially Vedanta. W hen Thetford gave the manuscript to Edgar Cayce's son, Hugh Lynn Cayce of the Association of Research and Enlightenmen t (A.R.E), Hugh Lynn became very encouraging. This was the same mystery Christos that his father, the famous ps ychic, had channeled. Soon the guiding powers brought some key figur es connected with the New Age movement into the lives of the two New York psychologists, and proposals for publicati on were well under way. The inner voice of Robert Skutch's w ife, Judith, directed her to Helen Schucman. It knew abo ut her inner voice. Judith's inner voice ordered her to co mmit to publishing the work before finances were even avail able. Their foundation was already stretched to the limit in helping to fund ex-astronaut Edgar Mitchell's Institute of Noetic Sciences as well as Stanford Research Institute's br eakthroughs in remote viewing. When Judith Skutch first saw the manuscript she said to herself, \"Finally ... here's my map hom e.\" In little time the Skutches published A Course in Mi racles. What new facets did it provide the cosmic Chris t? None beyond a coherent supernaturally based document tha t itself was seen as a miracle and proof of higher guidance. Ironically, not far away in New Jersey, Seth had been dictating similar revelations through Jane Roberts. The course is totally positive and totally rea ssuring-- the kind of thing a self-described \"mousy, anxiety- ridden\" New York professional woman such as Dr. Helen Schuc man needed for reassurance. It is a revelation that use s the Hindu concept of maya to dispel the threat of evil. Evil is an illusion, the projection of the mind. With enough positive th inking, it will disappear. In fact, we can reshape reality bec ause we have the godlike power to govern reality through ex panded consciousness because all that is, is spirit, and s pirit alone. We get into trouble when we vacillate between the t wo modes of consciousness: the old and the new. If evil is n ot real, neither is any misguided sense of sin. In fact, as A Course in Miracles states, sin is the illusion that separates us from our"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"own innate divinity, our own godhood. We are extens ions of the \"thought of God.\" So our natural inheritance is a state of pure love. The Hindu word for such cosmic bliss is ananda. One of the course's exercises in consciousness is t o replace all fear and other such negative emotions with love. Christ is our exemplar, model, and elder broth er. But we are his equal, being already perfect like him. The course even claims that we are more powerful than Christ. Our m anufactured illusions of sinfulness have made the world a priso n for Christ. Thus we are the ones with the power to free Christ by perceiving the world in the higher mode--that is, f ree of all evil. The course encourages a person to say, \"God h imself is incomplete without me\"; and, \"There is no differenc e between your will and God's.\" Clearly, if A Course in Miracles is right, Jesus is the most misunderstood figure in history. History for 2000 y ears has had it wrong, the church never even got off on the right foot, and the long-promised paraclete--the Holy Spirit, w hich was to guide the church through history--has not even m anaged to get through to Christians about their misguided understandings. They have uniformly--all of them--believed a counterfeit gospel for 2000 years. Christ's messiani c act of sacrifice on the cross--that central historical fac t of Christianity--was wasted blood and pain. In fact, he never even needed to come to earth if all he needed was a good channel, for there was no real sin to atone for, and our sep aration from God was just an illusion all along. Of course, if matter is only spirit in high th eatrical dress, then real history doesn't matter. If we wish hard e nough, all the evils of the world will just go away! just wish and meditate and concentrate, as they do in India where physical reality is just an illusion, and the illusion will improve--ri ght? As we can see from India, consciousness has indeed overco me the evils of the world, for there is no travail, no suf fering, no poverty and disease in India--right? Hindus have ha d three millennia to perform the grand experiment and resha pe reality"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"with their godlike feats of consciousness--behold . .. paradise on earth! Yes, one must go to India and see how the mill ennial experiment has worked! Be amazed ... and know that r eality is merely an illusion of the mind. Walk through Calc utta and Old Delhi, as I used to, and perform the same feats of consciousness that I did. I reminded myself that it was only a test to take my mind off the reality of the perfection a nd bliss around me. Yes, the evils of the world were mere il lusions that could be wished away. Prayer as mantra, and so on. Strangely, the harder I wished the more the evils d idn't go away. With such messages of hope coming from the cos mic Christ, one is tempted to quote the memorable words of Alfred E. Newman and say in all profundity, \"What, me worry?\" Or in the great words of Mr. Positive himse lf, Emille Coue, echo: \"Each day in every way I get better and better and better.\" Now look in the mirror and say it again, \" Each day ...\" Indeed, as the true mystical believer will tel l you, the only real evil now is doubt, which prevents the miracle from happening. Something must be done with the doubters , for they are spoiling the harmony that the world is abo ut to experience. Who are the doubters? Among them are the ortho dox Christians who do not recognize the new gospel comin g from the cosmic Christ. They are still \"hung up\" over the ir carefully transmitted 2000-year-old canon that has survived the centuries intact. They claim it has already worked the miracle of grace upon their lives and does not need changin g. They say they have encountered Christ personally, and whe n they read the New Testament, that it indeed describes th e One whom they have encountered. Through the New Testame nt they claim that they have encountered the true hist orical person of Jesus Christ, and that he in no way resemb les this new cosmic Christ others are channeling. Between these two faiths the two paths, words, concepts, and traditions are at odds--irreconcilable odds. It is clear that something will have to give."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"11 The Halls of Caricature This was a day that I had dreaded facing. Looming before me was a sight, a visage, too t errible to contemplate. It was a foreboding stone structure wh ose architecture carried the terrible essence out of wh ich flowed the haunting memories of an event that blinds the mind in unspeakable paradox--an event such as a child being molested by a trusted parent and, in shock, being sealed int o repeatedly reliving that event throughout life, forever crippl ed in soul by that event. I was near the concentrated ess ence of human evil, where in recreated images flowed the in finite sadness and outrage of a race. This event was only a stone's throw away in recent modern history. This was not d istant ancient Rome. This was now. I was standing before the Holocaust memorial-- and multitudes of collective voices groaned through the rocks. Fittingly, it was a gray day in Jerusalem.

I had descended into the lush subtropical splendor of the River Jordan, trave led across the Negev, climbed Masada. Finally, I beheld the im pressive sprawling Temple of Jerusalem from such vantage poi nts as the souks of the Arab quarter to the Mount of Olive s.

A terrible essence of history h ad been"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"captured and bottled up for all the world to see. In the Holocaust memorial I felt anguish and h orror, as though caught in the middle of a Francis Bacon paint ing, as I walked down aisle after aisle. From picture to picture and in collected fragments oozed the terrible memor ies of Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz, Buchenwald and other concentration camps. Hitler had called it \"the fina l solution.\" It involved gassing hordes of Jewish people with zy klon-b, performing shooting-squad mass executions of others , and torturing more people than you would care to count- -many in the name of medical experiments. People with sen sitive, intelligent faces stared out of pictures in pained bewilderment. The Jews were a people whose ancient heritage perhaps made them a little different, but who were neverthe less the progenitors of countless historical giants from Ein stein to Tolstoy, and Karl Marx to Sigmund Freud. As I moved silently and sadly through the museum, I studied face after face and I was haunted. There was Anne Frank in her pretty lon eliness, a poet here, a violinist there. I felt it in my por es--a tragic, haunting melody. Here was a people who had wandered through an eternal diaspora as though searching for their soul, adapting here, adapting there--from high Germ an culture to the ghettos of Warsaw.

One picture series that I stared at for a l ong time, from some book or another, pictured a large, rotund, evi l-eyed, bearded Jewish man with a hook nose and thick glass es following and then exposing himself to (\"flashing\") a helples s and innocent nine-year-old girl. He then abducted a nd raped her, getting rid of the evidence by murdering her a nd hiding her body. Quotes from Hitler's Mein Kampf put the b lame for prostitution and immorality in Germany squarely on the shoulders of Jewish conspirators who wanted to wrec k the moral fiber of the German people. Jews were depicte d as an evil race full of hidden depravities. When these images had gained permission from G erman society to emerge, they foreshadowed the coming per secution.

With the latter, one should not be surprised, for this very defense mech anism appears daily in a thousand contexts: from ordinary people to such extreme examples as multiple personalities who cannot handle the ambiguity of evil, and so partition thei r nature. Real evil is so terrible and threatening a void that to many it must be closed out and unmade, lest the mind go mad . It is too terrible to look at directly.

Such is the response of \"enlightened\" people of today who say, \"Surely that cannot be real.

Few wish to face the implications of what it means if this is a part of reality. It is easier to remake t he universe, to just think evil away. Unfortunately, history could repeat itself.

In reality we must ask whether a campaign of image and innuendo could start up aga in, directed against those who don't go along with the consensus. Recent history resounds with a loud \"yes.\" Depending upon the consensus, there are \"in\" groups and \"out\" groups. The consensus can easily change, as it has numerous times. Nowadays in America, appropriately due to this recent embarrassment\" of history known as the Holocaust, w e live in a time of pin-drop sensitivity to any discussion concerning Jews or Jewishness. This is such a taboo subject th at any statement suggesting less than full-hearted support for Jews is instantly seized upon as being potentially anti- Semitic. The Jewish people are in an era of grace. They are abov e reproach-- no ill dare be imputed to them. Reminders of their victimization are so great that never again will anything conspir atorial be imputed against them. The wrong public innuendo gets the full ire of the media, the ACLU, civil rights la wyers, the Antidefamation League, as well as other groups. Yet Jews are honest about their own human vulnerabilities and pe rhaps feel uneasy about \"too much grace,\" for again it ma y mean being singled out as \"different.\" But if they are experiencing a time of grace n ow, as are other \"minorities\" such as homosexuals, women (if y ou can call them a minority), Hispanics, and so on, it see ms to be open season on other convenient groups who are now seen as culpable for society's ills.

Increasingly, there are mounting attacks on Chr istians and Christian character--it is open season. This conditi on is like the creed in George Orwell's Animal Farm that says, \"All are equal, but some are more equal than others.\" Strang ely enough, it is a standard that we see applied select ively, as though some deserve special favor over others. Peop le forget that this very condition might have helped bring ab out earlier instances of dislike between groups. Perhaps we are dealing with a sad fact of human nature. Without doubt, if I were Jewish and had relati ves who had died in the Holocaust, then when I detected any soc ial currents mounting up that could start some of the same dread ed old prejudices, I would try to anticipate and head them off. I would protest, voice my views, use the media and so on. That sort of well-warranted hypersensitivity is onl y normal. One learns to smell out potential trouble. That wou ld also explain the perceived threat of Christian \"right-win g\" fundamentalist politics to Jewish groups who see em bodied in them the possibility of a new fascism. So here is the result: Several well-known Chris tian leaders are now on the receiving end of images and innuendo in the academy and the media. If \"minority members\" such a s Professor Allan Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School, or Arth ur Miller, another Harvard law professor, are on Ted K oppel's \"Nightline,\" they are acutely sensitive to any numb er of civil rights, such as the rights of gays or the rights of vendors to carry all manner of pornography. But they cannot res ist masterfully caricaturing Jerry Falwell through innu endo. It might come as a quick, offhanded reference, but there it is, as they use the full force of the academic and intellectual mystique of their office--they are, after all, Harvard law prof essors. They get equally emotional about other perceived threats , so there is almost a self-righteous outrage as these profess ors of law address feminist issues, women's rights, and public school prayer and why it should be banned. The audience ta citly"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"absorbs what is acceptable, what is \"in,\" dazzled i n part by their brilliance, by their articulation and ability to frame thoughts and opinions. Indeed, Dershowitz and Miller are on the foref ront of fashioning what is acceptable legal opinion, thus s haping the future of the nation. With some, I imagine, this is almost a messianic task. Perhaps their vision is a safe secu lar state that is fully pluralistic, even \"rabidly\" pluralistic, i f I might speak in irony. In ways I can identify with them supremel y. I am merely trying to reveal what may be some unanticipated outcomes. The downside to this is that Christians ar e now on the receiving end of liberal scapegoating. A nother fact is that some of them deserve it and that compl icates the problem. There have been men representing Christiani ty in the media before the world who have been less than exemplary in every domain. They have caricatured the Christian faith. The backlash will be a rising mood of public contempt on several fronts. Jesse Jackson will never be allowed to forget his anti-Semitic comment about New York City, calling it \"Hymie Town.\" Can you imagine this level of concentrated ou trage if some noted figure called Greenville, South Carolina, \"Fundie Town\"? No, not at all. It is almost to be expected. No one would blink an eye. Again, to repeat an earlier obs ervation, are we dealing with arbitrary classes of privilege? If so, are they based on some arbitrary standard? If the \"outs \" are now \"ins,\" by definition those that were \"in\" are being defined as \"outs,\" and so continues the polarization. This can mean trouble because arbitrary tides can shift: That is my point. Scapegoating is an ugly phenomenon. Psychiatri st Scott Peck deals with the harm it can wreak on individual lives in his book People of the Lie. Scapegoating is a disho nest way of dealing with the problem of evil.

With feminists, it's now men. ANTI-SEX LEAGUES The human tendency for an easy way out is to s capegoat. We see this in hardcore feminist doctrine where wom en are portrayed as having been \"oppressed victims\" from m illennia of male rule and patriarchy. As victims they can do no wrong. They are above reproach. They are gentle vic tims of male barbarism, and obviously society's ills are fr om men's misgoverning of the affairs of the world. (Only a p artial truth.) Today's evils thus are proof that men faile d and are not cut out for the task. Implicit in this is that wome n would have done a far better job. They would have created utop ia if given the chance. The new myth is this: Women's superior \"caringness,\" \"nurturingness,\" and \"feminine intuition and attune ment to earth rhythms\" would never have allowed war or other forms of oppression. So who is the source of history's evils? \"Male chauvinist pigs\" (See--they are free to name-call!), especiall y as embodied in masculine males. The safer, more tolerable men a re the more feminized or effete males. They will go along with the feminist program, unlike the old-fashioned John Way ne types who are dangerous and will never change.

The Christian academy has taken up the women's agenda. Yale started once as a divinity school, so did Harv ard, and so did Princeton. These three schools have shaped the denominational church in America. Virtually every week the Ivy League's divinity schools and seminary host women's consciousness-raising events. It is their own tirel ess round of reminders of their own oppression. There are talks and films about wife abuse, films and seminars on domestic vi olence, films and seminars on fathers and stepfathers moles ting their daughters. The family is a collapsing and inappropr iate institution that must change or be abolished. There are seminars and planning sessions on totally egalitarian marria ges. It should be a world of emasculated men submitting to assertive women. In such a world the gay caucus can announce homosexuality as the new virtue. It will be a golden age of lesbe anism and homosexuality and perhaps the banning of such evils as marriage. God forbid that we ever see an e ra like \"Little House on the Prairie\" again!

Men wo uld glory in their effeminacy, and women would become p seudomales. So many butch women have defaced what little genuine femininity they might have had. A British jo urnalist described them as blockish or chunky, waddling in p otato-sack dresses or trousers, with octagonal glasses and but ch haircuts.

It is quite a campaign of recruitment and social change. Times have changed. In the sixties I went to F ranco Zeffirelli's movie Romeo and Juliet. I left with tea rs flowing down my face as I rode my motorcycle out into the Virgin ia countryside. I was overwhelmed by my longing for the beauty of t he truly feminine, that allure that feminine women pos sess. When I fell in love in those days, I really fell in love. Girls from Hollins and Sweetbriar colleges with their pretty d resses and long hair would show up for dances at the Universit y of Virginia and the attraction I felt was like a huge magnet. Girls in that era treasured the mystique of their feminin ity. I long to see such women again. Let me engage in overstatement: Instead of lit he and feminine Olivia Hussey at 19 playing Juliet with her vulnera ble eyes and beautiful face, we have \"Ms. Betsy Gambler\" waddling across the screen announcing her nonnegotiables to Romeo in that fascinating voice that some of them ha ve (an imitation of the male voice just reaching puberty-- not yet deep, but trying hard).

On April 17, 1988, The San Francisco Chronicle reprinted a recent news story from The New York Times by Timoth y Egan that highlights a significant national issue: the c hanging roles of women and the role of university campuses in thi s change. The article reported: \"When Pete Schaub could not g et into a crowded business course at the University of Washin gton last quarter, he signed up for an introductory class in women's studies, thinking he might learn something about fe minism. What he learned was that when he repeatedly challen ged course assumptions in class, he soon became the foc us of the class itself.... Schaub said [about the class instr uctors], 'They ardently boast of lesbianism and deliver shallow se rmons on socialism while making hate-breeding statements about men.' \" He was dismissed by the two women instructo rs. Schaub described his experience in this women' s-study class: \"But from the first day on, they started in a bout how all men are wife-beaters and child molesters and how th e traditional American family, with a mom and a dad, doesn't work.... They classified everything I had to say as racist or sexist. Where's the freedom of inquiry?\" A picture of a handsome, muscular blond athlete accompanied the ar ticle. Schaub, 20 years ago, would have been pursued by another ge neration of women in another way. He looks like an all-Ameri can football star at six-foot-one and 220 pounds. But h e said that his size and business major made him the target of \"everything that's wrong with men.\" Perhaps if he had been an effete ally and blended in, Schaub would have been tolerated. There are women's courses like this at every univer sity in America, almost without exception. Invariably, only women attend them, and invariably, they start to change. Meanwhile,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"there is a new trend. Some men are flying to Asia t o get mates to whom they are attracted--feminine women who want to be wives. A backlash of male hostility could easily happ en sooner or later. Things could get ugly. This might in turn ju stify the legal machinery of \"the state\" in defining the conf ines of male and female roles and what is acceptable. The S tate will \"be forced\" to monitor individual lives even more c losely. There may even be legally enforceable code numbers for gender-related behavior, creating a gray conformity --premonitions again of Orwell's \"antisex league.\" Many feminists would love to provoke some form of legal interventi on upon men, where men's maleness would be curtailed. This trend is already happening as wife-abuse cases gain public a iring. A case is quietly being built. There might come a gen etic and cultural solution to manliness. FROM GRIEVANCE TO CARICATURE There is no question that women have legitimat e grievances again st male abuse. Fathers can be dictators, degr ading their wives and hurting their daughters. Husbands c an and do get drunk. Some even beat up their wives. Men (a small minority of them) can and do rape women. Some fello ws will take out a girl, have sex with her, then leave her. Again, they represent some men. Life is full of heartbreaking e xamples; and indeed, mistreatment between men and women seem s to be happening more as families fare worse. One expre ssion for this is human depravity. There is no question that such abuse is wrong, but sometimes such instances can be used for propaganda with radical ends in view. For example, imagine you are a college girl go ing to the campus women's center run by older women. Most universities have them. There are no men's centers. Women's solidarity is in view. The center shows an endless round of films and seminars on domestic violence and wife ab use, then films on fathers molesting daughters. After a while, your only perception of men will be a reductionistic ste reotype"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"that denies all differences among men as individual s. Suddenly all men will seem almost biologically predetermined to rape and abuse women. Marrying one of them would be like marrying a wild animal. If the young college girl in question is truly hurting inside from a dysfunctional family, perhaps a remote or al coholic parent, then she is even more vulnerable. But rather than being helped, in the long run she will be more alie nated and angry. Women's groups use a legitimate argument tha t women are abused, then they engage in overkill. They fail to show the 20-to-1 other instances of homes in which men do no t abuse women for each one they show that is abusive. After this \"consciousness-raising\" process at the women's center, the average college girl will harbor such a nger that her chances of a workable marriage are further lessened . If the man is less than perfect, it is almost doomed-- esp ecially if he has some anger of his own. The woman is now trigger -sensitive about male abuses and on the lookout for infraction s. Rather than exhibiting trust, the relationship will be based on acute suspicion. The resolve, loyalty, and commitment that held together marriages of the old order have virtually evaporated from modern relationships, whi le polarizing alienation fares ever worse. It is a self-fulfillin g prophecy. \"Consciousness-raising\" or indoctrination? Wome n's centers do not show films and seminars about men as victims of women, such as men who are married for their money or manipulated for selfish ends, or where alluring wom en set one man up after another \"for the kill.\" They do no t show cases where a man's intimate vulnerability is betra yed, when he has opened up his heart to a woman he has truste d who then turns this against him to undermine and destro y him. To think that women cannot abuse men is pure blindness . No one gets out of this unscathed. When women's groups recite the long litany of male inadequacies and abuses, the reality of such things cannot be repudiated, merely the editorial slant and solution they offer. Often the major women's voices are antimale and ant ifamily."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Often they come from the lesbian viewpoint. Their s olution is a feminist-controlled world, or lesbian marriages, or marriages with \"changed\" men. But this begs another deeper issue. Are women less bent than men, or are their d ark sides merely expressed differently, as many ex-lesbians h ave admitted. A woman may not necessarily be physically violent with another woman, but she can be coercive, manipu lative, treacherous, and jealous. She can oppress her fello w sisters as much as the most abusive of men. To use all the pro paganda of feminist \"consciousness-raising\" to jettison the heterosexual family relationship, especially the traditional fam ily, is to enter a greater unknown where the evils of abuse ar e by no means eliminated. Let us ask the obvious: Would a mass reversal of sex roles have consequences upon society? Yes, most likely te rminal ones, as would the final destruction of all evidenc es of monotheism. People know intuitively that there is a deep good to a loving, whole family. Latchkey kids and kids in hom es torn by strife and divorce hunger for the ideal of the h armonious, integrated family as they look longingly at \"Little House on the Prairie,\" \"Father Knows Best,\" and \"The Cosby Sho w.\" They see in a workable hierarchy a chance for love to operate. Dad is truly attracted to and protective of Mom; sh e wants to please him and is fulfilled. They get along, and th ey love their kids. They are not at war, but have joined in commi tment to an ideal of love, mutual need, and clear understand ing that their created differences are to be treasured! The family is very much a part of the old worl d order, as are traditional roles of men and women whose difference s are seen as being intentionally created by God. Differe nt roles between the sexes are also seen as God-ordained. Th is is critical in the case of the family.

We are reminded of the famous sign outside the auditorium of the Indian superguru Rajneesh, \"Leave your minds and you r sandals here.\" The rest of the human race has been like onlookers in a vast stadium looking down at the che ssboard in the center of the field and believing their whol e fate hangs on every chess move. The onlookers are powerless as they watch the game, knowing they are not clever enough themselves to figure out the next move. They are captives in a deadly serious game."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" So far, philosophy is still searching for a cl ever rejoinder to the vast questions it has encountered in its search . Philosophy itself has been \"waiting for Godot.\" It has become a player in the theater of the absurd. Not only has there been a long-term chess game that the philosophers have been playing over the centuries, but each individual philosopher (or team player) has been te mpted by lesser games and wagers that are quickly settled. W e find that from David Hume on, some of the old sidewalk tricks have worked on some of history's greatest minds. The gam e looks easy for the confident intellectual at first glance . An ordinary street sleight-of-hand artist has a pea and three c ups. He quickly switches them around. Famed British empirici st David Hume points to cup number three to reveal the pea. The pavement artist grins as he lifts the cup-behold, t he pea is not there. It is under cup number two. Now consider the weight of David Hume's decision about where the pea is if all of civilization hangs on his decision. it would go from a lighthearted challenge to a distended moment of uns peakable horror. If Hume's mind fails to detect its location , all of history feels the consequences. This is not too far from wh at has been going on between the human race and the participant s in the philosophical inquiry as philosophers have been gam bling with the truth, from petty wagers to long-term ches s games. Charting the course of philosophy and its effe ct on world history clearly shows that the thoughts written on the philosopher's table in one century can rule another century. Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto was written in the last c entury. Today--a century later--its philosophical view of r eality governs the lives of two billion people. Russia, China, and o ther Marxist nations would not exist in the form they do today if Karl Marx had never existed and if no one had ever thought of communism.

THE CRISIS Our spiritual crisis in the West has its roots in the Age of Reason, that seventeenth-century period out of wh ich emerged the rationalists and the empiricists. In th e 1600's and 1700's, strains of humanistic, man-centered thought came together and flourished, producing a widespread cha nge in assumptions about reality. The Age of Reason started with the assumption t hat the mind of man was an all-sufficient, autonomous agent for comprehensively understanding human nature and real ity. Incredibly, it was no more than a small roomful of men who brought in the Age of Reason. This minority asserted that human intelligence could comprehend man and the wor ld with adequacy. This was quite a heady assumption gi ven the limited experience of man with his small allotment of time and space. It is an ambitious project to try to log ically disassemble and account for the cosmos. Such a task requires an overview that is more than humanly derived, but the challenge of the game created a heady confidence. A group of thinkers known as the Continental Rat ionalists, composed of Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza, assume d on faith the mind's ability to function correctly, ind ependent of any external guidelines for thought and independent of God's revelations about his creation. The mind could buil d a sound,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"unshakable system of thought, they felt, by deducti ve reasoning from simple premises, reinforced by truths retained from the biblical worldview from which they could borrow for the sake of convenience. These biblical absolutes, afte r all, ensured ultimate meaning behind their endeavor. Leibniz and Descartes were theists. They did not want to dethrone God aft er all; they merely wanted to secure his knowledge wit hin the bounds of pure reason. So they placed all the bibli cal absolutes within the mind as \"innate ideas\" so they would be unassailably safe, in a category where no other che ss pieces could \"check\" them with skepticism--or so it seemed . Descartes began building his rational philosop hy from a single seemingly unassailable truth: Cogito, ergo su m (\"I think, therefore I am\"). This was the single fact upon whi ch no doubt could be shed. Having established man as the ultimate fact in the universe, and the only unshakable fact, he proceeded to \"prove\" God's existence as well as the existence of the external world. God and the created universe we re being rendered dependent upon man for authentic existence . Then another group of philosophers known as th e British Empiricists took things a step further toward moder nism. This group, composed of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, d enied the existence of the \"innate ideas\" held by the rat ionalists. All that man can know, they proposed, must originate in experience. All \"abstract ideas\" such as God or truth must deri ve from some sense impression in order to be noeticall y valid. Of the three philosophers, only David Hume exp lored the implications of a pure empiricism with unremitting vigor. All that man can legitimately know from experience, Hum e concluded, is a succession of sensations. Therefore, since thi ngs like God, one's personal identity, and the events o f life are not immediate sense impressions like pain or color or s ize, we cannot know that they exist (because of this observ ation by Hume, the philosophical category of metaphysics was effectively shut down and abandoned). Man experiences only a succession of events which habit and memory lead hi m to connect together into various unifying experiences. Our"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" experience has no necessary connections with the fu ture; therefore, no reliable knowledge is possible by emp irical observation derived from experience if it is true t hat there are no real, necessary connections between events. What Hume was in fact saying was that just bec ause the sun has risen every day for thousands of years give s us no warrant to predict it will come up again. Hume had just declared the death sentence on what philosophers ca ll causality--the very foundation upon which modern sc ience is founded. Connections between things and events perce ived by sense impressions could no longer be made. You c an imagine how this notion shrank the field of accepta ble knowledge. The world reeled from this proclamation of David Hu me. The result of Hume's analysis left man without poss ibility of significant knowledge, without self, in a world wit hout substance or structure. The scientific community of the 1700' s was thrown into an uproar because, granted Hume's i nitial premises (which they did not dispute), they could f ind no flaws in his thinking. For Hume, knowledge became o nly possible in the most limited sense. Yet for Hume th e practical demands of daily life still had to be assumed. You still had to assume that the sun would come up, that water would flow out of the faucet, and so on. William Barrett in Irrational Man, captures Hum e's absurd dilemma when Hume \"in a moment of acute skepticism, felt panicky in the solitude of his study and had to go out and join his friends in the billiard room in order to be rea ssured that the external world was really there.\" When Hume finished his empirical analysis, the very possibility of true scientific knowledge was in que stion. Immanuel Kant, shaken by Hume, sought to extract thinking fr om the impasse into which it had worked itself, and his so lution laid the groundwork for thought in the nineteenth centur y. Kant worked the chess pieces into a tighter situation, e ven closer to a final entrapment. Kant's revolutionary move was this: In order t o rescue"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"science and philosophy from skepticism while at the same time preserving humanistic assumptions, Kant remove d the form and structure of reality from their precarious place in a problematic external world and established them wit hin the mind of man. The patterns that science studies, the dynamic orderliness of nature which rewards the efforts of science, are not the result of habit and custom as David Hume ha d proposed. Instead, Kant now argued, this order originates in the mind of the observer. This subjective ordering proc ess is the condition for perception itself. Kant called this \" the transcendental unity of apperception\" (T.U.A.). All of a sudden the mind contained the creative power which produces wh at we know as \"reality.\" This had vast new implications t hat would send philosophy reeling in a whole new direction, p aving the way for Hegel and his concept of the evolution of h istory-- with beingness mystically growing in the universe-- and for the Romantics, who would delight in this breakthroug h. Suddenly, Kant's move of T. U. A. philosophica lly and epistemologically threw open the door not only for a knowledge independent of God, but it opened the way for mysti cism, monism, and the pursuit of the occult. The nature o f the mind, Kant argued, is to order the indeterminate st uff of sensation so that it can be perceived or known. Thi s ordering takes place before the experience is possible. Ther efore time, space, and causality are not \"out there\" in a real world; they are extended from the subject's mind for the act of perception. Science is successful in its generalizations about the normal relations between objects of experience because the se relations between objects of experience are established a pri ori by what Kant called the forms and categories of human understanding which allow objective experience to occur. What reality is, what \"things in themselves\" are, cannot therefore be known. What we \"know\" is made possible not by Go d, not by the mind's penetration of a real world, but by t he mind's projections of what we can know upon an essentially unknowable world. Kant placed God, the soul, moral freedom, an d the like in the realm of the unknowable \"things in themselves.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"This conceptual framework became known as phenomena lism, a foundation stone within the German school of idea lism. Needless to say, these \"breakthroughs\" spilled over from the philosophy departments to the schools of theolo gy in Tubingen, Leiden, Berlin and the other German univer sities, paving the way for the nineteenth-century German hi gher criticisms of Julius Wellhausen, Harnack, Ritschl, a nd many others. In turn, the theological left-hand turns wi thin these schools of theology had an immediate impact upon ot her centers of learning outside of Germany, as well as upon the entire German Lutheran church, putting all the trad itionally accepted tenets of the faith into total upheaval. By the early twentieth century, it would be a totally toothless church, incapable of voicing moral comment as the National Socialist platform rose to power, bringing in Hitler. A few i ndividuals like Bonhoeffer were rare exceptions within the chur ch and the academy. By then such opposition as his, during the era of Bergen-Belsen, represented little more than a twig tr ying to hold back the waters of a broken dam. Almost immediately, Kant's thoughts in Germany hit the international intellectual community. Samuel Colerid ge, the nineteenth-century English poet, could now say that we half create, half receive the world, so that what man fa bricates in perception cannot be separated from what is really there. Man knows only experience, not \"things in themselve s.\" Walt Whitman, an American poet and a contemporary o f Coleridge, elaborated on this by saying that man is like a spider who spins the world that he knows out of him self. For the world as we know it, as Kant had said, is a con struct of our minds. But now there is a terrible problem that the o riginal quest of Descartes and Leibniz could not have foreseen a cen tury before Kant. If one reasons earnestly about religio us questions from Kant's philosophic position, one can only arri ve at an agonizing agnosticism because God has been struc turally removed from any relationship to existence--he has been erased from the cosmos.

Faith can never be biblical faith rooted on the evidence that what is out there is real. In bib lical epistemology you don't need to keep proving to your self the reality of the external universe. It is a given tha t it is created by God, therefore real, and therefore has a purpose. So what did the world lose when modernism disp osed of biblical epistemology? It was a priceless treasure. In the biblical worldview, the significance of individual life was guaranteed. Time and history were intelligible and real. The fact that the universe exists was explained in a wa y that allowed for sustained, intelligent inquiry because the vast patterned structures and dynamic energies of the un iverse were seen as an outgrowth of God's wise and soverei gn purpose. Form and structure were real and not Kantian projec tions from the mind of man; rather, they were inherent in the reality of a knowable world. When Isaac Newton wrote Principia Mathematics in 1687 at Trinity College, Cam bridge, he rested on an intellectual assurance that the cos mos was trustworthy, and that his deep Christian beliefs wer e in no disharmony at all with the scientific task. Newton could be assured that Christianity links the world of the ra tional to the spiritual. It shows the harmony and continuity of a ll knowledge. There were physical laws such as gravity, and there were moral laws, each affecting different domains o f God's creation. But as the knowledge of God became suppressed through philosophy, these given and obvious truths became p hilosophically problematic.

I ts hard, natural determinism and unfeeling, soulless univers e left them with an impoverished vision of life. The Romant ics did not question the humanistic and naturalistic assump tions of the Enlightenment. They merely sought to reverse th e tendency toward impersonality by asserting the value of priv ate experience over and above what was mere scientific fact.

Hegel's influence after Kant mark ed the era of a new optimism, but this solipsism had not only an up side, it had a downside as well. By the time Nietzsche entered the philosopher's chair, he took Kant a step farther and held \"mere scientific fact\"-- indeed, the scientific undertaking itself--in compl ete contempt. Nietzsche was the one to rub the implications of wh at had happened over the past centuries into the faces of his contemporaries. He bemoaned the desolating universe that he and his contemporaries had inherited from his pr edecessors.

Soon it spread from them to Ame rica, where it was seized upon by the New England transce ndentalists: Thoreau, Emerson, and Whitman. Thoreau was to assert in Walden that \"The universe constantly and obediently answers our conceptions.... Let us spend our lives in conceiving them.\" Man can create the universe he so desires simply by revolutionizing his thinking, Thoreau obs erved, marking the early beginnings of \"consciousness-rais ing.\" Mysticism attached itself to the Romantic quest . To penetrate the secret world of \"things in themselves \" required an occult approach. Many adopted the attitude that sin ce by definition the rational, causal structure of the wo rld is an aspect of man's consciousness, the rational faculti es were merely an obstacle to true knowledge. Penetration t o the true essence of things required deep intuition, mystical mind states, or some meditative epiphany. Ecstatic self- absorption into a mystical oneness with or through nature--mos t obvious in Wordsworth, Shelley, and Whitman--had become an almost conventional form of religious experience . Nature began to be regarded as somehow divine. It was a tabloid for the sacred experience. Pantheism crept in. By the time the first translations of Hindu and Buddhist te xts were made in the nineteenth century, there was an immedi ate influence on Western minds. Walt Whitman applauded these new mystical breakthroughs in his celebrated poem \" Song of Myself.\" Whitman announced to the world: \"Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from.\" Whitman's fellow transcendentalist, Thoreau, c elebrated the occult potential in man with the help of the re cently translated Vendantist Hindu texts, saying, \"I have read a"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Hindoo book.\" Then he reveals the new teaching: \"So the Soul, from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to i t by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahma (God) .\"1 The teaching that the soul is God is pure pantheism. The Romantic movement introduced pantheism as a result of Kant's thought, and with that came the effort to lay aside traditional conceptions of good and evil. These cat egories were seen as limitations upon human consciousness a nd its quest for unlimited experiences. Besides, \"sin\" was never a popular word among artists, intellectuals, and the avant-garde. Blake, the English mystic poet, called this project on which he was embarked the marriage of reason and he ll. Later on in the nineteenth century, the very t erms \"good and evil\" were made irrelevant by persistent reduct ive analyses of experience. The most famous and influential of t hese came through the Englishman Walter Pater in his critical work The Renaissance. Pater sought to isolate value judgment from experience. He extracted the teeth from moral judgm ent by saying that \"not the fruit of experience, but experience i tself, is the end.\" He said that we should quicken ourselves by i ntensifying our experience. \"To burn always with this hard, gem -like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life .\"2 Moral questions are irrelevant to Pater who sa ys, \"The theory or idea or system which requires of us the s acrifice of any part of this experience has no real claims upon US.\"3 Truth of any sort has no reference here and no norm ative effect. Truth is not true but useful, as long as it serves our interests. Man's own experience is the god for whom all is sacrificed. Soon D.H. Lawrence and a host of other Romanti cs became champions of the pursuit of novel experiences and n ew pleasures, with no reference to morality. There was now a radi cal freedom to explore what used to be called \" evil.\" Hosts of Romantics entered the forbidden and the occult.

Even those who deplore our current moral condition do so in the very language that exemplifies that condi tion. The new language is that of value relativism, and it constitutes a change on our view of things moral and political as great as the one that took place when Christianity replaced Greek and Roman Paganism.

Yet the ant analogy doesn't approach the gulf of capacity between men and this philosophical quest, which only God is capable of performing. It would require a mind greater than the cosmos to reveal its true purpose to us. An intelligence of any less magnitude would not be equ ipped to provide an ultimate answer. Without revelation, we are hopelessly blind. There is no other way around this dilemma. Yet in the Age of Reason men dismissed revelat ion as an unacceptable source of knowledge. Its statements about the nature of ultimate reality were thrown out. The transcendental, supernatural basis for existence was rejected. If, by rationalist criterion, God could not speak satis factorily through revelation, the only alternative was for ma n to turn his faith toward himself as the final arbiter of ex istence and truth.

Diogenes Allen of Princeton, a professor of ph ilosophy under whom I studied, commented on how the Tractatu s of Wittgenstein radically narrowed what could be discu ssed in language: This very much restricted what we can say meaningfully. Not only are the concerns of metaphys ics and theology unstatable, but so too are the concern s of ethics and aesthetics. Wittgenstein, however, was misunderstood by the logical positivists, who saw him as an ally.

Rather than establish the knowledge of God, it has erased him from the universe and replaced God with a range of thing s--from nothing or the void, to Mr. Gumby, Rajneesh, and you r generic citizen on the street. Indeed, the West has regress ed and reentered the forbidden land of occult practices wh ich enlightenment rationalism once promised to abolish forever. Modern man has leaped from the checkmated position of rationalist despair to the extrarational free-fall of blind faith. Without any spiritual guidelines, man is now truly vulnerable in a wholly new way. He has returned to an inner-di rected religious subjectivism--from New Age channeling and pantheism, to Satan worship. The equation begins to look more and more like some diabolical tour de force.

A key new freedom they needed was th e freedom from moral restraint. They had the \"right,\" after all, to do as they pleased as long as they did not hurt anyone, and the right to live without the constant fear of bein g stigmatized by the present social order. They wanted to be libe rated from the Christian restraining force of morals and belief s that had been a pillar to the West. They hungered for a chan ging of the guard. The idea of \"sin\" was something repugnant to m ystics and libertines. They wanted it buried forever. Leaders of the new consciousness often crossed the boundaries of moral ity in their own private lives, and resented having to do this secretly. Madame Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy who touted her freedoms, ate hashish and had countless affairs of all kinds. Such brashness would be nothing by today 's standards, but in the late 1800's it stood out. One way the new beliefs spread in the early da ys was through what we now call \"consciousness-raising eve nts.\" They were like energized particles colliding in inc reasing numbers prior to a chain reaction. The 1960's was t hat final chain reaction where the critical threshold was fin ally passed. UNITING WITH THE EAST One key early event, which took place in Chica go in 1893, was the World Parliament of Religions, attracting 14 0,000 people. The speakers included Buddhist monks, theos ophists, Shintoists, a token number of Christian modernists i n search of a new ecumenism, plus several highly pers uasive mystics. It was the mystics who stole the hearts of the audience."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" The most articulate and brilliant of these spe akers was Swami Vivekananda, an impassioned Bengali who was th e premier disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahansa, who had recently died in India in 1887. Even today, the rad iant face of Ramakrishna appears on Indian postage stamps, for he occupies a position of renown as great as that of Gandhi. He is considered one of India's greatest enlightened godm en. At the time of the World Parliament of Religion s, the spiritual force of Ramakrishna was lighting up India like lightning flashing across a night sky. The ancient gods of In dia were having a revival through their instrument. Ramakrish na's 12 top disciples were spreading his life story and teachings all over the land. With Vivekananda, the premier discip le, this revival of Indian mysticism was now reaching the We st. Vivekananda was an inspired orator whose pleas for unity became irresistible to the thousands attending the World Parliament of Religions. Anyone who condemned the sp iritual treasures of this noble figure from the East was si mply exhibiting those \"narrow-minded biases\" typical of Western \"Christian\" culture. One can almost hear the accusat ions of \"cultural chauvinism.\" Take note: Here began the ea rly traces of today's common cultural/anthropological argument which defines different religions as being universal spir itual truths filtered through variant grids of culture and tradi tion. Spiritual truths could now be seen as wearing the c lothing of a given culture's language and imagery. So what the w orld needed were religious pundits acting as transcultur al interpreters of religion. \"Open-mindedness\" became a key word. Vivekananda had been a law student when he bec ame enraptured with his guru. Now he was a renunciant i n the ochre robe. His command of rhetoric and apparent no bility and virtue of character won his case time and again . Beneath it all was the admonition: \"All roads lead to God.\" Vivekananda's guru, Ramakrishna, was the syncre tist's saint: He had studied the scriptures of each of the major world religions, verifying each of them by claiming to reach"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"\"samadhi,\" or enlightenment, with each one of them. Whether it was by meditating on Christ, Buddha, or Krishna, Ramakrishna claimed he was taken to the same godhead. Each world faith took him back to the pantheistic One of the Vedantic godhead. Westerners loved this romantic im agery-- God as the ocean of being and infinite bliss, the s tatic eternal, the oversoul (\"paramatma\"), and so on. Vivekananda, like his master, used the followi ng illustration: The faiths of the world are like five blind men try ing to describe an elephant. One describes the trunk, a nother grasps a leg, another the ear, and so on. They all seem to contradict each other until their reports are unifi ed into a whole--then one sees the whole elephant. Vivekanand a was not shy in stating that the most complete descripti on of the whole shape of spiritual reality lay in India's anc ient storehouse of revelations given by its \"seers,\" \"ri shis,\" \"mahatmas,\" \"avadhuts,\" and \"avatars.\" India was po rtrayed to the World Parliament of Religions as a land on fire with spiritual truth. India's role among the nations was to enligh ten them with its spiritual wealth. The cardinal Vedantic truths are that the soul is eternal and divine and part of the godhead. It keeps evolving t hrough reincarnation after reincarnation until it rejoins the impersonal godhead. Life is merely an illusion, sucking us all in with its sensualist pleasures and pains that deny t he underlying unity of all existence. The dualisms of sweet and s our, light and dark, and good and evil, are two sides of ultimate unitive reality, like light coming out of a prism a nd breaking into colors. All reality is composed of consciousne ss. Existence therefore is the \"dream\" of the godhead. It is Vishnu lying on the thousand-petalled lotus forming the ph enomenal universe out of his undifferentiated being. Only wh en the droplets of consciousness merge back into the prima l ocean will this illusion of separateness end. A godman su ch as Ramakrishna claims to be none other than this--one w ho has sojourned the grand circle from eternity to eternit y. When he speaks, he claims it is the voice of the eternal co ming through"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"a human frame. Exquisite indeed. Mysticism had the ability to use sentimental f eelings within people to capture their allegiance. Ramakrishna won people's hearts by his apparent selflessness, sensitivity, a nd tenderness. What an overwhelming ace card to refute any attack of deception on his character--he seemed primevally in nocent and sweet. Indeed, he oozed with love for his young disciples, transmitting the voltage of his possessing force to their foreheads with a single touch. Therefore, when men such as Ramakrishna seemed to embody such goodness, they wer e, above reproach. The power of this sentimental goodn ess cannot be underestimated. What drove me to India initially was the lure of Ramakrishna combined with a number of mystical exper iences. The power of this hook of sentimentalized Vedanta m ust not be underestimated. WESTERN ADEPTS OF THE EAST Another group of players on the world stage at the turn of the century were the early figures of the Theosophi cal Society. The most notorious of these was the founde r of the Theosophical Society, Madame Blavatsky, a strange Rus sian noblewoman who had been into the occult from her ch ildhood. The headquarters for this society, which started in 1875, was in New York. But within a few years, Blavat sky moved it to Madras, India. She died two years befor e the World Parliament of Religions, choosing as her succe ssor Annie Besant, a member of the British Fabian Society, the toP of the pyramid of Britain's left-wing intelligentsia . Besant was a suffragette, most likely a lesbian, as well as a former member of Parliament. Another member of this occult triad was Alice Bailey, whose writings as much as any have directed the cou rse of the New Age movement. She later branched off from the t heosophists, forming the Arcane School, taking with her the Lucifer Publishing Company of the theosophists which she"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"renamed the Lucis Trust. The main remnant of her or ganization is now headquartered at United Nations Plaza. These turn of the century occultists pieced to gether a body of beliefs that look like a constitutional charter for the entire New Age movement. Where did they get these ideas? F rom Indian mysticism and from their own spirit guides! Before the term \"channeler\" was ever popularized, replacing th e older term of \"medium,\" they were channeling down \"higher \" revelations from the \" masters.\" James Webb in The Occult Underground states th at the early theosophists felt themselves \"specially chosen to b ear the light to the newly evolving global society.\"1 Those who had \"chosen\" the theosophists claimed to be superhu man Tibetan spirit masters whose disembodied presence w as in the Himalayas. They were setting up the world for \" global evolution\" and \"the appearance of a messiah.\" One p lan was that \"Lord Maitreya\" was to possess the body of Jid du Krishnamurti. Webb comments that his body \"was to b ecome the vehicle of the 'Lord Maitreya,' the coming 'World T eacher' of the new age ... preaching the Theosophical message of love, brotherhood, and the unity of all religions.\"2 Krishnamurti renounced this role in 1929 and b ecame a guru in his own right. Krishnamurti claimed to lose all memories prior to 1929. A little before then, Alice Bailey sp lit away from the theosophists, and a disappointed Annie Besa nt died in 1933. Who was this Lord Maitreya? The \"Master wh o had inhabited the body of Jesus in ancient Palestine, a nd who would take possession of the body of Krishnamurti i n the same fashion.\"3 Bailey again predicted Maitreya's re turn to establish a one world order and that this cosmic me ssiah was above all religions and all faiths. Bailey, like the others, got her revelations from forces outside of herself, nam ely, from \"the masters.\" Blavatsky revealed in a letter: \"All I can say is that someone positively inspires me--more than this, someone ent ers me. It is not I who talk and write: it is something wit hin me ... that thinks and writes for me.... I have become a s ort of storehouse for somebody else's knowledge.... Someon e comes"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"and envelops me as a misty cloud and all at once pu shes me out of myself and then I am not 'I' anymore ... but someone else.\"4 In the Mahatma Letters, which are purported wr itings from the masters to Colonel Olcott, a theosophist leader, one master referred to Madame Blavatsky as \"it, and the brother inside it.\" Olcott stated that no one knew the real Blavatsky since she was possessed and they \"just dealt with a n artificially animated body.\"5 With Blavatsky, this b egan at an early age. Indeed, the \"masters\" that channeled thr ough Blavatsky, Bailey, and Besant formulated an intricate and far-reaching occult revelation. THE EARLY CREED FOR THE NEW AGE MOVEMENT This occult revelation showed that man's probl em is that he has fallen from his previous status as part of the divine godhead into material existence, and that he has be en deceived into doubting his oneness with the godhead. Only th e hidden truths can set him free. Sin is nothing but ignoran ce. The theory of evolution, now applied to spiritual exist ence, was used to show that beings evolved as they reincarnat ed. The Hindus, of course, thought of this centuries before theosophists used Darwin. Resembling gods, the ascended masters, en route to the godhead themselves, could extend a hand down to help those beneath them on the ladder of sp iritual evolution. The hierarchy was there to help us. And who was Jesus Christ? Again he becomes the New Age cosmic Chr ist. Jesus was simply an occult adept, one of many masters, who the \"Christ consciousness\" possessed. His teachi ngs needed to be rescued from Christianity. Extracanonic al sources were needed, from early Gnostic heresies to revelat ions from the masters. The culprit hiding the esoteric truth was Christianity. Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled is one long 800-page attac k on Christianity, anticipating today's now-familiar post ure of moral outrage at any biblical or moral judgmentalis m (which itself is judgmentalism--against Christianity). The council of Nicea was attacked for supposedly throwing out rein carnation"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"along with other secret teachings. Christianity seem ed to be nothing but a cover-up campaign lasting 2000 yea rs. And its great adversary was really man's greatest ally- -Lucifer. ENTER LUCIFER, VANQUISHED HERO AND SAVIOR Blavatsky launched a stinging attack on the God of the Bible calling him \"capricious and unjUSt,\"6 \"a tribal God and no more.\"7 Blavatsky then reveals that the biblical acc ount is reversed, that Satan is the victim of Jehovah. She says: The appellation Satan, in Hebrew Satan, and Adversary ... belongs by right to the first and cru elest \"Adversary\" of all other Gods--Jehovah; not to the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom.8 Madame Blavatsky declares: Once the key to Genesis is in our hands, the scientific and symbolical Kabbala unveils the secre t. The Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the \"Lord God\" are identical.9 Satan, indeed, is viewed as the savior of mank ind, freeing men from ignorance and death. He becomes the creato r of divinized man. Blavatsky says: Satan, the Serpent of Genesis is the real crea tor and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. Fo r it is he ... who opened the eyes of the automaton (Adam) created by Jehovah, as alleged. And he who was the first to whisper, \"in the day ye eat thereo f, ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good and evil,\" can only be regarded in the light of a savior. An adver sary to Jehovah ... he still remains in Esoteric Truth the ever loving messenger ... who conferred on us spiritual instead of physical immortality.10"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" Lucifer becomes the greatest initiator. Churche s that oppose this savior \"are fighting against divine truth, whe n repudiating and slandering the Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom .\"11 It is only a small step from this to Alice Bail ey's talk about a \"Luciferic Initiation of Mankind.\" The road was wel l-paved. Nor was Bailey the only one to say this. A hundred y ears ago General Albert Pike, the top Masonic leader of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in Charleston, South Carolina, ant icipated a global Luciferic initiation in his letter to Mazz ini in Italy. Blavatsky calls Christ \"the first born brother o f Satan.\" Christ too becomes a great initiator who brings in t he hidden light. \"Atonement\" is now seen as \"at-onement\" with the divine inner self. It reverses the fall of divinity into the realm of matter. Blavatsky and her masters hate the biblic al view of the Fall and speak of this with considerable emotio n: Finally, it has created the god-slandering dog ma of Hell and eternal perdition; it has spread a thic k film between higher intuitions of man and divine verities; and, the most pernicious result of all, i t has made people remain ignorant of the fact there were no fiends, no dark demons in the universe before man's own appearance on this, and probably other ea rths.12 What is the Second Coming of Christ? Theosophis ts precede New Age beliefs by more than half a century: \"The coming of Christ means the reawakening of the Christ spirit in mankind or in as many as are able to receive it. ... For man, essentially divine, having wandered away from the k nowledge of his own divinity, has to regain it.\"13 The Secon d Coming of Christ is now reinterpreted by theosophists : It is the descent of a massive \"Christ consciousness\" upon the inhabitants of the earth. It becomes a global trans formation through consciousness-raising as the human race rec laims its lost divinity. To most New Agers, this best explain s the Second Coming. In reality, their scenario provides for what the Bible calls the Great Lie, on a massive level. In th at light it is a"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"vehicle for the delusion of the human race. Even th e blessed hope becomes disfigured by occult spell-weaving. To those who reject the truth, who are hostile to it, it is an attractive alternative to Christ's visible return. \"Lord Maitreya\" on April 25, 1982, was announc ed in newspapers around the world in a full-page ad predi cting his return as the global messiah. The ad proclaimed at one point: \"What is the Plan? It includes the installation of a new world government and new world religion under Maitreya.\" Benjamin Creme, who placed these paid ads, claims to be Maitr eya's channeler. Creme is the founder of the Tara Associat ion. So far there has been no appearance, and the blame inv ariably falls on the lack of spiritual consciousness in the world. MAKING EARLY CONTACT Both Annie Besant and Alice Bailey claimed to be channels for a number of ascended masters including \"The Tib etan,\" or Djwhal Khul. Today, Elizabeth Claire Prophet clai ms to be a channel for the ascended masters spoken of by the theosophists. Alice Bailey knew she had been marked for a tas k. There is no greater way to increase feelings of self-worth t han to feel that you have been chosen for a major cosmic task. She might have secretly gloated that she was now light-years ahead of her better-looking sister. This same entity entered Alice Bailey's life in seven-year intervals. It was not until 1915, when she was 35, that she finally discovered that this turbaned visitor was \" Master Kutchumi.\"14 In 1915 in Lucknow, India, Bailey was c lose to a mental breakdown from overwork and mental exhaustio n. Then a master appeared: Suddenly a broad shaft of brilliant light stru ck my room and the voice of the Master who had come to me when I was fifteen spoke to me.... He told me not to be unduly troubled; that I had been under observation and was doing what He wanted me to"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"do. He told me that things were planned and that the life work which He had earlier outlined to me would start, but in a way which I would not recogni ze.15 Then in 1919 two things happened to Alice Baile y. She met her first husband, Foster Bailey, an officer in the Theosophical Society, and she met her highest Tibetan master, kn own as \"The Tibetan,\" or Djwhal Khul. The Tibetan would be the true author of her many books. It was her moment to enter the world stage. How could she say no? Little did Alice Bailey know at the time that t he organization which she and her husband would eventu ally found would be in United Nations Plaza in New York City by the 1980's and that \"The Plan\" dictated to her by \"The Tibetan\" would be something held up by world leaders of the New Age movement as the most comprehensive overview of the New Age agenda. Bailey had taken her dictations from Djw hal Khul word for word. She notes, \"After all, the book s are His, not mine, and basically the responsibility is His. He does not permit me to make mistakes and watches over the fin al draft with great care.\"16 It is hard to resist the notion that because of the great logistical and strategic effort focused o n Bailey, Blavatsky, and Besant by the masters, something deali ng with world events was critical to their agenda. The mast ers had a vested interest in the destiny of the human race ap parent in their concentrated efforts. For almost 30 years Alice Bailey became the mou thpiece of \"The Tibetan,\" producing 19 books in the process. P robably the most powerful revelation, the one containing \"T he Plan,\" was The Externalization of the Hierarchy. All of th ese revelations went from \"The Tibetan\" to Alice Bailey to the world -at-large. But what if \"The Tibetan\" is not who he claims to be ? It's a ploy as old as the Trojan horse of the ancient world. The Greek army did not have the power to batter dow n the huge stone wall and gates of Troy, so they presente d the Trojans with a \"present\" that was wheeled inside th e heavily fortressed gates. Inside of this colossal carved ho rse hid an"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"army waiting to spring out at night and slay the sl umbering inhabitants of the kingdom. It worked, and the Gree ks destroyed Troy without losing a single man or batte ring down the gate. The FBI will sift every nuance of detail concer ning the private lives of public officials of national impor tance, such as a member of the cabinet or a Supreme Court justice. Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork got knocked out of contenti on over opinions in articles he had written for law jo urnals years earlier. Though an official can affect our lives in a given context, none of them claim to be channels of divin e truth. During the era of the Old Testament, a prophet was ruthlessly scrutinized. But \"The Tibetan\" and similar entities have been accepted by millions of people who don't even quest ion their credentials or their origin. They stake their etern al souls on some voice wired to the other end of the universe. It is a strange double standard: The same people who rattle off minor points about the Bible that they think will di spose of its validity and hence its authority will offer their s ouls to some channeled revelation or godman without hesitation. Their focused skepticism is selective and self-serving. I t's as if they have already made up their minds. Herein lies a dee p mystery-- it is the mystery of the human heart. By the 1960's America passed through the rainb ow bridge as many decided what sort of \"truth\" they wanted. W hat a handful had experienced at the turn of the century was commonly being experienced by an entire generation. The youth of the sixties started reveling in the delicious ne wness of something that held great promise and unlimited hor izons. Indeed this was a rainbow bridge for the New World Order."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"15 Going Beyond Good and Evil The Romantic movement, beginning in the last ce ntury, opened some interesting doors in our world. Its tre mendous artistic output has been a lure for generations of university students who have pored through its literature duri ng their most formative years. They have felt the delicious taste of various wild freedoms dangled before their eyes. Im agine the student away from home for the first time, free of supervision, and thrust into a unique permissive egalitarian atm osphere. What a time to be tempted by the Romantic challenge that exalts human experience! The Romantic ideal was Faustian: Human consciousness was seen as a deep ocean of mys tery with unlimited potential. Experience was the vehicl e for opening up this consciousness--the wilder the bette r. Critical in this process was the casting aside of the old re ligious and moralistic paradigms of good and evil that limi ted this new freedom to experience all things. When Goethe wrote Faust, that is exactly what he was opening up--a Pandora's box of consciousness-expans ion through experience. The Indian Tantrics taught the identical thing for centuries--that one must go beyond good a nd evil that adepts must become infinitely wise in both. Th en, and only then, can they transcend the false duality of both good and evil and merge with God. The Indian guru Rajnees h borrows from this Tantric teaching by saying that b y exhausting the experiences of pure evil, one can truly know go od and one can truly become God. Experience is the key. There was a time in the Western civilized worl d when nobody would have believed the level of immorality- -indeed, evil--that society has opened itself up to and perm itted. As we saw from examining the philosophers, certain doo rs had"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"to open first. Humanism was one of the outcomes of this, but it is only a halfway point. It allows you to say th at good and evil are relative, but unlike the Tantrics, unlike Faust, unlike the New Age movement, it does not really believe in or understand the supernatural. What humanism does is blur distinctions of good and evil; relativizes them. It says that the old traditional understandings no longer apply, tha t they don't really matter. Now classrooms in the public s ector teach \"values clarification.\" Peer groups decide what is okay and what is not. The distinction between good and evil has been powerfully neutralized over the past five decades. There are a number of indicators that tell just how much good a nd evil have been neutralized. Once humanism has performed this task in America and in Europe, a new brand of super naturalism can use humanism for a surprising turn of events. One area where good and evil have been blurred has been in the field of entertainment. The audience gets du ll to heightening thrills, then in turn wants to see more. It keeps f eeding like a fire. Now young children can become more jad ed than middle-aged adults of several generations back thro ugh a corruptive voyeurism as films take them to forbidde n areas. Indeed, movies are a very powerful index of th is blurring process. They are a formidable cultural reality, wh ether on TV or at the movie theater. Films have changed drastic ally. As we shall later see, particular films have stood out as major trend-setters of public thought. In that sense, the y are tools of propaganda and behavior modification. Some films ar e landmarks of conscience-searing--they push the mind to new boundaries, sometimes morally, sometimes conceptual ly. What would have been terribly bizarre or shocking a t one time can later enter the realm of the ordinary. Inc reasingly movies have abolished distinctions between good and evil. They have offered to millions in the general public what only a handful of outrageous Romantics would have pondere d in the last century.

Muggeridge observed: It is difficult to resist the conclusion that there is a death wish at work at the heart of our civilization whereby our banks promote the inflation which will ruin them, our educationalists seem to create the moral and intellectual chaos which will nullify their professional purposes, our physicians invent new and more terrible diseases to replace those the y have abolished, our moralists cut away the roots of all morality and our theologians dismantle the structure of belief they exist to expound and promo te.1 The answer for why the liberated West is in a process of self-destruction is coherently explained by the bib lical view. Its clear teaching is this: Sin and evil will take down individual lives as well as entire civilizations. The process and the answer serve to become, in the end, a kind of valid ation of the Bible and biblical truths which emphasize that good and evil are real. From Sodom of antiquity to Los Angeles to day, a Pandora's box is opened when evil is allowed free r eign. When the language of value relativism replaces clea r statements about good and evil, it becomes that much harder to back out of the trap. Good is mocked at and people become trapped.

That someone would have to die in order not to \"oppress them\" or distu rb their comfort zone is something so inhuman as to defy ima gination. So often feminists and homosexuals are seen li ning the mall of Capitol Hill to protest their \"rights,\" to c hampion their freedoms--to abort fetuses, to perform sodomy --things that were barely mentioned above a whisper during o ur Ziegfield era. Recently half a million of them displayed a qui lted tapestry signifying the thousands who had died beca use of AIDS. At the same time with angry indignation they demanded that antisodomy laws across the nation \"limiting fr eedom\" be repealed. With one foot in the grave, they still wa nt to engage in sodomy. This crusading coalition will lead you to beli eve that they are \"caring\" and \"nurturing\" and oppressed victims as they murder infants, commit anal intercourse, or engage in lesbian acts. imagine our audience at the Ziegfield Theater seeing a news special on some of these mass rallies, then wi th hidden glimpses of the camera seeing the acting out of wha t is being spoken of with such noble language.

Occasionally by ac cident someone will be overwhelmed by the spectacle of see ing a mountain of dead infants stuffed in a trash inciner ator, but this is a rarity. On the evening news of May 20, 19 85, there was an embarrassing story about the discovery of th ousands and thousands of dead \"fetuses\" in California. A gro wing mob of protesters waited to hear if the court would rule the babies as human or as products, and whether they wo uld be buried or cremated. Collagen from such flesh is used in certain cosmetics. Those who encountered the rottin g flesh were struck with the reality of abortion as opposed to tame descriptions of it. Perhaps they briefly came to th eir senses and were forced to deal with what was being done, b ut only briefly. Peter Adam, an associate professor of pediatri cs at Case Western Reserve University, within only six months o f the Roe v. Wade decision, joined some of his medical ass ociates conducting experiments on 12 babies: \"These men too k the tiny babies and cut off their heads--decapitated th e babies and cannulated the internal carotid arteries (that is, a tube was placed in the main artery feeding the brain). T hey kept the diminutive heads alive, much as the Russians kep t the dogs' heads alive in the 1950s. Take note of Dr. Ad am's retort to criticism: 'Once society's declared the fetus de ad, and abrogated its rights, I don't see any ethical probl em.... Whose rights are we going to protect, once we've de cided fetuses won't live?'\"2 The news media, like in the above case, occasi onally digs up some chilling artifact that signals new dangers. Different aspects of our social cancer come to light. For ins tance, 14-year-old Marcy Conrad of Milpitas, California, had been raped, strangled to death, and left lying off the r oad in the hills outside of town. According to the local paper , at least 13 students went out to look at her body. One girl picked up the murdered girl's jeans, cut off a patch, and thr ew the jeans down along the side of the road.

Those wh o saw the body went back to class or to the pinball arcad e. One went home to bed. Another student said he only cared abo ut collecting the marijuana cigarette he had won on a bet that the body was real. As the newspaper reported: \"The shoc k is the shock of the encounter with icy indifference, the i ndifference of the kids in the first instance, but much more im portantly, of the culture that produced them.... The depersona lization did not begin yesterday; it is not unique to this m oment, yet it seems more complete--and they seem more alienated a nd isolated--than we have ever known before.\"3 Walker Percy dwells on an alarming pattern of statistics in his Lost in the Cosmos: The suicide rate among persons under twenty-fi ve has risen dramatically in the last twenty years.... The incidence of drug use in teenagers and preteens has increased an estimated 3000 percent in the last thirty years. On a recent talk show on \"tough love,\" it was claimed that about one-third of all teenagers were depressed. Of the one third, as many as 75 percent were on drugs.4 Walker Percy continues to shine light on anoth er sacred institution--marriage and the marriage bed: Of all sexual encounters on soap operas, only six percent occur between husband and wife. In some cities of the United States, which now has the highest divorce rate in the world, the incidence of divorce now approaches 60 percent of married couple s. A recent survey showed that the frequency of sexual intercourse in married couples declined 90 percent after three years of marriage.5 Walker Percy goes out of his way to show that there is a worldview operating behind these strings of statist ics. It is a"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" relativism of values, that there are no absolute tr uths, thus making all moralities impotent in the end. They hav e no teeth--they are not able to make any real judgments or say \"no\" to evil with any authority. In Germany in the late 1930's the state became open to killing undesirables. This could be justified if men have no intrinsic value--then it becomes okay to kill th e mentally handicapped and others who would biologically pollu te the species. It makes sense for the state to abort babi es that might be inferior, whose parents have low IQ's. If the st ate decides that a certain group is detrimental to it, then rac ial genocide becomes the solution. Ironically, Hitler's term for the racial extermination of the Jews was \"The Final Solution.\" By then, Weberian value relativism had sunk its teeth into t he German mind, and all things became possible. Perhaps the most frightening artifact that the news media has unearthed in the last decade is the reality of satanic crimes and abductions. It is a phenomenon more sobering th an anything that happened in Germany before Hitler too k full control. The San Francisco Chronicle, one of the most p restigious papers in the United States, had the following head line on Thursday, November 5, 1987: \"SATANISM LINKED TO SCORES OF U.S. CHILD ABUSE CASES.\" Edward Lempinen's article stretched to a third of the back page. The front-page section summarize s this frightening reality: Children as young as 2 and 3 years old have co me forward with harrowing tales of drinking blood, animal sacrifices and sexual abuse as part of the rituals, according to law enforcement investigators , child abuse experts and parents.

Ted Koppel, the popular moderator of \"Nightlin e,\" said something quite profound when he was speaking at Du ke University in the fall of 1987. Koppel left the sta ndard posture of so-called objective impartiality that the media is supposed to embody and spoke from his heart. He portrayed th e bankruptcy of the permissive liberal approach to morality, say ing: \"We have actually convinced ourselves that slogans will save us. Shoot up if you must, but use a clean needle.

Not because it isn't cool or smart or because you might end up in jail or dying in an AID S ward, but no because it is wrong.... In its purest form, truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproac h.

It can only be man's revelation and, as such, it can change from d ay to day, from consensus opinion to consensus opinion. Writin g in The Humanist magazine, Paul Blanshard confesses a perspe ctive not uncommon among the educational elite. The title of his article is \"Three Cheers for our Secular State\" (Mar ch/April 1976): I think that the most important factor moving us toward a secular society has been the educational factor. Our schools may not teach Johnny to read properly, but the fact that Johnny is in school unt il he is sixteen tends to lead toward the elimination of religious superstition. The average American child now acquires a high school education, and this militates against Adam and Eve and all other myths of alleged history...

Humanism is the grandchild of the Age of Reason . What is it exactly? The Glossary of Humanism defines its po sition: Humanism subscribes to a view of life that is centered on man and his capacity to build a worthwh ile life for himself and his fellows here and now. The emphasis is placed on man's own intellectual and moral resources, and the notion of supernatural religion is rejected. One of the most important trends in modern Humanism is its reliance on the application of scientific enquiry and its evaluatio n of truth, reality and morals in purely human termS. 6 These are pretentious words indeed in light of the disintegration of society. Indeed, the humanist mus t avert his eyes from seeing the world he is passing on to others. I t is infinitely more sinister and hopeless, full of despair and ali enation, than the Christian alternative he so greatly seeks t o replace. A doctrine of meaninglessness has real consequ ences.

In the 1980's we have gone way beyond moralist ic posturing to appear decent. There is little pretense of innoc ence, especially in the youth. The writings of Henry Mill er 25 years ago typify America's awakening into continental nih ilism and despair: It may be that we are doomed, that there is no hope for us, any of us, but if that is so then let us set up a last agonizing, blood-curdling howl, a screech of defiance, a war-whoop!

And what if that one-world religi on is a revival of ancient occultism? And what if it is tot alitarian in power? If it is all these, it has fulfilled all of the requirements of an ancient prophecy. The following argument shows how things are in tricately set up to do what was just described. This scenario was predicted 2000 years ago by the New Testament write rs. Before writing the Book of Revelation, the apostle Joh n had a vision on the Island of Patmos. In it he saw world history ending in a battle between good and evil. He descri bed how a one-world religion was due to come on the world sce ne, destroying all rivals. It would begin as a sweet en ticement and end as a brutal dictator. He would describe it as Mystery Babylon revealed, likening it to the ancient occult system that the biblical God abhorred in the ancient world. Tha t system would return with fierce power. C.S. Lewis portraye d this in his novel That Hideous Strength 40 years ago. There have been numerous apocalyptic novels. Now there is a very re al possibility that the real thing is unfolding. What are the stepping-stones for this to happe n? Without sensationalizing history, how can we see this possi bility? It is not at all hard to envision. In fact, you have to b e blind to miss it. The first step is to limit the religious freedo ms of the one faith that predicted this eventuality and that clai ms to have the unrivalled truth. Like it or not, that is what the \"good news\" of the gospel is--the exclusive truth. It doe s not parade as broad-minded and tolerant of counterfeits or evi ls. For the above agenda to unfold, the Christian faith must be silenced"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"and suppressed. There are a thousand ways for this to happen. One is through the legal and political system. \"RIGHTS\" AS A LEGAL AGENDA Our world has many examples of the limitation of religious freedom. Mainly we think of the Communist bloc as th e prime example of this, but there are now a growing number of examples in the United States of America. It was the atheist Madelyn Murray O'Hair who in 1963 won a landmark Su preme Court decision barring religious practices--specific ally prayer--from all public schools. Why? Here's how le gal experts defined the problem: The atheistic viewpoin t of the O'Hair family, including that of her son, was being violated due to the fact that public schools allowed and pra cticed Christian prayers. These violated her son's rights b ecause he had to suffer hearing these prayers, and there were no atheistic ceremonies being given on his behalf. What if he we re a Hindu or a Jew--would he not also require that thes e religions be given representation as well? Therefore the stat e was showing one-sided favoritism toward Christianity wit hin a system that was supposed to be pluralistic, since p ublic schools were a branch of the state. O'Hair won and Christians ever since have been literally prohibited by the st ate to practice their religion in America's public schools . What concerns us in the O'Hair decision is tha t we have here a legal precedent for how a pluralistic state system iS supposed to function when those of many beliefs are involved: The religious practices of some are not to infringe upon the religious rights and freedoms of others. This can h ave far-reaching permutations. If it seems irrelevant and futile to speculate about a developing trend, one only needs to recall Bonhoeffe r's efforts to put together the Barmen Declaration as the church in Germany succumbed to an antihuman and anti-Christian system. What had seemed fantasy suddenly became rea lity. For Americans who celebrate religious freedoms , the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"curtailment of such freedoms may seem remote--until we contemplate one blatant thing: our own public schoo l system. Pretend that an average public school in America we re suddenly to engulf the nation in size and in operations. All of a sudden voluntary Bible studies and prayer, revival s and church meetings, and all manner of religious activi ties would have to be prohibited and frozen for the good of al l. Those who wished to engage in such practices would have t o sneak across the border--that is, if America were run alo ng the lines of one of its very own public schools. This is an i nteresting thought. To a future world-at-large that is without the legacy of a United States Constitution or Bill of Rights, the same kinds of limitations we put on those people in our public sc hools might seem quite reasonable in a globalist-pluralis t atmosphere. Religion would be fully privatized. Certainly our leg al system is busy trying to do just that--limit religi on entirely to the private sphere. Courtesy of the ACL U, numerous displays of the nativity that since the inception o f this country were displayed openly in public parks, etc. , have been banned, and cities across the country have bee n forced to take nativity displays down. Isn't it interestin g what gets these lawyers all full of self-righteous rage--nati vity scenes and prayer in schools. Nowadays you can get by snor ting cocaine in a public school without raising the ire of these crusaders for justice. With drugs they seem toleran tly understanding. That's not a major problem. But try p raying in the name of Christ. Angry ACLU faces will fill the night ly newscast of whatever locale this grievous event happened, an d multi-million-dollar lawsuits will begin. Are we se eing a social agenda being inacted? Let us proceed with more examples of state and secular interference. It is common knowledge that missions work is very much affected by the political situation in Ti bet (as well as in neighboring Nepal). Quite simply, there is no missions work. And that is because the political system will not tolerate it. The same situation is paralleled in Rumania, Alb ania, and Hungary. Communism has become a political reality in these"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"countries, and it has completely affected the relig ious rights of the individual. These are only a sample of all o f the countries under similar communistic rule. This is w hat can happen to religious freedoms when a political system becom es the arbiter of religious rights--often, there aren't an y rights. Those in Russia or Albania engaging in house churche s and prayer meetings can be legally arrested by the stat e police. They are imprisoned. Americans don't know what this is like. Meanwhile, we greet the subtle disappearance o f these freedoms naively, unlike immigrants who have come h ere from Eastern Europe who nod with grim understanding . They have seen what an all-powerful state can do;th ey have gotten their hands dirty in the pits. They have see n their neighbors carried off at midnight. There are no cho ruses of wimpy humane voices in the world they left behind. Now their warnings fall on deaf ears of the all-knowing liberal elite in America who have substituted the knowing smile f or real experience. The students of Harvard loved to patron ize the alarming words of Solzhenitsyn when he spoke at the ir commencement, because he was their new radical chic cause de celebre. But the words of warning of this great Russi an author went right over most of their heads. Many still tou ted their leftist lapel buttons because they have learned the language of role-modeling--that's what \"intellectuals\" do. They protest only the most vogue causes, and in fact can be iden tified as intellectuals by sporting all the right causes and paraphernalia. It's known as the liberal mystique: People role-pla y and posture themselves into intellectual status. It is unearned and cheap imaging that the truly gifted usually see thr ough at a glance. This is the power of consensus. Few individ uals can rise above it. There are other kinds of examples of the state blocking religious freedoms. During India's recent state of emergency, the Indian parliament was about to enact a law that permanently prohibited Christian proselytizing, evangelism, and foreign missions because such activity was perceive d as interfering with the rights of Indian nationals. India, using i ts state"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"of emergency situation, had already banned a range of these Christian activities. This act would make this ban p ermanent law. Already thousands of missionaries had their mi ssionary visas revoked and were due to leave the land perman ently. Conversion was seen as denationalizing and anti-Hind u. Yet since India is a secular democracy, its line of arg ument followed a clever argument propounded by the United Nations. Alger Hiss, who helped formulate the United Nations charter in San Francisco in 1948 with the help of his Commun ist bloc comrades (he was convicted as a traitor), based the document on the Soviet charter (left-wing media commentators and academics have always downplayed such connections). What is the United Nations' line of reasoning? --that it is a religious right of every follower of a given religi on not to be aggressively proselytized by those of another relig ion. Mission boards across the world knew immediately wh at it would mean for them if this became law in countries such as India: They would be forced to leave, and those caught eng aging in missionary activities would be prosecuted, even jai led. We have in India, then, a type of precedent that we ha ve already seen at work. In the name of the religious rights o f one person, the rights of the adherent of another relig ion could be legally limited. Specifically, if an aspect of bein g a Christian is to obey the command \"to make disciples of all natio ns\" in order to spread the gospel, this religious mandate can now be legally restricted in the name of the greater right s of all the collective religions and faiths. There is a darker aim beneath this line of reasoning. What is planned if the worl d becomes a federation of global states, whether loosely or tig htly structured? THE NEED FOR GLOBALISM As we have seen, in recent history there have been an interesting array of devices used to close the door s on religious freedoms. Under the banner of human right s, we have seen a line of thought which has been a supremely e ffective device in curtailing these freedoms. This argument is tailor-made"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"for a pluralist and globalist situation. The United Nations itself was founded upon a w ell-thought-out globalism. Indeed, if we suddenly submitted to the decrees of the United Nations General Assembly as law, then America would operate very much like our example of the extended public school. We would submit to doing th is \"for the benefit and out of respect for all world citize ns.\" Globalism has been a growing trend. In 1973, m any famous and influential people signed the Humanist Manifest o II as a virtual collective of academics, lawyers, financier s, and politicians whose names read like a Who's Who. They declared: We deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds. We have reached a turning po int in human history where the best option is to transc end the limits of national sovereignty to move toward the building of a world community... a system of world law and world order based upon transnational federal government. If this roster of experts feel this way, then maybe globalism is not just idle speculation. However, what concern s us the most about their global vision is the framework of laws and decrees that these experts intend to draw up which will affect each of us. Could we use United Nations law as a con ditional model for what we might expect? Many of these exper ts have done just that, forever throwing their support behi nd the United Nations. What does the United Nations provid e for world citizens desiring religious rights?

As with all revolutions, there were leaders and there were followers. in this case, the pigs became the l eaders since they were, through no fault of the others, a little smarter than the rest. One of their first official acts was to draft a statement of seven principles which were then painted on the bac k wall of the barn for all to see.

There were noble pronouncements as \"No animal shall drink alco holic beverages\"; \"No animal shall sleep in a bed\"; and \" No animal shall kill another animal.\" But the greatest and wis est of these was, \"All animals are equal.\" As the months became years, however, things di d not turn out quite the way the \"workers\" had expected.

When the puzzle d workers tried to figure out how things turned out this way, they went to the rear of the barn to see if there was not som ething in the seven great principles prohibiting this kind of inj ustice.

Indeed, just a few words changed here and there completely changed the picture: \"No animal shall dr ink alcoholic beverages ... to excess\"; \"No animal shal l sleep in a bed ... with sheets\"; \"No animal shall kill another animal ... without cause.\" But by far the worst shock of all ca me when the poor creatures turned with hope to the seventh prin ciple guaranteeing their rights but which now declared: \" All animals are equal ... but some animals are more equal than others.\" Before we examine the spiritual arms of globali sm, let us again remember the resolution from the above United Nations declaration: \"Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are prescrib ed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals.\" With enough legalese, word games, and elastic redefiniti ons of concepts, the above limitations could be instituted at the drop of a hat.

They can be heard decrying the polarizing force of Islamic fundamenta lism. But imagine how secular globalists greet Christianity wh en it becomes inspired by evangelical fervor. This clashi ng of beliefs must be dealt with by a cunning backdoor ap proach. Here is one such backdoor argument: If Western countries are going to initiate globalism, they need to set t he precedent for a new unitive generic religion, since religion itself is an enormous factor in creating lines of demarcation an d thus preventing transnational unity from happening. Ther efore, a new type of spirituality is needed: one that disavo ws the old order, one that can synthesize the beliefs of both East and West. This is not easy, for no one will ever be com pletely satisfied, especially that conservative minority of the three major monotheistic religions.

It expounded the ag enda and beliefs of the New Age movement, its leaders, i ts influence, as well as from whence it came and where it would b e going. None other than respected sociologist Virginia Hine defines the New Age movement in one of its own magazines, T he Networking Newsletter. In it she says: In the World Issues article entitled \"The Basic Paradigm of a Future Socio-cultural System,\" I sugg ested that a radically new form of social organization is emerging at all levels of the global system.... What we are reaching for here is the outlines of an emergent cosmology, the mythology of the NEW AGE. The \"demythologizing\" that is supposed to have occurred over the last two or three hundred years was in fact a replacement of earlier medieval and primitive cosmologies with what Jose Arguelles calls the Faustian myth of scientific humanism, a conceptual paradigm which now, in its turn, is fall ing before its successor. If we are to clarify the wide variations in NEW AGE ideology, we must seek the core tenets of the emergent paradigm. ... I would suggest that out of the welter of current ideological variants three basic tenets hav e emerged and that these constitute the NEW AGE answers to basic human questions.

We have reached \"cultural dislocation\" (a ter m used by historian William McLoughlin): All extensions of democracy and of human right s have been preceded by a period of spiritual awakeni ng, according to historian William McLoughlin. These periods of cultural dislocation, he says, are not periods of social neurosis, but are times of therapeutic and cathartic renewal. Awakenings occur when we lose faith in the viability of our institut ions and the authority of our leaders. Religious and spiritual awakening gives people a new vision of themselves which is then transplanted into social a ction.5 Clearly, they see the impediments to this trans formation as coming within the old established social order, esp ecially the traditional and mainline religions. Ferguson says t hat anthropologist Anthony Wallace \"concluded that when a culture can no longer tread its customary paths from birth to death, when these are suddenly blocked, stress in that cul ture will be so great that some of the fringe people will beg in to crack under the strain.

Their battle cry is, \"Back to basics,\" \"Back to God,\" or back to whatever. Eventually, however, no matter how loud the voices of the status quo, the culture breaks throug h what McLoughlin calls the \"crust of custom\" and finds new avenues of expression.7 The Christian faith is a central part of that n ativist crust. Ferguson admonishes that the New Age path of s alvation is the discovery that \"the myth of the savior 'out the re' is being replaced with the myth of the hero 'in here.' Its u ltimate expression is the discovery of the divinity within us. Out of our evolutionary consciousness will emerge the end of o ur illusion of separateness.\"8 Our own divinity is a key reason for global unity. We are united anyway--divinely. This message is broadcast far and wide at all of the New Age symposia and conferences across the country. Ho spice pioneer and author of the bestseller Death and Dyin g, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross predicts, \"In the decades to come we may see one universe, one humankind, one religion that unites us all in a peaceful world.\"9 Robert Muller, assistant secretary general to the United Nations and author of the key New Age book entitled New Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality, is a key vo ice among the political VIPs of the New Age movement. The United Nations is portrayed by Muller as a key catalyzer of global ism and a special friend of the New Age movement. In August 1983, Robert Muller was the main spe aker at the Ninth Annual Mandala Conference at the Town and Count ry Convention Center in San Diego. To the 2200 present, Muller presented a familiar message, that \"the earth and, ultimately, "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the cosmos are becoming self-conscious through Netw orking and the evolution of humankind.\"10 Of course there is a catch to this. Muller was asked by a reporter about exclusive religions such as Christian ity (McLoughlin's \"nativists\") and their role in the Ne w Age. Muller replied, they try to be exclusive, but I think ther e is no religion that can win. What they should do in my op inion is get together and define the principles they have in common.\"11 Muller's provisional solution is a generic religion based on a mosaic of syncretisms. Ironically, the a nthem of the conference was the national anthem, but with th e words changed. You might call it a generic New Age anthem . To the tune of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" came the words, \" O say can you see, by the One light in all, A New Age to embrace, at the call of all Nations.\"12 FORCING THE NEW AGE TO HAPPEN Muller uses an argument of moral need: \"The ne xt stage will be our entry into a moral global age--the glob al age of love--and a global spiritual age--the cosmic age. W e are now moving fast towards the fulfillment of the visions of the great prophets who through cosmic enlightenment saw the w orld as one unit, the human race as one family, sentimen t as the cement of that family, and the soul as our link wit h the universe, eternity, and God.\"13 New Agers project a positive spirit, proudly r ising above contemporary despair. In both Marilyn Ferguson and Robert Muller this mood of optimism is almost a reckless g lee, a manic expectancy. Muller exults, \"If Christ came bac k to earth, his first visit would be to the United Natio ns to see if his dream of human oneness and brotherhood had c ome true. He would be happy to see representatives from all nations.\"14 Evil is conveniently redefined as ignorance, a nd not as sin against a personal God. Evil is our failure to see the unity that is already there, thus forcing us to succumb to the \"myth of separation.\" New Agers thus anticipate the collapse of the old"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"age and the birth of the New Age by means of the pa radigm shift in the way reality is perceived. Monotheism a nd rationalism will be supplanted by mystical monism. This is all \"positive.\" Mark Satin in his book New Age Politics: The H ealing Self and Society goes so far as to label the mind-set of the present age as an obsolete \"Six-Sided Prison.\" When this mind-set is changed, the world of \"Little House on the Prairie\" will be demolished, along with a million and one other wholesome and go od things. A homosexual teacher in public school can t ell the kids about \"safe sodomy\" in \"open-minded\" state-fun ded sex-education classes, but he'd better not find the m praying to God. Sound alarmist? Listen to some of Satin's i deas. imagine advocating the following to that 1930' s audience in the Ziegfield Theater in our earlier conceptual tim e-travel experiment. Satin advocates overthrowing such thing s as patriarchal attitudes in which women are the victim s of the male psyche with the societal consequences of a mal e social order resulting in an overbalance of rationality, c ompetitiveness, and independence;15 and egocentricity--the false pr ide and selfishness stemming from the view, grounded in dualism, that we are our bodies. Satin (and historian Theodo re Roszak) observe that this mentality can be blamed on archaic Jewish and Christian beliefs;16 scientific single vi sion, the analytical scientific viewpoint which breaks things down to analyze them, failing to see their unity--therefore , \"a male trait\" that alienates us from \"mother nature\";17 an d finally nationalism--that archaic mind-set that keeps us fr om world-citizenship and that is grounded in territori ality and distrust.18 Satin's alternative to this \"Six-Sided Prison\" is a New Age society that is androgynous and feminist,19 neo-occ ult and paganistic,20 tribal and cooperative,21 and both lo calized in a feudal sense as well as fully and globally planetiz ed.22 New Agers hold that the dark and foreboding ho rizon of impending nuclear war is an important catalyst that will help force the planet into a new awakening, breaking dow n walls of resistance.

Outward necessity forces the dire reali zation. The media is a powerful instrument in harping on the cr isis of our atomic and ecological time clock. The pressure can also come from another direct ion. Many New Agers believe that the crucial triggering mecha nism for this global event will be through the appearance of a world messiah such as Maitreya who will establish the New Age-- that it will take such a one to raise the temperatu re high enough to create the change. Even visiting Princeto n University professor and United Nations consultant Johannes Galton has expressed the view that the world was wa iting to be unified, and that this would happen through the appearance of a messiah.23 Professor Galton ventured the notio n that this messiah would be triggered by science but did not elaborate beyond this. The Los Angeles Times of September 3, 1978, st ated that none other than Aurelio Peccei, founder and driving forc e behind The Club of Rome and one of the first endorsers of th e United Nations-based Planetary Initiative project announce d: \"I think mankind is building up something within itself wher eby it will be able to make a jump.\" And what will trigger this? Peccei named the two-pronged New Age apocalyptic ag enda: a disaster and a messianic savior. \"One disaster, o ne charismatic leader\" could trigger this transformation, Peccei c laims. The United Nations-related group called The Pl anetary Initiative for the World We Choose was conceived in January 1981. According to its Organizing Manual, its cospo nsors were from the Association for Humanistic Psychology, The Club of Rome, Global Education Associates, Planetary Citizens (a United Nations group whose honorary chairman is Nor man Cousins), and the United Nations Association of New South Wales. The wording of the Organizing Manual of The Pl anetary Initiative is noteworthy. Well-known writer Dave Hu nt has seen the manual and cited it in his writings. This manual divulges: \"The Planetary Initiative project will de velop ... an"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"enduring network of individuals, local groups and g lobal organizations ... for contributing to the creation of a peaceful, just, and humane world order.\"24 Does this sound a little like Orwell's doublespeak? Dave Hunt observes that the names associated with The Planetary Initiative read like a Who's Who. Its newspaper periodical, named The Init iator, bears a name not without potent import according to New Age terminology. David Spangler, a Planetary Initiative board o f directors member like Muller, as well as a New Age leader, ha s said something rather revealing about his idea of spirit ual initiation and its eschatological role in the New Age. Not all New Agers will agree with or even know about Spangler's definition of initiation when he says: Lucifer works within each of us to bring us to wholeness as we move into the New Age ... each of us is brought to that point which I term the Lucife ric initiation.... Lucifer comes to give us the final ... Lucifer ic initiations ... that many people in the days ahead will be facing, for it is an initiation into the Ne w Age.25 How can women help push for a New Age? By gett ing angry and becoming a political force, as our media constantly remind us. Women must see themselves as oppressed, and then make sure to blame it all on men and patriarch al society. Then they can attack it from another direction: The y can elevate their self-esteem by remembering who they r eally are. Who are they really? Goddesses who have been forced into amnesia by primitive men trying to keep them from t heir true potential. New Age feminist and conference speaker Charlen e Spretnak in her book The Politics of Women's Spirituality (N ew York: Anchor Books/Doubleday, 1982) teaches that, accordin g to one reviewer, \"Goddess worship, paganism, Wicca, an d witchcraft are all names for a form of natural reli gion that is centered around the mystery, sexuality, and psychic mysteries of the female. The book is a clarion call to women to"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" regain their natural power and to overthrow the glo bal rule of men. The author's starting point for the re-establi shment of female dominance is in bringing an end to Judeo-Chri stian religion.\"26 Charlene Spretnak was a key speaker at an even t that The Los Angeles Times on March 16, 1982, billed as \"God desses of Coming New Age Probe the Meaning of It All.\" This Ne w Age feminist conference resolved that churches shou ld either adopt New Age beliefs or be shut down. One backdoor approach in bringing this about is to give New Age definitions to Christian doctrinal terms (i.e. atonement means a t-onement with the divine). Can this backdoor approach work? There was a recent Presbyterian Congress on Rene wal that took place from January 7-11, 1985, in Dallas, Texa s, entitled \"The Five Year Plan for Evangelism in the Presbyter ian Church--The New Age Dawning.\" The amazing thing is t hat the keynote speaker, Bruce Larson, is a self-confess ed evangelical, touted as a shining light of faith in his shrinking, politicized, and intractably liberal denomination o f Presbyterianism. Bruce Larson has gone on record as saying great things about the coming \"New Age.\" The words by now might begin to have a familiar ring as Larson says: I had and have now a growing belief that we ar e in the beginning of an exciting new age ... which I believe is already imminent ... (and will) change life for all people upon this globe ... inner space and inter-space will become just as important, if n ot more important than outer-space. Mine is not an isolated hope. Carl Jung stated that in Jesus Christ there is made possible a new rung on the ladder of evolution. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin talks about his dreams for the evolution of a new being and a new society.... My dream is that we are on the verge of such a discovery.27 Larson's naive concession illustrates the powe r of the"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"backdoor approach. The denominational churches espe cially are being caught sleeping. Just when the church in Nazi Germany should have been waking up, it too had been falling asleep. When it came time to take a stand, they cou ldn't, as the German evangelical movement found out. In littl e time, they lost their religious freedoms and the church b ecame a mouthpiece for the state, as it now is in Russia. Wh at happened to those individual Christians who did take a stand? To use an Orwellian term, they were disposed. No one c ould see the writing on the back of the barn. Are people now any less naive or blind? Hardly. Again, consider the United Nations' declaration: \"Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are prescrib ed by law.\" The New Age has an underside that nobody wants to s ee. Its words are sweet and its promises are full of utopia n optimism, but it has all the weaponry in place for an awesome coup. The changing of the guards of key conceptual p aradigms-- to use this seemingly harmless term--will squeeze t he life out of the church, while the laws of the state, by the presently emerging agenda, could close down Christian function s overnight. Meanwhile, New Age \"Christian\" churches w ould flourish like state churches today in Russia. They w ould slip right into gear with smooth compromises, along with everyone else, and slide into a post-Christian neopagan era, intractable and totalitarian. It just might be Mystery Babylon revealed.

No matter what, I had to keep looking on as I pressed myself down into the thick burgundy chair in horror. Vivid impressions of the ancient Roman world penetrated my five-year- old mind. The horrifying scenes before me depicted real events, true history, and that was the shocker. I looked on helplessly from the balcony of one of Washington's grand old cinerama movie theaters as the colossal p ower of the emperor Nero was being portrayed. In his eye s was a perverse cruelty, a concentrated evil given to arbi trary whim. He seemed a law unto himself as he played with peop le like a bored child plays with helpless insects, cutting of f this and that bit to see what happens. This emperor was so h ard that no pleading would get through to him. The fact that such a dehumanized figure could exist baffled my young min d. What power could bend such a soul so grotesquely? H ow could someone choose evil over good? He was a human monster without an atom of sensitivity, goodness, o r compassion, and he ruled the entire world! There was a reality behind this that I would learn of much later in lif e. Nero, in truth, was a vehicle for something else. He was a r epresentative and a type among a very select group. Contrasting with this terrible figure was a gr oup of people who stuck in my mind as the supreme embodiment of g ood. In one scene they were in the center of the huge Col osseum of Rome. They were being persecuted because they would not pay homage to Nero. They were loyal to Christ alone above any state or emperor, and for that they would die. The crowds in the Colosseum roared. They wanted entertainment. Christians by the hundreds were spread across the arena.

Peace radiated from their faces. Nero could not stand it. Finally he gave the thumbs down. Huge iron gates into the arena opened as scor es of lions entered the stadium. The lions left some of t he Christians alone as they sang and stared fearlessly into the c rowds and at the emperor. Others were mauled while still singing. In the end, all died with dignity, leaving the Circu s Maximus in an eerie silence. The emperor's desire for a blo od orgy was completely frustrated, but only for the time being. My terror increased as I saw the city of Rome a ll ablaze. I recall asking my parents to take me out of the movi e theater. The face of Nero grinned as it flickered with a sca rlet light radiating from the enormous flames. Perhaps he was punishing his subjects--mere insects to him--or seeking new f orms of entertainment. He sang mad, intoxicating songs. Massive crowds of the populace wailed in the background as they ran in helpless terror to escape falling columns and co llapsing buildings. Nero ranted and laughed. How did he of a ll people end up with so much power? Why this evil creature a mong men? After the fire of Rome, Nero blamed the Christia ns. Waves of persecution rolled on even more grotesquely. It was an affront to everything I instinctively felt, to see that evil and falsehood could hold such power. This situation cri ed out to be judged. As the mobs of Rome went wild in the stre ets looking for Christians, believing their emperor's li es, the powerful figure of Paul the apostle reassured the b elievers in the catacombs of Rome of ultimate hope. Nothing coul d quench their hope or their goodness. I sensed somet hing far mightier in the Christian martyrs than the despotic evil that Nero embodied.

Dr. Metzger, a man with five Ph.D.' s and one of the world's most brilliant evangelical schol ars, was a key reason I was at Princeton during the last years of his tenure. There was no question that the Neronic pers ecution was real history--that this all happened in Rome. In deed, the mortar of the early church was persecution. It was incredible what the ancient Christians s uffered-- and did so time and again without God invisibly rem oving them from the scene! That is history. Like their Chr ist, they too suffered martyrdom, and they expected no less. Christ himself had told them: \"If they persecuted me, they will persecute you\" (John 15:20 RSV); \"Blessed are you whe n men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account\" (Matthew 5:11 RSV); and \" If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and t ake up his cross and follow me\" (Mark 8:34 RSV). Paul had followed suit, saying, \"When reviled, we bless; when persecu ted, we endure; when slandered, we try to conciliate\" (1 Co rinthians 4:12-13 RSV). And Paul knew from experience what thi s was like. Paul was stoned at Lystra; he and Silas were beaten by a mob in Philippi, then with lacerated backs sang hym ns to God; he had experienced the near-lethal 39 lashes o n various occasions; and he had a long imprisonment in Caesare a, was later sent to Rome as a prisoner, and died a martyr . He says to some of the slow-witted believers in Corinth: \"Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, th ree times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the o pen sea, I have been constantly on the move\" (2 Corinthians 11: 24-25). Paul's litany of trials goes on and on. If God could allow such trials to happen to th e apostles and early Christians without removing them from the scen e, should modern and postmodern Christians count on an y less? The wrath of man should not be underestimated . As we see in the Roman era, it can seem almost as bad as t he wrath of God from the receiving end--almost."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" The ancient Roman historian Tacitus, who like m ost of his contemporaries did not sympathize with the Christian s, describes what he saw after the great fire of Rome i n his Annals, XV, 44: Therefore to scotch the rumor [of his starting the fire], Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a class of men loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled Christians. Christus, from whom they got their name, had been executed by sentence of the procurat or Pontius Pilate when Tiberius was emperor; and the pernicious superstition was checked for a short time, only to break out afresh, not only in Judaea, the home of the plague, but in Rome itself, where all the horrible and shameful things in the world collect and find a home. First, then, those who confessed themselves Christians were arrested; next, on their disclosures, a vast multitude were convicted ' not so much on the charg e of arson as for hatred of the human race. And their death was made a matter of sport: they were covered in wild beasts' skins and torn to pieces by dogs; o r were nailed to crosses and set on fire in order to serve as torches by night when daylight failed. Ner o had offered his gardens for the spectacle and gave an exhibition in his circus, mingling with the crow d in the guise of a charioteer or mounted in his chariot ... it was felt that they were being sacrif iced not for the common good but to gratify the savagery of one man. This happened in A.D. 64, around the time that the apostle Paul was martyred.

An anonymous letter was laid before m e containing many people's names. Some of these denied that they were Christians or had ever been so; at my dictation they invoked the gods and did reverence with incense and wine to your image, which I had ordered to be brought for this purpose along with the statues of the gods; they also curse d Christ; and as I am informed that people who are really Christians cannot possibly be made to do any of those things, I considered that the people who did them should be discharged. Pliny's letter to the emperor Trajan describes the reality of emperor worship and the very real fact that Christia ns lost their lives for refusing to engage in this brief ac t. One wonders how many Christians of today could face death with a nything approaching this degree of raw courage and faith.

T hey would jump through any hoop-including burning incense to an altar and uttering a quick one to the emperor. They have already done as much to stay on TV. All these voice s would beg the emperor just like they beg their TV audienc es. Don't they ever fearfully wonder whether they might be am ong that massive crowd of false believers who hear the sting ing sentence of Christ uttered after they implore him, \"Lord, Lor d, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name ... perform many miracles?\" And Christ will respond, \"I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\" (Matthew 7) . Rather than awe or reverence, they tout God's name w ith the cheap flippancy of game-show hosts. Christians of today, alas, have no idea how mu ch harm these \"Christians\" have done. What is incredible is that they would dignify them with even a moment's airtime. Pa ul had well warned the Ephesian elders at the port of Mile tus, on his third missionary journey, that the church would be inundated with false Christians throughout the ages, coming bo th from within and from outside the church. The epistles wa rn that such false teachers would ply people for money, exe rcise their secret lusts, introduce false doctrines, and seek p ersonal glory. The condition of the church today reflects t his very spiritual cancer. The church is flaccid, ignorant, and unprepared. It has subsisted on a diet of candy and junk food. If most of the contemporary church were somehow able t o change places with the early church, it would be in dire straits, capitulating its beliefs instantly at the first moment of discomfort before it got even within earshot of Rome 's Colosseum.

John wrote in his first epistle to those u nder his leadership that the spirit of Antichrist who will c ome in the end was already at work in the world in his forerun ners (1 John 2:18). Like mounting refrains in a symphony, Nero for eshadowed the climax. He was but one of many antichrists. Joh n lived to see Nero. By the time John recorded the Boo k of Revelation in A.D. 92, Domitian sat on the throne of the Roman empire. By then, many Christians had been mart yred and the imperial cult of emperor worship was fully enforced. The caesars, who were considered to be \"vehicles\" f or the Roman gods, by the time of Domitian's reign claimed to be fully god incarnate. Until that time they were give n the title of gods posthumously. The line between life and death for early Chris tians was the following: The test of fidelity to the state involv ed public ceremonies before altars of Caesar across the empire . Subjects were to proclaim Caesar as Lord and offer incense to his likeness at the altars. Subjects referred to Domiti an (A.D. 81-96) with the words dominus et deus noster: \"our Lord and God.\" Those who refused this test of loyalty to the state were seen as \"haters of the human race,\" a term we saw i n the account of Tacitus. Josephus and others revealed th at Jews, as subjects under the empire who had a long-establishe d religion, were exempt from this. Not so with Christians. it wa s before these Roman altars that Christians were rooted out repeatedly. Christ was their Lord, not Caesar. They c ould not with integrity utter the words Kaisar est Kurios, \" Caesar is Lord,\" while offering incense to an idol of Caesar. They recognized what spiritual powers of darkness worked through this system of tyranny, where the emperor sat in th e seat of godhood demanding to be worshiped by his subjects. it was an ancient theme that would reappear across history during that span of time between the first and second adve nts of Christ, but this span would not endure forever.

The final denouement of evil would be so great that God himself would have to intervene in the aff airs Of the world. When asked about the world conditions before h is return, christ told his apostles that these future days wou ld be more wicked than the days of Noah. How evil were those d ays? They were sufficiently wicked for God to send a glo bal flood! The biblical record in Genesis mentions that virtua lly the entire human race mocked and defied God. The common picture we have is that the race engaged in various perversities and occult-sexual practices in a hedonistic feeding frenzy. The lid had been blown off. If they retaine d a patina of spirituality to justify it, it required removing th e knowledge of God and replacing it with some kind of sorcerize d nature religion. We are certainly crOssing taboo barriers today. The definite picture we do get of Noah's day is that al l moral restraint was broken so that \"all flesh,\" except fo r the family of Noah, was now rotten beyond restoration. \"The Lo rd saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time\" (Genesis 6:5). Like Sodom, it re quired a total purge. Such was the antediluvian world before the flo od.

Now they belie ve its secrets are being rediscovered. How ironic if this is in reality the Noachian age, and a foreboding sign ind eed if such \"secrets\" from Noah's day are being rediscovered in today's occult revival. It is not impossible. The era of the Roman emperors was a major refra in in history's vast symphony. Christ spoke of many antich rists that would come. Some would be miracle workers. The y all would claim to be divine. Jesus spoke of this in Ma tthew 24:24: \"For false Christs and false prophets will ap pear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even th e elect--if that were possible.\" Their effect would be to delud e and deceive masses of people, counterfeiting themselves as the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Messiah. The concluding climax would be the final A ntichrist-- one figure over the entire earth. He would come as an eschatological personage, not a collective symbo l (as the Reformers viewed the papacy), though he would have h uman forerunners, other antichrists. To the world he wou ld be the Messiah. In the Old Testament, Daniel describes the Ant ichrist at the close of his vision of future things. Daniel 11:36- 37 (KJV) gives the profile: And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that which is determined shall be done. Neither shall he regard t he God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. Indeed, he will \"honor the God of forces\" (ver se 38)--or Satan. Paul further focuses in on this eschatological personage in the second letter to the Thessalonian church: Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling to meet him, we beg you, brethren, not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter purporting to be from us, to the effect that the da y of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebelli on comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himsel f against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God (2 Thessalonians 2:1- 5 RSV).

Now they learned from Paul that a general apostasy, a falling away o r rebellion, needed to come first before the Lord would return. Evil would increase, while the scaffolding of the nominal chur ch-at-large would collapse. The world would rebel against God a nd his truth. They also knew that the final Antichrist had to come not as a collective symbol, but as a man, \"the man of sin.\" Paul reveals the source of the Antichrist's power: \"The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, sig ns and wonders, and in every sort of evil that deceives th ose who are perishing\" (2 Thessalonians 2:9). THE BOOK OF REVELATION: THE ANTICHRIST AS \"THE BEAS T\" As we have seen, the Antichrist has been calle d the \"man of sin,\" the \"son of perdition,\" and \"the lawless o ne,\" as well as other descriptive terms. In the great apocalypti c book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation, he is call ed \"the beast.\" The most extensive New Testament descriptio n of his activities on the earth at the time of the end is d ocumented in the Book of Revelation. These descriptions are couche d in apocalyptic imagery and language, giving a very viv id sense of the outrageous reality of this being. He may use the body of a man, but we are admonished that he is far more th an a man. A massive, ageless power is occupying a human body to fulfill a deadly agenda centuries in the making. The trick is not to be fooled by the illusion of a man's body operating li ke a puppet. Why is \"apocalyptic language\" used? Apocalypti c imagery and language is needed when mortal minds are grappl ing with dimensions of reality that go far beyond the s enses, such as the spiritual dominions and realities so out of the reach of most men. Add to this the fact that these unreachab le spiritual realities are to be described operating in the dist ant future, and the challenge of communicating this bec omes incredible. Apocalyptic language is the only concei vable medium to say anything at all."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" God, using the apostle John as his instrument, would not invent some Aramaic or Greek word for \"holographic laser scanning\" that by its own future context could not possibly have any meaning at all in the ancient culture of 2 000 years ago. John the apostle cannot say, \"Oh yes, it was a laser operating at a billion joules of power,\" or \"After they achieved nuclear fusion...\" or, \"Particle beam weaponry in a dvanced satellites...\" He could only describe things with a vailable imagery. Even in the 1920's these same terms would have no meaning. Even as recently as the early seventies, p eople would be baffled by a statement like, \"I booted up my IBM 386, but since it was MS Dos and operating at 17 megaher tz, there was no way it was compatible with the old CPM disk I was trying to open up.\" Now imagine suddenly being able to glimpse int o the far future from the ancient world, then being told to d escribe that utterly different world 2000 years ahead. Add to th is an ability to discern spiritual realities at work, and the job of communicating this to contemporaries and others acr oss history is titanic. Only God can find a linguistic medium t o do this--apocalyptic language: visual and symbolic met aphor that describes spiritual and concrete realities int ersecting and acting in concert. There will be lessons in apocaly ptic descriptions applicable to any era, such as the age less struggle between good and evil, but only when outward condit ions approximate the time of the prophecy do things real ly pop into view. That is why Luther and Calvin almost gave up on the Book of Revelation! The Book of Revelation is like a four-dimensiona l moving hologram. Daniel was told when he asked God the mea ning behind his baffling vision of the future, which see med to carry the symbolism of a dream: \"The meaning of the se things will not be shown until the time of the end. \" So too with the Book of Revelation. It unfurls like a massiv e master plan or blueprint opening into view as the calendar of world events progresses. It is a tough book to deal with. It has carrie d multiple levels"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"of meaning. Below are the main ones. For one thing, the Book of Revelation had a mes sage to the early believers of its day about the real powers at work behind Rome and the caesars. It provided a context for thei r persecution, spiritual insight regarding the source of this adve rsity. It encouraged the efforts of the early church to ma intain the faith against immense opposition. All this help ed the church survive this first wave of persecution (the preterist view). Revelation also portrayed the rising and fallin g tides across history, the patterns and interplays between good a nd evil, the kingdom of God versus the principalities and do minions of Satan (the idealist view). Many suggest that Revelation also showed the sh ifting stages of church growth versus church decay and apo stasy throughout history (the historicist view). Finally, the Book of Revelation showed the supre me blueprint of history and the outcome at the end, pr ophesying the last days right up to Christ's return (the prophetic futurist view). What all this means is that the Book of Revelati on provides ultimate meaning to history and portrays ultimate h ope no matter to what heights evil arises. It also predict s the end of linear history with its grand conclusion as well as its cyclic movements. We see that history is indeed \"his story \"--and nothing can thwart God's plan. As has been said, the Book of Revelation gives us a glimpse of the Antichrist, also known as the beast, who is to come in the final days before Christ's return. This is by fa r the most complete revelation of the Antichrist, adding furth er detail to all the other prior biblical sketches. Revelation, c hapter 13, describes this future reality: The dragon [Satan] gave the beast his power an d his throne and great authority. One of the heads of the beast seemed to have a fatal wound, but the fat al wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, \"Who is like the beast? Who can make war against hi m?\" The beast was given a mouth to utter proud wor ds and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months. He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--al l whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world (verses 2-8). Then another powerful figure emerges two verse s later: Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. He exercised all of the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and i ts inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabita nts of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could spea k and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. He also forced everyone, small and great , rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or his forehead, so that no one coul d buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666 (Revelation 13:11-18). The beast, or Antichrist, and the second beast , or false prophet as he is sometimes described, form an aweso me power. They are directly empowered by Satan himself , who is called \"the dragon\" in the Book of Revelation. Satan gives a human agent his throne and his powers for the first thine in history. John has just revealed in the prior chapter, Re velation 12:9, that \"The great dragon was hurled down--that ancien t serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole worl d astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.\" It is the dragon that seeks out and establishes the beast. In the very first verse of chapter 13, the chapter about t he Antichrist, the dragon initiates the process: \"And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast co ming out of the sea.\" Again, the sea represents the endless mas ses of humanity from out of which the beast emerges physic ally. That is the physical shell, the body, but what abou t his soul? Indeed, what about the soul of the Antichrist? Here is another deep mystery. Those who have read my book Ri ders of the Cosmic Circuit will see far more completely the d ynamics of demonic possession as it takes place with the heavi est of today's New Age emissaries in India. There is an an cient and secret path for this mystery initiation to unfold. I myself felt these ancient forces in south India beginning to un ravel my soul. My former guru--India's greatest miracle-work er, Sai Baba--had totally undergone this possessive transfor mation. As with all \"enlightened\" masters, we used the term \"there's nobody home\" inside the shell of the body--meaning there is no human ego. We, his disciples, assumed it was God inside. It turned out to be something else. This is deadly serious stuff, and the following gives us a further hint ab out the Antichrist. We now discover that the soul of the Antichris t has another"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"source. In Revelation 11:7, we are given a hint: \".. . the beast that comes up from the Abyss...\" The abyss is that shaft of infinite darkness which is the holding place and ga teway of the demonic powers and principalities. The beast do es not have a functioning human soul, but is in a state of total possession. A spirit being from the highest of the demonic hierarchy, if not Satan himself, enters the body of the beast. At last Lucifer walks the earth as \"the god of this world.\" What God prevented from happening at Babel when the world spoke one language--a unified world system un der an earlier prototype of the Antichrist, Nimrod--is finally allowed to happen. For only once in history a one-w orld system, with Lucifer at the helm empowering and wor king through his Antichrist, is allowed to take place. I t is the crowning abomination, the completion of the prophet Daniel's \"abomination of desolation.\" In the Book of Revelation we gain an interesting glimpse of the Antichrist. He is inspired and empowered by Sat an while the hidden powers and kingships of the earth provid e the floor plan for his emergence. The kings surrender t o him their dominions. It is a reemergence of the former great empires, embodied last of all by Rome, but it stretc hes beyond them. The territory of Europe today comprised the c entral corpus of Rome. This revived Rome is to reappear agai n. It is interesting that 1992 is being pinpointed for a uni ted Europe, commercially and otherwise. Nations must surrender a degree of sovereignty for this to happen. One highly place d international banker remarked to an acquaintance of his that a shadow government of ten or twelve men in internati onal finance would be the true rulers of this merged Eur ope in 1992. One could almost think of them as the true in visible kings, the banker kings, who would pull strings whi le almost no one would know who they were. The 2000-year-old Book of Revelation continues to unfurl. The beast will be in the control seat of an aw esome power: the world's military arsenal. This will give him di rect powers"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"over life and death--the life of every citizen on t he earth. He will be feared the way the Roman emperors were feare d. We see this with the words, \"Who is able to make war w ith the beast?\" The rhetorical answer is clearly, \"No one o n earth.\" U.N. leaders since Alger Hiss have talked of a global military force policed by the United Nations. Leade rs in high places, such as Brzezinski, who wrote Between Two Age s, have spoken of a simultaneous surrender and merger of Am erican and Soviet military powers to enforce world peace. It would be run by a third force, a \"neutral\" force. This ha s been a long-term goal of the Trilateral Commission, the Bi lderbergers, as well as the Council on Foreign Relations (the CFR), among a number of elitist groups. This shadow gover nment, in place for some time, will be waiting in the wing s for the switchover and surrender of powers to take place. T hese are the real movers and shakers of history. Once the gl obal police force is in place, there will be no turning back, n o divvying back the chips to once-sovereign nations. Picture, therefore, a global umbrella of Star Wars technology--satellite-linked supercomputers communi cating in gigabytes, total-eye satellites, lasers, particlebe am weapons platforms, ICBM's--now under centralized control once the merger of Soviet and American military arsenals has taken place. Orwell's Big Brother, portrayed in the novel 1 984, did not approach this kind of supreme power. And come t o think of it, what better imagery could the apostle John 2 000 years ago--indeed, a thousand years before the Dark Ages- -use to describe the reality of some futuristic laser and S tar Wars technology than the descriptive phrase \"fire coming down from heaven\"? No better metaphor was available in t he ancient world. Like his predecessors the Roman emperors, the beast will indeed have life-and-death power over ev ery inhabitant of the world. For good reason they will ask, \"Who c an make war on the beast?\" The beast and his ally are also empowered with enormous spiritual powers directly from Satan. They are able to work deceiving miracles. The beast is at the axis of the world's new"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"religious system, which in reality is a revival of what the Book of Revelation terms Mystery Babylon. The second beast is his high priest. In the ancient world, the source and root of t he various occult mystery religions was Babylon, founded by Nim rod soon after the Great Flood. From there its metaphys ical system moved into culture after culture. But Babylon's secre t mysteries are due to revive as a world religion. Ev ery evidence today seems to point to the fact that this is happe ning right now. The beast, like his predecessor Nimrod, is to be the messiah of this global religion, receiving worship from the inhabitants of the earth who will also worship the dragon. The mystery of Lucifer will finally be unveile d--\"They will worship the dragon.\" Foreshadowings of this have re cently appeared. Blatantly, there has been the rapid appear ance of the phenomenon of satanism. On a subtler level, Ali ce Bailey pointed to a coming Luciferic New Age initiation, a s has David Spangler, a major New Age leader. New Age eve nts dotting our horizon form a rising aggregate of voic es speaking of New Age initiations. The spirit beings in the ch annelers echo the teachings of Mystery Babylon, with its divi ne within and its expectation of the coming world messiah. So who are they and where are they from? Couldn't they be from among the host of \"the dragon and his angels,\" these enti ties ranging from Ramtha to Lazarus? The third global domain that the beast has tot al control over is the world's banking and economic system, wh ich is now finally centralized. He is the mystery banker a s well as the messiah. This reality has been foreshadowed by the Roman emperors whose images appeared on ancient coin s accompanied by words proclaiming their deity. The i mperial cult and commerce were interlinked. This ancient li nk will be forged once again. A surviving structure of this ha s existed in recent centuries in the Masonic orders where commer ce and an occult brotherhood form a secret link.

Yet the apostle John describes a reality that has o nly recently come into focus: global banking, laser scanning, an d the universal computer bar code. As was recounted earli er, John recorded the following 2000 years ago on the island of Patmos: \"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or o n his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless h e had the mark, which is the name of the beast...\" (Revela tion 13:16-17). It is a tiny step to go from using a Visa card or a bank card on the Plus System and other ATM machines, in which th e electronic strip is attached to the card, to puttin g that same strip of information on the human body so that it c an be laser scanned. This has already been done with laser tatt oos and implanted microchips. It is only since the advent o f networked supercomputing (we are close to fifth generational autonomously intelligent machines, as we saw foresh adowed in Arthur C.

It is t he guaranteed welfare of socialism traded for the price of freedo m-- that's the barter of the whole earth. As under Orwell's Big Brother in 1984, there is barely freedom to think. The mind dares to move beneath th e surface, but that is all. In the end, all who differ with th is agenda will be found out and exterminated. Like the pogrom s of 60 million in Russia, or the millions of political p risoners killed in Cambodia, or the tens of millions in China, or the millions and millions of \"political\" prisoners kill ed during our present era, so too this genocide--which is by no means too fantastic to conceive of since it has already h appened-- will happen again.

To achieve this, he will try to totally abolish any evidence of the knowledge of the true God from the face of t he earth.

Indeed this very thought seduced the highest created intelligence in the uni verse. It was also great enough to cause the fall of the enti re human race.

Peo ple find it infinitely desirable and beautiful, its promises ir resistible, as it seems to hold such great promise. This thought s eems to answer our greatest hopes and longings, our deepest struggles with our identity in the cosmos, and our quest for ultimate meaning. It is the Great Lie. It is the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Surism, Joinism, Sikhism, Tao ism, the Kabbala, the Greek Hermetic and Eleusinian Gnos tic beliefs, Neoplatonism, all the occult creeds from T heosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucians, as well as too many cults to mention. It is the central foundation stone of the New Age movement. The tenets of the Great Lie have been chanted on the banks of the Ganges since time immemorial. Weather-beaten sages have uttered secret syllables and mantras in caves to invoke its powers. Modern meditators have sought to plumb its secret depths as they have gathered in intimate mee tings from MIT to Esalen, from Greenwich Village to Marin County, from the west bank of the Seine to Cambridge, Englan d.

It is behind the body language of the out rageous and autonomously defiant Berkeleyite cruising down Teleg raph, or the straight yuppie in the corporate world waiti ng to run a line of coke and then go to a wife-swapping party c um seance. Now all those wild little desires can be acted out without real risk because it is God playing the game with himsel f. The Hindu term for this is Maha-lila. One can sin witho ut consequence since it is all a cosmic game of hide-and-seek anyw ay. In mainline Hinduism this does not apply, for karma hangs over the head like a mountain. But many Westerners use the guru's argument from the Bhagavad Gita that any acti on is permissible if done in the right consciousness, eve n killing. Rajneesh cites this all the time. Thus part of the Great Lie involves blotting o ut the reality of the consequences of our actions. People hate to acknowledge them anyway. It is like the odd defiance, the turni ng against reality that we witness in the homosexual u nderworld now that AIDS has killed hundreds of thousands. Now many are even more profligate, swapping partners li ke they are on a merry-go-round. Yet the whirlwind of self- destruction follows along behind--as real as a tornado uprootin g a Texas ranch house. Genesis 3 recounts the fall of man through the Great Lie. Satan, speaking through the serpent, promised Adam and Eve that they would become like God. In the same br eath he assured them that there was no death--that death is an illusion. \"'You will not surely die,' the serpent said to the woman. 'For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes w ill be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil'\" (Genesis 3:4,5). Here it is: \"You will not surely d ie\" and \"You will be like God.\" It is a direct contradiction to what God had"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"told them and what Adam and Eve knew in their consc iences. In Goethe's masterpiece Faust, the question is aske d Mephistopheles, \"What is the fastest thing in the U niverse?\" The answer is that it is a thought, \"when the will turn s from good to evil.\" How great the plunge! Adam and Eve fell f or it and fell from a vast summit, taking all of the human ra ce with them. It was a cosmic event. Originally Adam and Eve were exemplars of ever ything we long for. At the height of their created powers, th ese federal heads of the human race had the full capacity of im mense intellects and clear consciences--without taint of original sin. They had original righteousness. Their senses were razor-sharp. This was human potential at its best; nothing dulled their vital intimacy with their Creator. If w e believe the biblical record, these two foundational heads of th e race were created perfect. With all their faculties operant, living in paradise, the ideal environment, experiencing deep fellowship with the living God, they fell for the Great Lie. I t was the unhindered human will without the environmental arg ument of: \"I grew up in a poor family in Detroit and was abused as a child, and that's why I did it.\" There were no excuses. The will alone was accountable--the naked will. Und er these conditions they chose evil, and their choice flew in the face of both reason and reality. That alone ill ustrates both the potency of the lie and the human vulnerabi lity centering around the self, the \"I.\" The lesson is this: If our two perfect federal heads of the race succumbed by their wills, can we be so confide nt that we ourselves won't fall as they did? We have so muc h less and are but blemished images of these original para gons. If they fell in paradise, how are we supposed to fare in a corrupt world inundated with evils of all kinds? In God's great salvation plan, only the doors of grace can f ree us, and such grace can only come through the mystery of the Messiah's atoning act. God's counteroffer of grace has been on his terms, not on the serpent's. Unfortunately, multitudes have opted for the latter's offer because it felt g ood, it"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"seemed right. Playing God with their own wills, man y have declared it the more desirable choice. But the Great Lie did not originate in Eden. I t came through one cosmic being far superior in capacity t o the two perfect humans who were later seduced. The most endowed created being ever, who witnessed the creat ion of the physical cosmos before time began, wanted to be come God and ascend above the throne of God. Isaiah 14:1 2-14 (KJV) recounts this pivotal cosmic event: How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, so n of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations! For thou has said in thine heart, \"I will asce nd into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will asc end above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.\" The fall of Lucifer heightens the issue of wha t took place in Eden. In deep heaven, the will embodied in Lucif er existed in the most-exalted spiritual regions, unli ke Adam's physical existence. For in the midst of heavenly sp lendor, bathed in the love of God, the unimaginable Viseo D ei, free of any possible influence or pull of physical exist ence (the Gnostic excuse), and with the most lucid of intelli gences imaginable, the will still chose evil. Cambridge phi losopher Austin Farrer pinpoints Lucifer's perversity of cho ice as that of \"preferring the sterile satisfaction of pride an d self-will to the inexhaustible wealth of a participation in the life of God.\" This becomes the most monstrous of imaginable sins. To Farrer, this incident depicts \"without obstruction what perversity is--the perversity expressed in any and every sin.\" Human perversity \"can do all the devil can do in ma king an absolute beginning of evil; this at every moment in time.\"1 "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" Lucifer fell and became Satan, the father of l ies.

No Star Wars imagery can depict this complex and fallen being. His footprints, however, can be s een across time, across human history, as the great adversary of God who is the architect of the Great Lie, and the secr et mystery religion upon which it rides. The almost 2000-year-old Book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, summarized and distilled over 1500 years of Jewish prophecy in its far-reaching vision of ultimate one worldism. Brooks Alexander comments on this futu re global empire involving economic, political, and mi litary forces under an occult gnosis which appears in a si ngle unified system of oppression and delusion known as Mystery Babylon. Ten years before the term \"New Age\" appeared, Brooks Alexander, founder and director of Spiritual Counterfeit Projec ts, wrote in the early seventies: \"The Bible gives us a clear, if unpleasant picture: in the last days of history as we know it, our race will be brought together in a common expre ssion of cosmic humanism. This coming great world religion w ill offer itself to us as the ancient wisdom and hidden truth underlying all the religious forms of history.\" Why \"Mystery\" Babylon? Something is a mystery as long as it remains secret and hidden from public disclos ure. Yet the Book of Revelation says that the mystery will be reve aled. The public proclamation of the mystery only takes effec t when the prophecy becomes activated at the critical historic al moment. As Brooks Alexander notes, \"Mystery Babylon is a spir itual system that is founded on the widespread public dis closure of previously concealed information.\" Keep in mind tha t Hinduism has both exoteric and esoteric knowledge. There is a polytheism-pantheism for the general masses, and th ere is a"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"high level \"advaitic\" monism for the higher initiat e. Tantra has always been extremely secret, though gurus like Rajneesh are starting to popularize it in ever-widening circ les. Why does the Book of Revelation pinpoint Babylon ? What can we glean from Babylon-of-old if its mystery is t o be revealed? Isaiah warns God's people of Babylon's deadly d elusion. God reminds them, \"I am the Lord, and there is no o ther.... I did not say to the offspring of Jacob, 'Seek me in chaos' [or the formless void]. I the Lord speak the truth, I decla re what is right\" (Isaiah 45:18 RSV). God is the great \"I AM.\" He is transcendent. He is not the impersonal Brahmin of Hi nduism or the void of Mahayana Buddhism. Only He claims the title of the \"I AM.\" But what of Babylon? Did it not seek t he divine within while living by the hedonistic pleasure prin ciple? Again, that same pattern keeps appearing--a society given over to the hedonistic pleasure principle, shatteri ng moral laws, while teaching the divine within. That was Bab ylon-of-old, and it seems to be resurrecting in our day--in Euro pe and America as well as other places. In Isaiah 47, God exposes the spiritual realit ies of the Babylonian religion as he addresses Babylon: \"Now the refore hear this, you lover of pleasures, who sits securely, wh o say in your heart 'I am and there is no one besides me' ... [Go d's judgment] shall come to you in a moment ... in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the great power of your enc hantments. You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, 'No one s ees me'; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, 'I am and there is no one besid es me' (Isaiah 47:8-10). Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title of \"I AM\" and identified the human self w ith God. They were also earmarked by their sorcery and their hedonism-- that was the essence of Babylon. Their occult practi ces, such as astrology and channeling, undergirded this. God was not denying that such occult pursuits gave them experiences and powers. After all, God said \"in spi te of your many sorceries and the great power of your enchantm ents.\""},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"But the root source of this occult power was the dra gon himself, never God. God abhorred these practices. I srael was warned with drastic words to stay away from Babylon' s occult practices, the way a parent warns a child to avoid an electric power line that has fallen and could kill the child with a touch. The presumed wisdom, like the child with the parent , is that God knows some things that mortals don't. His warni ngs then were against the same occult practices that ar e surfacing today. They could equally apply to every New Age ho listic fair where hundreds of booths are selling crystals, pyra mids, and so forth while live channelers are opening the door s to the void. Apart from a miracle, it is hard to deny that Mystery Babylon is resurrecting again. What does God say about the Babylonian channele rs as he warns Israel to avoid contamination? And what do we gather about the \"familiar spirits\" that work through thei r human vessels? God by no means denies the reality of \"fam iliars\" or \"familiar spirits,\" but we learn that they are demo nic and not to be trusted--that these spirits teach the Great L ie, just as they are doing again today through J.Z. Knight and Jach Pursel. They are enemies of the one true God. Indee d, as we saw in the first contact in this book from the numb er-one bestseller Communion, Whitley Streiber even speculat ed that his otherworldly visitation might have been the anc ient goddess herself--none other than Astarte. Modern au thor Streiber himself used this very name of the goddess ! Yes, even the gods and goddesses are demonic, or maybe I should say especially the gods and goddesses are demonic. God from the beginning warned of the Babylonian / Canaanite/Chaldean sorceries. Here are some clear scr iptural examples--again, think of a parent warning a child of a downed power line which is arcing thousands of volt s: And when they say to you, \"Consult the mediums and the wizards who whisper and mutter,\" should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? (Isaiah 8:19 NASB) ."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" There shall not be found among you any one who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, any one who practices divination, a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or a medium, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord (Deuteronomy 1 8:10-12 RSV). Regard not them that have familiar spirits, nei ther seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I Am the Lord your God (Leviticus 19:31 KJV). If a person turns to mediums and wizards, play ing the harlot after them, I will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people (Leviticus 20:6 RSV). A man or a woman who is a medium or wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned with stones, their blood shall be upon them (Leviticus 2 0:27 RSV). To put it simply, the Babylonian occult arts we re an abomination so serious that they were a capital offense among t he Israelites. Remember Jane Roberts and her pluralistic entity , Seth and Seth II, recounted in our first chapter of contacts ? How would that fit into the rubric of biblical explanation? W e see a perfect example of a pluralistic entity when Christ confront s the Gadarene, who when asked his name responded that it was \"Legion.\" Why was that his name? The demons in the man responded \"for we are many\" and then they begged no t to be sent into the abyss when they were exorcised. As an illustration of the concrete reality of these demonic possessing spirits, Christ sent them into a large h erd of pigs nearby. The pigs charged off a cliff and into the s ea, killing themselves--not at all normal behavior for a pig. T he man \"Legion\" had in his possessed state exhibited a suf ficient range of superhuman and paranormal feats to scare e veryone"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"away. Among other things, he had the physical stren gth to snap heavy chains. But when Christ appeared, the demo ns trembled in horror. Legion was demon-possessed. After he was exorc ised, his countrymen were awed when they found him fully clot hed and in his right mind. Somewhere in his past he had opened the door for these \"familiar spirits,\" just as Jane Roberts had when she played with the Ouija board and got Seth. She hooked a spiritual manta ray. Yet Roberts was only t oo accountable, for at a specific time in her life she turned her back on the God of the Bible. She refers to that era scor nfully, making sure to give us all the caricatures. She say s that as she grew older she found it increasingly difficult to a ccept the God of her ancestors. \"God seemed as dead as they w ere.\" But what is interesting is that this modern and libe rated woman, after caricaturing God, confessed to being i gnorant about the Bible. Instead, she turned to the revelati ons of Seth. Channeler Jane Roberts chose to follow the one who bears the same name as the Egyptian god of evil, Seth, th e ancient twin of Osiris--Seth, whose image is carved in the dank, musty descending corridors of stone beneath the Val ley of the Kings, whose huge stone colossi lean against the bu lbous pillars of Karnak, a subterranean god from the anci ent past of Egypt. This multiple entity, Seth, claims to have n ever been enfleshed. Little wonder--this being from the void existed before the foundations of our world. It floated acr oss the ancient world, maybe even into Babylon, for it is a spirit; it has always been a spirit, and there are others. As we saw, the Old Testament calls it or them \"familiar spirits.\" Paul reveals still yet another mystery--that t hese spirits can even stand behind idols, like the idols of anci ent Babylon or of modern India. Paul says, \"Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God\" (1 Corinthians 10:19-20). He calls them \"elemen tal spirits.\" Paul also says, \"Now the Spirit [of God] expre ssly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by g iving heed"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons\" (1 Ti mothy 4:1 RSV). Such was the story of Jane Roberts, who fell aw ay from the faith to pay heed to doctrines of demons. Channe ling is by no means new at all. As we plainly saw in the Old T estament it came right out of Babylon. The Babylonians also had a radically different view of reality compared to Israel, another reason they were declar ed off-limits. NIMROD--AN EARLY ANTICHRIST The Tower of Babylon, its founding edifice and spiritual center, observes Brooks Alexander, \"was an astral te mple representing the structure of reality. As the 'cosm ic mountain,' it tied heaven and earth together. It was the all i nclusive image of the totality of the universe.\" Alexander a dds that \"in the ritual act of ascending the astral altar, the p riests acted out the stages of god-realization and the inner meaning of mankind's oneness with the cosmos. The Babylonian mo narch was the focus of the occult power channeled through the activities of the priesthood. He was regarded as a divine being, a god-man.\" The monarch was also the one through whom the gods spoke. He was the initiate who could travel to the realm of the gods. He was the mouthpiece for the gods and goddes ses of Babylon. The secret wisdom of Babylon is a direct an cestor of India's mystical system, from its hidden wisdom of man's inner divinity and its priestly class, to its gods and goddesses. Pantheism fuses with polytheism, just as in India. How did Babylon's mystery religion suddenly app ear in the ancient world? The Book of Genesis informs us th at before the flood, the world was in a frenzy of \"wickedness .\" God's wrath fell, while a remnant was preserved in the ar k. But scarcely had the waters of the great flood abated when, sure enough, the Great Lie appeared again. Nimrod f ounded the city of Babylon centered on the tower, that temp le of man rising to the stars. He appointed himself as its sa vior, and again the mystery religion rose from out of the flo odwaters. If"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"some sorcerized hedonism caused the whole earth to fall away from God, bringing on the flood, then that han dful of survivors would have been very aware of it. Noah's sons had very long lives and very long memories, and Nimrod' s father (Cush) was a son of one of Noah's sons--\"Cush begat N imrod\" (Genesis 10:8 KJV). Nimrod's father caused the first great apostas y in the postflood world, then Nimrod was able to introduce the ancient mystery religion. It appealed to his lusts, his van ity, and his ambition. He was feared and adored. Later he was ki lled by those who understood the nature of this ancient bla sphemy. His almost preternaturally beautiful wife, Semirami s, was pregnant and she bore him a child, claiming that it was her husband, Nimrod, coming back as the godman Tammuz. Reincarnation appeared and formed a building block f or the mystery religion. It enabled the divine family to r each godhood, as it does in India today. Likenesses of Semiramas and her son have appea red on coins, statues, murals, and in all manner of temple icons. She is the great goddess--from Diana of the Wiccans and neopagans of today, as well as of the ancient world (one thin ks of the great temple of Diana in Ephesus), to the great goddess of India, Shakti. Her name has changed many times thro ugh history, as has that of her avatar son. She was hea venly Venus or Cybele, Jove's wife, mother of Janus, the god wit h the all-seeing-eye. She was also Minerva, Europa, Ceres, and Ashtoreth. In India she appears in many forms. Noted English archeologist and antiquarian Ale xander Hislop says of this goddess and child: The Babylonians, in their popular religion, supremely worshipped a goddess mother and son [Semiramis and Tammuz]. From Babylon, this worship of the mother and child spread to the ends of the earth. In Egypt, the mother and child were worshipped under the names of Isis and Osiris. In India, even to this day, as Isi [or Parvati] and Is hwara"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"[The Indian God Ishwara is represented as a babe at the breast of his own wife Isi, or Parvati].... [Hi slop says] ... the Hindu mythology, which is admitted to be essentially Babylonian, could not have been subdued. 2 The mystery religion of Babylon is the root of all mystery religions, the secret initiations, the exalted prie sthoods and, above all, the secret knowledge. It promises the ke ys to the tree of life, immortality, as well as divinity. A f ully functional flow chart of this whole process is most clearly se en in the world's greatest reserve of this belief system, Ind ia. India has been the place where the mystery religion has taken root unhindered. It has distilled over the centuries int o a refined wine--the Chateau Rothschild of religious wines. Revel ation reports that the whole world becomes drunk on the w ine of Babylon. BABYLON'S GODS AND GODDESSES TODAY India's sages (from Shankaracharya to Patanjal i) became over the centuries the think tank for Babylonian mys ticism. In India we see the crossover, from the dualism of vil lage idolatry to the monism of the sage claiming to have merged w ith God. India takes us from the Vedas of the dualistic gods to the Upanishadic breakthrough. Village India worships th e gods on the lower strata, till the villagers realize tha t the self is embodied in those gods and, through them, transcend all and become the one god, Brahman. Such is the refined Brah manism of the yogis and rishis. A supreme moment of crossover was illustrated when ninteenth-century Ramakrishna identified with the Ben gali goddess Kali and, once becoming her, destroyed the illusion of separateness by destroying the image of the godd ess on a shard of glass. Then he experienced enlightenment and claimed to become Brahman. Ramakrishna reported that he became the overmind, and entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi . He did it through Kali, through the doors of Babylon, i n the arms of Semiramis. He adored his goddess Kali, also know n as"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Durga, also known as Siva's consort, Shakti--Sacta, the tabernacle, the goddess of Babylon. It was through t he spiritual system of Babylon that Ramakrishna became enlightened -- that is the link. Ramakrishna became possessed by his cosmic godd ess and joined the cosmic aristocracy. He claimed to become God through the yoni of the goddess, and that is the ne xt secret doorway through which to merge with the goddess. Th is mystery path is highly developed in India's Tantra. It is sex with the goddess through a woman as a vehicle--that is why the temple of Diana in Ephesus had temple prostitut es. Sex through them was a way of worshiping and touching t he goddess herself. That was why Venus was known as a goddess of lusts. The goddess behind Mystery Babylon in the Book of Revelation is called the \"whore of Babylon.\" There is double entendre--it is both spiritual harlotry as w ell as physical harlotry. The temples of India to this day have temple prostitutes. Mystery Babylon dances through history, but her garments and dance remain the same. It is a forbidd en fruit that men and women crave: sensual fulfillment and g odhood, a hard combination to beat. This shiny apple of Tan tra is what Indian superguru Rajneesh holds out to his tens of t housands of Western followers. But his secret ceremonies of t rue Tantra are even more amazing, as I point out in Riders of t he Cosmic Circuit. Modern feminists are rediscovering the great g oddess. Certainly nothing can seem to lift a woman's self-es teem more than becoming a goddess. That indeed appears to be one solution to \"problems of self-worth and identity.\" To them it vindicates the feminine in a universe where too muc h male principle seems to be operative. An injection of th e cosmically feminine is required. If the goal is judicial equal ity in society, then the same alternative must be applied to the cosmos. Followers of the goddess say that a male de ity must be counterbalanced with a female counterpart. It on ly makes sense in an era of judicial egalitarianism. It also brings back androgyny. Margot Adler, a modern witch, points out in Bringing Down the Moon that it is now time for the s isters to go"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"out and do the magic circle and summon the goddess. Such \"consciousness-raising,\" suddenly a reality in our modern world, was unforeseen by humanist intellectuals who thought they were moderns who had left the supernatural beh ind. But then again, they wouldn't have recognized Mystery B abylon's attire if it were dancing before their eyes. The my stery danced right by them. The goddess of Babylon even dances across the T V screen. Joseph Campbell, whose book The Power of Myth has be en the number-one New York Times bestseller, has done a no teworthy job in service to the goddess. Indeed, through the insights of Joseph Campbell, Semiramis and Tammuz have returned once again to the modern world as inner mythologica l figures. They are archetypes of the self, the heroes within. The gods are the gateways to one's own godhood. If one does not worship the goddess outwardly like the Wiccans, one can still encounter her as an archetype within. For neopagan \"advaitins,\" she helps them realize their true identity, The Her o with a Thousand Faces (also the title of Joseph Camp bell's book). This too fits the secret gnosis of the mystery reli gion. There is a goddess for intellectuals as well as sensualists. It is an uncanny fit, a supreme work of genius. And if you h ave discernment, you can see the handprints of its arch itect and his mystery religion. Today's Tower of Babel, using the building bloc ks of ancient Babylon, will be forged into a supreme edifice syncr etizing all the world's mystery paths. Babylon-of-old provides t he clue to this all-encompassing system which the apostle J ohn saw in an immense vision."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"20 The Hidden AristoCRACY As the massive pieces of this emerging global order fit into place, it must be emphasized that by no means are a ll the pieces just airy \"spiritual\" abstractions creating the mere illusion of globalism.

It is important t hat we glimpse this enormous piece of the puzzle to apprec iate the reality behind what has been going on. Gears an d levers of history have been moved and adjusted, and a larg e-scale game of Monopoly has been played, with real currenc y and real assets shifting hands--a game with very re al winners and losers. It is not at all out-of-the-question th at such \"players\" would finance the New Age movement with t heir publishing and broadcasting monopolies using it as the religious arm for this plan. We have seen what the New Age movement has been able to do in the changing of the guard from the old world order to the New World Order. The New Age piece of the puzzle is by no means the dominant one, as so many have thought. The New Age movement may have its very greatest role in influencing free and affluent nations such as America to go along with t he global plan for a New World Order. People operating out of self-interest do not surrender their freedoms and heritage unless they are persuaded that there is something better a head. Meanwhile, there are quite a few already-socialisti c European nations who will be more swayed by the outward prom ises of a socialist political agenda than by some New Age v ision.

The meshing of the net of steel to capture the worl d has been a quiet conspiracy out of public view. Its big events, as we shall see, have taken place at quiet meetings wh ere an elite few move enormous amounts of capital. The superrich and the superbrilliant have teamed up while the masses watch television and eat at McDonald's. Their small, dull , prosaic worlds never embrace the truly colossal perspective around them. And should one of the masses look up for a se cond, there is always an army of experts, intellectuals, and skeptics to ridicule any suspicions. It is the \"complexity o f life\" argument tied in with the \"random forces of history \" argument that sages of today use to numb a public deeply pre occupied with their own immediate problems. The world has had an elite few operating in th e shadows of history and far from public view. These insiders ha ve avoided the spotlights flooding the main stage of history. Other actors have been thrust onstage, but the ones directing th e drama have been backstage. This fractional minority of pe ople can only activate their plans of power and affect milli ons and millions of lives if they remain out-of-view and be yond suspicion. It is a dangerous and risky undertaking, for they a re vastly outnumbered. Secrecy is critical. To someone who is an atheistic materialist, th is idea seems preposterous. People have but one life to live, so what would inspire loyalty in or sustain any participant in so me grand-scale conspiracy to take over the earth, if those who fin ally benefited were not even on the scene for another fe w hundred years?

Each player in the game can feel the impending victory when he manages to reach some rem ote crank or dial and turn it while out of public view. He becomes a cosmic player in history. He feels as if he is in the body of some corporate messiah. He can feel a kind of trans national allegiance to a higher cause, not to speak of the e xtremely generous temporal rewards of wealth and prestige he will usually accrue as part of the plan. The lesser play ers in the game can continue to be motivated by the rewards of the moment. There are benefits at every level. Almost 200 years ago, in 1797, one of the most respected scientists in the world wrote a book entitled Proof s of a Conspiracy (London: Creech, Cadell, Davies Publ., 1797). He was John T. Robison, secretary general to Scotland's pre stigious Royal Society and professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He was considered to be on e of the truly great intellectuals of the day. Science was called \"natural philosophy\" in that day. Robison was also a high-deg ree Mason. Whenever he traveled to Europe from Scotland , he always attended the Grand Orient Masonic Lodges. But when Robison had recently been in Europe on a sabbatical, he detected a new element in the Grand Orient Masonic Lodges. More than that, Adam Weishaupt, the founder of this new elite, approached Robison to join an inner circle kn own as Illuminism. It was the quiet flame that burned in t he French intelligentsia such as Voltaire, Robespierre, Mirab eau, and the Duc D'Orleans. The Illuminist plan was to unseat the present powers of hereditary aristocracy and replace them with an int ellectual aristocracy, using a staged revolt of the masses to do this. "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"This, indeed, was exactly what the French Revolution appeared to be--key people catalyzing great numbers of peopl e. Robison warned the royal family of England tha t hidden powers were pulling strings--that the French Revolut ion was not a historical accident happening by whim, but th at it was manipulated by geniuses who had their own agenda. T here was one genius in particular behind Illuminism. Lik e Karl Marx, he was of Jewish descent, but had temporarily joined the Jesuit Order. Later he got into league with som e powerful German merchants who were initiates in the occult. Adam Weishaupt was a professor of canon law at the Unive rsity of Ingolstadt. He started the Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. His plan was to use the Grand Orient Lodges o f Europe as a filtering mechanism through which to screen ou t talent and build a hierarchy of inner circles. Like the Ma fia of today, only the inner inner circle could be trusted with t he true purpose of the Order. The true purpose of the Illuminati, according to Professor Robison, was world hegemony: a world order ruled by an elite pretending to represent the common man, an el ite who had penetrated every aspect of society from the art s to politics and law while shaping public opinion with more subt lety than the average citizen was able to detect. Weisha upt's plan involved a communistic order outlined a full 70 yea rs before Marx came on the scene. Weishaupt was exposed in 1785 when the Bavarian government stepped in and seized his papers. An unknown variab le had caused exposure. The hidden hand was forced to come out of the shadows for a moment. The horseman, name d Lanze, carrying various secret papers and plans to France, was struck and killed by lightning in Regensberg. Th e local police handed the papers over to the Bavarian govern ment. When the Bavarian government questioned four profess or colleagues of Weishaupt, they testified to the cons piracy.

Rumor remained that the Illuminati then shifte d locations to Italy, calling itself \"the invisible 40.\" By the early 1800's, Weishaupt and his conspiratorial Illuminists were m entioned in the correspondence of George Washington, Jeffers on, Madison, and John Quincy Adams. They did not want t his plan infiltrating America any more than Robison wan ted to see it in England. They had seen the ruthlessness o f France's \"Reign of Terror.\" George Washington wrote in 1798: \"It is not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Illuminati and the p rinciples of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am.\"1 That was 200 years ago, and indeed a connecting thread e xisted through the 1800's. It had to do with merchant bank ers and occultists, as well as other invisible players. 200 YEARS LATER Today, the power of a certain group of bankers is colossal according to Harvard and Princeton professor emerit us, Carroll Quigley, who confessed to being an insider and conf idant of this elite group. Professor Quigley's magnum opu s, Tragedy and Hope: A History of Our Time, rocked those who s aw it when it came out in 1966. This 1300-page book named majo r insider power groups attempting to manipulate a world socia list order. Quigley ardently supported the plan, but sai d that it should no longer be under cover. His book was a tri umphalist announcement of the inevitable, since the plan had virtually reached completion. He had been among the intellect ual brain trust rubbing shoulders with the insiders.

When I got a copy of Quigley's book, Tragedy a nd Hope, printed in Taiwan (an exact copy of the original Ma cmillan book which my friend owned), I was amazed. Indeed, Professor Quigley had let too much out of the bag. That book and others opened a cryptic doorway. It enabled me to g limpse the reality of some of the elite insiders manipulat ing world events in order for their plan to take shape. The r eality of what was happening was even more incredible than Ro bert Ludlum's Matarese Circle. Here finally was tangible evidence of insiders who were so well-versed at removing the ir own fingerprints that they slipped detection. Evidence had previously come in faint traces here and there; certain names kept cropping up. When author Ian Fleming, who for years had been a member of the British Secret Service, wrote a bout James Bond combating such secret conspiratorial grou ps as Smersh and Specter, one wonders whether he was indu lging in more than just fiction and showing insider's kno wledge thinly veiled. According to Quigley, yes, such hidd en groups most certainly do exist, and they are beautifully c amouflaged. The average person would not think twice as their stretch limousines with tinted windows glide down P ark Avenue or London's Bond Street. Harvard professor emeritus Quigley divulges th e following about this \"international network\" in Tragedy and H ope: This network which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists or any other group, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of it s instruments.2"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" In the next sentence, Quigley differs on only one point with the insider network: \"It wishes to remain unkn own.\" Other sources have led me to believe that Quigley w ent very deep, but that there are things even deeper. Quigley summarizes the insider's grand plan: \" Their aim is nothing less than to create a world system of finan cial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. Th e system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by th e central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreement s arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.\"3 This i s almost a perfect description of the secret international mee tings of the Bilderbergers: \"secret agreements arrived at in freq uent private meetings....\" One fact that Quigley and others reveal is tha t the banking houses owned by the great family dynasties are also the banks behind the International Monetary Fund, as well as The World Bank. The same names keep cropping up. They are king makers and nation breakers. The goal is a global ce ntral bank--once national banks have been established and conditions are right. So far, the central banking system projected f or Europe in 1992 is a major milestone to this goal--and not a s mall part of this gradualist agenda is America's own central ban k, the Federal Reserve Bank. National debt is highly in thei r favor. The two trillion dollars now owed to them by the Un ited States, as they wear the outer attire of the Federa l Reserve Bank, gives this inner circle of select banks yearly interest payments of over 100 billion dollars. Elections and stock markets can switch directi ons overnight with a directive from the Federal Reserve. Alan Gree nspan, the visible chairman of the Federal Reserve, could change the prime lending rate and cause a panic, a recession, indeed, a depression with a single word. The politi cian who does the bidding of the insiders gets in the door. It is always"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"good policy to justify substantial loans from these banks. The rhetoric is irrelevant and has been for a very long time--just watch one president after another promise to balanc e the national debt, then watch it quietly climb off the graph. The debt will soon equal the sum total assets of the na tion. How do banks and money barons manipulate condi tions? According to Harvard economist John Kenneth Ga lbraith, Winston Churchill was shown an interesting object l esson by New York banker and industrial magnate Bernard Baruch in 1929. Baruch, of the lineage of the money changers, was an advisor to President Wilson at the Treaty of Versai lles, beside that other great advisor, \"Colonel\" Mandel House. Bar uch also advised Roosevelt and was a member of his brain trust. During World War I, Baruch, when he was chairman of the War Industries Board, made hundreds of millions of d ollars from lucrative contracts in the war and munitions i ndustry. He was at the right place at the right time. Accord ing to Harvard economist Galbraith, Baruch walked Sir Winst on Churchill out on the floor of the New York Stock Exc hange the morning it fell.4 Churchill was brought to witness t he crash firsthand on October 24, 1929, because it was desir ed that he see the power of the banking system at work. This p resumes plenty of lead time for Winston to take the ship fr om England to the United States, hang out for a while, maybe s tart the day with a good breakfast at the Waldorf, and make it t here in time to see the floor open up. This is insider knowledge that would pale Simon Boesky's. We will see later why Baruch gav e Churchill this object lesson. The American market collapsed that day of 1929 , and so did the world market not long after. Economic condition s for the next world war were set up, greatly aided by Americ a's Great Depression. Billions of dollars shifted hands overni ght. Some had gotten out in time--the big hitters--while scor es of the wealthy were destroyed. Then, after the crash, when railroads and industries plummeted, the big hitters came back on the stock market floor and bought industries at whi m for a dime on the dollar. One such \"fortunate speculator\" was"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Bernard Baruch who had boasted to Churchill that he ha d liquidated his stock holdings when the market was a t the top and bought bonds and gold, while retaining a huge c ash reserve. Now he could buy companies like pieces on a Monopoly board. Millions of lives were wrecked, and America su ddenly needed a \"New Deal\" in the form of social welfare. The Great Crash created another precedent for free America: gr adual socialism, as the Fabians had been doing in England . Why would any banker or insider be the least bit attrac ted to socialism? Because the idea that socialism is a shar e-the-wealth program is strictly a confidence game to get the pe ople to surrender their freedom to an all-powerful colle ctive. It is a means to consolidate and control wealth. Once this is understood, it is no longer a paradox that the super-rich promo te it. Here is another riddle: Once the central banks become \"socialized\" as in Britain, the ownership remains th e same. Rothschild still controls the Bank of England, and th e Bank of England is still a private bank. As a central bank, it is literally above the law. While wars and revolutions have been useful to international bankers in gaining or increasing control over gover nments, the key to such control has always been control of money. You can control a government if you have it in your debt. A creditor can demand special privileges from the sovereign. Money-seeking governments have granted m onopolies in state banking, along with natural resources, oil concessions, etc. But the monopoly that the interna tional bankers most covet is control over a nation's money . The famed quote of Lord Rothschild to his friend Benjamin Disraeli, England's first Jewish prime minister, wa s, \"As long as I control a nation's currency, I care not who makes i ts laws.\" Disraeli's novel Coningsby, a thinly veiled story th at involved Rothschild, contained the following interesting quot e: \"The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\"5 This is true. International bankers actually own as private companies the central banks of the key European nations. The Bank of"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"England, Bank of France, and Bank of Germany are not owned by their respective governments, as most people ima gine, but are privately owned monopolies that were granted by the heads of state. That is precisely why the London Fi nancial Times of September 26, 1921, revealed that, even at the t ime, \"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could up set the whole fabric of government finance by refrainin g from renewing Treasury Bills.\" But Professor Quigley revealed that these visi ble heads at the top of the Big Five Banks were only front men, th e agentur of the invisible international bankers. Again, it w as imperative that the shadow figures stay in the shadows and wor k behind front men. Quigley directly addresses the is sue of the front men of the state banks of Europe: It must not be felt that these heads of the wo rld's chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the domInant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers (also known as \"international\" or \"merchant bankers\") who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks.6 Such a front man was Montagu Norman who was go vernor of the Bank of England. He suddenly came to America the year of the Great Crash, in February of 1929, to con fer with Andrew Mellon, the Secretary of the Treasury. The W all Street journal on November 11, 1927, had already referred to Norman as \"the currency dictator of Europe.\" Wrong. He was the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"front man for Lord Rothschild, the true currency dic tator of Europe. Norman, a close friend of J.P. Morgan, had said of himself, \"I hold the hegemony of the world,\" accord ing to Dr. Quigley. John Hargrave who wrote the biography about and entitled Montagu Norman, cited the dream of thi s titular head of the Bank of England: \"that the Hegemony of W orld Finance should reign supreme over everyone, everywh ere, as one whole supernational control mechanism.\"7 Norman was parroting someone else's view behind the scenes. The Fabian Society of Britain, another of Quigl ey's inner circle round table groups who were present at Versa illes, had worked up the gradualist agenda for the spread of s ocialism. Americans needed the backdoor approach. So after th e crash, which in turn started the Great Depression, in came the Trojan horse of socialism in its first small increments as Roosevelt was cast in the light of the savior of the people w ith welfare and government programs. Not far behind were his li beral advisors, including Mr. Baruch who had also advised President Woodrow Wilson (having contributed generously to both Wilson's and Roosevelt's campaigns). Take note that within a decade of Churchill's object lesson on the floor, he became one of Britain's greatest prime ministers. Hi s bid as prime minister had failed repeatedly, but with the right support, he was elected. CREATING AMERICA'S CENTRAL BANK How did America finally get a central bank lik e its European cousins'? Let's look back again. There were numerou s attempts in the 1800's to create a central bank in America-- most of these attempts point back to the Rothschilds . The Rothschilds had their invisible hands in ma ny of the early major American banking houses. One banker was August Belmont, a superstar of Birmingham's Our Crowd (whose original family name was Schoenberg). He use d to put ads in the New York paper advertising himself a s Rothschild's agent. He became incredibly wealthy. In the South,"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Rothschild had the Erlangers. It is interesting that both the original Ameri can banking houses that represented Rothschild--August Belmont a nd the Erlangers--funded the North and the South respe ctively during America's Civil War. Rothschild sent August Bel mont to the United States during the Panic of 1837 and e mpowered him to buy government bonds. Right then the Civil Wa r started. Whichever side won owed its respective ban ker for the victory. Could the goal be monopoly of capital? It seems Abraham Lincoln saw the power play be hind this masquerade as one bank was seemingly played against the other. The invisible hand underneath was never seen by the multitudes. Lincoln did see it, for he had resisted the pressure to create in America a central private bank that wo uld print its money. He also spotted the \"divide-and-conquer\" mov ement where the North was pitted against the South with b oth sides financed by the same money elite. Abraham Lincoln battled for the right of Congre ss and the Treasury to hold the awesome power of coining money . He knew that to surrender this power to private banks was ultimately to surrender the sovereignty of America. Adams and Jefferson had warned of this all along. Defying the hidden bankers, Lincoln issued the greenbacks. Interesting ly, Lincoln was soon assassinated. Forty years later there was another event: Joh n Pierpont Morgan created the Panic of 1907 and was amply rewa rded. He gained numerous holdings, as well as his bid to be the Rothschild's number-one American agent. J.P. Morgan' s real feat and service to Rothschild in the Panic of 1907 was that he created a mood in America that was receptive to a c entral bank--to be known as the Federal Reserve Bank. Morgan 's own bank, The Morgan Guaranty Trust, was allowed to be among the inner circle of primary owners of the Fed eral Reserve. It is interesting that Morgan had spent fiv e months in Europe right before the 1907 Panic, shuttling be tween London and Paris. He was gaining an inside look at Europe's central banks."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" The New York Times, October 26, 1907, noted in connection with J.P. Morgan's actions during the Panic of 1907 , \"In conversation with the New York Times correspondent, Lord Rothschild paid a high tribute to J.P. Morgan for hi s efforts in the present financial juncture in New York. 'He is worthy of his reputation as a great financier and a man of wo nders. His latest action fills one with admiration and respect for him.'\" This is the only time a Rothschild praised another b anker outside his own family. A few decades later, The Ne w York Times dropped another nugget. On March 28, 1932, du ring the Great Depression, The New York Times noted: \"Lo ndon: N.M. Victor Rothschild, twenty-one-year-old nephew o f Baron Rothschild, is going to the United States soon to ta ke a post with J.P. Morgan & Co., it was learned tonight.\" Soon after J.P. Morgan had created the Panic o f 1907, the American people were in the right mood to believe t hat a central bank would prevent such a panic from occurr ing again. When the moment was right, Senator Aldrich-- who later married into the Rockefeller family when his daughter Abbey married John D. Rockefeller, Jr.--was in plac e to push through the Federal Reserve Act. That delicate momen t was during a lame duck Senate, right before the Christma s break on December 22, 1913. Immediately before that, Aldr ich, representing the Rockefellers, with Paul Warburg, w ho represented the Rothschilds as well as the Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York, had gone to Jeckyl Island, Georgia, in a seal ed train, away from the press, to iron out how they would pre sent the Federal Reserve bill to the House and Senate. Paul W arburg was the banking genius who understood the labyrinth ine structure of the Federal Reserve Bank, and Aldrich wa s the public relations man in the Senate. Warburg had some interesting connections. Paul Warburg had come to America ten years prior, in 1902, from the Warburg Bank of Germany. He married Nina Loeb, daughter of Kuhn Loeb founder Solomon Loeb, while his brother, Felix, married Frieda Schiff, the daughter of Jacob Schiff , who was head of Kuhn Loeb. Jacob Schiff was the ruling powe r of Kuhn"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Loeb. Both Paul and Felix were made full partners of Kuhn Loeb, and Paul was finally paid an annual salary of half a million dollars (then!) to enlighten the public on the need for a central bank. His father-in-law, who paid him this colossal salary to set up the Federal Reserve, was Jacob Schi ff. Stephen Birmingham writes in his authoritative bestseller Ou r Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York, \"In the eigh teenth century the Schiffs and Rothschilds shared a double house\" in Frankfurt. Jacob Schiff reportedly bought his partn ership into Kuhn Loeb with Rothschild money--hence, the Ku hn Loeb connection with Rothschild. Once Senator Aldrich had gotten the Federal Res erve Act through the Senate, Woodrow Wilson, under the nod f rom \"Colonel\" Mandel House, signed the Federal Reserve Ac t. Among the international financiers who contributed heavily to Woodrow Wilson's campaign were Jacob Schiff, Bern ard Baruch, Henry Morgenthau, and New York Times publish er Adolph Ochs. Insider banker Bernard Baruch was later made absolute dictator over American business when Presi dent Wilson appointed him chairman of the War Industries Board, where he had control of all domestic contracts for Allied war materials. Hence his war industries profits of over two hundred million dollars. Yale professor Charles Seymour, whose collectio n of secret papers of Colonel Edward Mandel House are at the pre stigious Beinecke Rare Books Library at Yale, revealed in his book The Intimate Papers of Colonel House, that \"Colo nel\" (who was never in the military) Edward Mandel House was the \"unseen guardian angel\" of the Federal Reserve Act. His father, Thomas House, reportedly a Rothschild agent during the era of the Civil War, made millions of dollars r unning supplies through the blockades. Then he retired to Texas and sent his son Edward to Europe to be educated. \"Colon el\" Edward Mandel House almost never left Wilson's side . After Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act, no ne other than Paul Warburg became the first chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. Naturally he had to temporarily give up his"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"partnership of Kuhn Loeb. Paul Warburg remained cha irman of America's new central bank until it was revealed that his third brother, Max Warburg, who was still in German y, headed the Central Bank of Germany! It just seemed too much of a coincidence. Paul's brother Max Warburg, by World W ar II, also headed up German Secret Intelligence, which ha s baffled many fellow Jews--as has the fact that some of Hitl er's major funding came through the Warburgs, who controlled t he Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam through which they sent loan money. Once America had a central bank in place from which to borrow money, World War I suddenly arrived just in time for America to take some substantial war loans and get into the action. Versailles was the urban renewal after the \"war to end all wars.\" The goal was the League of Nations: guar anteed peace through world unity--again, \"world unity.\" THE CHALLENGE OF SOVEREIGN STATES While Europe was ready for the League of Natio ns, America was not. So those insiders meeting at Versa illes after World War I now had to regroup to get America ready for globalism. The coming Crash of '29 would help. Meanw hile several semisecret groups were formed. According to Professor Quigley, they were round table spawns. One in Ameri ca was named the CFR, or Council on Foreign Relations, a boringly neutral name. But try to become a member or walk through the door! The founders included many of tho se who had been at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, including Colonel Edward House and Walter Lip pmann. Finances for the CFR came from: J.P. Morgan; John D. Rockefeller; Bernard Baruch; Paul Warburg; Otto Kahn; and Jacob Schiff. The CFR began on July 29, 1921, in New York City. Its building is on the west side of fashionabl e Park Avenue at 68th Street. Facing it is the Soviet Emba ssy to the United Nations on the opposite corner. The flame for the League of Nations had to be kept alive at"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"all costs, and the best and the brightest had to be tapped as members of these groups. One of these groups, the CF R, traditionally divulges almost nothing about its aim s and purpose, but something did leak out once. The CFR's S tudy No. 7, published November 25, 1959, openly declared its tr ue purpose: \"... building a New International Order [which] mus t be responsive to world aspirations for peace, [and] for social and economic change.... an international order [cod e for world government] ... including states labeling the mselves as 'Socialist.'\" The roster of CFR members is thoroughly impressi ve--so are the power groups who have representatives in it . International banking organizations that curre ntly have men in the CFR include Kuhn, Loeb & Co; Lazard Freres (directly affiliated with Rothschild); Dillon Read; L ehman Bros.; Goldman, Sachs; Chase Manhattan Bank; Morgan Guaranty Bank; Brown Bros. Harriman; First National Cit y Bank; Chemical Bank & Trust; and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank. The CFR is totally interlocked with the ma jor foundations (Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie) and the s o-called think tanks (Rand, Hudson Institute, Brookings Instit ute). Figure 1, The CFR, Omitted. According to Article H of the CFR bylaws, no minutes are to be taken and no member of the CFR is to divulge the c ontent of any of its top-secret meetings. If a member shou ld do so, he is to be expelled immediately. One former member to do so was Rear Admiral Chester Ward (USN ret.). Though ther e is an elite of high military in the CFR, Chester Ward wa s a patriot. They misjudged him. The former rear admira l warned the public about the CFR saying: The most powerful clique in these elitist grou ps have an objective in common--they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national independence of the United States."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" A second clique of international members in the CFR ... comprises the Wall Street International bankers and their key agents. Primarily, they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in the control of global government. They would probably prefer that this be an all-powerful United Nations organization; but they are also prepared to deal with, and for, a one-world government controlled by the Soviet Communists if U.S. sovereignty is ever surrendered to them.8 Less than 20 years after the CFR was founded, Wo rld War II had arrived. Once that war had ended, America was n ow ready to join \"the League of Nations,\" now incarnat ing as the United Nations. America sat down in San Francisco w ith Alger Hiss and joined the United Nations, the succe ssor to the League of Nations--Alger Hiss, a charter member of the CFR; Alger Hiss, whose sympathy with communism can no longer be denied. The CFR's chairman is David Rockefel ler, and the United Nations' 18 acres of prime Manhattan land was donated by the Rockefeller family. The United Na tions charter and constitution is a thin paraphrasing of the Soviet model which Alger Hiss borrowed from when he coauth ored it. The U.N. constitution is therefore a Marxist so cialist paradigm. According to Quigley, this is far from be ing an accident. World socialism, communism and bankers! There was always the Communist question. Bankers kept cropping up in this area as well, which is odd--unl ess one understands the logic of Hegelian synthesis: the lo gic of propping up two counterforces who are to oppose one another until they merge. It is also a great way to run up national debt--weapons systems that take billions to create, that through a disarmament treaty are then trashed. This happened again and again. Did the bankers have goals for Russ ia? There are shrouded historical facts. Jacob Schiff, head of Kuhn Loeb, had given Tro tsky (alias"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Bronstein) 20 million dollars in gold bullion in 191 7 and sent him to Moscow to trigger the Bolshevik Revolution wit h his 275 comrades (now bearing new Russianized names) fro m the lower East side of Manhattan. When this long ro ster of names entered the United States Congressional Reco rd, many saw a pattern and it took the full weight of t he Antidefamation League to silence them. The New York Journal-American of February 3, 1949, cites Jacob S chiff's grandson and says, \"Today it is estimated by Jacob's grandso n, John Schiff, that the old man sank about 20,000,000 doll ars for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia.\" But there was a brief embarrassment. Trotsky (or Bronstein) and his 275 co mrades on the S.S. Christiana were held in Halifax, Canada- -their first port of call. World War I was going on, and Ca nada was suspicious. Trotsky spent five days in jail in Canad a, but the powers-that-be moved the Canadian government. So on Trotsky with the 20 million dollars in gold bullion and his 275 comrades were again back on their way to Russia. Wha t happened? The British, through Kuhn Loeb partner Sir Will iam Wiseman, and the United States, through \"Colonel\" Ho use, put the heat on Canada. Trotsky even got an American pas sport out of the deal. William Wiseman, who had also been sent by British intelligence to help bring the United States into the war, was amply rewarded for his services. After Wor ld War I ended, he stayed in America as a new partner in the Jacob Schiff and Paul Warburg-controlled Kuhn Loeb Bank. While Schiff was sending Trotsky on his way, t he German Warburgs gave Lenin five million dollars and sent h im through Germany in a sealed train. The world was distracted by World War I. Lenin was installed, and by the end of the war the Communist takeover of Russia was well in effect. Loans to Russia continued. World War II solidified things eve n more. By then, Stalin had come to power. After World War II came Yalta where Churchill a nd Roosevelt gave Stalin all sorts of concessions as they drank gallons of whiskey and ate pounds of caviar. Stalin was han ded"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"11 nations including East Germany, Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Rumania, and other satellite landholdings. Soon enough Stalin got Pola nd and Czechoslovakia through unhindered invasion. It was Ro osevelt who had held Patton back from finishing the war aga inst Germany and marching right into Moscow. Had Patton been allowed to do what he had wanted to do and continue his march, which moved without obstruction, there would be no Russian occupation of East Germany and countless oth er satellite countries. After World War II, the Commun ist bloc was far more solidified. Nations and power groups w ere being shuffled like cards in a deck, with decisions as weighted as Olympic scoring. Now another irony: Russia has apparently needed the capitalists. This is clear in the ten books by Anto ny Sutton, British scholar and member of Stanford University's Hoover Institute. Sutton wrote Wall Street and the Bolshevi k Revolution, tracing all kinds of capital flowing from Wall Stre et into Russia. Sutton also wrote National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union (New York: Arlington House, 1974) abou t how one military secret after another has somehow leake d out of America and into Soviet hands--how we somehow keep giving them our secrets after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on research to get that edge which we lo se almost instantly. Several news leaks stated that in one da y the plans for the cruise missile went from a Pentagon desk to p out the door. They were very top secret. just an innocent m istake! Months later, Russia had its own version of the cru ise missile-- so too with Polaris submarines. Sutton cites volume s of \"coincidences.\" But there were earlier precedents fo r leaking secrets. Oddly enough, it was Alger Hiss' friends J ulius and Ethel Rosenburg who shared with the Stalin governmen t the secrets from the Manhattan Project on how to build the atomic bomb.

What about other supercapitalists visiting this bas tion of communism? What about the trip to Russia in October 1964 of David Rockefeller, the chairman of the CFR and the Chase Man hattan Bank? What an odd place for a money superbaron to go -- a capitalist, no less. And what about the coinciden ce that happened after Rockefeller left Russia? A few days a fter Rockefeller ended his only vacation to Russia, the h ead of Russia, Nikita Khrushchev, was recalled from a vacat ion at a Black Sea resort to learn that he was no longer prem ier of the Supreme Soviet. He had been fired--Khruschev who p ounded his shoe on the desk at the United Nations General Assembly, the killer from the Ukraine who said to the capital ists, \"We will bury you.\" He was fired after David Rockefeller 's visit-- amazing. Also amazing was the low-key reporting of these \"coincidences\" by the press, until you examine the interlocking boards of directors of the CFR and the New York medi a: publishing, radio, and television. Then it is not s o amazing, nor is it amazing when very powerful publishing hou ses push bestsellers and create hot topics. Avant-garde and chic is always in. Traditional values are always out. Some topics are strictly taboo--Christian bashing, unfortunately, is not one of the taboos. The Rockefeller empire took off at the beginnin g of this century. Today it is colossal, though it is sometim es hard to see where their ownership ends and that of other ba nkers begins--and that includes the Rothschilds. Compared t o the Rothschilds of Europe, who have been in the banking business for 200 years, the Rockefellers are merely country s quires. But let us look at these country squires for a minut e. Seeing the panorama of their holdings is like trying to ph otograph a mirage--things shift in and out of view. At another time, we will look at the Rothschilds.

The findings were reported in Ja nuary 1975 in the Intelligence Digest of the United Kingd om. Here are those findings-- At that time, 15 members of the Rockefeller fam ily were directors of 40 corporations which had assets of 70 billion dollars. The boards on which the Rockefellers served had interlocking directorates with 91 major U.S. corpor ations controlling combined assets of 640 billion dollars. The Rockefellers have more than 200 trusts and foundatio ns where tremendous deposits of wealth are placed. The Rockefellers' first business is the oil emp ire of Exxon with its 300 subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, and secondly, the banking empire--the Chase Manhattan, t he Citi, and Chemical Banks. Closely related to these banks are three gigantic insurance companies--New York Life, Equita ble Life, and Metropolitan Life--which have interlockin g boards of directors. More than these main banks and insura nce companies, the Rockefeller investments account for a bout 25 percent of the assets of the 50 largest commercial banks and 30 percent of all the assets of the 50 largest life insurance companies in the USA. Similar influence holds true for their holdings in major corporations, including Mobil Oil , Marathon Oil, IBM, Westinghouse, Boeing, Xerox, Avon, TWA, Eastern, United, National, Delta, Northwest Airl ines, Penn Central, Safeway, General Foods, Allied Chemicals, An aconda Copper, Shell, Gulf, Union, Continental Oil, American Motors, and so on.

But again, compared to certain other banking d ynasties, the Rockefellers are nouveaux riches, mere upstarts of this century. There exist powers within powers that they have only tapped. The grand directors--the illumined see rs--are in other drawing rooms--older, larger, more palatia l drawing rooms way out of public view. THE MONEY CHANGERS AND THE TEMPLE After Christ had cast the money changers out of the temple, they went out into the greater marketplace of the w orld and in time captured it. They did this colossal feat throu gh \"money changing\" in all its aspects. The greatest internat ional banks on the face of the earth now belong to them. The following are the international banking ar istocracies of the earth, those temple money changers who have res urfaced as international bankers. They include the banking dynasties of Rothschild (in the five pivotal nations of Europe ), Warburg (Germany and Holland), Sassoon (the Far East), Laza rd Freres (France), Mendelsohn (Amsterdam), Israel Moses Seif (Italy), Kuhn Loeb (New York), Goldman Sachs (New York), and Lehman Brothers (New York).

As partnerships, they are free from audi ting. Those that are central banks of nations are especia lly free of auditing. They loan to nations as well as major cor porations and individuals. Lincoln made the following interesting observa tion about conditions around him, an observation that equally applies today: \"When we see a lot of framed timbers, differ ent portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen, and when we see these timbers joined together and see that they exa ctly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their re spective pieces, and not a piece too many or too few, not om itting even scaffolding, or if a single piece be lacking, we ca n see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared to yet bri ng such a piece in; in such case, we find it impossible to no t believe that they all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first lick was struck.\" Fifty years after Lincoln's statement, America finally did get a central bank. The blueprint for that was the one used by the same architects who established the central ban ks of Europe. Now the building materials for the grand py ramid-- hewn, polished and assembled--finally stood ready t o form the grand structure of the supreme builder masons.

But no one looking on can really set the timetable. I have always had the fee ling that I would live to see this critical apocalyptic period of the world's history; but, of course, I could be wrong as so man y others have been wrong through the centuries. It is merely a gut sense. The biblical mandate is that we are not to set dates concerning the prophetic timetable. Hundreds of Chri stian amateurs and pseudoprophets have been discredited for doing exactly that--inventing their own schema to set dates on th e prophetic calendar--when even Christ himself clearly announced in Scripture that no one knows the day or the hour of the Second Advent except God. Date-setters usually extr apolate the Second Advent from something that they have tar geted nearby it on the prophetic calendar. It never works . It is to remain a mystery. The church is given signs to look for, yet it is still supposed to watch and expect while remaini ng active and diligent in life, not passive and monastic.

In the 1940's and 1950's, Norman Rockwell's dep ictions of the happy American family sitting in a country chur ch or at the family dinner table summed up the soul of mains tream America. There was little Johnny smiling with innoc ent good cheer at his strong, stable, and loving father who was seated at the head of the table, while the mom humbly and affectionately served the dinner--each comfortable and secure in their own role. There was a feeling of stability, s ecurity, and love. These were happy people who loved one another and loved living in a free world. Not that all marriage s then reflected this, but at least the consensus was that this was an ideal worth emulating. That was the model. People k new it took commitment, and they were willing to work towa rd it. What made it easier then was that they had the full sanction of society on their side. But today, where are these people whom Norman Rockwell portrayed? Where have they gone? They have all but become extinct with the buffalo.

The one who was once the father was now experimenting with strong feelings for men. Donahue glowed with admiration. Literally, the castration o f the man had been made complete, with the wife now weari ng the pants. James Thurber's metaphor had become literal. The young daughter was still learning to \"understand\" h er new parents, \"bravely\" hiding her deep bewilderment. To the liberated, obviously this was better than Norman Roc kwell's American family of the fifties with the dad, pipe i n mouth at the head of the table with all that hierarchy and a ffection. Almost anything but the old family model is permitt ed. If science in a few short years has provided discoveri es which have destroyed much of the earth's critical ozone l ayer with flurocarbons, which are now changing the earth's cl imate, that is insignificant compared to destroying the fa mily. The fallout from that will be staggering. Among other things, it took men like Hollywood producer and playwright Norman Lear, head of People for the American Way (which should be named \"people who want to dest roy America\") to further bury the traditional family. L ear's TV superhit, \"All In the Family,\" starring the inflexi ble \"male chauvinist pig\" Archie Bunker, showed that the tradi tional family model was archaic in a modern world, and ind eed laughable. Dad bullied a passive mom. The strong da d could only be a buffoon and a bad guy who should have his authority taken away from him--yes, even by the state, if it took that. And Bunker's catholicism made him prejudiced and out-of-step. There was old world Archie Bunker to wh om you could apply the most-feared labels of all: He was \" sexist\" and \"racist.\" Of course, Lear is not from the Catholic t radition. He is free of all prejudices, right? Except when it co mes to men of"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"the type who founded America--those Christians who l oved God and country. Norman Lear made millions while he grinned all the way to the bank. He also set the ca ricature in the public mind. The traditional hierarchical famil y was obsolete. Roles had to change, and certain religious views wer e old paradigms that helped create today's problems. Meanwhile, ACLU legal precedents have been kee ping a close pace with the media Frankenstein. Reality is c atching up with film. A recent ACLU legal victory enabled t he courts to take a ten-year-old boy from his evangelical mom (described in court as \"fanatic and bigoted\") to be placed int o a more suitable household. The boy was awarded by the courts to his divorced homosexual father dying of AIDS and living with a gay lover--obviously a better environment fo r a growing boy than a Christian home. Norman Rockwell's little Johnny has come a long way! America in the 1980's has him living with his divor ced homosexual dad whose live-in lover is a man. In Rock well's era, Johnny was reading about \"Dick and Jane.\" Now there are magazines lying about like Dick and Frank, and chan ces are good that Johnny is learning all about sodomy. Ther e are videos and open doors. Johnny can come home from fo urth grade with his chums, while the dad and his gay lov er are off somewhere arm-in-arm, and play their videotapes--no t old Walt Disney films, but movies like Heavy Bondage wit h men wearing leather masks sodomizing, \"fisting,\" and to rturing each other. All this because the ACLU really cares about Jo hnny! They are deeply caring people when it comes to the Ameri can way--that is why they are spending millions of doll ars on extremely clever legal arguments that are sealing t he coffin on old America. Their very efforts prove that they have an agenda: to destroy the old America for the new.

Little Johnny's peers can score it i n ten minutes within a hundred yards of the elementary sc hool. Let it sink in. This is not fantasy.

How are the youth of these non-families develo ping? If you time-grafted today's youth culture next to the era of the fifties, no one would believe it. Who would have ever thought that God, goodness, and doing right wo uld be despised by the majority of today's youth? But it is .

Imagine a student i n the fifties appearing in class at Oklahoma State looking like t hat!

It is an ugly and hideous t urn of events--that the androgynous role-reversal is what is in. It seems impossible that this has all happened so fast . To me, these are indicators of other things on the way. All these happenings comprise what the Bible pr edicts when it describes the \"great rebellion\" and \"the gr eat falling away.\" It's as tangible as sea lions choking and dy ing from the poisons in the ocean, except this is spiritual poll ution--and it must happen for other pieces of the puzzle to fit i nto place. An interesting detail is in the Bible. Paul des cribed \"the last generation\" to Timothy. It is a description that se ems to be getting closer and more fitting every day.

We see it in all the teen movies, from Less Than Zero and The River's Edge, to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. But there are higher octane rebellions.

It is getting so seri ous that police departments have special departments and agents ass igned to this growing phenomenon--people who have been ri tually murdered and dismembered, and kids who have been kidnapped--never to be seen again. Then exsatanists try to confess the horrendous things that go on. Human sac rifice in the 1980's--that's modern progress for you. It c ertainly shows how effective \"education\" has been--that god of the culteratti. It also is a perfect profile of the las t generation. The old world order must really be expunged be fore the New World Order can come into place. This is the tr ansformation threshold, the critical mass, the full paradigm shi ft heralded today.

It will be an impressive monol ith of colossal power. There will be things about it that will surprise all of us--things we did not foresee. But some eleme nts come into clearer focus every day. I have had what I thi nk are glimpses of forces behind this emerging reality--sp iritual forces. I believe but cannot prove that these glimp ses were given to me by God. One of them was soon after I re turned from India after being there several years. I was a young Christian recuperating in my parents' London house i n Kensington. Dad, a diplomat, had retired in London for ten year s. I was still battling serious intestinal problems fr om living in the wilds of South India. A dream is a dream, but w hat I experienced was something else entirely--massive co lor: panoramic, superscreen, bigger than life. It was no t at all"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"foggy, but I was present in the experience with all of my faculties. I knew it was not just another dream but something, perhaps instructional, to prepare me for a future r eality. I am a very difficult person to scare. I used to go to horror films alone even when I was seven. But in the darkne ss of 5 A.M. after the panoramic experience was over, I w as in a cold sweat, breathing heavily. I was certain that it was not just another dream--I had spent years gear-shifting to d ifferent levels of altered consciousness. This was unique. N ow that I was a Christian, it felt as though the Holy Spirit i mpressed this direct connection with a certain reality right into my soul. In the early to midseventies, I recounted this experience to a number of close college friends who are among my best friends (Charles Jarvis, former deputy director of L egal Services Corporation; Dr. Preston Campbell, the Vande rbilt University Faculty of Medicine; Dr. Bob Brown, the Fa culty of Medicine of the University of Virginia; Dr. Tony Mo rton, a U.S. Naval Flight Surgeon; Dr. Rick Ciccotelli, Ph.D . from Princeton University and former philosophy assistan t professor at Notre Dame). I emphasize the importance of the d ate because, among other things, in 1981 AIDS hit natio nal headlines. The Main Vision: It is the Place De Canon in do wntown Brussels, the city of my father's final diplomatic p ost. It is the large medieval cobblestone square surrounded by imp ressive regal buildings. A terrible laughter fills the air and spiritual airwaves--omnipresent. As I round the corner I see a huge canvas canopy covering a throne. A huge swollen leg maybe 20 feet long rests on a ramp. A grotesque gigantic being that is the source of the laughter is mounted on the throne. I almost do a demonic mind m eld with its thoughts. I cannot begin to describe the h ideous cascade of direct feeling. I realize that this imag e represents the reality behind the triune Antichrist. One head is astoundingly intelligent, maybe an IQ of half a million, and ano ther head swings around flopping on the chest--it is ins ane beyond belief. The third head is entirely sinister, pure e vil. It wants to destroy. It is the source of many embodime nts. I"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"recognize India's Siva, who I once meditated on, as being an outward type of this creature. The being knows I am watching and that I have some understanding of its real mission--to unify and pos sess the human race, to penetrate every soul. Satan hims elf has entered this creature. A bent and mythologized hist ory of the cosmos emerges with every hideous screaming laugh. It is trying to unmake God. It is trying to keep out the knowledge that the holy God in fury will consign this creatur e to the lake of fire. It wants to destroy the apple of God's eye . I notice that sticking in the leg there are hu ndreds of hypodermic needles. Dazed, unaware people in some k ind of trance approach the leg. This is the moment they ar e to lose their souls forever. They play with the hypodermics , forcing polluted blood to go in and out. A slurping sound i s emitted. Then they plunge the needles into their arms, joini ng blood with the creature. I can see their consciousness ch anging the minute the blood has entered them--there is no turn ing back. The dazed lack of awareness of the brainwashed subj ects is terrible beyond belief. They seem unreachable as th ey walk to eternal destruction. After that, I sit up in bed and look out into the black early morning of London through the window of my bedroom. This mood haunts me the whole day. No, it's not jus t another dream--almost ten years later AIDS appeared in head lines. But blood can have other contaminants, from heroin t o cocaine, and who knows what else awaits down the road? Just a dream? I'm not so sure. I feel it was a glimpse at a spiritual reality operating behind the scenes. Some of the great writers have tried to see in to the future to glimpse this invading global reality. Aldous Huxley saw the manipulated masses in his Brave New World as being r educed to trivial hedonists, living for the moment, enthra lled with designer drugs, with no purpose for living beyond t he next shallow thrill. These drugged subjects were putty i n the hands of the state. They had no will, no character- -they could not fight the system even if they wanted to. But they"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"were not the gray masses living on the edge of abso lute poverty that Orwell envisioned in his tyrannical wo rld order. Huxley's world was one of numbed thrill-seekers. George Orwell, that famed British author and fo rmer member of the British secret intelligence, speculated about things probably from what he knew then as an intelligence insider. His 1984 is a classic, with graphic insights that h ave been almost prophetic. From the forties, when Orwell wro te 1984, he envisioned a collective semiglobal system. Peopl e were slaves without free will. They were the brainwashed masses who had no concept of history, since all books were destroyed. And what passed the censors had been rewritten to f it the confines of permitted thought. History was skewed w ith new interpretations yearly. One thinks of the father of American progressive education, John Dewey, and his idea to influence youth in state schools through textbooks--schools, mind you, with no prayer and no God. Like Lennon's \"Imag ine,\" it would be a world without heaven and hell, with only exalted man to govern his own affairs. The populace of 1984 were surrounded by sublim inal messages and the centralized eyes and ears of the state. Dou ble-think slogans were everywhere--slogans that went against the natural gut sense of the conscience and common sense, just like so many of the high-sounding social agend as of today. Orwell's \"antisex league\" brilliantly foresa w the antisexism leagues of today--that liberal collectiv e who have invaded college campuses with their nonsexist and a ntifamily agenda; this new consensus of today comprised of ga ys, lesbians, and \"minorities.\" In Orwell's 1984 there was not a moment to thi nk in privacy. \"The individual is only a cell.\" Reality is in \"the collective Mind, the Mind of the Party, collective and immortal.\" One's own child could be an informer to the ever-pr esent central control. Orwell's two-way telescreen foresa w the host of technological breakthroughs of today that could one day be used to invade privacy. The science of psychology h ad become a power, not to heal wounded psyches--its alleged p urpose"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"in the past--but to invade and take over wanton par ts of the individualist mind that had engaged in \"thoughtcrim e.\" No private thought could escape the all-seeing-eye of Big Brother. The science of behavior could even turn to the most elaborate forms of torture, in Room 101, to flush out anything it wanted and remake the mind in any fashion it so chose. Roo m 101 was deep in the massive gray structure known as \"the Mi nistry of Love,\" where thoughtcriminals were \"cured.\" \"Power is tearing human minds apart and putting them back together by your own choosing.\" The hero was being made an \"unp erson\" and told that as a heretic, \"We will lift you clean out of history. You will be annihilated in the past and in the future. But first we will make you perfect. Your mind will b e perfectly remade, and only then, destroyed.\" It's a vision of total dehumanization--an apt portrayal of the system of A ntichrist. People were seduced and manipulated from every side. And when they got their supersystem, it turned on e ach one of them, to invade them, to possess them. They had surrendered bit by bit to this emerging reality over the decade s without the need for a single shot to be fired. It was the frog-in-the-heating-water analogy. In Orwell's futuristic world of 1984, there we re no families, and sex roles had been obliterated. This fact seeme d very important to George Orwell. Intimacy and trust and attraction between the sexes had all but vanished. Tenderness was gone. Innocence and vulnerability were gone. Love b etween men and women was abolished forever. The family was obsolete. Men and women were neutered in drab uniforms. A member of the Party told a rally of the brainwashed that \"unorthodox loyalties lead to thoughtcrime; that th e family leads to unorthodox loyalties,\" encouraging \"ownlif e.\" Therefore \"the introduction of 'artsem' [artificial inseminat ion] combined with the neutralization of the orgasm will render impossible the family until it becomes impossible t o conceptualize.\" Even the memory of the family will be blotted out o f history. In the end, all human passion and genius is de stroyed in Orwell's world. The free-thinking individual has be come"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"anathema. The state has become God. Of course, Geor ge Orwell was a secularist, so it is natural that he w ould omit the metaphysical and spiritual dimension. If we added t he spiritual reality of supernatural evil, we would be closer to the mark--that is where the abyss of horror deepens far more than the dull grays of Orwell's future world. Orwel l's evil would have dimension and color and free reign once the spiritual reality was added, combined with the enor mous stakes of the eternal worth of each soul. That is e xactly the biblical prediction. Much worse than Orwell's Big Bro ther is the embodied Antichrist. And much worse than the co llective mind of the Party is the spiritual reality of a dem onic mind meld--unified mass possession by which spiritual be ings of evil possess human minds like empty clearinghouses. It is a hideous mass haunting where humans do unimaginabl e things to one another, taking Orwell's dehumanizati on a step farther. Evil intent is amplified. But there is another difference between Orwell 's future world and biblical reality. The vision in Room 101 for the human race is: \"Picture a boot stamping on a human face forever.\" The biblical picture does not permit this . The prophetic picture is simple and final--God interven es. End of story. The God of history absolutely forbids the fi nal triumph of evil, and what he does to the powers of evil and their system is horrifying beyond imagining, should you h appen to be on the wrong side. Wrath explodes from the al l-powerful God who is great enough to create the galaxies with a single word. His power is terrifying. He demolishes those who hated and destroyed good, those who terminally reje cted God and wrenched others' souls apart, and those who chased God's elect to the ends of the earth, persecuting a nd destroying the church. It is not for nothing that since the an cient church, the Second Coming of Christ has been called the \"blessed hope,\" and so it is for God's people, for the pure-hearted and the innocent.

The global banking fraternity watches helplessly as Baby lon falls in a single day. The economic spell ends as the cle verest plans are laid waste. The old apostle on the Isle of Patm os describes this moment when commercial and occult Babylon falls . John observes, in the Book of Revelation: \"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has b ecome a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit , a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird. For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries\" (Revelation 1 8:2,3). \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!'\" \"The merchants of the earth will weep and mour n over her because no one buys their cargoes any more--cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls ... and the bodies and souls of men\" (Revelat ion 18:10-13). Babylon is destroyed in a single hour! That wou ld be impossible, but for the recently emerging reality o f globally interlinked computers. John saw this 2000 years ago , a thousand years before the Dark Ages. Think about it --a system that could only be possible with twentieth-century technology, and John describes how the world economy collapses in a single hour. Already we see the New York, London, and Tokyo stock exchanges affecting each other in a mat ter of hours. But a unified system with something suddenly going radically wrong--such as a massive interlocking deb t system finally collapsing--makes a lot of sense. It really could happen in a single hour."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" John Lennon, in perhaps his most famous and in fluential song, \"Imagine,\" pictures a world with no heaven or hell. Then the key refrain soon follows: \"And the World W ill Be as One.\" Lennon's song sums up the one-world dream. He also sings of those who have this dream: \"Y ou may think I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" Len non, of course, would include those countless contemporary idealists on his wavelength. But he may have been referring to others as well, a much more esoteric group who help ed him in his ascent from Liverpool to becoming the greate st rock legend of all time. He had every instrument needed to broadcast his message, from his own prodigious tale nts to the media at his feet. His lyrics were a messianic mess age for a world (\"I'm more famous than Jesus Christ,\" he once said). And doubtless Lennon entered, upon occasion, even l arger drawing rooms than the ones in Buckingham Palace, a nd met those who might not just be imagining, but actually pulling the levers for the world to be as one. Yes, we can imagine the Lennon/Illuminist drea m for a season, but it cannot endure because its foundation stone is the falsehood of human imagination and cunning graf ted to a deeper satanic plan. It's the promise of perfection and harmony--but with God clearly left out of the pictu re. As such it is a Frankenstein monster, as empty and dead as a b ody without a soul. It is the final experiment that is doomed to fail. This pretended paradise will become hell on earth. The Book of Revelation pictures the earth as a tortured plane t: its oceans poisoned from pollution, its weather and seasons in upheaval, its atmosphere heating up to agonizing temperatures , boils and skin cancer breaking out, and a world governmen t gone haywire. God, in passive wrath, will allow the mome ntum of human folly to show its inevitable fruits. But man's hatred of God and man's embracing of a demonic system headed by Satan himself will ultimately bring God's active wr ath.
