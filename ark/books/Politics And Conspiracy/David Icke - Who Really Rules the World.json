[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David Icke WHO REALLY RULES THE WORLD?TO OUR NEW VISITORSAn Introduction from David Icke:Welcome to the David Icke website. I am a former journalist and television presenter from England who has spent the last ten years uncovering the biggest secret - who really controls the world and has done so for thousands of years.I have written ten books, including \"The Biggest Secret\", \"...and the truth shall set you free\", and \"I Am Me, I Am Free.\". Bridge of Love Publications, my publisher, has also produced several videos including \"Freedom Road\", \"Turning of the Tide\", \"Revelations of a Mother Goddess\", and \"The Reptilian Agenda.\" I reveal how a global secret society called the Illuminati (the \"Illuminated Ones\" as they call themselves) have been holding the reigns of power in the world since ancient times, expanding their power out of the Middle and Near East (and other centres) to control first Europe and then, thanks to the British Empire and other European empires, to take over in the Americas, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and elsewhere. http://www.davidicke.com/icke/visitor.html (1 af 6) [03-03-2002 11:24:03]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David IckeWhen those empires appeared to withdraw from these regions, the Illuminati left behind the secret society networks and the Illuminati bloodlines and these have continued to control and orchestrate events ever since. There are two type of prisons or dictatorships. There is the overt variety, which are clear dictatorships (communism, fascism, etc) and then there are the most effective variety of all - the covert dictatorship, the one that masquerades as freedom. People do not rebel against not being free when they think they are!The Illuminati have been working to a long planned and coordinated agenda to create a world government, central bank, army, and a micro-chipped population linked to a global computer. Anyone with an operational brain can see that all these things are now emerging ever more rapidly. Under this edifice of global power are designed to be super states like the European Union (evolved out of the EEC free trade area), the American Union (to be evolved out of the NAFTA free trade area), and the Pacific Union (to be evolved out of the APEC free trade area). NATO (merging with the UN peacekeeping operation) is planned to be the world army, the world police force, to keep countries in line who do not wish to concede their sovereignty to the Illuminati world government, which is planned to evolve through the United Nations. The structure of global control is pyramids inside pyramids. Very much like Russian dolls, one doll inside another. If you look at any organisation today you will see that it is structured as a pyramid. Those lower down the pyramid have no idea what the organisation they work for is really about. They just do their own job and go home every day. They don't know how what they do connects with other people's contribution to http://www.davidicke.com/icke/visitor.html (2 af 6) [03-03-2002 11:24:03]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David Ickecreate a very obvious and sinister pattern and direction. Only the very few at the top know that. In this way the few can manipulate thousands in an organisation to advance an agenda that those thousands do not even know exists. There is a global version of this which manipulates billions in the same way.These \"individual\" organisations, be they banks, trans-national corporations, media empires, NATO, etc., then fit into even bigger pyramids. So you find, for example, that at the peak of the global banking pyramid all the banks are ultimately controlled by the same people - the Illuminati. Same with the transnational corporations, the media, and so on. There is a global pyramid which encompasses the pyramids of banking, business, media, military, politics, and the other institutions that run the planet. At the peak of this pyramid you find the elite of the Illuminati who orchestrate their agenda for global control through all their, apparently unconnected, organisations.This is why there has been an incessant move to centralisation of global power in all areas of our lives, banking, business, media, politics, whatever. It is orchestrated by the SAME people in accordance with the SAME agenda. You will find a stream of articles on this site that will give you detailed background to this agenda and there is endless information in my books which you can order from this website.The Illuminati manipulate humanity through the mind and emotions. There are too many people and too few Illuminati to control people physically, except on a small scale. They have to manipulate the way the masses think and feel, so we live our lives and see the world in the way the Illuminati want us to. For instance, the most powerful of the manipulation techniques is one I call Problem-Reaction-Solution. It works like this:http://www.davidicke.com/icke/visitor.html (3 af 6) [03-03-2002 11:24:03]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David IckeYou want to introduce something you know the people won't like.This may be more power to the police, a further erosion of basic freedoms, even a war. You know that if you offer these policies openly the people will react against them. So you first create a PROBLEM, a rising crime rate, more violence, a terrorist bomb, a government collapse, or you get one of your Illuminati puppets like Saddam Hussein to go to war.You make sure someone else is blamed for this problem and not you, the real people behind it all. So you create a \"patsy\", as they call them in America, a Timothy McVeigh or a Lee Harvey Oswald. You then use your media to tell people what they should think about your manufactured event and who they should blame for it. This brings us to stage two, the REACTION from the people - \"This can't go on what are THEY going to do about it?\"This allows THEY to then openly offer the SOLUTION to the problems they have created - new legislaation which advances their agenda of centralisation of global power or the erosion of more basic freedoms. This technique is being used all the time on the human mind and emotions, not least with the stream of mind-contolled youngsters and adults who go crazy with guns around the world and immediately prompt gun control laws. I say this as someone who does not have guns and believes passionately in non-violence. But if we are going to be street-wise we need to look beyond our own beliefs and realise that the Illuminati is seeking to systematically disarm those who WOULD use weapons against them. Just before Adolf Hitler began to fill the concentration camps he introduced the same anti-gun legislation which we are seeing today all over the world.We are now at a crucial time in this agenda's history. So many cards are waiting to be played by the Illuminati in the next 12 http://www.davidicke.com/icke/visitor.html (4 af 6) [03-03-2002 11:24:03]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To our New Visitors - David Ickemonths.

As readers of my books will know, I am extremely wary of channeled information because while on occasions it can come from a high and enlightened source, much of it is very low level or, frankly, a sham.However, I felt that this channel was one of those who is truly gifted and a wealth of detailed information emerged that confirmed and added to my own research, which has been very much gathered in this dimension and not through channeled messages.Anyway, here is some of the information that came through relating to the relationship between the reptilian bloodline and the Illuminati obsession with ritual.

These are referred to as \"hidden spaces and planes unknown to man\", in the apparently ancient Emerald Tablets, which I quote from in \"Children of the Matrix\". For simplicity, I refer to this \"between world\" in my books as the lower fourth dimension.It is from here that they police our vibrational prison - the Matrix - and seek to addict and restrict us to the dense physical senses. This world was once far less dense than it is today and the \"fall\" down the frequencies, caused by the manipulation of incarnate consciousness and DNA infiltration, has made it so much more difficult to maintain a multi-dimensional connection while in physical form. We are now in a cycle of change when the vibration of this \"world\" will be raised out of dense physicality and return to where it once was. In doing so, the reptilians' ability to manipulate our physical form will be removed and this is why they are in such a panic at this time to prevent this shift from opening the vibrational prison door.The reptilians and other manipulating entities exist only just outside the frequency range of our physical senses. Their own physical form has broken down and they can no longer re-produce. Thus they have sought to infiltrate human form and so use that to exist and control in this dimension. They chose the Earth for this infiltration because it most resembles in vibration the locations from which they originate. These reptilians are addicted to the dense physical \"world\" and the sensations it offers and they have no desire to advance higher. Their aim in this period is to stop the Earth and http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html (2 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:02:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"REPTILIANS: WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH BLOODLINE AND RITUAL ~ Articles by David Ickeincarnate humanity from making the shift from dense physical prison into multi-dimensional paradise.[From what I understand, this dense physical world is caught in a manufactured time \"loop\", in which \"time\" is a circle, constantly repeating itself. Note that one of the ancient symbols for \"infinity\" is the snake swallowing its own tail. The pentagram or five-pointed star, so prevalent in Satanism, is also symbolic of this unbroken \"time\" cycle, the vibrational prison.The period we are now experiencing has, therefore, been played out before. We are just at that point again in the repeating circle or cycle, like a rat running on one of those wheels in a cage. No matter how fast it runs, it keeps covering the same ground. What we need to do is break the \"time\" circle and thus the prison. We are now in that part of the circle that is most vulnerable to this because of the vibrational changes taking place in this part of the Universe and this is why the control of humans has tightened so rapidly in this period - they are doing everything they can to defend their prison from the awakening of the inmates. The micro-chip is crucial to that.] Genetic corruptionhttp://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html (3 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:02:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"REPTILIANS: WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH BLOODLINE AND RITUAL ~ Articles by David IckeThese reptilians and their allies have corrupted Earth DNA with their own and this genetic infiltration lies dormant until it is activated by the vibrational fields generated by the Illuminati secret society rituals, and others in the public eye like the carefully designed coronations and official ceremonies of many kinds, including even the UK State Opening of Parliament and certainly those of the various religions.[This activation is now also being inflicted upon the general population through technology on Earth and in space, no doubt, and this channeled entity said that the cloning programme is there to develop designer bodies for the reptilians of the \"in between world\" that would not require the overpowering of an already incarnate consciousness.] Once activated, the DNA opens the body to possession by these reptilians and other beings, and this is what is happening, for example, to Freemasons in the rituals that most of them deliver parrot fashion while having no idea of their vibrational significance. This is why the Illuminati are so obsessed with knowing a person's bloodline. They know which have the potential for this activation and possession and which do not. The Mormon Church genealogical data base and now the DNA data banks are designed to identify those with the bloodline. These are the people who are given jobs and roles that serve the Illuminati agenda, while most of them have no idea what is really going on and what they are being used for. Their DNA is then activated and they go through a change of character (a phrase I have heard so many times in relation to such people once they advance in the system) and a very different consciousness takes over their mental and emotional processes.http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html (4 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:02:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"REPTILIANS: WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH BLOODLINE AND RITUAL ~ Articles by David Icke[This is why it is so important for everyone to stay well clear of ritual, no matter how innocent it may appear on the surface. I would include \"New Age\" ritual in this, too. I don't mean standing in a circle, connecting together and projecting loving thoughts, etc. I mean carefully constructed ritual that is constantly repeated, as with religious ceremony for example. I am beginning to realise why I have had a life-long aversion to taking part in ritual of any kind.] Each new generation of the Illuminati bloodline families is exposed to the appropriate ritual to activate their possession by the reptilian entities and so the cycle goes on. The phrase that comes to mind is \"...forgive them for they know not what they do.\"P.S. Apparently, this DNA infiltration is known within the inner circles of the British royal family as the \"family disease\". They are actually in fear of it because they know that once it is activated they will be taken over. But of course they are caught in a world of constant ritual and ceremony designed specifically to activate their possession. It is catch 22. Without the ritual they cannot be the royal family, but with the ritual they are activated and possessed. The thought and emotional processes of the UK's Queen Mother are not those of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the little girl officially born into that body 101 years ago. They are controlled by the reptilian entity or entities, which possessed her after the hybrid DNA activation. http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html (5 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:02:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"REPTILIANS: WHY THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH BLOODLINE AND RITUAL ~ Articles by David IckeReferenced/Related material:Emerald TabletsChildren of the MatrixThe Biggest Secret...and the truth shall set you freeTHE MICRO, MICRO, MICRO, CHIP - HOW SMALL THEY REALLY AREThe OuroborosBaphomet PentagramCapitol PentagramPentagonWhite House PentagramTexaco PentagramSee Washington LayoutMasonic Flag & PentagramSecret Societies PentagramsLink URL for websites http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/obsessed.html (6 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:02:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"David Icke Temple of Congress Symbolism Slide Showopen.html ø¾ ø¾ øÈ ̈ ÷Ð2ÿÑ: ÷Ð ¾û °|©É ø¾ ÷Ð@ » ø½î TEXTR*ch ÿÿÿÿ 9 ®-ó¹f²dÙy ••Pœ h h Frror writing the attachment.

Marketing researcher Brian Wansink, director of the Food & Brand Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, found that consumers perceive products in large packages as less expensive than smaller ones--even though they often aren't. As a result, they actually use 18% to 45% more than they otherwise would.Anthropologist Rapaille says the desire for excess comes from the \"reptilian brain,\" the earliest, most primitive structures in our mental evolution. \"The reptilian wants to grab as much food as possible, to be as big and powerful as possible, because it's focused on survival. When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the reptilian, the reptilian always wins.\"Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago, and more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and diabetes.

The prescriptions contained within the pages of this manual can set you free of this menace.In America-as in any communist country2[2]-Big Brother's modus operandi consists of bringing down the full might of the government upon any unlucky \"citizen\" that crosses paths with its divine agenda (absolute ownership and control of all property and people). Few, if any, can withstand such an assault. Operating in limited liability with official immunity, Big Brother's operatives wreak holy hell on a daily basis against any they choose, but continually walk away from the carnage unscathed.3[3] For those who follow the precepts as presented in this manual, such days are numbered, if not over.

The non-judicial Uniform Commercial Code has been cracked and is now utterly accessible for any who would examine the contents of this manual. As you will discover, the assurances made in the preceding paragraphs are not hollow chatter: this text can set you free. The treatises, essays, and historical material contained in this book are all on solid legal ground. It is not a matter of if we are on the right trail or not; it is rather a matter of how well we read the trail markings we encounter-because the remedies described in this manual are working like crazy north, east, south and west, and the successes contained herein will free you of the ranting of any critic.5[5] The main failing with professional (and amateur) critics is that that particular vocation does not involve helping people and getting things done. It just involves tearing down things that might help, and stopping others from breaking free of Big Brother's clutches-an occupational calling/hobby with a marginal sanity index. When you come across someone who is preoccupied with stopping this process and saying how bad it all is, realize that the critic is a \"company man,\" obsessed with infecting all with the venom of statism,6[6] and does not have your best interests at heart-and likely never will.7[7] An honorable critic would bring forth another solution, i.e. another remedy for the situation at hand, rather than just sounding a general hue and cry8[8] and proclaiming that all (sheep) should stand stockstill9[9] and accept their fate as \"part of life.\" As with the first two editions, the initial aim of this volume is fully acquainting you with the process of regaining control of the all-capital-letters juristic10[10] http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/redir/index452.html (4 of 11) [6/16/2002 1:14:46 PM]"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Hidden Mysteries Booksname/TRADE NAME that began appearing on legal documents, such as the Social Security card in your possession, following the registration of your birth.

The problem with such a name is that even though it belongs to you, and was created expressly to reference you, someone else has custody of it-meaning that someone else can control the travels that particular piece of intellectual property (the all-caps TRADE NAME) and has been using it for financial gain courtesy of your labor. This handbook shows you how to rectify this situation.Having accomplished the foregoing, the main objective of this manual becomes providing you with the means for fortifying your existence and deflecting all legal and financial assaults on your freedom, family, wealth, property, and peace of mind. The legality of the issues addressed herein is well substantiated in the common law and the UCC, and you are limited only by your lack of understanding of them. The Glossary contained herein has been specifically created and annotated to assist you in acquiring a working knowledge of the key issues.Material has been laid out so that the reader can go straight into the practical application of the filing instructions, adapt the sample documents with the details of his/her life, and successfully file the documents without doing anything else. However, such practice is basically \"treating the symptom\" and is not recommended because the cause of the condition-unwanted victimization at the hands of the system-is still unresolved; sort of like being lost in the jungle, finding a compass, but then not knowing which direction is the best way out. http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/redir/index452.html (5 of 11) [6/16/2002 1:14:46 PM]"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Hidden Mysteries BooksThe theory portion of this volume, as well as the items in the Appendix, affords a treetop perch for those who might be lost in the legal/commercial/political jungle: one with a bird's-eye view of the whole territory as never before. Once a bewildered traveler gets a compass reading on the right landmark, he can thereafter successfully negotiate any difficulties encountered on his way out of the jungle because of acquired certainty of where he is headed and the full expectation that he will make it. Whether you do your filing(s) sooner rather than later, steady progress between the covers of this manual, however unhurried, will give you a new perspective on the same old surroundings and produce a courage and a confidence that can fuel your journey all the way out of the \"jungle\" and onto the highroad for a better life. Because the Code has been cracked, the filing procedures and background material are now simple. Matters have now been removed from the private, monopolistic, judicial system, and players within that arena have become personally commercially accountable for their actions. These breakthroughs have thereby greatly remedied the nuisance of dealing with the courts, the courts' extreme formalism, and the secret rituals11[11] of the inner sanctum of the legal fraternity, \"the Brotherhood.\"For those reading this page that may have the misfortune of being involved in an ongoing legal dilemma, some words of encouragement: the procedure contained herein is beneficial at any stage of the game.12[12] The more entangled one has become, the more complicated it can seem to be to extricate oneself from the tentacles of those who would gleefully destroy one's life.

What is offered here can be completely locked into place in very short order and can serve you thereafter in many different circumstances.13[13] This manual will also introduce you with the very real possibility of personal independence and functional sovereignty. Believe it or not, it was the exercise of your inherent sovereign right to \"decide\" with whom you would contract that got you into this mess in the first place. The first step in regaining sovereignty is reestablishing ownership and control of the corporately colored property identified as your all-capital-letters TRADE NAME (and any and all other corruptions/permutations thereof).

Trilogy. Now this avatar of conspiriology, renowned for his razor wit and progressive philosophy, takes you on a fascinating, eclectic ride through what Wilson has termed the \"Cultic Twilight\" where conspiracy theories flourish. Everything Is Under Control covers the range of Wilson's kaleidoscopic knowledge, from John Adams to the Voronezh (former Soviet Union) UFO sighting, the Campus Crusade for Cthulhu to the Mothman prophecies, and everything in between. What do the Freemasons, the Kennedys, and Princess Diana have in common? All are at the center of gigantic conspiracy theories with incredibly complex and endlessly multiplying twists, turns, highways and byways.

Dick \"One of the most important scientific philosophers of his century--scholarly, witty, scientific, hip and hopeful.\" --Dr. Timothy Leary Excerpts:A-Albionic Consulting and ResearchThe most plausible of the multiconspiracy theories--i.e., those scenarios that do not claim that one supersecret criminal gang rules this planet, but rather that at least two such \"gangs\" exist, at war with each other--comes forth from an outfit styling itself A-Albionic Consulting and Research, in Ferndale, Michigan.A-Albionic began in 1985 with a common or garden-variety uniconspiracy theory, blaming everything on the British royal family--rather like Lyndon LaRouche, who may have served as their original inspiration. In 1989, however, A-Albionic revised their model of the world (yes, they actually use the scientific word \"model\" and show other signs of some technical education). The post-1989 A-Albionic scenario holds that, in their own words (capitals included), \"The Overt and Covert Organs of the Vatican and the British Empire are Locked in Mortal Combat for Control of the World.\"A-Albionic traces this Mortal Combat back to the reign of the first Queen http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/item300/item392.html (2 of 6) [6/16/2002 1:22:05 PM]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL - Hidden Mysteries BooksElizabeth, when Protestant-Catholic warfare raged all over Europe--the time when the English, typically, made their pioneer scientific rationalist, Sir Francis Bacon, a high government official, while the Vatican took their pioneer scientific rationalist, Giordano Bruno, and burned him at the stake. The British Crown and the Throne of Peter have continued to make war on each other ever since, in this model, and every other \"interest group,\" \"trade union,\" \"association of manufacturers,\" Mafia family, international bank or intelligence agency--everything that might qualify as a conspiracy in anybody's mind--have all become puppets, unknowingly, in this megastruggle.Thus, the Windsor Family Mega-Conspiracy manipulates a motley crew, which A-Albionic sums up as \"Comsymp-International Banker-Judeo-Masonic-Labour Party-British Intelligence-Socialist International-Social Democrat-Fabian-AFL-CIO-UAW-KGB\"--the same unlikely bedfellows that appear in many anti-Illuminati theories. The Vatican, on the opposite side of the world power struggle, controls an assembly of \"CIA-Fascist International-Georgetown Jesuits-McCarthyite-Buckleyite-Knights of Malta.\" (See Knights of Malta and P2.)Duoconspiracy theories, like uniconspiracy theories, often lead to logical conclusions that seem bizarre to outsiders. Thus, the late Carroll Quigley, professor of history at Georgetown University, appears as a member of the Insiders in the John Birch Societytheory, and these alleged Insiders, who sound a lot like the Illuminati, all belong to the British Royal Family Jumbo Conspiracy in A-Albionic's system. In fact, many right-wing theories become compatible if one identifies Insiders with Illuminati and both with international bankers (Jewish, Dutch, or whichever suspects you prefer). . . . Ergo, Quigley was an agent of the Windsor Gang.But Prof. Quiqley taught at Georgetown, which the Jesuits own, so this makes him actually a tool of the Vatican conspiracy according to A-Albionic. He had entered the Windsor-InsiderInternational Banker-Illuminati conspiracy, A-Albionic says, but only to expose it.

The Jesuits sent Quigley to spy out the enemy and publish their secrets, according to A-Albionic.This minor detail in the conspiratorial mosaic became a matter of passionate debate among conspiriologists during the 1992 presidential race, because Bill Clinton, in one speech, mentioned Prof. Quigley as a teacher who had vastly inspired him in his youth. To the majority of right-wing conspiracy buffs, this \"proved\" that Clinton worked for the Insiders, or the Illuminati or at least the international bankers. But A-Albionic insisted on their own analysis. If President Clinton really received inspiration from a Jesuit school, they claim, then he has become a tool of the Vatican/CIA, or anti-Illuminati, conspiracy.See also: The Con, Princess Di's Death, Terra Papers, Yankee and Cowboy WarReference:National Association for Consumer Protection in Mental Health PracticesThe National Association for Consumer Protection in Mental Health Practices, founded by Christopher Barden, is engaged in a state by state drive to enact laws that would require mental health practioners to provide scientific evidence that their methods are safe and effective, before they can receive state insurance money.

Before I can describe each, I’ve moved on to the next one.I’ve entered an auditorium. There are many people in it. I think most of them are Grays. The auditorium is semicircular; I’ve stepped in through doors at the back. The lighting is subdued, and the feel is of a social event. There are some humans down there – they stand out. One man is wearing a white T-shirt and jeans. He’s about 30 feet away. He stops and is talking with someone, standing hipshot, relaxed. The seating is a series of benches that follow the contours of the room. Some Grays are seated. We’re getting ready for a presentation. My feet are bare.There is a keyboard I’m familiar with. A display console is above it, with numerous icons spread across the surface. Each is some variation on a fancy crescent moon with brilliant colors, reds, oranges, yellows. The colors seem to have to do with the level of urgency for each icon. The screen has fine, gold grid lines on it. Some of the icons are drifting slowly. Streams of data are going by inside an oval window on the console. The data is supplemental to other things on the display, details about things. I’m supposed to read everything that’s in green characters and read the rest if I have time.Another icon is yellow and resembles a hammer & sickle. My job is to make adjustments. If you touch one of the icons, it can be “dragged” along the console display.

It's time for this horrendous secret to end....From the Introduction:There are many dangers to the human race, some real and some imagined. I believe that the trauma-based mind control which this book exposes is the greatest danger to the human race. It gives evil men the power to carry out any evil deed totally undetected.By the time the astute reader finishes this book, they will be as familiar with how to carry out trauma-based mind-control as some of the programmers. Ancient and more recent secrets will no longer be secrets.Over the years, I have spent thousands of hours studying the Illuminati, http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/item200/item219.html (1 of 4) [6/16/2002 1:24:16 PM]"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Illuminati Formula - Hidden Mysteriesthe Intelligence agencies of the world, and the occult world in general.The centerpiece of these organizations is the trauma-based mind control that they carry out. Without the ability to carry out this sophisticated type of mind-control using MPD, drugs, hypnosis and electronics and other control methodologies, these organizations would fail to keep their dark evil deeds secret. When one of the mind-control programmers of the Church of Scientology, who has left Scientology, was asked about MPD, he said, \"It's the name of the game of mind control.\"Research into this subject will never be complete. This book has tried to give a comprehensive view of how the programming is done. The basic techniques were developed in German, Scottish, Italian, and English Illuminati families and have been done for centuries. Some report that some of the techniques go back to ancient Egypt and ancient Babylon to the ancient mystery religions. The Nazis are known to have studied ancient Egyptian texts in their mind control research. The records and secrets of the generational Illuminati bloodlines are very-well guarded secrets. Even when I've learned about the location of secret depositories of some of the Illuminati's secrets in Europe, America, and Asia, their records and secrets are too well-guarded to be examined.The intelligence agencies, such as MI-6 began investigating these mind-control techniques early this century, but their records have been routinely destroyed and tampered with. There are some survivors and professionals who know that the British used programmed trauma-based MPD (DID) agents in W.W.I. In Jan., 1987, Richard Kluft submitted an article to the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis about 8 MPD patients who were between 60 and 72 years of age.....Excerpts:Page 53When the programmer wants the child's alters to learn to trance deeper, he will give a drug that the alter doesn't like.
