Sutton "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PREFACE Since the early 1920s, numerous pamphlets and artic les, even a few books, have sought to forge a link between \"international banke rs\" and \"Bolshevik revolutionaries.\" Rarely have these attempts been s upported by hard evidence, and never have such attempts been argued within the fra mework of a scientific methodology. Indeed, some of the \"evidence\" used in these efforts has been fraudulent, some has been irrelevant, much cannot b e checked. Examination of the topic by academic writers has been studiously avoid ed; probably because the hypothesis offends the neat dichotomy of capitalist s versus Communists (and everyone knows, of course, that these are bitter en emies). Moreover, because a great deal that has been written borders on the absurd, a sound academic reputation could easily be wrecked on the shoals of ridicule. Reason enough to avoid the topic. Fortunately, the State Department Decimal File, par ticularly the 861.00 section, contains extensive documentation on the hypothesize d link. When the evidence in these official papers is merged with nonofficial ev idence from biographies, personal papers, and conventional histories, a truly fascina ting story emerges. We find there was a link between some New York international bankers and many revolutionaries, including Bolsheviks. These bankin g gentlemen — who are here identified — had a financial stake in, and were roo ting for, the success of the Bolshevik Revolution. Who, why — and for how much — is the story in this book.

Letter to President Woodrow Wilson (October 17, 191 8) from William Lawrence Saunders, chairman, Ingersoll-Rand Corp.; director, American International Corp.; and deputy chairman, Federal Reserve Bank of New Yo rk The frontispiece in this book was drawn by cartooni st Robert Minor in 1911 for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Minor was a talented artist and writer who doubled as a Bolshevik revolutionary, got himself arrested in Ru ssia in 1915 for alleged subversion, and was later bank-rolled by prominent Wall Street financiers. Minor's cartoon portrays a bearded, beaming Karl Marx standing in W all Street with Socialism tucked under his arm and accepting the congratulations of financial luminaries J.P. Morgan, Morgan partner George W. Perkins, a smug John D. Ro ckefeller, John D. Ryan of National City Bank, and Teddy Roosevelt — prominent ly identified by his famous teeth — in the background. Wall Street is decorated by Red flags. The cheering crowd and the airborne hats suggest that Karl Marx must h ave been a fairly popular sort of fellow in the New York financial district. Was Robert Minor dreaming? On the contrary, we shal l see that Minor was on firm ground in depicting an enthusiastic alliance of Wal l Street and Marxist socialism. The characters in Minor's cartoon — Karl Marx (symboliz ing the future revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky), J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefell er — and indeed Robert Minor himself, are also prominent characters in this book . The contradictions suggested by Minor's cartoon hav e been brushed under the rug of history because they do not fit the accepted concep tual spectrum of political left and political right. Bolsheviks are at the left end of the political spectrum and Wall Street financiers are at the right end; therefore, we implicitly reason, the two groups have nothing in common and any alliance between the two is absurd. Factors contrary to this neat conceptual arrangement are usually reject ed as bizarre observations or unfortunate errors. Modern history possesses such a built-in duality and certainly if too many uncomfortable facts have been rejected and brushed under the rug, it is an inaccurate history. On the other hand, it may be observed that both the extreme right and the extreme left of the conventional political spectrum are absolute ly collectivist. The national socialist (for example, the fascist) and the intern ational socialist (for example, the Communist) both recommend totalitarian politico-eco nomic systems based on naked, unfettered political power and individual coercion. Both systems require monopoly control of society. While monopoly control of indus tries was once the objective of J. P. Morgan and J. D. Rockefeller, by the late ninete enth century the inner sanctums of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Wall Street understood that the most efficient way to gain an unchallenged monopoly was to \"go political\" and make society go to work f or the monopolists — under the name of the public good and the public interest. Th is strategy was detailed in 1906 by Frederick C. Howe in his Confessions of a Monopolist. 1 Howe, by the way, is also a figure in the story of the Bolshevik Revolution. Therefore, an alternative conceptual packaging of p olitical ideas and politico- economic systems would be that of ranking the degre e of individual freedom versus the degree of centralized political control. Under such an ordering the corporate welfare state and socialism are at the same end of the spectrum. Hence we see that attempts at monopoly control of society can have di fferent labels while owning common features. Consequently, one barrier to mature understanding o f recent history is the notion that all capitalists are the bitter and unswerving enemi es of all Marxists and socialists. This erroneous idea originated with Karl Marx and w as undoubtedly useful to his purposes. In fact, the idea is nonsense. There has been a continuing, albeit concealed, alliance between international political capitalist s and international revolutionary socialists — to their mutual benefit. This alliance has gone unobserved largely because historians — with a few notable exceptions — have an unconscious Marxian bias and are thus locked into the impossibility of any such alliance existing. The open- minded reader should bear two clues in mind: monopo ly capitalists are the bitter enemies of laissez-faire entrepreneurs; and, given the weaknesses of socialist central planning, the totalitarian socialist state is a per fect captive market for monopoly capitalists, if an alliance can be made with the so cialist powerbrokers. Suppose — and it is only hypothesis at this point — that American monopoly capitalists were able to reduce a planned socialist Russia to the status of a captive technical colony? Would not this be the logical twentieth-century internati onalist extension of the Morgan railroad monopolies and the Rockefeller petroleum t rust of the late nineteenth century? Apart from Gabriel Kolko, Murray Rothbard, and the revisionists, historians have not been alert for such a combination of events. Histor ical reporting, with rare exceptions, has been forced into a dichotomy of capitalists ver sus socialists. George Kennan's monumental and readable study of the Russian Revolu tion consistently maintains this fiction of a Wall Street-Bolshevik dichotomy. 2 Russia Leaves the War has a single incidental reference to the J.P. Morgan firm and no reference at all to Guaranty Trust Company. Yet both organizations are prominently men tioned in the State Department files, to which frequent reference is made in this book, and both are part of the core of the evidence presented here. Neither self-admitted \"Bolshevik banker\" Olof Aschberg nor Nya Banken in Stockholm is mentioned in Kennan yet both were central to Bolshevik funding. Moreover, in minor yet crucial c ircumstances, at least crucial for our argument, Kennan is factually in error. For example , Kennan cites Federal Reserve Bank director William Boyce Thompson as lea ving Russia on November 27, 1917. This departure date would make it physically impossible for Thompson to be in Petrograd on December 2, 1917, to transmit a cable request for $1 million to Morgan in New York. Thompson in fact left Petrograd on Dec ember 4, 1918, two days after sending the cable to New York. Then again, Kennan s tates that on November 30, 1917, Trotsky delivered a speech before the Petrogr ad Soviet in which he observed, \"Today I had here in the Smolny Institute two Ameri cans closely connected with American Capitalist elements \"According to Kennan, it \"is difficult to imagine\" who"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"these two Americans \"could have been, if not Robins and Gumberg.\" But in [act Alexander Gumberg was Russian, not American. Furthe r, as Thompson was still in Russia on November 30, 1917, then the two Americans who visited Trotsky were more than likely Raymond Robins, a mining promoter turned do-gooder, and Thompson, of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bolshevization of Wall Street was known among w ell informed circles as early as 1919. The financial journalist Barron recorded a co nversation with oil magnate E. H. Doheny in 1919 and specifically named three promine nt financiers, William Boyce Thompson, Thomas Lamont and Charles R. Crane: Aboard S.S. Aquitania, Friday Evening, February 1, 1919. Spent the evening with the Dohenys in their suite. Mr. Doheny said: If you believe in democracy you cannot believe in Socialism. Socialis m is the poison that destroys democracy. Democracy means opportunity for all. Soc ialism holds out the hope that a man can quit work and be better off. Bolshevism is the true fruit of socialism and if you will read the interesting testimony before the Senate Committee about the middle of January that showed up all these pacifists and p eace-makers as German sympathizers, Socialists, and Bolsheviks, you will see that a majority of the college professors in the United States are teaching social ism and Bolshevism and that fifty- two college professors were on so-called peace comm ittees in 1914. President Eliot of Harvard is teaching Bolshevism. The worst Bolshevis ts in the United States are not only college professors, of whom President Wilson i s one, but capitalists and the wives of capitalists and neither seem to know what they are talking about. William Boyce Thompson is teaching Bolshevism and he may ye t convert Lamont of J.P. Morgan & Company. Vanderlip is a Bolshevist, so is Charles R. Crane. Many women are joining the movement and neither they, nor thei r husbands, know what it is, or what it leads to. Henry Ford is another and so are most of those one hundred historians Wilson took abroad with him in the fooli sh idea that history can teach youth proper demarcations of races, peoples, and nations geographically. 3 In brief, this is a story of the Bolshevik Revoluti on and its aftermath, but a story that departs from the usual conceptual straitjacket appr oach of capitalists versus Communists. Our story postulates a partnership betw een international monopoly capitalism and international revolutionary socialis m for their mutual benefit. The final human cost of this alliance has fallen upon the sho ulders of the individual Russian and the individual American. Entrepreneurship has been brought into disrepute and the world has been propelled toward inefficient sociali st planning as a result of these monopoly maneuverings in the world of politics and revolution. This is also a story reflecting the betrayal of the Russian Revolution. The tsars and their corrupt political system were ejected only to be replaced by the new powerbrokers of another corrupt political system. W here the United States could have exerted its dominant influence to bring about a fre e Russia it truckled to the ambitions of a few Wall Street financiers who, for their own purposes, could accept a centralized tsarist Russia or a centralized Marxist Russia but not a decentralized free Russia. And the reasons for these assertions will unfold as we develop the underlying and, so far, untold history of the Russian Revolution and its af termath. 4 "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Footnotes: 1 \"These are the rules of big business.

What course it takes will depend much on what Mr. Rockefeller tells Mr. Hague to do. Mr. Rockefeller is a symbol of the American ruling class and Mr. Hague is a symbol of its political tools. Leon Trotsky, in New York Times, December 13, 1938. (Hague was a New Jersey politician) In 1916, the year preceding the Russian Revolution, internationalist Leon Trotsky was expelled from France, officially because of his par ticipation in the Zimmerwald conference but also no doubt because of inflammator y articles written for Nashe Slovo, a Russian-language newspaper printed in Paris. In S eptember 1916 Trotsky was politely escorted across the Spanish border by Fren ch police. A few days later Madrid police arrested the internationalist and lodged him in a \"first-class cell\" at a charge of one-and-one-haft pesetas per day. Subsequently Trot sky was taken to Cadiz, then to Barcelona finally to be placed on board the Spanish Transatlantic Company steamer Monserrat. Trotsky and family crossed the Atlantic Ocean and l anded in New York on January 13, 1917. Other Trotskyites also made their way westward acro ss the Atlantic. Indeed, one Trotskyite group acquired sufficient immediate infl uence in Mexico to write the Constitution of Querétaro for the revolutionary 191 7 Carranza government, giving Mexico the dubious distinction of being the first g overnment in the world to adopt a Soviet-type constitution. How did Trotsky, who knew only German and Russian, survive in capitalist America? According to his autobiography, My Life, \"My only profession in New York was that of a revolutionary socialist.\" In other words, Trot sky wrote occasional articles for Novy Mir, the New York Russian socialist journal. Yet we know that the Trotsky family apartment in New York had a refrigerator and a telephone, and, according to Trotsky, that the family occasionally traveled in a chauffeured limousine. This mode of living puzzled the two young Trotsky boys. When they went into a tearoom, the boys would anxiously demand of their mother, \"Why d oesn't the chauffeur come in?\" 1 The stylish living standard is also at odds with Tr otsky's reported income. The only funds that Trotsky admits receiving in 1916 and 191 7 are $310, and, said Trotsky, \"I distributed the $310 among five emigrants who were returning to Russia.\" Yet Trotsky had paid for a first-class cell in Spain, t he Trotsky family had traveled across Europe to the United States, they had acquired an e xcellent apartment in New York — paying rent three months in advance — and they ha d use of a chauffeured limousine. All this on the earnings of an impoveris hed revolutionary for a few articles for the low-circulation Russian-language newspaper Nashe Slovo in Paris and Novy Mir in New York!"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Joseph Nedava estimates Trotsky's 1917 income at $1 2.00 per week, \"supplemented by some lecture fees.\" 2 Trotsky was in New York in 1917 for three months, from January to March, so that makes $144.00 in income f rom Novy Mir and, say, another $100.00 in lecture fees, for a total of $244.00. Of this $244.00 Trotsky was able to give away $310.00 to his friends, pay for the New Y ork apartment, provide for his family — and find the $10,000 that was taken from h im in April 1917 by Canadian authorities in Halifax. Trotsky claims that those w ho said he had other sources of income are \"slanderers\" spreading \"stupid calumnies \" and \"lies,\" but unless Trotsky was playing the horses at the Jamaica racetrack, it can't be done. Obviously Trotsky had an unreported source of income. What was that source? In The Road to Safety, author Arthur Willert says Trotsky earned a living by working as an electrician for Fo x Film Studios. Other writers have cited other occupations, but there is no evidence t hat Trotsky occupied himself for remuneration otherwise than by writing and speaking . Most investigation has centered on the verifiable f act that when Trotsky left New York in 1917 for Petrograd, to organize the Bolshev ik phase of the revolution, he left with $10,000. In 1919 the U.S. Senate Overman Commi ttee investigated Bolshevik propaganda and German money in the United States an d incidentally touched on the source of Trotsky's $10,000. Examination of Colonel Hurban, Washington attaché to the Czech legation, by the Overman Committee yielde d the following: COL. HURBAN: Trotsky, perhaps, took money from Germ any, but Trotsky will deny it. Lenin would not deny it. Miliukov proved that h e got $10,000 from some Germans while he was in America. Miliukov had the proof, bu t he denied it. Trotsky did, although Miliukov had the proof. SENATOR OVERMAN: It was charged that Trotsky got $1 0,000 here. COL. HURBAN: I do not remember how much it was, but I know it was a question between him and Miliukov. SENATOR OVERMAN: Miliukov proved it, did he? COL. HURBAN: Yes, sir. SENATOR OVERMAN: Do you know where he got it from? COL. HURBAN: I remember it was $10,000; but it is n o matter. I will speak about their propaganda. The German Government knew Russia better than anybody, and they knew that with the help of those people they c ould destroy the Russian army. (At 5:45 o'clock p.m. the subcommittee adjourned un til tomorrow, Wednesday, February 19, at 10:30 o'clock a.m.) 3 It is quite remarkable that the committee adjourned abruptly before the source of Trotsky's funds could be placed into the Senate rec ord. When questioning resumed the next day, Trotsky and his $10,000 were no longer of interest to the Overman Committee. We shall later develop evidence concerni ng the financing of German and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"revolutionary activities in the United States by Ne w York financial houses; the origins of Trotsky's $10,000 will then come into focus. An amount of $10,000 of German origin is also menti oned in the official British telegram to Canadian naval authorities in Halifax, who requested that Trotsky and party en route to the revolution be taken off the S .S. Kristianiafjord (see page 28). We also learn from a British Directorate of Intelligen ce report 4 that Gregory Weinstein, who in 1919 was to become a prominent member of the Soviet Bureau in New York, collected funds for Trotsky in New York. These fund s originated in Germany and were channeled through the V olks-zeitung, a German daily newspaper in New York and subsidized by the German government. While Trotsky's funds are officially reported as Ge rman, Trotsky was actively engaged in American politics immediately prior to l eaving New York for Russia and the revolution. On March 5, 1917, American newspape rs headlined the increasing possibility of war with Germany; the same evening T rotsky proposed a resolution at the meeting of the New York County Socialist Party \"pledging Socialists to encourage strikes and resist recruiting in the event of war w ith Germany.\" 5 Leon Trotsky was called by the New York Times \"an exiled Russian revolutionist.\" Louis C. Fraina, who cosponsored the Trotsky resolution, later — under a n alias — wrote an uncritical book on the Morgan financial empire entitled House of Morgan. 6 The Trotsky-Fraina proposal was opposed by the Morris Hillquit faction , and the Socialist Party subsequently voted opposition to the resolution. 7 More than a week later, on March 16, at the time of the deposition of the tsar, Leon Trotsky was interviewed in the offices of Novy Mir.. The interview contained a prophetic statement on the Russian revolution: \"... the committee which has taken the place of the depo sed Ministry in Russia did not represent the interests or the aims of the revoluti onists, that it would probably be shortlived and step down in favor of men who would be more sure to carry forward the democratization of Russia.\" 8 The \"men who would be more sure to carry forward th e democratization of Russia,\" that is, the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks, were th en in exile abroad and needed first to return to Russia. The temporary \"committee\" was therefore dubbed the Provisional Government, a title, it should be noted, that was u sed from the start of the revolution in March and not applied ex post facto by historian s. WOODROW WILSON AND A PASSPORT FOR TROTSKY President Woodrow Wilson was the fairy godmother wh o provided Trotsky with a passport to return to Russia to \"carry forward\" the revolution. This American passport was accompanied by a Russian entry permit and a Bri tish transit visa. Jennings C. Wise, in Woodrow Wilson: Disciple of Revolution, makes the pertinent comment, \"Historians must never forget that Woodrow Wilson, despite the efforts of the British police, made it possible for Leon Trotsky to enter Russia with an American passport.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"President Wilson facilitated Trotsky's passage to R ussia at the same time careful State Department bureaucrats, concerned about such revolu tionaries entering Russia, were unilaterally attempting to tighten up passport proc edures. The Stockholm legation cabled the State Department on June 13, 1917, just after Trotsky crossed the Finnish- Russian border, \"Legation confidentially informed R ussian, English and French passport offices at Russian frontier, Tornea, consi derably worried by passage of suspicious persons bearing American passports.\" 9 To this cable the State Department replied, on the same day, \"Department is exercising special care in issuance of passports fo r Russia\"; the department also authorized expenditures by the legation to establis h a passport-control office in Stockholm and to hire an \"absolutely dependable Ame rican citizen\" for employment on control work. 10 But the bird had flown the coop. Menshevik Trotsky with Lenin's Bolsheviks were already in Russia preparing to \"car ry forward\" the revolution. The passport net erected caught only more legitimate bi rds. For example, on June 26, 1917, Herman Bernstein, a reputable New York newspaperman on his way to Petrograd to represent the New York Herald, was held at the border and refused entry to Russia. Somewhat tardily, in mid-August 1917 the Russian em bassy in Washington requested the State Department (and State agreed) to \"prevent the entry into Russia of criminals and anarchists... numbers of whom have already gone to Russia.\" 11 Consequently, by virtue of preferential treatment f or Trotsky, when the S.S. Kristianiafjord left New York on March 26, 1917, Trotsky was aboard and holding a U.S. passport — and in company with other Trotskyir e revolutionaries, Wall Street financiers, American Communists, and other interest ing persons, few of whom had embarked for legitimate business. This mixed bag of passengers has been described by Lincoln Steffens, the American Communist: The passenger list was long and mysterious. Trotsky was in the steerage with a group of revolutionaries; there was a Japanese revolution ist in my cabin. There were a lot of Dutch hurrying home from Java, the only innocent pe ople aboard. The rest were war messengers, two from Wall Street to Germany.... 12 Notably, Lincoln Steffens was on board en route to Russia at the specific invitation of Charles Richard Crane, a backer and a former chairm an of the Democratic Party's finance committee. Charles Crane, vice president of the Crane Company, had organized the Westinghouse Company in Russia, was a member of the Root mission to Russia, and had made no fewer than twenty-three visits to Russia between 1890 and 1930. Richard Crane, his son, was confidential assistant to then Secretary of State Robert Lansing. According to the former ambassador to Germany William Dodd, Crane \"did much to bring on the Kerensky revolution which gave way to Communism.\" 13 And so Steffens' comments in his diary about conve rsations aboard the S.S. Kristianiafjord are highly pertinent:\" . . . all agree that the rev olution is in its first phase only, that it must grow. Crane and Russ ian radicals on the ship think we shall be in Petrograd for the re-revolution. 14 Crane returned to the United States when the Bolshe vik Revolution (that is, \"the re- revolution\") had been completed and, although a pri vate citizen, was given firsthand reports of the progress of the Bolshevik Revolution as cables were received at the State Department. For example, one memorandum, date d December 11, 1917, is"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"entitled \"Copy of report on Maximalist uprising for Mr Crane.\" It originated with Maddin Summers, U.S. consul general in Moscow, and the covering letter from Summers reads in part: I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of same [above report] with the request that it be sent for the confidential information of Mr. Charles R. Crane. It is assumed that the Department will have no objection to Mr. C rane seeing the report .... 15 In brief, the unlikely and puzzling picture that em erges is that Charles Crane, a friend and backer of Woodrow Wilson and a prominent financ ier and politician, had a known role in the \"first\" revolution and traveled t o Russia in mid-1917 in company with the American Communist Lincoln Steffens, who w as in touch with both Woodrow Wilson and Trotsky. The latter in turn was carrying a passport issued at the orders of Wilson and $10,000 from supposed German s ources. On his return to the U.S. after the \"re-revolution,\" Crane was granted a ccess to official documents concerning consolidation of the Bolshevik regime: T his is a pattern of interlocking — if puzzling — events that warrants further investig ation and suggests, though without at this point providing evidence, some link between the financier Crane and the revolutionary Trotsky. CANADIAN GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS ON TROTSKY'S RELEASE 16 Documents on Trotsky's brief stay in Canadian custo dy are now de-classified and available from the Canadian government archives. Ac cording to these archives, Trotsky was removed by Canadian and British naval p ersonnel from the S.S. Kristianiafjord at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on April 3, 1917, listed a s a German prisoner of war, and interned at the Amherst, Nova Scotia, i nternment station for German prisoners. Mrs. Trotsky, the two Trotsky boys, and five other men described as \"Russian Socialists\" were also taken off and intern ed. Their names are recorded by the Canadian files as: Nickita Muchin, Leiba Fisheleff, Konstantin Romanchanco, Gregor Teheodnovski, Gerchon Melintchansky and Leon Bronst ein Trotsky (all spellings from original Canadian documents). Canadian Army form LB-l, under serial number 1098 ( including thumb prints), was completed for Trotsky, with a description as follow s: \"37 years old, a political exile, occupation journalist, born in Gromskty, Chuson, Ru ssia, Russian citizen.\" The form was signed by Leon Trotsky and his full name given as Leon Bromstein (sic) Trotsky. The Trotsky party was removed from the S.S. Kristianiafjord under official instructions received by cablegram of March 29, 191 7, London, presumably originating in the Admiralty with the naval control officer, Halifax. The cablegram reported that the Trotsky party was on the \"Christianiafjord\" (sic) and should be \"taken off and retained pending instructions.\" The reason given to the naval control officer at Halifax was that \"these are Russian Soci alists leaving for purposes of starting revolution against present Russian governm ent for which Trotsky is reported to have 10,000 dollars subscribed by Socialists and Germans.\" On April 1, 1917, the naval control officer, Captai n O. M. Makins, sent a confidential memorandum to the general officer commanding at Hal ifax, to the effect that he had"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"examined all Russian passengers\" aboard the S.S. Kristianiafjord and found six men in the second-class section: \"They are all avowed S ocialists, and though professing a desire to help the new Russian Govt., might well be in league with German Socialists in America, and quite likely to be a great hindranc e to the Govt. in Russia just at present.\" Captain Makins added that he was going to remove the group, as well as Trotsky's wife and two sons, in order to intern the m at Halifax. A copy of this report was forwarded from Halifax to the chief of the Gene ral Staff in Ottawa on April 2, 1917. The next document in the Canadian files is dated Ap ril 7, from the chief of the General Staff, Ottawa, to the director of internmen t operations, and acknowledges a previous letter (not in the files) about the intern ment of Russian socialists at Amherst, Nova Scotia: \". . . in this connection, have to inform you of the recei pt of a long telegram yesterday from the Russian Consul General, MONTREAL, protesting against the arrest of these men as they were in pos session of passports issued by the Russian Consul General, NEW YORK, U.S.A.\" The reply to this Montreal telegram was to the effe ct that the men were interned \"on suspicion of being German,\" and would be released o nly upon definite proof of their nationality and loyalty to the Allies. No telegrams from the Russian consul general in New York are in the Canadian files, and it is known that this office was reluctant to issue Russian passports to Russian political exiles . However, there is a telegram in the files from a New York attorney, N. Aleinikoff, to R . M. Coulter, then deputy postmaster general of Canada. The postmaster genera l's office in Canada had no connection with either internment of prisoners of w ar or military activities. Accordingly, this telegram was in the nature of a p ersonal, nonofficial intervention. It reads: DR. R. M. COULTER, Postmaster Genl. OTTAWA Russian political exiles returning to Russia detained Halifax interned Amherst camp. K indly investigate and advise cause of the detention and names of all detained. T rust as champion of freedom you will intercede on their behalf. Please wire collect . NICHOLAS ALEINIKOFF On April 11, Coulter wired Aleinikoff, \"Telegram re ceived. Writing you this afternoon. You should receive it tomorrow evening. R. M. Coulter.\" This telegram was sent by the Canadian Pacific Railway Telegraph but charged to the Canadian Post Office Department. Normally a private business tele gram would be charged to the recipient and this was not official business. The f ollow-up Coulter letter to Aleinikoff is interesting because, after confirming that the T rotsky party was held at Amherst, it states that they were suspected of propaganda again st the present Russian government and \"are supposed to be agents of Germany.\" Coulter then adds,\" . . . they are not what they represent themselves to be\"; the Trotsky group is \"...not detained by Canada, but by the Imperial authorities.\" After assuring Al einikoff that the detainees would be made comfortable, Coulter adds that any information \"in their favour\" would be transmitted to the military authorities. The genera l impression of the letter is that while Coulter is sympathetic and fully aware of Tro tsky's pro-German links, he is unwilling to get involved. On April 11 Arthur Wolf of 134 East Broadway, New York, sent a telegram to Coulter. Though sent from New Yo rk, this telegram, after being acknowledged, was also charged to the Canadian Post Office Department."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Coulter's reactions, however, reflect more than the detached sympathy evident in his letter to Aleinikoff. They must be considered in th e light of the fact that these letters in behalf of Trotsky came from two American residen ts of New York City and involved a Canadian or Imperial military matter of international importance. Further, Coulter, as deputy postmaster general, was a Canadi an government official of some standing. Ponder, for a moment, what would happen t o someone who similarly intervened in United States affairs! In the Trotsky affair we have two American residents corresponding with a Canadian deputy post master general in order to intervene in behalf of an interned Russian revoluti onary. Coulter's subsequent action also suggests something more than casual intervention. After Coulter acknowledged the Aleinikoff and Wolf telegrams, he wrote to Major General Willoughby Gwatkin of the Department of Mil itia and Defense in Ottawa — a man of significant influence in the Canadian mili tary — and attached copies of the Aleinikoff and Wolf telegrams: These men have been hostile to Russia because of th e way the Jews have been treated, and are now strongly in favor of the present Admini stration, so far as I know. Both are responsible men. Both are reputable men, and I am s ending their telegrams to you for what they may be worth, and so that you may represe nt them to the English authorities if you deem it wise. Obviously Coulter knows — or intimates that he know s — a great deal about Aleinikoff and Wolf. His letter was in effect a cha racter reference, and aimed at the root of the internment problem — London. Gwatkin wa s well known in London, and in fact was on loan to Canada from the War Office i n London. 17 Aleinikoff then sent a letter to Coulter to thank h im most heartily for the interest you have taken in th e fate of the Russian Political Exiles .... You know me, esteemed Dr. Coulter, and you also know my devotion to the cause of Russian freedom .... Happily I know Mr. Tr otsky, Mr. Melnichahnsky, and Mr. Chudnowsky . . . intimately. It might be noted as an aside that if Aleinikoff kn ew Trotsky \"intimately,\" then he would also probably be aware that Trotsky had decla red his intention to return to Russia to overthrow the Provisional Government and institute the \"re-revolution.\" On receipt of Aleinikoff's letter, Coulter immediately (April 16) forwarded it to Major General Gwatkin, adding that he became acquainted w ith Aleinikoff \"in connection with Departmental action on United States papers in the Russian language\" and that Aleinikoff was working \"on the same lines as Mr. Wo lf . . . who was an escaped prisoner from Siberia.\" Previously, on April 14, Gwatkin sent a memorandum to his naval counterpart on the Canadian Military Interdepartmental Committee repea ting that the internees were Russian socialists with \"10,000 dollars subscribed by socialists and Germans.\" The concluding paragraph stated: \"On the other hand there are those who declare that an act of high-handed injustice has been done.\" Then o n April 16, Vice Admiral C. E. Kingsmill, director of the Naval Service, took Gwat kin's intervention at face value. In a letter to Captain Makins, the naval control offic er at Halifax, he stated, \"The Militia"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"authorities request that a decision as to their (th at is, the six Russians) disposal may be hastened.\" A copy of this instruction was relayed t o Gwatkin who in turn informed Deputy Postmaster General Coulter. Three days later Gwatkin applied pressure. In a memorandum of April 20 to the naval secretary, he w rote, \"Can you say, please, whether or not the Naval Control Office has given a decision?\" On the same day (April 20) Captain Makins wrote Adm iral Kingsmill explaining his reasons for removing Trotsky; he refused to be pres sured into making a decision, stating, \"I will cable to the Admiralty informing t hem that the Militia authorities are requesting an early decision as to their disposal.\" However, the next day, April 21, Gwatkin wrote Coulter: \"Our friends the Russian soc ialists are to be released; and arrangements are being made for their passage to Eu rope.\" The order to Makins for Trotsky's release originated in the Admiralty, Lond on. Coulter acknowledged the information, \"which will please our New York corres pondents immensely.\" While we can, on the one hand, conclude that Coulte r and Gwatkin were intensely interested in the release of Trotsky, we do not, on the other hand, know why. There was little in the career of either Deputy Postmaste r General Coulter or Major General Gwatkin that would explain an urge to release the M enshevik Leon Trotsky. Dr. Robert Miller Coulter was a medical doctor of S cottish and Irish parents, a liberal, a Freemason, and an Odd Fellow. He was appointed de puty postmaster general of Canada in 1897. His sole claim to fame derived from being a delegate to the Universal Postal Union Convention in 1906 and a delegate to N ew Zealand and Australia in 1908 for the \"All Red\" project. All Red had nothing to do with Red revolutionaries; it was only a plan for all-red or all-British fast ste amships between Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. Major General Willoughby Gwatkin stemmed from a lon g British military tradition (Cambridge and then Staff College). A specialist in mobilization, he served in Canada from 1905 to 1918. Given only the documents in the Canadian files, we can but conclude that their intervention in behalf of Trots ky is a mystery. CANADIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE VIEWS TROTSKY We can approach the Trotsky release case from anoth er angle: Canadian intelligence. Lieutenant Colonel John Bayne MacLean, a prominent Canadian publisher and businessman, founder and president of MacLean Publi shing Company, Toronto, operated numerous Canadian trade journals, includin g the Financial Post. MacLean also had a long-time association with Canadian Army Intelligence. 18 In 1918 Colonel MacLean wrote for his own MacLean's magazine an article entitled \"Why Did We Let Trotsky Go? How Canada Lost an Oppo rtunity to Shorten the War.\" 19 The article contained detailed and unusual informa tion about Leon Trotsky, although the last half of the piece wanders off int o space remarking about barely related matters. We have two clues to the authentic ity of the information. First, Colonel MacLean was a man of integrity with excelle nt connections in Canadian government intelligence. Second, government records since released by Canada, Great Britain, and the United States confirm MacLea n's statement to a significant"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"degree. Some MacLean statements remain to be confir med, but information available in the early 1970s is not necessarily inconsistent with Colonel MacLean's article. MacLean's opening argument is that \"some Canadian p oliticians or officials were chiefly responsible for the prolongation of the war [World War I], for the great loss of life, the wounds and sufferings of the winter of 19 17 and the great drives of 1918.\" Further, states MacLean, these persons were (in 191 9)doing everything possible to prevent Parliament and the Canadian people from get ting the related facts. Official reports, including those of Sir Douglas Haig, demon strate that but for the Russian break in 1917 the war would have been over a year e arlier, and that \"the man chiefly responsible for the defection of Russia was Trotsky ... acting under German instructions.\" Who was Trotsky? According to MacLean, Trotsky was not Russian, but German. Odd as this assertion may appear it does coincide w ith other scraps of intelligence information: to wit, that Trotsky spoke better Germ an than Russian, and that he was the Russian executive of the German \"Black Bond.\" A ccording to MacLean, Trotsky in August 1914 had been \"ostentatiously\" expelled f rom Berlin; 20 he finally arrived in the United States where he organized Russian revolu tionaries, as well as revolutionaries in Western Canada, who \"were largel y Germans and Austrians traveling as Russians.\" MacLean continues: Originally the British found through Russian associ ates that Kerensky, 21 Lenin and some lesser leaders were practically in German pay as early as 1915 and they uncovered in 1916 the connections with Trotsky then living in New York. From that time he was closely watched by... the Bomb Squad. I n the early part of 1916 a German official sailed for New York. British Intell igence officials accompanied him. He was held up at Halifax; but on their instruction he was passed on with profuse apologies for the necessary delay. After much manoe uvering he arrived in a dirty little newspaper office in the slums and there found Trots ky, to whom he bore important instructions. From June 1916, until they passed him on [to] the British, the N.Y. Bomb Squad never lost touch with Trotsky. They disc overed that his real name was Braunstein and that he was a German, not a Russian. 22 Such German activity in neutral countries is confir med in a State Department report (316-9-764-9) describing organization of Russian re fugees for revolutionary purposes. Continuing, MacLean states that Trotsky and four as sociates sailed on the \"S.S. Christiania\" (sic), and on April 3 reported to \"Captain Making\" (sic) and were taken off the ship at Halifax under the direction of Lieu tenant Jones. (Actually a party of nine, including six men, were taken off the S.S. Kristianiafjord. The name of the naval control officer at Halifax was Captain O. M. Makins, R.N. The name of the officer who removed the Trotsky party from the ship is not in the Canadian government documents; Trotsky said it was \"Machen.\" ) Again, according to MacLean, Trotsky's money came \"from German sources in New Yo rk.\" Also: generally the explanation given is that the release was done at the request of Kerensky but months before this British officers and one Can adian serving in Russia, who could"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"speak the Russian language, reported to London and Washington that Kerensky was in German service. 23 Trotsky was released \"at the request of the British Embassy at Washington . . . [which] acted on the request of the U.S. State Department, who were acting for someone else.\" Canadian officials \"were instructed to inform the p ress that Trotsky was an American citizen travelling on an American passport; that hi s release was specially demanded by the Washington State Department.\" Moreover, writ es MacLean, in Ottawa \"Trotsky had, and continues to have, strong undergr ound influence. There his power was so great that orders were issued that he must b e given every consideration.\" The theme of MacLean's reporting is, quite evidentl y, that Trotsky had intimate relations with, and probably worked for, the German General Staff. While such relations have been established regarding Lenin — t o the extent that Lenin was subsidized and his return to Russia facilitated by the Germans — it appears certain that Trotsky was similarly aided. The $10,000 Trots ky fund in New York was from German sources, and a recently declassified documen t in the U.S. State Department files reads as follows: March 9, 1918 to: American Consul, Vladivostok from Polk, Acting Secretary of State, Washington D.C. For your confidential information and prompt attent ion: Following is substance of message of January twelfth from Von Schanz of Germa n Imperial Bank to Trotsky, quote Consent imperial bank to appropriation from c redit general staff of five million roubles for sending assistant chief naval commissio ner Kudrisheff to Far East. This message suggests some liaison between Trotsky and the Germans in January 1918, a time when Trotsky was proposing an alliance with the West. The State Department does not give the provenance of the tele gram, only that it originated with the War College Staff. The State Department did tre at the message as authentic and acted on the basis of assumed authenticity. It is c onsistent with the general theme of Colonel MacLean's article. TROTSKY'S INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES Consequently, we can derive the following sequence of events: Trotsky traveled from New York to Petrograd on a passport supplied by the intervention of Woodrow Wilson, and with the declared intention to \"carry f orward\" the revolution. The British government was the immediate source of Trotsky's re lease from Canadian custody in April 1917, but there may well have been \"pressures .\" Lincoln Steffens, an American Communist, acted as a link between Wilson and Charl es R. Crane and between Crane and Trotsky. Further, while Crane had no official p osition, his son Richard was confidential assistant to Secretary of State Robert Lansing, and Crane senior was provided with prompt and detailed reports on the pr ogress of the Bolshevik Revolution. Moreover, Ambassador William Dodd (U.S. ambassador to Germany in the Hitler era) said that Crane had an active role in the Kerensky phase of the revolution; the Steffens letters confirm that Crane saw the Kerensky phase as only one step in a continuing revolution."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The interesting point, however, is not so much the communication among dissimilar persons like Crane, Steffens, Trotsky, and Woodrow Wilson as the existence of at least a measure of agreement on the procedure to be followed — that is, the Provisional Government was seen as \"provisional,\" a nd the \"re-revolution\" was to follow. On the other side of the coin, interpretation of Tr otsky's intentions should be cautious: he was adept at double games. Official documentatio n clearly demonstrates contradictory actions. For example, the Division of Far Eastern Affairs in the U.S. State Department received on March 23, 1918, two re ports stemming from Trotsky; one is inconsistent with the other. One report, dat ed March 20 and from Moscow, originated in the Russian newspaper Russkoe Slovo. The report cited an interview with Trotsky in which he stated that any alliance w ith the United States was impossible: The Russia of the Soviet cannot align itself... wit h capitalistic America for this would be a betrayal It is possible that Americans seek su ch an rapprochement with us, driven by its antagonism towards Japan, but in any case th ere can be no question of an alliance by us of any nature with a bourgeoisie nat ion. 24 The other report, also originating in Moscow, is a message dated March 17, 1918, three days earlier, and from Ambassador Francis: \"T rotsky requests five American officers as inspectors of army being organized for defense also requests railroad operating men and equipment.\" 25 This request to the U.S. is of course inconsistent with rejection of an \"alliance.\" Before we leave Trotsky some mention should be made of the Stalinist show trials of the 1930s and, in particular, the 1938 accusations and trial of the \"Anti-Soviet bloc of rightists and Trotskyites.\" These forced parodies o f the judicial process, almost unanimously rejected in the West, may throw light o n Trotsky's intentions. The crux of the Stalinist accusation was that Trots kyites were paid agents of international capitalism. K. G. Rakovsky, one of th e 1938 defendants, said, or was induced to say, \"We were the vanguard of foreign ag gression, of international fascism, and not only in the USSR but also in Spain, China, throughout the world.\" The summation of the \"court\" contains the statement, \"T here is not a single man in the world who brought so much sorrow and misfortune to people as Trotsky. He is the vilest agent of fascism .... \" 26 Now while this may be no more than verbal insults r outinely traded among the international Communists of the 1930s and 40s, it i s also notable that the threads behind the self-accusation are consistent with the evidence in this chapter. And further, as we shall see later, Trotsky was able to generate support among international capitalists, who, incidentally, were also supporter s of Mussolini and Hitler. 27 So long as we see all international revolutionaries and all international capitalists as implacable enemies of one another, then we miss a c rucial point — that there has indeed been some operational cooperation between in ternational capitalists, including"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"fascists. And there is no a priori reason why we sh ould reject Trotsky as a part of this alliance. This tentative, limited reassessment will be brough t into sharp focus when we review the story o£ Michael Gruzenberg, the chief Bolshevi k agent in Scandinavia who under the alias of Alexander Gumberg was also a confident ial adviser to the Chase National Bank in New York and later to Floyd Odium of Atlas Corporation. This dual role was known to and accepted by both the Soviets and his A merican employers. The Gruzenberg story is a case history of international revolution allied with international capitalism. Colonel MacLean's observations that Trotsky had \"st rong underground influence\" and that his \"power was so great that orders were issue d that he must be given every consideration\" are not at all inconsistent with the Coulter-Gwatkin intervention in Trotsky's behalf; or, for that matter, with those l ater occurrences, the Stalinist accusations in the Trotskyite show trials of the 19 30s. Nor are they inconsistent with the Gruzenberg case. On the other hand, the only kn own direct link between Trotsky and international banking is through his cousin Abr am Givatovzo, who was a private banker in Kiev before the Russian Revolution and in Stockholm after the revolution. While Givatovzo professed antibolshevism, he was in fact acting in behalf of the Soviets in 1918 in currency transactions. 28 Is it possible an international web (:an be spun fr om these events? First there's Trotsky, a Russian internationalist revolutionary w ith German connections who sparks assistance from two supposed supporters of P rince Lvov's government in Russia (Aleinikoff and Wolf, Russians resident in N ew York). These two ignite the action of a liberal Canadian deputy postmaster gene ral, who in turn intercedes with a prominent British Army major general on the Canadia n military staff. These are all verifiable links. In brief, allegiances may not always be what they a re called, or appear. We can, however, surmise that Trotsky, Aleinikoff, Wolf, Coulter, and Gwatki n in acting for a common limited objective also had some common highe r goal than national allegiance or political label. To emphasize, there is no absolute proof that this is so. It is, at the moment, only a logical supposition from the facts. A loyalty higher than that forged by a common immediate goal need have been no more than that of friendship, although that strains the imagination when we ponde r such a polyglot combination. It may also have been promoted by other motives. The p icture is yet incomplete.

Von Kühlmann, minister of foreign affairs, to the k aiser, December 3, 1917 In April 1917 Lenin and a party of 32 Russian revol utionaries, mostly Bolsheviks, journeyed by train from Switzerland across Germany through Sweden to Petrograd, Russia. They were on their way to join Leon Trotsky to \"complete the revolution.\" Their trans-Germany transit was approved, facilitat ed, and financed by the German General Staff. Lenin's transit to Russia was part o f a plan approved by the German Supreme Command, apparently not immediately known t o the kaiser, to aid in the disintegration of the Russian army and so eliminate Russia from World War I. The possibility that the Bolsheviks might be turned aga inst Germany and Europe did not occur to the German General Staff. Major General Ho ffman has written, \"We neither knew nor foresaw the danger to humanity from the co nsequences of this journey of the Bolsheviks to Russia.\" 1 At the highest level the German political officer w ho approved Lenin's journey to Russia was Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg , a descendant of the Frankfurt banking family Bethmann, which achieved g reat prosperity in the nineteenth century. Bethmann-Hollweg was appointed chancellor in 1909 and in November 1913 became the subject of the first vote of censure ever passed by the German Reichstag on a chancellor. It was Bethmann-H ollweg who in 1914 told the world that the German guarantee to Belgium was a me re \"scrap of paper.\" Yet on other war matters — such as the use of unrestricted submarine warfare — Bethmann- Hollweg was ambivalent; in January 1917 he told the kaiser, \"I can give Your Majesty neither my assent to the unrestricted submarine war fare nor my refusal.\" By 1917 Bethmann-Hollweg had lost the Reichstag's support a nd resigned — but not before approving transit of Bolshevik revolutionaries to R ussia. The transit instructions from Bethmann-Hollweg went through the state secretary A rthur Zimmermann — who was immediately under Bethmann-Hollweg and who handled day-to-day operational details with the German ministers in both Bern and Copenhagen — to the German minister to Bern in early April 1917. The kaiser hi mself was not aware of the revolutionary movement until after Lenin had passed into Russia. While Lenin himself did not know the precise source of the assistance, he certainly knew that the German government was providing some funding. There were, however, intermediate links between the German foreign minis try and Lenin, as the following shows:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"LENIN'S TRANSFER TO RUSSIA IN APRIL 1917 Final decision BETHMANN- HOLLWEG (Chancellor) Intermediary I ARTHUR ZIMMERMANN (State Secretary) Intermediary II BROCKDORFF- RANTZAU (German Minister in Copenhagen) Intermediary III ALEXANDER ISRAEL HELPHAND (alias PARVUS) Intermediary IV JACOB FURSTENBERG (alias GANETSKY) LENIN, in Switzerland From Berlin Zimmermann and Bethmann-Hollweg communi cated with the German minister in Copenhagen, Brockdorff-Rantzau. In turn , Brockdorff-Rantzau was in touch with Alexander Israel Helphand (more commonly known by his alias, Parvus), who was located in Copenhagen. 2 Parvus was the connection to Jacob Furstenberg, a Pole descended from a wealthy family but better kno wn by his alias, Ganetsky. And Jacob Furstenberg was the immediate link to Lenin. Although Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg was the final authority for Lenin's transfer, and although Lenin was probably aware of the German origins of the assistance, Lenin cannot be termed a German agent. The German F oreign Ministry assessed Lenin's probable actions in Russia as being consist ent with their own objectives in the dissolution of the existing power structure in Russ ia. Yet both parties also had hidden objectives: Germany wanted priority access to the p ostwar markets in Russia, and Lenin intended to establish a Marxist dictatorship. The idea of using Russian revolutionaries in this w ay can be traced back to 1915. On August 14 of that year, Brockdorff-Rantzau wrote th e German state undersecretary about a conversation with Helphand (Parvus), and ma de a strong recommendation to employ Helphand, \"an extraordinarily important man whose unusual powers I feel we must employ for duration of the war .... \" 3 Included in the report was a warning: \"It might perhaps be risky to want to use the powers ranged behind Helph and, but it would certainly be an admission of our own weakness if we were to refuse their services out of fear of not being able to direct them.\" 4 Brockdorff-Rantzau's ideas of directing or controll ing the revolutionaries parallel, as we shall see, those of the Wall Street financiers. It was J.P. Morgan and the American International Corporation that attempted to control both domestic and foreign revolutionaries in the United States for their own purposes."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"A subsequent document 5 outlined the terms demanded by Lenin, of which the most interesting was point number seven, which allowed \" Russian troops to move into India\"; this suggested that Lenin intended to conti nue the tsarist expansionist program. Zeman also records the role of Max Warburg in estab lishing a Russian publishing house and adverts to an agreement dated August 12, 1916, in which the German industrialist Stinnes agreed to contribute two mill ion rubles for financing a publishing house in Russia. 6 Consequently, on April 16, 1917, a trainload of thi rty-two, including Lenin, his wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, Grigori Zinoviev, Sokolnikov, a nd Karl Radek, left the Central Station in Bern en route to Stockholm. When the par ty reached the Russian frontier only Fritz Plattan and Radek were denied entrance i nto Russia. The remainder of the party was allowed to enter. Several months later th ey were followed by almost 200 Mensheviks, including Martov and Axelrod. It is worth noting that Trotsky, at that time in Ne w York, also had funds traceable to German sources. Further, Von Kuhlmann alludes to Le nin's inability to broaden the base of his Bolshevik party until the Germans suppl ied funds. Trotsky was a Menshevik who turned Bolshevik only in 1917. This s uggests that German funds were perhaps related to Trotsky's change of party l abel. THE SISSON DOCUMENTS In early 1918 Edgar Sisson, the Petrograd represent ative of the U.S. Committee on Public Information, bought a batch of Russian docum ents purporting to prove that Trotsky, Lenin, and the other Bolshevik revolutiona ries were not only in the pay of, but also agents of, the German government. These documents, later dubbed the \"Sisson Documents ,\" were shipped to the United States in great haste and secrecy. In Washington, D .C. they were submitted to the National Board for Historical Service for authentic ation. Two prominent historians, J. Franklin Jameson and Samuel N. Harper, testified to their genuineness. These historians divided the Sisson papers into three gro ups. Regarding Group I, they concluded: We have subjected them with great care to all the a pplicable tests to which historical students are accustomed and . . . upon the basis of these investigations, we have no hesitation in declaring that we see no reason to do ubt the genuineness or authenticity of these fifty-three documents. 7 The historians were less confident about material i n Group II. This group was not rejected as. outright forgeries, but it was suggest ed that they were copies of original documents. Although the historians made \"no confide nt declaration\" on Group III, they were not prepared to reject the documents as o utright forgeries. The Sisson Documents were published by the Committe e on Public Information, whose chairman was George Creel, a former contribut or to the pro-Bolshevik Masses. The American press in general accepted the document s as authentic. The notable exception was the New York Evening Post, at that time owned by Thomas W. Lamont,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"a partner in the Morgan firm. When only a few insta llments had been published, the Post challenged the authenticity of all the documents. 8 We now know that the Sisson Documents were almost a ll forgeries: only one or two of the minor German circulars were genuine. Even ca sual examination of the German letterhead suggests that the forgers were unusually careless forgers perhaps working for the gullible American market. The German text w as strewn with terms verging on the ridiculous: for example, Bureau instead of the German word Büro; Central for the German Zentral; etc. That the documents are forgeries is the conclusion of an exhaustive study by George Kennan 9 and of studies made in the 1920s by the British go vernment. Some documents were based on authentic information and, as Kennan observes, those who forged them certainly had access to some unusually good information. For example, Documents 1, 54, 61, and 67 mention that the Nya Ba nken in Stockholm served as the conduit for Bolshevik funds from Germany. This cond uit has been confirmed in more reliable sources. Documents 54, 63, and 64 mention Furstenberg as the banker- intermediary between the Germans and the Bolshevist s; Furstenberg's name appears elsewhere in authentic documents. Sisson's Document 54 mentions Olof Aschberg, and Olof Aschberg by his own statements was the \"Bo lshevik Banker.\" Aschberg in 1917 was the director of Nya Banken. Other document s in the Sisson series list names and institutions, such as the German Naptha-Industr ial Bank, the Disconto Gesellschaft, and Max Warburg, the Hamburg banker, but hard supportive evidence is more elusive. In general, the Sisson Documents, whi le themselves outright forgeries, are nonetheless based partly on generally authentic information. One puzzling aspect in the light of the story in th is book is that the documents came to Edgar Sisson from Alexander Gumberg (alias Berg, re al name Michael Gruzenberg), the Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia and later a conf idential assistant to Chase National Bank and Floyd Odium of Atlas Corporation. The Bols hevists, on the other hand, stridently repudiated the Sisson material. So did J ohn Reed, the American representative on the executive of the Third Intern ational and whose paycheck came from Metropolitan magazine, which was owned by J.P. Morgan interests. 10 So did Thomas Lamont, the Morgan partner who owned the New York Evening Post. There are several possible explanations. Probably the con nections between the Morgan interests in New York and such agents as John Reed and Alexander Gumberg were highly flexible. This could have been a Gumberg maneuver to discredit Sisson an d Creel by planting forged documents; or perhaps Gumb erg was working in his own interest. The Sisson Documents \"prove\" exclusive German invol vement with the Bolsheviks. They also have been used to \"prove\" a Jewish-Bolshe vik conspiracy theory along the lines of that of the Protocols of Zion. In 1918 the U.S. government wanted to unite American opinion behind an unpopular war with Germa ny, and the Sisson Documents dramatically \"proved\" the exclusive complicity of G ermany with the Bolshevists. The documents also provided a smoke screen against publ ic knowledge of the events to be described in this book. THE TUG-OF-WAR IN WASHINGTON 11 "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"A review of documents in the State Department Decim al File suggests that the State Department and Ambassador Francis in Petrograd were quite well informed about the intentions and progress of the Bolshevik movement. In the summer of 1917, for example, the State Department wanted to stop the de parture from the U.S. of \"injurious persons\" (that is, returning Russian rev olutionaries) but was unable to do so because they were using new Russian and American pa ssports. The preparations for the Bolshevik Revolution itself were well known at least six weeks before it came about. One report in the State Department files sta tes, in regard to the Kerensky forces, that it was \"doubtful whether government . . . [can ] suppress outbreak.\" Disintegration of the Kerensky government was reported throughout September and October as were Bolshevik preparations for a coup. The British gove rnment warned British residents in Russia to leave at least six weeks before the Bolsh evik phase of the revolution. The first full report of the events of early Novemb er reached Washington on December 9, 1917. This report described the low-key nature of the revolution itself, mentioned that General William V. Judson had made a n unauthorized visit to Trotsky, and pointed out the presence of Germans in Smolny — the Soviet headquarters. On November 28, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson orde red no interference with the Bolshevik Revolution. This instruction was apparent ly in response to a request by Ambassador Francis for an Allied conference, to whi ch Britain had already agreed. The State Department argued that such a conference was impractical. There were discussions in Paris between the Allies and Colonel Edward M. House, who reported these to Woodrow Wilson as \"long and frequent discu ssions on Russia.\" Regarding such a conference, House stated that England was \"p assively willing,\" France \"in differently against,\" and Italy \"actively so.\" Wood row Wilson, shortly thereafter, approved a cable authored by Secretary of State Rob ert Lansing, which provided financial assistance for the Kaledin movement (Dece mber 12, 1917). There were also rumors filtering into Washington that \"monarchists working with the Bolsheviks and same supported by various occurrences and circumsta nces\"; that the Smolny government was absolutely under control of the Germ an General Staff; and rumors elsewhere that \"many or most of them [that is, Bols hevists] are from America.\" In December, General Judson again visited Trotsky; this was looked upon as a step towards recognition by the U.S., although a report dated February 5, 1918, from Ambassador Francis to Washington, recommended again st recognition. A memorandum originating with Basil Miles in Washingt on argued that \"we should deal with all authorities in Russia including Bolsheviks .\" And on February 15, 1918, the State Department cabled Ambassador Francis in Petro grad, stating that the \"department desires you gradually to keep in somewh at closer and informal touch with the Bolshevik authorities using such channels as will avoid any official recognition.\" The next day Secretary of State Lansing conveyed th e following to the French ambassador J. J. Jusserand in Washington: \"It is considered inadvisable to take any action which will antagonize at this time any of th e various elements of the people which now control the power in Russia .... \" 12 On February 20, Ambassador Francis cabled Washingto n to report the approaching end of the Bolshevik government. Two weeks later, o n March 7, 1918, Arthur Bullard"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"reported to Colonel House that German money was sub sidizing the Bolsheviks and that this subsidy was more substantial than previou sly thought. Arthur Bullard (of the U.S. Committee on Public Information) argued: \"we ought to be ready to help any honest national government. But men or money or equ ipment sent to the present rulers of Russia will be used against Russians at l east as much as against Germans.\" 13 This was followed by another message from Bullard t o Colonel House: \"I strongly advise against giving material help to the present Russian government. Sinister elements in Soviets seem to be gaining control.\" But there were influential counterforces at work. A s early as November 28, 1917, Colonel House cabled President Woodrow Wilson from Paris that it was \"exceedingly important\" that U.S. newspaper comments advocating that \"Russia should be treated as an enemy\" be \"suppressed.\" Then next month Willi am Franklin Sands, executive secretary of the Morgan-controlled American Interna tional Corporation and a friend of the previously mentioned Basil Miles, submitted a memorandum that described Lenin and Trotsky as appealing to the masses and th at urged the U.S. to recognize Russia. Even American socialist Walling complained to the Department of State about the pro-Soviet attitude of George Creel (of the U.S . Committee on Public Information), Herbert Swope, and William Boyce Thom pson (of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York). On December 17, 1917, there appeared in a Moscow ne wspaper an attack on Red Cross colonel Raymond Robins and Thompson, alleging a link between the Russian Revolution and American bankers: Why are they so interested in enlightenment? Why wa s the money given the socialist revolutionaries and not to the constitutional democ rats? One would suppose the latter nearer and dearer to hearts of bankers. The article goes on to argue that this was because American capital viewed Russia as a future market and thus wanted to get a firm footh old. The money was given to the revolutionaries because the backward working men and peasants trust the soc ial revolutionaries. At the time when the money was passed the social revolutionarie s were in power and it was supposed they would remain in control in Russia for some time. Another report, dated December 12, 1917, and relati ng to Raymond Robins, details \"negotiation with a group of American bankers of th e American Red Cross Mission\"; the \"negotiation\" related to a payment of two milli on dollars. On January 22, 1918, Robert L Owen, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committe e on Banking and Currency and linked to Wall Street interests, sent a letter to Woodrow Wilson recommending de facto recognition of Russia, permission for a shipl oad of goods urgently needed in Russia, the appointment of representatives to Russi a to offset German influence, and the establishment of a career-service group in Russ ia. This approach was consistently aided by Raymond Rob ins in Russia. For example, on February 15, 1918, a cable from Robins in Petrograd to Davison in the Red Cross in Washington (and to be forwarded to William Boyce Th ompson) argued that support"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"be given to the Bolshevik authority for as long as possible, and that the new revolutionary Russia will turn to the United States as it has \"broken with the German imperialism.\" According to Robins, the Bolsheviks w anted United States assistance and cooperation together with railroad reorganizati on, because \"by generous assistance and technical advice in reorganizing com merce and industry America may entirely exclude German commerce during balance of war.\" In brief, the tug-of-war in Washington reflected a struggle between, on one side, old- line diplomats (such as Ambassador Francis) and low er-level departmental officials, and, on the other, financiers like Robins, Thompson , and Sands with allies such as Lansing and Miles in the State Department and Senat or Owen in the Congress.

Otto H. Kahn, director, American International Corp ., and partner, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., speaking to the League/or Industrial Democracy , New York, December 30, 1924 Before World War I, the financial and business stru cture of the United States was dominated by two conglomerates: Standard Oil, or th e Rockefeller enterprise, and the Morgan complex of industries — finance and transpor tation companies. Rockefeller and Morgan trust alliances dominated not only Wall Street but, through interlocking directorships, almost the entire economic fabric of the United States. l Rockefeller interests monopolized the petroleum and allied indu stries, and controlled the copper trust, the smelters trust, and the gigantic tobacco trust, in addition to having influence in some Morgan properties such as the U.S. Steel Co rporation as well as in hundreds of smaller industrial trusts, public service operat ions, railroads, and banking institutions. National City Bank was the largest of the banks influenced by Standard Oil-Rockefeller, but financial control extended to the United States Trust Company and Hanover National Bank as well as to major life insurance companies — Equitable Life and Mutual of New York. The great Morgan enterprises were in steel, shippin g, and the electrical industry; they included General Electric, the rubber trust, and ra ilroads. Like Rockefeller, Morgan controlled financial corporations — the National Ba nk of Commerce and the Chase National Bank, New York Life Insurance, and the Gua ranty Trust Company. The names J.P. Morgan and Guaranty Trust Company occur repeatedly throughout this book. In the early part of the twentieth century th e Guaranty Trust Company was dominated by the Harriman interests. When the elder Harriman (Edward Henry) died in 1909, Morgan and associates bought into Guaranty Trust as well as into Mutual Life and New York Life. In 1919 Morgan also bought control of Equitable Life, and the Guaranty Trust Company absorbed an additional s ix lesser trust companies. Therefore, at the end of World War I the Guaranty T rust and Bankers Trust were, respectively, the first and second largest trust co mpanies in the United States, both dominated by Morgan interests. 2 American financiers associated with these groups we re involved in financing revolution even before 1917. Intervention by the Wa ll Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell into the Panama Canal controversy is recor ded in 1913 congressional hearings. The episode is summarized by Congressman Rainey: It is my contention that the representatives of thi s Government [United States] made possible the revolution on the isthmus of Panama. T hat had it not been for the interference of this Government a successful revolu tion could not possibly have"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"occurred, and I contend that this Government violat ed the treaty of 1846. I will be able to produce evidence to show that the declarati on of independence which was promulgated in Panama on the 3rd day of November, 1 903, was prepared right here in New York City and carried down there — prepared in the office of Wilson (sic) Nelson Cromwell .... 3 Congressman Rainey went on to state that only ten o r twelve of the top Panamanian revolutionists plus \"the officers of the Panama Rai lroad & Steamship Co., who were under the control of William Nelson Cromwell, of Ne w York and the State Department officials in Washington,\" knew about the impending revolution. 4 The purpose of the revolution was to deprive Colombia, of which Panama was then a part, of $40 million and to acquire control of the Panama Canal. The best-documented example of Wall Street interven tion in revolution is the operation of a New York syndicate in the Chinese re volution of 1912, which was led by Sun Yat-sen. Although the final gains of the syn dicate remain unclear, the intention and role of the New York financing group are fully documented down to amounts of money, information on affiliated Chinese secret societies, and shipping lists of armaments to be purchased. The New York ba nkers syndicate for the Sun Yat- sen revolution included Charles B. Hill, an attorne y with the law firm of Hunt, Hill & Betts. In 1912 the firm was located at 165 Broadway , New York, but in 1917 it moved to 120 Broadway (see chapter eight for the si gnificance of this address). Charles B. Hill was director of several Westinghous e subsidiaries, including Bryant Electric, Perkins Electric Switch, and Westinghouse Lamp — all affiliated with Westinghouse Electric whose New York office was als o located at 120 Broadway. Charles R. Crane, organizer of Westinghouse subsidi aries in Russia, had a known role in the first and second phases of the Bolshevik Rev olution (see page 26). The work of the 1910 Hill syndicate in China is rec orded in the Laurence Boothe Papers at the Hoover Institution. 5 These papers contain over 110 related items, including letters of Sun Yat-sen to and from his Am erican backers. In return for financial support, Sun Yat-sen promised the Hill sy ndicate railroad, banking, and commercial concessions in the new revolutionary Chi na. Another case of revolution supported by New York fi nancial institutions concerned that of Mexico in 1915-16. Von Rintelen, a German e spionage agent in the United States, 6 was accused during his May 1917 trial in New York City of attempting to \"embroil\" the U.S. with Mexico and Japan in order t o divert ammunition then flowing to the Allies in Europe. 7 Payment for the ammunition that was shipped from t he United States to the Mexican revolutionary Pancho V illa, was made through Guaranty Trust Company. Von Rintelen's adviser, Sommerfeld, paid $380,000 via Guaranty Trust and Mississippi Valley Trust Company to the W estern Cartridge Company of Alton, Illinois, for ammunition shipped to El Paso, for forwarding to Villa. This was in mid-1915. On January 10, 1916, Villa murdered se venteen American miners at Santa Isabel and on March 9, 1916, Villa raided Col umbus, New Mexico, and killed eighteen more Americans. Wall Street involvement in these Mexican border rai ds was the subject of a letter (October 6, 1916) from Lincoln Steffens, an America n Communist, to Colonel House, an aide' to Woodrow Wilson:"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"My dear Colonel House: Just before I left New York last Monday, I was told convincingly that \"Wall Street\" had completed arrangements for one more raid of Mex ican bandits into the United States: to be so timed and so atrocious that it wou ld settle the election .... 8 Once in power in Mexico, the Carranza government pu rchased additional arms in the United States. The American Gun Company contracted to ship 5,000 Mausers and a shipment license was issued by the War Trade Board for 15,000 guns and 15,000,000 rounds of ammunition. The American ambassador to Me xico, Fletcher, \"flatly refused to recommend or sanction the shipment of any muniti ons, rifles, etc., to Carranza.\" 9 However, intervention by Secretary of State Robert Lansing reduced the barrier to one of a temporary delay, and \"in a short while . . . [ the American Gun Company] would be permitted to make the shipment and deliver.\" 10 The raids upon the U.S. by the Villa and the Carran za forces were reported in the New York Times as the \"Texas Revolution\" (a kind of dry run for th e Bolshevik Revolution) and were undertaken jointly by Germans and Bolshevi ks. The testimony of John A. Walls, district attorney of Brownsville, Texas, bef ore the 1919 Fall Committee yielded documentary evidence of the link between Bo lshevik interests in the United States, German activity, and the Carranza forces in Mexico. 11 Consequently, the Carranza government, the first in the world with a Soviet-type constitution (which was written by Trotskyites), was a government with support on Wall Street. The Carranza revolution probably could not have succeed ed without American munitions and Carranza would not have remained in power as lo ng as he did without American help. 12 Similar intervention in the 1917 Bolshevik Revoluti on in Russia revolves around Swedish banker and intermediary Olof Aschberg. Logi cally the story begins with prerevolutionary tsarist loans by Wall Street bank syndicates. AMERICAN BANKERS AND TSARIST LOANS In August 1914 Europe went to war. Under internatio nal law neutral countries (and the United States was neutral until April 1917) cou ld not raise loans for belligerent countries. This was a question of law as well as mo rality. When the Morgan house floated war loans for Britain and France in 1915, J.P. Morgan argued that these were not war loans at all but merely a means of facilitating international trade. Such a distinction had indeed been elaborately made by President Wilson in October 1914; he explained that the sale of bonds in the U.S. for foreign governments was in effect a loan of savings to bell igerent governments and did not finance a war. On the other hand, acceptance of Tre asury notes or other evidence of debt in payment for articles was only a means of fa cilitating trade and not of financing a war effort. 13 Documents in the State Department files demonstrate that the National City Bank, controlled by Stillman and Rockefeller interests, a nd the Guaranty Trust, controlled by Morgan interests, jointly raised substantial loa ns for the belligerent Russia before"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"U.S. entry into the war, and that these loans were raised alter the State Department pointed out to these firms that they were contrary to international law. Further, negotiations for the loans were undertaken through official U.S. government communications facilities under cover of the top-le vel \"Green Cipher\" of the State Department. Below are extracts from State Departmen t cables that will make the case. On May 94, 1916, Ambassador Francis in Petrograd se nt the following cable to the State Department in Washington for forwardin to Fra nk Arthur Vanderlip, then chairman of the National City Bank in New York.

FRANCIS, AMERICAN AMBASSADOR Note:— Entire Message in Green Cipher. TELEGRAPH ROOM 15 \"Olof\" in the cable was Olof Aschberg, Swedish bank er and head of the Nya Banken in Stockholm. Aschberg had been in New York in 1915 conferring with the Morgan firm on these Russian loans. Now, in 1916, he was i n Petrograd with Rolph Marsh of Guaranty Trust and Samuel MacRoberts and Rich of Na tional City Bank (\"City\" in cable) arranging loans for a Morgan-Rockefeller con sortium. The following year, Aschberg, as we shall see later, would be known as the \"Bolshevik Banker,\" and his own memoirs reproduce evidence of his right to the title. The State Department files also contain a series of cables between Ambassador Francis, Acting Secretary Frank Polk, and Secretary of State Robert Lansing concerning the legality and propriety of transmitti ng National City Bank and Guaranty Trust cables at public expense. On May 25, 1916, Ambassador Francis cabled Washington as follows and referred to the tw o previous cables: 569, May 25, one p.m. My telegram 563 and 565 May twenty-fourth are sent for local representatives of institutions addressed in the hope of consummating loan which would largely increase international trade and greatly benefit [diplomatic relations?]. Prospect for success promising. Petrograd representatives consider terms submitted very satisfactory but fear such representations to their institutions wou ld prevent consummation loan if Government here acquainted these proposals. FRANCIS, AMERICAN AMBASSADOR. 16 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" The basic reason cited by Francis for facilitating the cables is \"the hope of consummating loan which would largely increase inte rnational trade.\" Transmission of commercial messages using State Department facil ities had been prohibited, and on June 1, 1916, Polk cabled Francis: 842 In view of Department's regulation contained in its circular telegraphic instruction of March fifteenth, (discontinuance of forwarding Comm ercial messages) 17 1915, please explain why messages in your 563, 565 and 575, shou ld be communicated. Hereafter please follow closely Department's instru ctions. Acting.

If they do, I regret that the Department can not be a party to their transmission, as such action wo uld submit it to justifiable criticism because of participation by this Government in loan transaction by a belligerent for the purpose of carrying on its hostile operations. Such participation is contrary to the accepted rule of international law that neutral Gov ernments should not lend their assistance to the raising of war loans by belligere nts. The last line of the Lansing cable as written, was not transmitted to Petrograd. The line read: \"Cannot arrangements be made to send the se messages through Russian channels?\" How can we assess these cables and the parties invo lved? Clearly the Morgan-Rockefeller interests were not i nterested in abiding by international law. There is obvious intent in these cables to supply loans to belligerents. There was no hesitation on the part o f these firms to use State Department facilities for the negotiations. Further , in spite of protests, the State Department allowed the messages to go through. Fina lly, and most interesting for subsequent events, Olof Aschberg, the Swedish banke r, was a prominent participant and intermediary in the negotiations on behalf of G uaranty Trust. Let us therefore take a closer look at Olof Aschberg. OLOF ASCHBERG IN NEW YORK, 1916"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Olof Aschberg, the \"Bolshevik Banker\" (or \"Bankier der Weltrevolution,\" as he has been called in the German press), was owner of the Nya Banken, founded 1912 in Stockholm. His codirectors included prominent membe rs of Swedish cooperatives and Swedish socialists, including G. W. Dahl, K. G. Ros ling, and C. Gerhard Magnusson. 18 In 1918 Nya Banken was placed on the Allied black- list for its financial operations in behalf of Germany. In response to the blacklisting, Nya Banken changed its name to Svensk Ekonomiebolaget. The bank remain ed under the control of Aschberg, and was mainly owned by him. The bank's L ondon agent was the British Bank of North Commerce, whose chairman was Earl Gre y, former associate of Cecil Rhodes. Others in Aschberg's interesting circle of business associates included Krassin, who was until the Bolshevik Revolution (wh en he changed color to emerge as a leading Bolshevik) Russian manager of Siemens- Schukert in Petrograd; Carl Furstenberg, minister of finance in the first Bolsh evik government; and Max May, vice president in charge of foreign operations for Guaranty Trust of New York. Olof Aschberg thought so highly of Max May that a photog raph of May is included in Aschberg's book. 19 In the summer of 1916 Olof Aschberg was in New York representing both Nya Banken and Pierre Bark, the tsarist minister of fin ance. Aschberg's prime business in New York, according to the New York Times (August 4, 1916), was to negotiate a $50 million loan for Russia with an American banking sy ndicate headed by Stillman's National City Bank. This business was concluded on June 5, 1916; the results were a Russian credit of $50 million in New York at a bank charge of 7 1/2 percent per annum, and a corresponding 150-million-ruble credit for the NCB syndicate in Russia. The New York syndicate then turned around and issue d 6 1/2 percent certificates in its own name in the U.S. market to the amount of $50 mi llion. Thus, the NCB syndicate made a profit on the $50 million loan to Russia, fl oated it on the American market for another profit, and obtained a 150-million-ruble cr edit in Russia. During his New York visit on behalf of the tsarist Russian government, Aschberg made some prophetic comments concerning the future for America in Russia: The opening for American capital and American initi ative, with the awakening brought by the war, will be country-wide when the s truggle is over. There are now many Americans in Petrograd, representatives of bus iness firms, keeping in touch with the situation, and as soon as the change comes a huge American trade with Russia should spring up. 20 OLOF ASCHBERG IN THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION While this tsarist loan operation was being floated in New York, Nya Banken and Olof Aschberg were funneling funds from the German government to Russian revolutionaries, who would eventually bring down th e \"Kerensky committee\" and establish the Bolshevik regime. The evidence for Olof Aschberg's intimate connectio n with financing the Bolshevik Revolution comes from several sources, some of grea ter value than others. The Nya Banken and Olof Aschberg are prominently cited in t he Sisson papers (see chapter three); however, George Kennan has systematically a nalyzed these papers and shown"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"them to be forged, although they are probably based in part on authentic material. Other evidence originates with Colonel B. V. Nikiti ne, in charge of counterintelligence in the Kerensky government, and consists of twenty-nine telegrams transmitted from Stockholm to Petrograd, and vice versa, regarding financing of the Bolsheviks. Three of these telegra ms refer to banks — telegrams 10 and 11 refer to Nya Banken, and telegram 14 refers to the Russo-Asiatic Bank in Petrograd. Telegram 10 reads as follows: Gisa Furstenberg Saltsjobaden. Funds very low canno t assist if really urgent give 500 as last payment pencils huge loss original hopeless instruct Nya Banken cable further 100 thousand Sumenson. Telegram 11 reads: Kozlovsky Sergievskaya 81. First letters received N ya Banken telegraphed cable who Soloman offering local telegraphic agency refers to Bronck Savelievich Avilov. Fürstenberg was the intermediary between Parvus (Al exander I. Helphand) and the German government. About these transfers, Michael F utrell concludes: It was discovered that during the last few months s he [Evegeniya Sumenson] had received nearly a million rubles from Furstenberg t hrough the Nya Banken in Stockholm, and that this money came from German sou rces. 21 Telegram 14 of the Nikitine series reads: \"Furstenb erg Saltsjöbaden. Number 90 period hundred thousand into Russo-Asiatic Sumenson .\" The U.S. representative for Russo-Asiatic was MacGregor Grant Company at 120 Br oadway, New York City, and the bank was financed by Guaranty Trust in the U.S. and Nya Banken in Sweden. Another mention of the Nya Banken is in the materia l \"The Charges Against the Bolsheviks,\" which was published in the Kerensky pe riod. Particularly noteworthy in that material is a document signed by Gregory Alexi nsky, a former member of the Second State Duma, in reference to monetary transfe rs to the Bolsheviks. The document, in part, reads as follows: In accordance with the information just received th ese trusted persons in Stockholm were: the Bolshevik Jacob Furstenberg, better known under the name of \"Hanecki\" (Ganetskii), and Parvus (Dr. Helfand); in Petrograd : the Bolshevik attorney, M. U. Kozlovsky, a woman relative of Hanecki — Sumenson, engaged in speculation together with Hanecki, and others. Kozlovsky is the chief receiver of German money, which is transferred from Berlin through the \"Disco nto-Gesellschaft\" to the Stockholm \"Via Bank,\" and thence to the Siberian Ba nk in Petrograd, where his account at present has a balance of over 2,000,000 rubles. The military censorship has unearthed an uninterrupted exchange of telegrams of a political and financial nature between the German agents and Bolshevik leaders [St ockholm-Petrograd]. 22 Further, there is in the State Dept. files a Green Cipher message from the U.S. embassy in Christiania (named Oslo, 1925), Norway, dated February 21, 1918, that reads: \"Am informed that Bolshevik funds are deposi ted in Nya Banken, Stockholm, Legation Stockholm advised. Schmedeman.\" 23 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Finally, Michael Furtell, who interviewed Olof Asch berg just before his death, concludes that Bolshevik funds were indeed transfer red from Germany through Nya Banken and Jacob Furstenberg in the guise of paymen t for goods shipped. According to Futrell, Aschberg confirmed to him that Furstenb erg had a commercial business with Nya Banken and that Furstenberg had also sent funds to Petrograd. These statements are authenticated in Aschberg's memoirs (see page 70). In sum, Aschberg, through his Nya Banken, was undoubtedly a channel f or funds used in the Bolshevik Revolution, and Guaranty Trust was indirectly linke d through its association with Aschberg and its interest in MacGregor Grant Co., N ew York, agent of the Russo- Asiatic Bank, another transfer vehicle. NYA BANKEN AND GUARANTY TRUST JOIN RUSKOMBANK Several years later, in the fall of 1922, the Sovie ts formed their first international bank. It was based on a syndicate that involved the forme r Russian private bankers and some new investment from German, Swedish, American, and British bankers. Known as the Ruskombank (Foreign Commercial Bank or the B ank of Foreign Commerce), it was headed by Olof Aschberg; its board consisted of tsarist private bankers, representatives of German, Swedish, and American ba nks, and, of course, representatives of the Soviet Union. The U.S. Stock holm legation reported to Washington on this question and noted, in a referen ce to Aschberg, that \"his reputation is poor. He was referred to in Document 54 of the Sisson documents and Dispatch No. 138 of January 4, 1921 from a legation in Copenhagen.\" 24 The foreign banking consortium involved in the Rusk ombank represented mainly British capital. It included Russo-Asiatic Consolid ated Limited, which was one of the largest private creditors of Russia, and which was granted £3 million by the Soviets to compensate for damage to its properties in the Sovi et Union by nationalization. The British government itself had already purchased sub stantial interests in the Russian private banks; according to a State Department repo rt, \"The British Government is heavily invested in the consortium in question.\" 25 The consortium was granted extensive concessions in Russia and the bank had a share capital of ten million gold rubles. A report in the Danish newspaper National Titende stated that \"possibilities have been created for co operation with the Soviet government where this, by political negotiations, w ould have been impossible.\" 26 In other words, as the newspaper goes on to say, the p oliticians had failed to achieve cooperation with the Soviets, but \"it may be taken for granted that the capitalistic exploitation of Russia is beginning to assume more definite forms.\" 27 In early October 1922 Olof Aschberg met in Berlin w ith Emil Wittenberg, director of the Nationalbank fur Deutschland, and Scheinmann, h ead of the Russian State Bank. After discussions concerning German involvement in the Ruskombank, the three bankers went to Stockholm and there met with Max Ma y, vice president of the Guaranty Trust Company. Max May was then designated director of the Foreign Division of the Ruskombank, in addition to Schlesin ger, former head of the Moscow Merchant Bank; Kalaschkin, former head of the Junke r Bank; and Ternoffsky, former head of the Siberian Bank. The last bank had been p artly purchased by the British government in 1918. Professor Gustav Cassell of Swe den agreed to act as adviser to"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Ruskombank. Cassell was quoted in a Swedish newspap er (Svenskadagbladet of October 17, 1922) as follows: That a bank has now been started in Russia to take care of purely banking matters is a great step forward, and it seems to me that this ba nk was established in order to do something to create a new economic life in Russia. What Russia needs is a bank to create internal and external commerce. If there is to be any business between Russia and other countries there must be a bank to handle it. This step forward should be supported in every way by other countries, and when I was asked my advice I stated that I was prepared to give it. I am not in favor o f a negative policy and believe that every opportunity should be seized to help in a pos itive reconstruction. The great question is how to bring the Russian exchange back to normal. It is a complicated question and will necessitate thorough investigatio n. To solve this problem I am naturally more than willing to take part in the wor k. To leave Russia to her own resources and her own fate is folly. 28 The former Siberian Bank building in Petrograd was used as the head office of the Ruskombank, whose objectives were to raise short-te rm loans in foreign countries, to introduce foreign capital into the Soviet Union, an d generally to facilitate Russian overseas trade. It opened on December 1, 1922, in M oscow and employed about 300 persons. In Sweden Ruskombank was represented by the Svenska Ekonomibolaget of Stockholm, Olof Aschberg's Nya Banken under a new n ame, and in Germany by the Garantie und Creditbank fur Den Osten of Berlin. In the United States the bank was represented by the Guaranty Trust Company of New Yo rk. On opening the bank, Olof Aschberg commented: The new bank will look after the purchasing of mach inery and raw material from England and the United States and it will give guar antees for the completion of contracts. The question of purchases in Sweden has not yet arisen, but it is hoped that such will be the case later on. 29 On joining Ruskombank, Max May of Guaranty Trust ma de a similar statement: The United States, being a rich country with well d eveloped industries, does not need to import anything from foreign countries, but... i t is greatly interested in exporting its products to other countries and considers Russia th e most suitable market for that purpose, taking into consideration the vast require ments of Russia in all lines of its economic life. 30 May stated that the Russian Commercial Bank was \"ve ry important\" and that it would \"largely finance all lines of Russian industries.\" From the very beginning the operations of the Rusko mbank were restricted by the Soviet foreign-trade monopoly. The bank had difficu lties in obtaining advances on Russian goods deposited abroad. Because they were t ransmitted in the name of Soviet trade delegations, a great deal of Ruskombank funds were locked up in deposits with the Russian State Bank. Finally, in early 1924 the Russian Commercial Bank was fused with the Soviet foreign-trade commissariat, a nd Olof Aschberg was dismissed"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"from his position at the bank because, it was claim ed in Moscow, he had misused bank funds. His original connection with the bank w as because of his friendship with Maxim Litvinov. Through this association, so runs a State Department report, Olof Aschberg had access to large sums of money for the purpose of meeting payments on goods ordered by Soviets in Europe: These sums apparently were placed in the Ekonomibol aget, a private banking company, owned by Mr. Aschberg. It is now alledged [ sic ] that a large portion of these funds were employed by Mr. Aschberg for makin g investments for his personal account and that he is now endeavoring to maintain his position in the bank through his possession of this money. According to my infor mant Mr. Aschberg has not been the sole one to profit by his operations with the S oviet funds, but has divided the gains with those who are responsible for his appointment in the Russian Commerce Bank, among them being Litvinoff. 31 Ruskombank then became Vneshtorg, by which it is kn own today. We now have to retrace our steps and look at the ac tivities of Aschberg's New York associate, Guaranty Trust Company, during World War I, to lay the foundation for examination of its role in the revolutionary era in Russia. GUARANTY TRUST AND GERMAN ESPIONAGE IN THE UNITED STATES, 1914-1917 32 During World War I Germany raised considerable fund s in New York for espionage and covert operations in North America and South Am erica. It is important to record the flow of these funds because it runs from the sa me firms — Guaranty Trust and American International Corporation — that were invo lved in the Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath. Not to mention the fa ct (outlined in chapter three) that the German government also financed Lenin's revolut ionary activities. A summary of the loans granted by American banks to German interests in World War I was given to the 1919 Overman Committee of th e United States Senate by U.S. Military Intelligence. The summary was based on the deposition of Karl Heynen, who came to the United States in April 1915 to assist D r. Albert with the commercial and financial affairs of the German government. Heynen' s official work was the transportation of goods from the United States to G ermany by way of Sweden, Switzerland, and Holland. In fact, he was up to his ears in covert operations. The major German loans raised in the United States between 1915 and 1918, according to Heynen, were as follows: The first loa n, of $400,000, was made about September 1914 by the investment bankers Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Collateral of 25 million marks was deposited with Max M. Warburg in Hamburg, the German affiliate of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Captain George B. Lester of U.S . Military Intelligence told the Senate that Heynen's reply to the question \"Why did you go to Kuhn, Loeb & Co?\" was, \"Kuhn, Loeb & Co. we considered the natural ba nkers of the German government and the Reichsbank.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The second loan, of $1.3 million, did not come dire ctly from the United States but was negotiated by John Simon, an agent of the Suede utsche Disconto-Gesellschaft, to secure funds for making shipments to Germany. The third loan was from the Chase National Bank (in the Morgan group) in the amount of three million dollars. The fourth loan wa s from the Mechanics and Metals National Bank in the amount of one million dollars. These loans financed German espionage activities in the United States and Mexic o. Some funds were traced to Sommerfeld, who was an adviser to Von Rintelen (ano ther German espionage agent) and who was later associated with Hjalmar Schacht a nd Emil Wittenberg. Sommerfeld was to purchase ammunition for use in Me xico. He had an account with the Guaranty Trust Company and from this payments w ere made to Western Cartridge Co. of Alton, Illinois, for ammunition that was shi pped to El Paso for use in Mexico by Pancho Villa's bandits. About $400,000 was expen ded on ammunition, Mexican propaganda, and similar activities. The then German ambassador Count Von Bernstorff has recounted his friendship with Adolph von Pavenstedt, a senior partner of Amsinck & Co., which was controlled and in November 1917 owned by American International Co rporation. American International figures prominently in later chapters ; its board of directors contained the key names on Wall Street: Rockefeller, Kahn, Stillm an, du Pont, Winthrop, etc. According to Von Bernstorff, Von Pavenstedt was \"in timately acquainted with all the members of the Embassy.\" 33 Von Bernstorff himself regarded Von Pavenstedt as one of the most respected, \"if not the most respected imperial German in New York.\" 34 Indeed, Von Pavenstedt was \"for many years a Chief pay master of the German spy system in this country.\" 35 In other words, there is no question that Armsinck & Co., controlled by American International Corporation, w as intimately associated with the funding of German wartime espionage in the United S tates. To clinch Von Bernstorff's last statement, there exists a photogr aph of a check in favor of Amsinck & Co., dated December 8, 1917 — just four weeks aft er the start of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia — signed Von Papen (another Ge rman espionage operator), and having a counterfoil bearing the notation \"travelli ng expenses on Von W [i.e., Von Wedell].\" French Strothers, 36 who published the photograph, has stated that this check is evidence that Von Papen \"became an accessory aft er the fact to a crime against American laws\"; it also makes Amsinck & Co. subject to a similar charge. Paul Bolo-Pasha, yet another German espionage agent , and a prominent French financier formerly in the service of the Egyptian g overnment, arrived in New York in March 1916 with a letter of introduction to Von Pav enstedt. Through the latter, Bolo- Pasha met Hugo Schmidt, director of the Deutsche Ba nk in Berlin and its representative in the United States. One of Bolo-Pa sha's projects was to purchase foreign newspapers so as to slant their editorials in favor of Germany. Funds for this program were arranged in Berlin in the form of cred it with Guaranty Trust Company, with the credit subsequently made available to Amsi nck & Co. Adolph von Pavenstedt, of Amsinck, in turn made the funds avai lable to Bolo-Pasha. In other words, both Guaranty Trust Company and Ams inck & Co., a subsidiary of American International Corporation, were directly i nvolved in the implementation of German espionage and other activities in the United States. Some links can be established from these firms to each of the major G erman operators in the U.S. — Dr."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Albert, Karl Heynen, Von Rintelen, Von Papan, Count Jacques Minotto (see below), and Paul Bolo-Pasha. In 1919 the Senate Overman Committee also establish ed that Guaranty Trust had an active role in financing German World War I efforts in an \"unneutral\" manner. The testimony of the U.S. intelligence officer Becker m akes this clear: In this mission Hugo Schmidt [of Deutsche Bank] was very largely assisted by certain American banking institutions. It was while we were neutral, but they acted to the detriment of the British interests, and I have cons iderable data on the activity of the Guaranty Trust Co. in that respect, and would like to know whether the committee wishes me to go into it. SENATOR NELSON: That is a branch of the City Bank, is it not? MR. BECKER: No. SENATOR OVERMAN: If it was inimical to British inte rests it was unneutral, and I think you had better let it come out. SENATOR KING: Was it an ordinary banking transactio n? MR. BECKER: That would be a matter of opinion. It h as to do with camouflaging exchange so as to make it appear to be neutral exch ange, when it was really German exchange on London. As a result of those operations in which the Guaranty Trust Co. mainly participated between August 1, 1914, and the time America entered the war, the Deutsche Banke in its branches in South America succeeded in negotiating £4,670,000 of London exchange in war time. SENATOR OVERMAN: I think that is competent. 37 What is really important is not so much that financ ial assistance was given to Germany, which was only illegal, as that directors of Guaranty Trust were financially assisting the Allies at the same time. In other wor ds, Guaranty Trust was financing both sides of The conflict. This raises the questio n of morality. THE GUARANTY TRUST-MINOTTO-CAILLAUX THREADS. 38 Count Jacques Minotto is a most unlikely but verifi able and persistent thread that links the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia with Germa n banks, German World War I espionage in the United States, the Guaranty Trust Company in New York, the abortive French Bolshevik revolution, and the relat ed Caillaux-Malvy espionage trials in France. Jacques Minotto was born February 17, 1891, in Berl in, the son of an Austrian father descended from Italian nobility, and a German mothe r. Young Minotto was educated in Berlin and then entered employment with the Deut sche Bank in Berlin in 1912. Almost immediately Minotto was sent to the United S tates as assistant to Hugo Schmidt, deputy director of the Deutsche Bank and i ts New York representative. After"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"a year in New York, Minotto was sent by the Deutsch e Bank to London, where he circulated in prominent political and diplomatic ci rcles. At the outbreak of World War I, Minotto returned to the United States and immedi ately met with the German ambassador Count Von Bernstorff, after which he ent ered the employ of Guaranty Trust Company in New York. At Guaranty Trust, Minot to was under the direct orders of Max May, director of its foreign department and an associate of Swedish banker Olof Aschberg. Minotto was no minor bank official. The interrogatories of the Caillaux trials in Paris in 1919 established that M inotto worked directly under Max May. 39 On October 25, 1914, Guaranty Trust sent Jacques M inotto to South America to make a report on the political, financial, and c ommercial situation. As he did in London, Washington, and New York, so Minotto moved in the highest diplomatic and political circles here. One purpose of Minotto's mi ssion in Latin America was to establish the mechanism by which Guaranty Trust cou ld be used as an intermediary for the previously mentioned German fund raising on the London money market, which was then denied to Germany because of World W ar I. Minotto returned to the United States, renewed his association with Count V on Bernstorff and Count Luxberg, and subsequently, in 1916, attempted to obtain a po sition with U.S. Naval Intelligence. After this he was arrested on charges of pro-German activities. When arrested Minotto was working at the Chicago plant of his fat her-in-law Louis Swift, of Swift & Co., meatpackers. Swift put up the security for the $50,000 bond required to free Minotto, who was represented by Henry Veeder, the S wift & Co. attorney. Louis Swift was himself arrested for pro-German activitie s at a later date. As an interesting and not unimportant coincidence, \"Major\" Harold H. Swift, brother of Louis Swift, was a member of the William Boyce Thompson 1917 Red Cross Mission to Petrograd — that is, one of the group of Wall Stree t lawyers and businessmen whose intimate connections with the Russian Revolution ar e to be described later. Helen Swift Neilson, sister of Louis and Harold Swift, wa s later connected with the pro- Communist Abraham Lincoln Center \"Unity.\" This esta blished a minor link between German banks, American. banks, German espionage, an d, as we shall see later, the Bolshevik Revolution. 40 Joseph Caillaux was a famous (sometimes called noto rious) French politician. He was also associated with Count Minotto in the latter's Latin America operations for Guaranty Trust, and was later implicated in the fam ous French espionage cases of 1919, which had Bolshevik connections. In 1911, Cai llaux became minister of finance and later in the same year became premier of France . John Louis Malvy became undersecretary of state in the Caillaux government. Several years later Madame Caillaux murdered Gaston Calmette, editor of the pr ominent Paris newspaper Figaro. The prosecution charged that Madame Caillaux murder ed Calmette to prevent publication of certain compromising documents. This affair resulted in the departure of Caillaux and his wife from France. The couple we nt to Latin America and there met with Count Minotto, the agent of the Guaranty T rust Company who was in Latin America to establish intermediaries for German fina nce. Count Minotto was socially connected with the Caillaux couple in Rio de Janeir o and Sao Paulo, Brazil, in Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Buenos Aires, Argentina . In other words, Count Minotto was a constant companion of the Caillaux co uple while they were in Latin America. 41 On returning to France, Caillaux and his wife stay ed at Biarritz as guests of Paul Bolo-Pasha, who was, as we have seen, also a German espionage operator in the United States and France. 42 Later, in July 1915, Count Minotto arrived in Fran ce from Italy, met with the Caillaux couple; the same year the Caillaux couple also"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"visited Bolo-Pasha again in Biarritz. In other word s, in 1915 and 1916 Caillaux established a continuing social relationship with C ount Minotto and Bolo-Pasha, both of whom were German espionage agents in the United States. Bolo-Pasha's work in France was to gain influence f or Germany in the Paris newspapers Le Temps and Figaro. Bolo-Pasha then went to New York, arriving February 24, 1916. Here he was to negotiate a loan of $2 million — and here he was associated with Von Pavenstedt, the prominent Germa n agent with Amsinck & Co. 43 Severance Johnson, in The Enemy Within, has connected Caillaux and Malvy to the 1918 abortive French Bolshevik revolution, and stat es that if the revolution had succeeded, \"Malvy would have been the Trotsky of Fr ance had Caillaux been its Lenin.\" 44 Caillaux and Malvy formed a radical socialist part y in France using German funds and were brought to trial for these subversiv e efforts. The court interrogatories in the 1919 French espionage trials introduce testi mony concerning New York bankers and their relationship with these German es pionage operators. They also set forth the links between Count Minotto and Caillaux, as well as the relationship of the Guaranty Trust Company to the Deutsche Bank and the cooperation between Hugo Schmidt of Deutsche Bank and Max May of Guaranty Tr ust Company. The French interrogatory (page 940) has the following extract from the New York deposition of Count Minotto (page 10, and retranslated from the F rench): QUESTION: Under whose orders were you at Guaranty T rust? REPLY: Under the orders of Mr. Max May. QUESTION: He was a Vice President? ANSWER: He was Vice President and Director of the F oreign Department. Later, in 1922, Max May became a director of the So viet Ruskom-bank and represented the interests of Guaranty Trust in that bank. The French interrogatory establishes that Count Minotto, a German espionage agent, was in the employ of Guaranty Trust Company; that Max May was his superi or officer; and that Max May was also closely associated with Bolshevik banker O lof Aschberg. In brief: Max May of Guaranty Trust was linked to illegal fund raisin g and German espionage in the United States during World War I; he was linked ind irectly to the Bolshevik Revolution and directly to the establishment of Rus kombank, the first international bank in the Soviet Union. It is too early to attempt an explanation for this seemingly inconsistent, illegal, and sometimes immoral international activity. In genera l, there are two plausible explanations: the first, a relentless search for pr ofits; the second — which agrees with the words of Otto Kahn of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and of A merican International Corporation in the epigraph to this chapter — the r ealization of socialist aims, aims which \"should, and can, be brought about\" by nonsoc ialist means.

He was in reality nothing but a mask — the Red Cross complexion of the mission was nothing but a mask. Cornelius Kelleher, assistant to William Boyce Thom pson (in George F. Kennan, Russia Leaves the War) The Wall Street project in Russia in 1917 used the Red Cross Mission as its operational vehicle. Both Guaranty Trust and Nation al City Bank had representatives in Russia at the time of the revolution. Frederick M. Corse of the National City Bank branch in Petrograd was attached to the American Re d Cross Mission, of which a great deal will be said later. Guaranty Trust was r epresented by Henry Crosby Emery. Emery was temporarily held by the Germans in 1918 a nd then moved on to represent Guaranty Trust 'in China. Up to about 1915 the most influential person in the American Red Cross National Headquarters in Washington, D.C. was Miss Mabel Boa rdman. An active and energetic promoter, Miss Boardman had been the movi ng force behind the Red Cross enterprise, although its endowment came from wealth y and prominent persons including J. P. Morgan, Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Clevel and H. Dodge, and Mrs. Russell Sage. The 1910 fund-raising campaign for $2 million , for example, was successful only because it was supported by these wealthy resi dents of New York City. In fact, most of the money came from New York City. J.P. Mor gan himself contributed $100,000 and seven other contributors in New York C ity amassed $300,000. Only one person outside New York City contributed over $ 10,000 and that was William J. Boardman, Miss Boardman's father. Henry P. Davison was chairman of the 1910 New York Fund-Raising Committee and later became chairm an of the War Council of the American Red Cross. In other words, in World War I the Red Cross depended heavily on Wall Street, and specifically on the Morgan firm . The Red Cross was unable to cope with the demands o f World War I and in effect was taken over by these New York bankers. According to John Foster Dulles, these businessmen \"viewed the American Red Cross as a vir tual arm of government, they envisaged making an incalculable contribution to th e winning of the war.\" 1 In so doing they made a mockery of the Red Cross motto: \" Neutrality and Humanity.\" In exchange for raising funds, Wall Street asked fo r the Red Cross War Council; and on the recommendation of Cleveland H. Dodge, one of Woodrow Wilson's financial backers, Henry P. Davison, a partner in J.P. Morgan Company, became chairman. The list of administrators of the Red Cross then began to take on the appearance of the New York Directory of Directors: John D. Ryan, pres ident of Anaconda Copper Company (see frontispiece); George W. Hill, preside nt of the American Tobacco Company; Grayson M.P. Murphy, vice president of the Guaranty Trust Company; and"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Ivy Lee, public relations expert for the Rockefelle rs. Harry Hopkins, later to achieve fame under President Roosevelt, became assistant to the general manager of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. The question of a Red Cross Mission to Russia came before the third meeting of this reconstructed War Council, which was held in the Re d Cross Building, Washington, D.C., on Friday, May 29, 1917, at 11:00 A.M. Chairm an Davison was deputed to explore the idea with Alexander Legge of the Intern ational Harvester Company. Subsequently International Harvester, which had con siderable interests in Russia, provided $200,000 to assist financing the Russian m ission. At a later meeting it was made known that William Boyce Thompson, director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had \"offered to pay the entire expense of the commission\"; this offer was accepted in a telegram: \"Your desire to pay expense s of commission to Russia is very much appreciated and from our point of view very im portant.\" 2 The members of the mission received no pay. All exp enses were paid by William Boyce Thompson and the $200,000 from International Harvester was apparently used in Russia for political subsidies. We know from the files of the U.S. embassy in Petrograd that the U.S. Red Cross gave 4,000 rubles to Prince Lvoff, president of the Council of Ministers, for \"relief of revolutionists \" and 10,000 rubles in two payments to Kerensky for \"relief of political refugees.\" AMERICAN RED CROSS MISSION TO RUSSIA, 1917 In August 1917 the American Red Cross Mission to Ru ssia had only a nominal relationship with the American Red Cross, and must truly have been the most unusual Red Cross Mission in history. All expenses, includi ng those of the uniforms — the members were all colonels, majors, captains, or lie utenants — were paid out of the pocket of William Boyce Thompson. One contemporary observer dubbed the all- officer group an \"Haytian Army\": The American Red Cross delegation, about forty Colo nels, Majors, Captains and Lieutenants, arrived yesterday. It is headed by Col onel (Doctor) Billings of Chicago, and includes Colonel William B. Thompson and many d octors and civilians, all with military titles; we dubbed the outfit the \"Haytian Army\" because there were no privates. They have come to fill no clearly defined mission, as far as I can find out, in fact Gov. Francis told me some time ago that he had urged they not be allowed to come, as there were already too many missions from the various allies in Russia. Apparently, this Commission imagined there was urge nt call for doctors and nurses in Russia; as a matter of fact there is at present a s urplus of medical talent and nurses, native and foreign in the country and many haft-emp ty hospitals in the large cities. 3 The mission actually comprised only twenty-four (no t forty), having military rank from lieutenant colonel down to lieutenant, and was supplemented by three orderlies, two motion-picture photographers, and two interpret ers, without rank. Only five (out of twenty-four) were doctors; in addition, there we re two medical researchers. The mission arrived by train in Petrograd via Siberia i n August 1917. The five doctors and orderlies stayed one month, returning to the United States on September 11.

George C. Whipple was listed as professor of sanitary engineering at Harvard University but in fact was p artner of the New York firm of Hazen, Whipple & Fuller, engineering consultants. T his is significant because Malcolm Pirnie — of whom more later — was listed as an assistant sanitary engineer and employed as an engineer by Hazen, Whipple & Ful ler. The majority of the mission, as seen from the table , was made up of lawyers, financiers, and their assistants, from the New York financial district. The mission was financed by William B. Thompson, described in the o fficial Red Cross circular as \"Commissioner and Business Manager; Director United States Federal Bank of New York.\" Thompson brought along Cornelius Kelleher, d escribed as an attache to the mission but actually secretary to Thompson and with the same address — 14 Wall Street, New York City. Publicity for the mission wa s handled by Henry S. Brown, of the same address. Thomas Day Thacher was an attorne y with Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, a firm founded by his father, Thomas Thac her, in 1884 and prominently involved in railroad reorganization and mergers. Th omas as junior first worked for the family firm, became assistant U.S. attorney under H enry L. Stimson, and returned to the family firm in 1909. The young Thacher was a cl ose friend of Felix Frankfurter and later became assistant to Raymond Robins, also on the Red Cross Mission. In 1925 he was appointed district judge under Presiden t Coolidge, became solicitor general under Herbert Hoover, and was a director of the William Boyce Thompson Institute.

The elder Ward well was one of the signers of the famous Standard Oil trust agreement, a member o f the committee to organize Red Cross activities in the Spanish American War, and a director of the Greenwich Savings Bank. His son Alan was a director not only of Greenwich Savings, but also of Bank of New York and Trust Co. and the Georgian Man ganese Company (along with W. Averell Harriman, a director of Guaranty Trust). In 1917 Alan Wardwell was affiliated with Stetson, Jennings 8c Russell and la ter joined Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Gardner & Read (Frank L. Polk was acting secretary of state during the Bolshevik Revolution period). The Senate Overman Committee no ted that Wardwell was favorable to the Soviet regime although Poole, the State Department official on the spot, noted that \"Major Wardwell has of all America ns the widest personal knowledge of the terror\" (316-23-1449). In the 1920s Wardwell became active with the Russian- American Chamber of Commerce in promoting Soviet tr ade objectives. The treasurer of the mission was James W.

Swift, deputy commissioner, was assistant to the vi ce president of Swift & Company; William G. Nicholson was also with Swift & Company, Union Stockyards. Two persons were unofficially added to the mission after it arrived in Petrograd: Frederick M. Corse, representative of the National City Bank in Petrograd; and Herbert A. Magnuson, who was \"very highly recommend ed by John W. Finch, the confidential agent in China of Colonel William B. T hompson.\" 4 The Pirnie papers, deposited at the Hoover Institut ion, contain primary material on the mission. Malcolm Pirnie was an engineer employed by the firm of Hazen, Whipple & Fuller, consulting engineers, of 42 Street, New Yor k City. Pirnie was a member of the mission, listed on a manifest as an assistant sanit ary engineer. George C. Whipple, a partner in the firm, was also included in the group . The Pirnie papers include an original telegram from William B. Thompson, invitin g assistant sanitary engineer Pirnie to meet with him and Henry P. Davison, chair man of the Red Cross War Council and partner in the J.P. Morgan firm, before leaving for Russia. The telegram reads as follows: WESTERN UNION TELEGRAM New York, June 21, 1917 To Malcolm Pirnie I should very much like to have you dine with me at the Metropolitan Club, Sixteenth Street and Fifth Avenue New York City at eight o'cl ock tomorrow Friday evening to meet Mr. H. P. Davison. W. B. Thompson, 14 Wall Street The files do not elucidate why Morgan partner Davis on and Thompson, director of the Federal Reserve Bank — two of the most prominent fi nancial men in New York — wished to have dinner with an assistant sanitary en gineer about to leave for Russia. Neither do the files explain why Davison was subseq uently unable to meet Dr. Billings and the commission itself, nor why it was necessary to advise Pirnie of his inability to do so. But we may surmise that the off icial cover of the mission — Red Cross activities — was of significantly less intere st than the Thompson-Pirnie activities, whatever they may have been. We do know that Davison wrote to Dr. Billings on June 25, 1917: Dear Doctor Billings: It is a disappointment to me and to my associates o n the War Council not have been able to meet in a body the members of your Commissi on .... A copy of this letter was also mailed to assistant sanitary engineer Pirnie with a personal letter from Morgan banker Henry P. Davison , which read:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"My dear Mr. Pirnie: You will, I am sure, entirely understand the reason for the letter to Dr. Billings, copy of which is enclosed, and accept it in the spirit i n which it is sent .... The purpose of Davison's letter to Dr. Billings was to apologize to the commission and Billings for being unable to meet with them. We may then be justified in supposing that some deeper arrangements were made b y Davison and Pirnie concerning the activities of the mission in Russia and that these arrangements were known to Thompson. The probable nature of these act ivities will be described later. 5 The American Red Cross Mission (or perhaps we shoul d call it the Wall Street Mission to Russia) also employed three Russian-Engl ish interpreters: Captain Ilovaisky, a Russian Bolshevik; Boris Reinstein, a Russian-American, later secretary to Lenin, and the head of Karl Radek's Bureau of In ternational Revolutionary Propaganda, which also employed John Reed and Alber t Rhys Williams; and Alexander Gumberg (alias Berg, real name Michael Gr uzenberg), who was a brother of Zorin, a Bolshevik minister. Gumberg was also th e chief Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia. He later became a confidential assista nt to Floyd Odlum of Atlas Corporation in the United States as well as an advi ser to Reeve Schley, a vice president of the Chase Bank. It should be asked in passing: How useful were the translations supplied by these interpreters? On September 13, 1918, H. A. Doolittl e, American vice consul at Stockholm, reported to the secretary of state on a conversation with Captain Ilovaisky (who was a \"close personal friend\" of Colonel Robin s of the Red Cross Mission) concerning a meeting of the Murman Soviet and the A llies. The question of inviting the Allies to land at Murman was under discussion a t the Soviet, with Major Thacher of the Red Cross Mission acting for the Allies. Ilo vaisky interpreted Thacher's views for the Soviet. \"Ilovaisky spoke at some length in Russian, supposedly translating for Thacher, but in reality for Trotsky .... \"to the ef fect that \"the United States would never permit such a landing to occur and urging the speedy recognition of the Soviets and their politics.\" 6 Apparently Thacher suspected he was being mistrans lated and expressed his indignation. However, \"Ilovaisky imme diately telegraphed the substance to Bolshevik headquarters and through the ir press bureau had it appear in all the papers as emanating from the remarks of Maj or Thacher and as the general opinion of all truly accredited American representa tives.\" 7 Ilovaisky recounted to Maddin Summers, U.S. consul general in Moscow, several instances where he (Ilovaisky) and Raymond Robins o f the Red Cross Mission had manipulated the Bolshevik press, especially \"in reg ard to the recall of the Ambassador, Mr. Francis.\" He admitted that they had not been sc rupulous, \"but had acted according to their ideas of right, regardless of how they mig ht have conflicted with the politics of the accredited American representatives.\" 8 This then was the American Red Cross Mission to Rus sia in 1917. AMERICAN RED CROSS MISSION TO RUMANIA"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"In 1917 the American Red Cross also sent a medical assistance mission to Rumania, then fighting the Central Powers as an ally of Russ ia. A comparison of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia with that sent to Ruman ia suggests that the Red Cross Mission based in Petrograd had very little official connection with the Red Cross and even less connection with medical assistance. Where as the Red Cross Mission to Rumania valiantly upheld the Red Cross twin princip les of \"humanity\" and \"neutrality,\" the Red Cross Mission in Petrograd fl agrantly abused both. The American Red Cross Mission to Rumania left the United States in July 1917 and located itself at Jassy. The mission consisted of t hirty persons under Chairman Henry W. Anderson, a lawyer from Virginia. Of the thirty, sixteen were either doctors or surgeons. By comparison, out of twenty-nine individ uals with the Red Cross Mission to Russia, only three were doctors, although anothe r four members were from universities and specialized in medically related f ields. At the most, seven could be classified as doctors with the mission to Russia co mpared with sixteen with the mission to Rumania. There was about the same number of orderlies and nurses with both missions. The significant comparison, however, is that the Rumanian mission had only two lawyers, one treasurer, and one engine er. The Russian mission had fifteen lawyers and businessmen. None of the Rumani an mission lawyers or doctors came from anywhere near the New York area but all, except one (an \"observer\" from the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.), of the lawyers and businessmen with the Russian mission came from that area. Which is t o say that more than half the total of the Russian mission came from the New York finan cial district. In other words, the relative composition of these missions confirms tha t the mission to Rumania had a legitimate purpose — to practice medicine — while t he Russian mission had a non- medical and strictly political objective. From its personnel, it could be classified as a commercial or financial mission, but from its actio ns it was a subversive political action group.

The medical staff of the Americ an Red Cross Mission in Russia — the seven doctors — quit in disgust in Aug ust 1917, protested the political activities of Colonel Thompson, and returned to the United States. Consequently, in September 1917, when the Rumanian mission appealed to Petrograd for American doctors and nurses to help out in the near crisis c onditions in Jassy, there were no American doctors or nurses in Russia available to g o to Rumania. Whereas the bulk of the mission in Russia occupied its time in internal political maneuvering, the mission in Rumania threw itself in to relief work as soon as it arrived. On September 17, 1917, a confidential cabl e from Henry W. Anderson, chairman of the Rumania mission, to the American am bassador Francis in Petrograd requested immediate and urgent help in the form of $5 million to meet an impending catastrophe in Rumania. Then followed a series of l etters, cables, and communications from Anderson to Francis appealing, unsuccessfully, for help. On September 28, 1917, Vopicka, American minister i n Rumania, cabled Francis at length, for relay to Washington, and repeated Ander son's analysis of the Rumanian crisis and the danger of epidemics — and worse — as winter closed in: Considerable money and heroic measures required pre vent far reaching disaster .... Useless try handle situation without someone with a uthority and access to government . . . With proper organization to look a fter transport receive and distribute supplies. The hands of Vopicka and Anderson were tied as all Rumanian supplies and financial transactions were handled by the Red Cross Mission in Petrograd — and Thompson and his staff of fifteen Wall Street lawyers and bu sinessmen apparently had matters of greater concern that Rumanian Red Cross affairs. Th ere is no indication in the Petrograd embassy files at the U.S. State Departmen t that Thompson, Robins, or Thacher concerned himself at any time in 1917 or 19 18 with the urgent situation in Rumania. Communications from Rumania went to Ambass ador Francis or to one of his embassy staff, and occasionally through the con sulate in Moscow. By October 1917 the Rumanian situation reached the crisis point. Vopicka cabled Davison in New York (via Petrograd) on October 5: Most urgent problem here .... Disastrous effect fea red .... Could you possibly arrange special shipment .... Must rush or too late. Then on November 5 Anderson cabled the Petrograd em bassy saying that delays in sending help had already \"cost several thousand liv es.\" On November 13 Anderson cabled Ambassador Francis concerning Thompson's lac k of interest in Rumanian conditions: Requested Thompson furnish details all shipments as received but have not obtained same ....

THOMPSON IN KERENSKY'S RUSSIA What then was the Red Cross Mission doing? Thompson certainly acquired a reputation for opulent living in Petrograd, but app arently he undertook only two major projects in Kerensky's Russia: support for an Ameri can propaganda program and support for the Russian Liberty Loan. Soon after ar riving in Russia Thompson met with Madame Breshko-Breshkovskaya and David Soskice , Kerensky's secretary, and agreed to contribute $2 million to a committee of p opular education so that it could \"have its own press and... engage a staff of lectur ers, with cinematograph illustrations\" (861.00/ 1032); this was for the pro paganda purpose of urging Russia to continue in the war against Germany. According to S oskice, \"a packet of 50,000 rubles\" was given to Breshko-Breshkovskaya with the statement, \"This is for you to expend according to your best judgment.\" A further 2,100,000 rubles was deposited into a current bank account. A letter from J. P. Mo rgan to the State Department (861.51/190) confirms that Morgan cabled 425,000 ru bles to Thompson at his request for the Russian Liberty Loan; J. P. also conveyed t he interest of the Morgan firm regarding \"the wisdom of making an individual subsc ription through Mr. Thompson\" to the Russian Liberty Loan. These sums were transm itted through the National City Bank branch in Petrograd. THOMPSON GIVES THE BOLSHEVIKS $1 MILLION Of greater historical significance, however, was th e assistance given to the Bolsheviks first by Thompson, then, after December 4, 1917, by Raymond Robins. Thompson's contribution to the Bolshevik cause was recorded in the contemporary American press. The Washington Post of February 2, 1918, carried the following paragraphs: GIVES BOLSHEVIKI A MILLION W. B. Thompson, Red Cross Donor, Believes Party Mis represented. New York, Feb. 2 (1918). William B. Thompson, who was in Petrograd from July until November last, has made a personal contribution of $1,000,000 to t he Bolsheviki for the purpose of spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria. Mr. Thompson had an opportunity to study Russian co nditions as head of the American Red Cross Mission, expenses of which also were largely defrayed by his personal contributions. He believes that the Bolshe viki constitute the greatest power against Pro-Germanism in Russia and that their prop aganda has been undermining the militarist regimes of the General Empires. Mr. Thompson deprecates American criticism of the B olsheviki. He believes they have been misrepresented and has made the financial contribution to the cause in the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"belief that it will be money well spent for the fut ure of Russia as well as for the Allied cause. Hermann Hagedorn's biography The Magnate: William Boyce Thompson and His Time (1869-1930) reproduces a photograph of a cablegram from J.P. Mo rgan in New York to W. B. Thompson, \"Care American Red Cross, H otel Europe, Petrograd.\" The cable is date-stamped, showing it was received at P etrograd \"8-Dek 1917\" (8 December 1917), and reads: New York Y757/5 24W5 Nil — Your cable second receiv ed. We have paid National City Bank one million dollars as instructed — Morga n. The National City Bank branch in Petrograd had been exempted from the Bolshevik nationalization decree — the only foreign or domest ic Russian bank to have been so exempted. Hagedorn says that this million dollars p aid into Thompson's NCB account was used for \"political purposes.\" SOCIALIST MINING PROMOTER RAYMOND ROBINS 9 William B. Thompson left Russia in early December 1 917 to return home. He traveled via London, where, in company with Thomas Lamont of the J.P. Morgan firm, he visited Prime Minister Lloyd George, an ep isode we pick up in the next chapter. His deputy, Raymond Robins, was left in ch arge of the Red Cross Mission to Russia. The general impression that Colonel Robins presented in the subsequent months was not overlooked by the press. In the word s of the Russian newspaper Russkoe Slovo, Robins \"on the one hand represents American labor a nd on the other hand American capital, which is endeavoring through the Soviets to gain their Russian markets.\" 10 Raymond Robins started life as the manager of a Flo rida phosphate company commissary. From this base he developed a kaolin de posit, then prospected Texas and the Indian territories in the late nineteenth centu ry. Moving north to Alaska, Robins made a fortune in the Klondike gold rush. Then, for no observable reason, he switched to socialism and the reform movement. By 1 912 he was an active member of Roosevelt's Progressive Party. He joined the 1917 A merican Red Cross Mission to Russia as a \"social economist.\" There is considerable evidence, including Robins' o wn statements, that his reformist social-good appeals were little more than covers fo r the acquisition of further power and wealth, reminiscent of Frederick Howe's suggest ions in Confessions of a Monopolist. For example, in February 1918 Arthur Bullard was in Petrograd with the U.S. Committee on Public Information and engaged in writing a long memorandum for Colonel Edward House. This memorandum was given to Robins by Bullard for comments and criticism before transmission to House in Washington, D.C. Robins' very unsocialistic and imperialistic comments were to the effect that the manuscript was \"uncommonly discriminating, far-seeing and well done,\" but that he had one or two reservations — in particular, that recognition of the Bolsheviks was long overdue, that it should have been effected immediately, and that had the U.S. so recognized the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Bolsheviks, \"I believe that we would now be in cont rol of the surplus resources of Russia and have control officers at all points on t he frontier.\" 11 This desire to gain \"control of the surplus resourc es of Russia\" was also obvious to Russians. Does this sound like a social reformer in the American Red Cross or a Wall Street mining promoter engaged in the practical exe rcise of imperialism? In any event, Robins made no bones about his suppor t for the Bolshevists. 12 Barely three weeks after the Bolshevik phase of the Revolu tion started, Robins cabled Henry Davison at Red Cross headquarters: \"Please urge upo n the President the necessity of our continued intercourse with the Bolshevik Govern ment.\" Interestingly, this cable was in reply to a cable instructing Robins that the \"President desires the withholding of direct communications by representatives of the United States with the Bolshevik Government.\" 13 Several State Department reports complained about the partisan nature of Robins' activities. For example, on March 27, 1919, Harris, the American consul at Vladivostok, commented on a long conversa tion he had had with Robins and protested gross inaccuracies in the latter's report ing. Harris wrote, \"Robins stated to me that no German and Austrian prisoners of war had joined the Bolshevik army up to May 1918. Robbins knew this statement was absolu tely false.\" Harris then proceeded to provide the details of evidence availa ble to Robins. 14 Limit of Area Controlled by Bolsheviks, January 191 8 Harris concluded, \"Robbins deliberately misstated f acts concerning Russia at that time and he has been doing it ever since.\" On returning to the United States in 1918, Robins c ontinued his efforts in behalf of the Bolsheviks. When the files of the Soviet Bureau were seized by the Lusk Committee, it was found that Robins had had \"consid erable correspondence\" with Ludwig Martens and other members of the bureau. One of the more interesting documents seized was a letter from Santeri Nuorteva (alias Alexander Nyberg), the first Soviet representative in the U.S., to \"Comrad e Cahan,\" editor of the New York Daily Forward. The letter called on the party faithful to prepare the way for Raymond Robins: (To Daily) FORWARD  Jul y 6, 1918 Dear Comrade Cahan: It is of the utmost importance that the Socialist p ress set up a clamor immediately that Col. Raymond Robins, who has just returned from Rus sia at the head of the Red Cross Mission, should be heard from in a public rep ort to the American people.

Fraternally, PS&AU   Santeri Nuorteva THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND REVOLUTION Unknown to its administrators, the Red Cross has be en used from time to time as a vehicle or cover for revolutionary activities. The use of Red Cross markings for unauthorized purposes is not uncommon. When Tsar Ni cholas was moved from Petrograd to Tobolsk allegedly for his safety (alth ough this direction was towards danger rather than safety), the train carried Japan ese Red Cross placards. The State Department files contain examples of revolutionary activity under cover of Red Cross activities. For example, a Russian Red Cross offici al (Chelgajnov) was arrested in Holland in 1919 for revolutionary acts (316-21-107) . During the Hungarian Bolshevik revolution in 1918, led by Bela Kun, Russian member s of the Red Cross (or revolutionaries operating as members of the Russian Red Cross) were found in Vienna and Budapest. In 1919 the U.S. ambassador in London cabled Washington startling news; through the British government he h ad learned that \"several Americans who had arrived in this country in the uniform of t he Red Cross and who stated that they were Bolsheviks . . . were proceeding through France to Switzerland to spread Bolshevik propaganda.\" The ambassador noted that ab out 400 American Red Cross people had arrived in London in November and Decemb er 1918; of that number one quarter returned to the United States and \"the rema inder insisted on proceeding to France.\" There was a later report on January 15, 19 18, to the effect that an editor of a labor newspaper in London had been approached on th ree different occasions by three different American Red Cross officials who offered to take commissions to Bolsheviks in Germany. The editor had suggested to the U.S. embassy that it watch American Red Cross personnel. The U.S. State Depart ment took these reports seriously and Polk cabled for names, stating, \"If t rue, I consider it of the greatest importance\" (861.00/3602 and /3627). To summarize: the picture we form of the 1917 Ameri can Red Cross Mission to Russia is remote from one of neutral humanitarianis m. The mission was in fact a mission of Wall Street financiers to influence and pave the way for control, through either Kerensky or the Bolshevik revolutionaries, o f the Russian market and resources. No other explanation will explain the actions of th e mission. However, neither Thompson nor Robins was a Bolshevik. Nor was either even a consistent socialist. The writer is inclined to the interpretation that t he socialist appeals of each man were covers for more prosaic objectives. Each man was in tent upon the commercial; that is, each sought to use the political process in Russia for personal financial ends. Whether the Russian people wanted the Bolsheviks was of no concern. Whether the Bolshevik regime would act against the United States — as it consistently did later — was of no concern. The single overwhelming objective was to g ain political and economic influence with the new regime, whatever its ideolog y. If William Boyce Thompson had acted alone, then his directorship of the Feder al Reserve Bank would be inconsequential. However, the fact that his mission was dominated by representatives"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"of Wall Street institutions raises a serious questi on — in effect, whether the mission was a planned, premeditated operation by a Wall Str eet syndicate. This the reader will have to judge for himself, as the rest of the story unfolds.

Lord Milner, member of the British War Cabinet, 191 7, and director of the London Joint Stock Bank William Boyce Thompson is an unknown name in twenti eth-century history, yet Thompson played a crucial role in the Bolshevik Rev olution. 1 Indeed, if Thompson had not been in Russia in 1917, subsequent history might have followed a quite different course. Without the financial and, more i mportant, the diplomatic and propaganda assistance given to Trotsky and Lenin by Thompson, Robins, and their New York associates, the Bolsheviks may well have w ithered away and Russia evolved into a socialist but constitutional society . Who was William Boyce Thompson? Thompson was a prom oter of mining stocks, one of the best in a high-risk business. Before Wor ld War I he handled stock-market operations for the Guggenheim copper interests. Whe n the Guggenheims needed quick capital for a stock-market struggle with John D. Rockefeller, it was Thompson who promoted Yukon Consolidated Goldfields before a n unsuspecting public to raise a $3.5 million war chest. Thompson was manager of t he Kennecott syndicate, another Guggenheim operation, valued at $200 million. It wa s Guggenheim Exploration, on the other hand, that took up Thompson's options on the rich Nevada Consolidated Copper Company. About three quarters of the origina l Guggenheim Exploration Company was controlled by the Guggenheim family, th e Whitney family (who owned Metropolitan magazine, which employed the Bolshevik John Reed), and John Ryan. In 1916 the Guggenheim interests reorganized into G uggenheim Brothers and brought in William C. Potter, who was formerly with Guggenh eim's American Smelting and Refining Company but who was in 1916 first' vice pr esident of Guaranty Trust. Extraordinary skill in raising capital for risky mi ning promotions earned Thompson a personal fortune and directorships in Inspiration C onsolidated Copper Company, Nevada Consolidated Copper Company, and Utah Copper Company — all major domestic copper producers. Copper is, of course, a major material in the manufacture of munitions. Thompson was also director of the Chi cago Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, the Magma Arizona Railroad and the Metrop olitan Life Insurance Company. And of particular interest for this book, Thompson was \"one of the heaviest stockholders in the Chase National Bank.\" It was Al bert H. Wiggin, president of the Chase Bank, who pushed Thompson for a post in the F ederal Reserve System; and in 1914 Thompson became the first full-term director o f the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — the most important bank in the Federal R eserve System. By 1917, then, William Boyce Thompson was a financi al operator of substantial means, demonstrated ability, with a flair for promo tion and implementation of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"capitalist projects, and with ready access to the c enters of political and financial power. This was the same man who first supported Al eksandr Kerensky, and who then became an ardent supporter of the Bolsheviks, bequeathing a surviving symbol of this support — a laudatory pamphlet in Russian, \"Pravda o Rossii i Bol'shevikakh.\" 2 Before leaving Russia in early December 1917 Thomps on handed over the American Red Cross Mission to his deputy Raymond Robins. Rob ins then organized Russian revolutionaries to implement the Thompson plan for spreading Bolshevik propaganda in Europe (see Appendix 3). A French government doc ument confirms this: \"It appeared that Colonel Robins . . . was able to send a subversive mission of Russian bolsheviks to Germany to start a revolution there.\" 3 This mission led to the abortive German Spartacist revolt of 1918. The overall plan also included schemes for dropping Bolshevik literature by airplane or for sm uggling it across German lines. Thompson made preparations in late 1917 to leave Pe trograd and sell the Bolshevik Revolution to governments in Europe and to the U.S. With this in mind, Thompson cabled Thomas W. Lamont, a partner in the Morgan fi rm who was then in Paris with Colonel E. M. House. Lamont recorded the receipt of this cablegram in his biography: Just as the House Mission was completing its discus sions in Paris in December 1917, I received an arresting cable from my old school an d business friend, William Boyce Thompson, who was then in Petrograd in charge of th e American Red Cross Mission there. 4 Lamont journeyed to London and met with Thompson, w ho had left Petrograd on December 5, traveled via Bergen, Norway, and arrive d in London on December 10. The most important achievement of Thompson and Lamo nt in London was to convince the British War Cabinet — then decidedly a nti-Bolshevik — that the Bolshevik regime had come to stay, and that British policy should cease to be anti- Bolshevik, should accept the new realities, and sho uld support Lenin and Trotsky. Thompson and Lamont left London on December 18 and arrived in New York on December 25, 1917. They attempted the same process of conversion in the United States. A CONSULTATION WITH LLOYD GEORGE The secret British War Cabinet papers are now avail able and record the argument used by Thompson to sell the British government on a pro-Bolshevik policy. The prime minister of Great Britain was David Lloyd Geo rge. Lloyd George's private and political machinations rivaled those of a Tammany H all politician — yet in his lifetime and for decades after, biographers were un able, or unwilling, to come to grips with them. In 1970 Donald McCormick's The Mask of Merlin lifted the veil of secrecy. McCormick shows that by 1917 David Lloyd George had bogged \"too deeply in the mesh of international armaments intrigues to be a f ree agent\" and was beholden to Sir Basil Zaharoff, an international armaments dealer, whose considerable fortune was made by selling arms to both sides in several wars. 5 Zaharoff wielded enormous behind-the-scenes power and, according to McCormick , was consulted on war policies by the Allied leaders. On more than one oc casion, reports McCormick,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George, and Georges Clemencea u met in Zaharoff's Paris home. McCormick notes that \"Allied statesmen and le aders were obliged to consult him before planning any great attack.\" British inte lligence, according to McCormick, \"discovered documents which incriminated servants o f the Crown as secret agents of Sir Basil Zaharoff with the knowledge of Lloyd George. \" 6 In 1917 Zaharoff was linked to the Bolsheviks; he sought to divert munit ions away from anti-Bolsheviks and had already intervened in behalf of the Bolshev ik regime in both London and Paris. In late 1917, then — at the time Lamont and Thompso n arrived in London — Prime Minister Lloyd George was indebted to powerful inte rnational armaments interests that were allied to the Bolsheviks and providing as sistance to extend Bolshevik power in Russia. The British prime minister who met with William Thompson in 1917 was not then a free agent; Lord Milner was the power be hind the scenes and, as the epigraph to this chapter suggests, favorably inclin ed towards socialism and Karl Marx. The \"secret\" War Cabinet papers give the \"Prime Min ister's account of a conversation with Mr. Thompson, an American returned from Russia ,\" 7 and the report made by the prime minister to the War Cabinet after meeting wit h Thompson. 8 The cabinet paper reads as follows: The Prime Minister reported a conversation he had h ad with a Mr. Thompson — an American traveller and a man of considerable means — who had just returned from Russia, and who had given a somewhat different impr ession of affairs in that country from what was generally believed. The gist of his r emarks was to the effect that the Revolution had come to stay; that the Allies had no t shown themselves sufficiently sympathetic with the Revolution; and that MM. Trotz ki and Lenin were not in German pay, the latter being a fairly distinguished Professor. Mr. Thompson had added that he considered the Allies should conduct in Russia an active propaganda, carried out by some form of Allied Council composed o[ men especially selected [or the purpose; further, that on the whole, he conside red, having regard to the character of the de facto Russian Government, the several All ied Governments were not suitably represented in Petrograd. In Mr. Thompson' s opinion, it was necessary for the Allies to realise that the Russian army and people were out of the war, and that the Allies would have to choose between Russia as the f riendly or a hostile neutral. The question was discussed as to whether the Allies ought not to change their policy in regard to the de facto Russian Government, the B olsheviks being stated by Mr. Thompson to be and-German. In this connection Lord Robert Cecil drew attention to the conditions of the armistice between the German and Russian armies, which provided, inter alia, for trading between the two c ountries, and for the establishment of a Purchasing Commission in Odessa, the whole arr angement being obviously dictated by the Germans. Lord Robert Cecil expresse d the view that the Germans would endeavour to continue the armistice until the Russian army had melted away. Sir Edward Carson read a communication, signed by M . Trotzki, which had been sent to him by a British subject, the manager of the Rus sian branch of the Vauxhall Motor Company, who had just returned from Russia [Paper G .T. — 3040]. This report indicated that M. Trotzki's policy was, ostensibly at any rate, one of hostility to the organisation of civilised society rather than pro-G erman. On the other hand, it was"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"suggested that an assumed attitude of this kind was by no means inconsistent with Trotzki's being a German agent, whose object was to ruin Russia in order that Germany might do what she desired in that country. After hearing Lloyd George's report and supporting arguments, the War Cabinet decided to go along with Thompson and the Bolshevik s. Milner had a former British consul in Russia — Bruce Lockhart — ready and waiti ng in the wings. Lockhart was briefed and sent to Russia with instructions to wor k informally with the Soviets. The thoroughness of Thompson's work in London and t he pressure he was able to bring to bear on the situation are suggested by sub sequent reports coming into the hands of the War Cabinet, from authentic sources. T he reports provide a quite different view of Trotsky and the Bolsheviks from t hat presented by Thompson, and yet they were ignored by the cabinet. In April 1918 General Jan Smuts reported to the War Cabinet his talk with General Nieffel, the head of the French Military Mission who had just returned from Russia: Trotski (sic) . . . was a consummate scoundrel who may not be pro-German, but is thoroughly pro-Trotski and pro-revolutionary and ca nnot in any way be trusted. His influence is shown by the way he has come to domina te Lockhart, Robins and the French representative. He [Nieffel] counsels great prudence in dealing with Trotski, who he admits is the only really able man in Russia . 9 Several months later Thomas D. Thacher, Wall Street lawyer and another member of the American Red CrAss Mission to Russia, was in Lo ndon. On April 13, 1918, Thacher wrote to the American ambassador in London to the effect that he had received a request from H. P. Davison, a Morgan par tner, \"to confer with Lord Northcliffe\" concerning the situation in Russia and then to go on to Paris \"for other conferences.\" Lord Northcliffe was ill and Thacher left with yet another Morgan partner, Dwight W. Morrow, a memorandum to be submi tted to Northcliffe on his return to London. 10 This memorandum not only made explicit suggestions about Russian policy that supported Thompson's position b ut even stated that \"the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet government in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary army.\" The four main propos als in this Thacher report are: First of all . . . the Allies should discourage Jap anese intervention in Siberia. In the second place, the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet Government in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary a rmy. Thirdly, the Allied Governments should give their m oral support to the Russian people in their efforts to work out their own polit ical systems free from the domination of any foreign power .... Fourthly, until the time when open conflict shall r esult between the German Government and the Soviet Government of Russia ther e will be opportunity for peaceful commercial penetration by German agencies in Russia. So long as there is no open break, it will probably be impossible to entir ely prevent such commerce. Steps should, therefore, be taken to impede, so far as po ssible, the transport of grain and raw materials to Germany from Russia. 11 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" THOMPSON'S INTENTIONS AND OBJECTIVES Why would a prominent Wall Street financier, and di rector of the Federal Reserve Bank, want to organize and assist Bolshevik revolut ionaries? Why would not one but several Morgan partners working in concert want to encourage the formation of a Soviet \"volunteer revolutionary army\" — an army sup posedly dedicated to the overthrow of Wall Street, including Thompson, Thoma s Lamont, Dwight Morrow, the Morgan firm, and all their associates? Thompson at least was straightforward about his obj ectives in Russia: he wanted to keep Russia at war with Germany (yet he argued befo re the British War Cabinet that Russia was out of the war anyway) and to retain Rus sia as a market for postwar American enterprise. The December 1917 Thompson mem orandum to Lloyd George describes these aims. 12 The memorandum begins, \"The Russian situation is l ost and Russia lies entirely open to unopposed German explo itation .... \"and concludes, \"I believe that intelligent and courageous work will s till prevent Germany from occupying the field to itself and thus exploiting R ussia at the expense of the Allies.\" Consequently, it was German commercial and industri al exploitation of Russia that Thompson feared (this is also reflected in the Thac her memorandum) and that brought Thompson and his New York friends into an alliance with the Bolsheviks. Moreover, this interpretation is reflected in a quasi-jocular statement made by Raymond Robins, Thompson's deputy, to Bruce Lockhart, the British a gent: You will hear it said that I am the representative of Wall Street; that I am the servant of William B. Thompson to get Altai copper for him; that I have already got 500,000 acres of the best timber land in Russia for myself; that I have already copped off the Trans-Siberian Railway; that they have given me a m onopoly of the platinum of Russia; that this explains my working for the sovie t .... You will hear that talk. Now, I do not think it is true, Commissioner, but let us a ssume it is true. Let us assume that I am here to capture Russia for Wall Street and Ameri can business men. Let us assume that you are a British wolf and I am an American wo lf, and that when this war is over we are going to eat each other up for the Russian m arket; let us do so in perfectly frank, man fashion, but let us assume at the same t ime that we are fairly intelligent wolves, and that we know that if we do not hunt tog ether in this hour the German wolf will eat us both up, and then let us go to work. 13 With this in mind let us take a look at Thompson's personal motivations. Thompson was a financier, a promoter, and, although without previous interest in Russia, had personally financed the Red Cross Mission to Russia and used the mission as a vehicle for political maneuvering. From the total p icture we can deduce that Thompson's motives were primarily financial and com mercial. Specifically, Thompson was interested in the Russian market, and how this market could be influenced, diverted; and captured for postwar expl oitation by a Wall Street syndicate, or syndicates. Certainly Thompson viewed Germany as an enemy, but less a political enemy than an economic or a commercial enemy. Germa n industry and German banking were the real enemy. To outwit Germany, Tho mpson was willing to place seed money on any political power vehicle that woul d achieve his objective. In other words, Thompson was an American imperialist fightin g against German imperialism, and this struggle was shrewdly recognized and explo ited by Lenin and Trotsky."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The evidence supports this apolitical approach. In early August 1917, William Boyce Thompson lunched at the U.S. Petrograd embassy with Kerensky, Terestchenko, and the American ambassador Francis. Over lunch Thompso n showed his Russian guests a cable he had just sent to the New York office of J.P. Morgan requesting transfer of 425,000 rubles to cover a personal subscription to the new Russian Liberty Loan. Thompson also asked Morgan to \"inform my friends I recommend these bonds as the best war investment I know. Will be glad to look af ter their purchasing here without compensation\"; he then offered personally to take u p twenty percent of a New York syndicate buying five million rubles of the Russian loan. Not unexpectedly, Kerensky and Terestchenko indicated \"great gratification\" at support from Wall Street. And Ambassador Francis by cable promptly informed the S tate Department that the Red Cross commission was \"working harmoniously with me, \" and that it would have an \"excellent effect.\" 14 Other writers have recounted how Thompson attempte d to convince the Russian peasants to support Kerensky b y investing $1 million of his own money and U.S. government funds on the same order o f magnitude in propaganda activities. Subsequently, the Committee on Civic Ed ucation in Free Russia, headed by the revolutionary \"Grandmother\" Breshkovskaya, with David Soskice (Kerensky's private secretary) as executive, established newspa pers, news bureaus, printing plants, and speakers bureaus to promote the appeal — \"Fight the kaiser and save the revolution.\" It is noteworthy that the Thompson-fun ded Kerensky campaign had the same appeal — \"Keep Russia in the war\" — as had his financial support of the Bolsheviks. The common link between Thompson's supp ort of Kerensky and his support of Trotsky and Lenin was — \"continue the wa r against Germany\" and keep Germany out of Russia. In brief, behind and below the military, diplomatic , and political aspects of World War I, there was another battle raging, namely, a m aneuvering for postwar world economic power by international operators with sign ificant muscle and influence. Thompson was not a Bolshevik; he was not even pro-B olshevik. Neither was he pro- Kerensky. Nor was he even pro-American. The overriding motivation was the capturing of the postwar Russian market. This was a commercial, not an ideological, objective. Ideology could sway revolutionary operat ors like Kerensky, Trotsky, Lenin et al., but not financiers. The Lloyd George memorandum demonstrates Thompson's partiality for neither Kerensky nor the Bolsheviks: \"After the overthrow o f the last Kerensky government we materially aided the dissemination of the Bolshe vik literature, distributing it through agents and by aeroplanes to the Germany arm y.\" 15 This was written in mid- December 1917, only five weeks after the start of t he Bolshevik Revolution, and less than four months after Thompson expressed his suppo rt of Kerensky over lunch in the American embassy. THOMPSON RETURNS TO THE UNITED STATES Thompson then returned and toured the United States with a public plea for recognition of the Soviets. In a speech to the Rock y Mountain Club of New York in January 1918, Thompson called for assistance for th e emerging Bolshevik government and, appealing to an audience composed l argely of Westerners, evoked the spirit of the American pioneers:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"These men would not have hesitated very long about extending recognition and giving the fullest help and sympathy to the workingman's g overnment of Russia, because in 1819 and the years following we had out there bolsh eviki governments . . . and mighty good governments too.... 16 It strains the imagination to compare the pioneer e xperience of our Western frontier to the ruthless extermination of political opposition then under way in Russia. To Thompson, promoting this was no doubt looked upon a s akin to his promotion of mining stocks in days gone by. As for those in Thom pson's audience, we know not what they thought; however, no one raised a challen ge. The speaker was a respected director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a self-made millionaire (and that counts for much). And after all, had he not just re turned from Russia? But all was not rosy. Thompson's biographer Hermann Hagedorn has wr itten that Wall Street was \"stunned\" that his friends were \"shocked\" and \"said he had lost his head, had turned Bolshevist himself.\" 17 While Wall Street wondered whether he had indeed \"t urned Bolshevik,\" Thompson found sympathy among fellow directors on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Codirector W. L. Saunders, chairman of In gersoll-Rand Corporation and a director of the FRB, wrote President Wilson on Octo ber 17, 1918, stating that he was \"in sympathy with the Soviet form of Government\"; a t the same time he disclaimed any ulterior motive such as \"preparing now to get t he trade of the world after the war. 18 Most interesting of Thompson's fellow directors was George Foster Peabody, deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York an d a close friend of socialist Henry George. Peabody had made a fortune in railroa d manipulation, as Thompson had made his fortune in the manipulation of copper stocks. Peabody then became active in behalf of government ownership of railroa ds, and openly adopted socialization. 19 How did Peabody reconcile his private-enterprise s uccess with promotion of government ownership? According to his biographer Louis Ware, \"His reasoning told him that it was important for this f orm of transport to be operated as a public service rather than for the advantage of pri vate interests.\" This high-sounding do-good reasoning hardly rings true. It would be mo re accurate to argue that given the dominant political influence of Peabody and his fel low financiers in Washington, they could by government control of railroads more easil y avoid the rigors of competition. Through political influence they could manipulate t he police power of the state to achieve what they had been unable, or what was too costly, to achieve under private enterprise. In other words, the police power of the state was a means of maintaining a private monopoly. This was exactly as Frederick C. Howe had proposed. 20 The idea of a centrally planned socialist Russia must have appe aled to Peabody. Think of it — one gigantic state monopoly! And Thompson, his frie nd and fellow director, had the inside track with the boys running the operation! 21 THE UNOFFICIAL AMBASSADORS: ROBINS, LOCKHART, AND S ADOUL The Bolsheviks for their part correctly assessed a lack of sympathy among the Petrograd representatives of the three major Wester n powers: the United States, Britain and France. The United States was represent ed by Ambassador Francis,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"undisguisedly out of sympathy with the revolution. Great Britain was represented by Sir James Buchanan, who had strong ties to the tsar ist monarchy and was suspected of having helped along the Kerensky phase of the revol ution. France was represented by Ambassador Paleologue, overtly anti-Bolshevik. In e arly 1918 three additional personages made their appearance; they became de facto representatives of these Western countries and edged out the officially reco gnized representatives. Raymond Robins took over the Red Cross Mission from W. B. Thompson in early December 1917 but concerned himself more with econo mic and political matters than obtaining relief and assistance for poverty-stricke n Russia. On December 26, 1917, Robins cabled Morgan partner Henry Davison, tempora rily the director general of the American Red Cross: \"Please urge upon the President the necessity of our continued intercourse with the Bolshevik Government.\" 22 On January 23, 1918, Robins cabled Thompson, then in New York: Soviet Government stronger today than ever before. Its authority and power greatly consolidated by dissolution of Constituent Assembly .... Cannot urge too strongly importance of prompt recognition of Bolshevik autho rity .... Sisson approves this text and requests you to show this cable to Creel. Thach er and Wardwell concur. 23 Later in 1918, on his return to the United States, Robins submitted a report to Secretary of State Robert Lansing containing this o pening paragraph: \"American economic cooperation with Russia; Russia will welco me American assistance in economic reconstruction.\" 24 Robins' persistent efforts in behalf of the Bolshev ik cause gave him a certain prestige in the Bolshevik camp, and perhaps even some politi cal influence. The U.S. embassy in London claimed in November 1918 that \"Salkind ow e[s] his appointment, as Bolshevik Ambassador to Switzerland, to an American . . . no other than Mr. Raymond Robins.\" 25 About this time reports began filtering into Washi ngton that Robins was himself a Bolshevik; for example, the fo llowing from Copenhagen, dated December 3, 1918: Confidential. According to a statement made by Rade k to George de Patpourrie, late Austria Hungarian Consul General at Moscow, Colonel Robbins [ sic ], formerly thief of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia, is at present in Moscow negotiating with the Soviet Government and arts as the intermed iary between the Bolsheviki and their friends in the United States. The impression seems to be in some quarters that Colonel Robbins is himself a Bolsheviki while other s maintain that he is not but that his activities in Russia have been contrary to the interest of Associated Governments. 26 Materials in the files of the Soviet Bureau in New York, and seized by the Lusk Committee in 1919, confirm that both Robins and his wife were closely associated with Bolshevik activities in the United States and with the formation of the Soviet Bureau in New York. 27 The British government established unofficial relat ions with the Bolshevik regime by sending to Russia a young Russian-speaking agent, B ruce Lockhart. Lockhart was, in effect, Robins' opposite number; but unlike Robins, Lockhart had direct channels to"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"his Foreign Office. Lockhart was not selected by th e foreign secretary or the Foreign Office; both were dismayed at the appointment. Acco rding to Richard Ullman, Lockhart was \"selected for his mission by Milner an d Lloyd George themselves .... \"Maxim Litvinov, acting as unofficial Soviet repres entative in Great Britain, wrote for Lockhart a letter of introduction to Trotsky; in it he called the British agent \"a thoroughly honest man who understands our position and sympathizes with us. 28 We have already noted the pressures on Lloyd George to take a pro-Bolshevik position, especially those from William B. Thompson , and those indirectly from Sir Basil Zaharoff and Lord Milner. Milner was, as the epigraph to this chapter suggests, exceedingly prosocialist. Edward Crankshaw has succ inctly outlined Milner's duality. Some of the passages [in Milner] on industry and so ciety . . . are passages which any Socialist would be proud to have written. But they were not written by a Socialist. They were written by \"the man who made the Boer War .\" Some of the passages on Imperialism and the white man's burden might have b een written by a Tory diehard. They were written by the student of Karl Marx. 29 According to Lockhart, the socialist bank director Milner was a man who inspired in him \"the greatest affection and hero-worship.\" 30 Lockhart recounts how Milner personally sponsored his Russian appointment, pushe d it to cabinet level, and after his appointment talked \"almost daily\" with Lockhart. Wh ile opening the way for recognition of the Bolsheviks, Milner also promoted financial support for their opponents in South Russia and elsewhere, as did Mor gan in New York. This dual policy is consistent with the thesis that the modus operandi of the politicized internationalists — such as Milner and Thompson — w as to place state money on any revolutionary or counterrevolutionary horse that lo oked a possible winner. The internationalists, of course, claimed any subsequen t benefits. The clue is perhaps in Bruce Lockhart's observation that Milner was a man who \"believed in the highly organized state.\" 31 The French government appointed an even more openly Bolshevik sympathizer, Jacques Sadoul, an old friend of Trotsky. 32 In sum, the Allied governments neutralized their ow n diplomatic representatives in Petrograd and replaced them with unofficial agents more or less sympathetic to the Bolshevists. The reports of these unofficial ambassadors were in direct contrast to pleas for help addressed to the West from inside Russia. Maxim Gor ky protested the betrayal of revolutionary ideals by the Lenin-Trotsky group, wh ich had imposed the iron grip of a police state in Russia: We Russians make up a people that has never yet wor ked in freedom, that has never yet had a chance to develop all its powers and its talents. And when I think that the revolution gives us the possibility of free work, o f a many-sided joy in creating, my heart is tilled with great hope and joy, even in th ese cursed days that are besmirched with blood and alcohol."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"There is where begins the line of my decided and ir reconcilable separation [tom the insane actions of the People's Commissaries. I cons ider Maximalism in ideas very useful for the boundless Russian soul; its task is to develop in this soul great and bold needs, to call forth the so necessary fighting spir it and activity, to promote initiative in this indolent soul and to give it shape and life in general. But the practical Maximalism of the Anarcho-Communi sts and visionaries from the Smolny is ruinous for Russia and, above all, for th e Russian working class. The People's Commissaries handle Russia like material f or an experiment. The Russian people is for them what the Horse is for learned ba cteriologists who inoculate the horse with typhus so that the anti-typhus lymph may develop in its blood. Now the Commissaries are trying such a predestined-to-failu re experiment upon the Russian people without thinking that the tormented, half-st arved horse may die. The reformers from the Smolny do not worry about Ru ssia. They are cold-bloodedly sacrificing Russia in the name of their dream of th e worldwide and European revolution. And just as long as I can, I shall impr ess this upon the Russian proletarian: \"Thou art being led to destruction} Thou art being used as material for an inhuman experiment!\" 33 Also in contrast to the reports of the sympathetic unofficial ambassadors were the reports from the old-line diplomatic representative s. Typical o[ many messages [lowing into Washington in early 1918 — particularl y after Woodrow Wilson's expression of support for the Bolshevik governments — was the following cable [tom the U.S. legation in Bern, Switzerland: For Polk. President's message to Consul Moscow not understood here and people are asking why the President expresses support of Bolsh eviki, in view of rapine, murder and anarchy of these bands. 34 Continued support by the Wilson administration for the Bolsheviks led to the resignation of De Witt C. Poole, the capable Americ an charge d'affaires in Archangel (Russia): It is my duty to explain frankly to the department the perplexity into which I have been thrown by the statement of Russian policy adop ted by the Peace Conference, January 22, on the motion of the President. The ann ouncement very happily recognizes the revolution and confirms again that e ntire absence of sympathy for any form of counter revolution which has always been a key note of American policy in Russia, but it contains not one [word] of condemnat ion for the other enemy of the revolution — the Bolshevik Government. 35 Thus even in the early days of 1918 the betrayal of the libertarian revolution had been noted by such acute observers as Maxim Gorky and De Witt C. Poole. Poole's resignation shook the State Department, which reque sted the \"utmost reticence regarding your desire to resign\" and stated that \"i t will be necessary to replace you in a natural and normal manner in order to prevent gra ve and perhaps disastrous effect upon the morale of American troops in the Archangel district which might lead to loss of American lives.\" 36 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"So not only did Allied governments neutralize their own government representatives but the U.S. ignored pleas from within and without Russia to cease support of the Bolsheviks. Influential support of the Soviets came heavily from the New York financial area (little effective support emanated f rom domestic U.S. revolutionaries). In particular, it came from American International Corporation, a Morgan-controlled firm. EXPORTING THE REVOLUTION: JACOB H. RUBIN We are now in a position to compare two cases — not by any means the only such cases — in which American citizens Jacob Rubin and Robert Minor assisted in exporting the revolution to Europe and other parts of Russia. Jacob H. Rubin was a banker who, in his own words, \"helped to form the Soviet Government of Odessa.\" 37 Rubin was president, treasurer, and secretary of R ubin Brothers of 19 West 34 Street, New York City. In 19 17 he was associated with the Union Bank of Milwaukee and the Provident Loan Soci ety of New York. The trustees of the Provident Loan Society included persons ment ioned elsewhere as having connection with the Bolshevik Revolution: P. A. Roc kefeller, Mortimer L. Schiff, and James Speyer. By some process — only vaguely recounted in his boo k I Live to Tell 38 — Rubin was in Odessa in February 1920 and became the subject o f a message from Admiral McCully to the State Department (dated February 13, 1920, 861.00/6349). The message was to the effect that Jacob H. Rubin of Un ion Bank, Milwaukee, was in Odessa and desired to remain with the Bolshevists — \"Rubin does not wish to leave, has offered his services to Bolsheviks and apparent ly sympathizes with them.\" Rubin later found his way back to the U.S. and gave testi mony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 1921: I had been with the American Red Cross people at Od essa. I was there when the Red Army took possession of Odessa. At that time I was favorably inclined toward the Soviet Government, because I was a socialist and ha d been a member of that party for 20 years. I must admit that to a certain extent I h elped to form the Soviet Government of Odessa .... 39 While adding that he had been arrested as a spy by the Denikin government of South Russia, we learn little more about Rubin. We do, ho wever, know a great deal more about Robert Minor, who was caught in the act and r eleased by a mechanism reminiscent of Trotsky's release from a Halifax pri soner-of-war camp. EXPORTING THE REVOLUTION: ROBERT MINOR Bolshevik propaganda work in Germany, 40 financed and organized by William Boyce Thompson and Raymond Robins, was implemented in the field by American citizens, under the supervision of Trotsky's People's Commiss ariat for Foreign Affairs:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"One of Trotsky's earliest innovations in the Foreig n Office had been to institute a Press Bureau under Karl Radek and a Bureau of Inter national Revolutionary Propaganda under Boris Reinstein, among whose assis tants were John Reed and Albert Rhys Williams, and the full blast of these p ower-houses was turned against the Germany army. A German newspaper, Die Fackel (The Torch), was pri nted in editions of half a million a day and sent by special train to Central Army Committees in Minsk, Kiev, and other cities, which in turn distributed them to other points along the front. 41 Robert Minor was an operative in Reinstein's propag anda bureau. Minor's ancestors were prominent in early American history. General S am Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas, was related to Minor's mothe r, Routez Houston. Other relatives were Mildred Washington, aunt of George W ashington, and General John Minor, campaign manager for Thomas Jefferson. Minor 's father was a Virginia lawyer who migrated to Texas. After hard years with few cl ients, he became a San Antonio judge. Robert Minor was a talented cartoonist and a social ist. He left Texas to come East. Some of his contributions appeared in Masses, a pro-Bolshevik journal. In 1918 Minor was a cartoonist on the staff of the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Minor left New York in March 1918 to report the Bolshevik Revoluti on. While in Russia Minor joined Reinstein's Bureau of International Revoluti onary Propaganda (see diagram), along with Philip Price, correspondent of the Daily Herald and Manchester Guardian, and Jacques Sadoul, the unofficial French ambassado r and friend of Trotsky. Excellent data on the activities of Price, Minor, a nd Sadoul have survived in the form of a Scotland Yard (London) Secret Special Report, No. 4, entitled, \"The Case of Philip Price and Robert Minor,\" as well as in repor ts in the files of the State Department, Washington, D.C. 42 According to this Scotland Yard report, Philip Pri ce was in Moscow in mid-1917, before the Bolshevik Rev olution, and admitted, \"I am up to my neck in the Revolutionary movement.\" Betwe en the revolution and about the fall of 1918, Price worked with Robert Minor in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

In Germany their activities came to the noti ce of British, French, and American intelligence. On February 15, 1919, Lieutenant J.

Habas got to know Philip Price and Robert Minor and sugge sted that some pamphlets be printed for distribution amongst American troops. T he Scotland Yard report relates that Price and Minor had already written several pa mphlets for British and American troops, that Price had translated some of Wilhelm L iebknecht's works into English, and that both were working on additional propaganda tracts. Habas reported that Minor and Price said they had worked together in Si beria printing an English- language Bolshevik newspaper for distribution by ai r among American and British troops. 45 On June 8, 1919, Robert Minor was arrested in Paris by the French police and handed over to the American military authorities in Coblen z. Simultaneously, German Spartacists were arrested by the British military a uthorities in the Cologne area. Subsequently, the Spartacists were convicted on cha rges of conspiracy to cause mutiny and sedition among Allied forces. Price was arrested but, like Minor, speedily liberated. This hasty release was noted in the Stat e Department: Robert Minor has now been released, for reasons tha t are not quite clear, since the evidence against him appears to have been ample to secure conviction.

Minor, District Judge, San Antonio, Te xas 48 Polk telegraphed Judge Minor that neither the State Department nor the War Department had information on the detention of Robe rt Minor, and that the case was now before the military authorities at Coblenz. Lat e on June 13 the State Department received a \"strictly confidential urgent\" message f rom Paris reporting a statement made by the Office of Military Intelligence (Coblen z) in regard to the detention of Robert Minor: \"Minor was arrested in Paris by Frenc h authorities upon request of British Military Intelligence and immediately turne d over to American headquarters at Coblenz.\" 49 He was charged with writing and disseminating Bols hevik revolutionary literature, which had been printed in Dusseldorf, a mongst British and American troops in the areas they occupied. The military aut horities intended to examine the charges against Minor, and if substantiated, to try him by court-martial. If the charges were not substantiated, it was their intention to t urn Minor over to the British authorities, \"who originally requested that the Fre nch hand him over to them.\" 50 Judge Minor in Texas independently contacted Morris Shepp ard, U.S. senator from Texas, and Sheppard contacted Colonel House in Paris. On J une 17, 1919, Colonel House sent the following to Senator Sheppard: Both the American Ambassador and I are following Ro bert Minor's case. Am informed that he is detained by American Military a uthorities at Cologne on serious charges, the exact nature of which it is difficult to discover. Nevertheless, we will take every possible step to insure just consideration fo r him. 51 Both Senator Sheppard and Congressman Carlos Bee (1 4th District, Texas) made their interest known to the State Department. On Ju ne 27, 1919, Congressman Bee requested facilities so that Judge Minor could send his son $350 and a message. On July 3 Senator Sheppard wrote Frank Polk, stating t hat he was \"very much interested\" in the Robert Minor case, and wondering whether Sta te could ascertain its status, and whether Minor was properly under the jurisdiction o f the military authorities. Then on"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"July 8 the Paris embassy cabled Washington: \"Confid ential. Minor released by American authorities . . . returning to the United States on the first available boat.\" This sudden release intrigued the State Department, and on August 3 Secretary of State Lansing cabled Paris: \"Secret. Referring to p revious, am very anxious to obtain reasons for Minor's release by Military authorities .\" Originally, U.S. Army authorities had wanted the Br itish to try Robert Minor as \"they feared politics might intervene in the United State s to prevent a conviction if the prisoner was tried by American court-martial.\" Howe ver, the British government argued that Minor was a United States citizen, that the evidence showed he prepared propaganda against American troops in the first ins tance, and that, consequently — so the British Chief of Staff suggested — Minor should be tried before an American court. The British Chief of Staff did \"consider it of the greatest importance to obtain a conviction if possible.\" 52 Documents in the office of the Chief of Staff of th e Third Army relate to the internal details of Minor's release. 53 A telegram of June 23, 1919, from Major General Harbord, Chief of Staff of the Third Army (later ch airman of the Board of International General Electric, whose executive cen ter, coincidentally, was also at 120 Broadway), to the commanding general, Third Army, s tated that Commander in Chief John J. Pershing \"directs that you suspend action i n the case against Minor pending further orders.\" There is also a memorandum signed by Brigadier General W. A. Bethel in the office of the judge advocate, dated J une 28, 1919, marked \"Secret and Confidential,\" and entitled \"Robert Minor, Awaiting Trial by a Military Commission at Headquarters, 3rd Army.\" The memo reviews the le gal case against Minor. Among the points made by Bethel is that the British were obviously reluctant to handle the Minor case because \"they fear American opinion in t he event of trial by them of an American for a war offense in Europe,\" even though tire offense with which Minor is charged is as serious \"as a man can commit.\" This i s a significant statement; Minor, Price, and Sadoul were implementing a program desig ned by Federal Reserve Bank director Thompson, a fact confirmed by Thompson's o wn memorandum (see Appendix 3). Was not therefore Thompson (and Robins ), to some degree, subject to the same charges? After interviewing Siegfried, the witness against M inor, and reviewing the evidence, Bethel commented: I thoroughly believe Minor to be guilty, but if I w as sitting in court, I would not put guilty on the evidence now available — the testimon y of one man only and that man acting in the character of a detective and informer . Bethel goes on to state that it would be known with in a week or ten days whether substantial corroboration of Siegfried's testimony was available. If available, \"I think Minor should be tried,\" but \"if corroboration canno t be had, I think it would be better to dismiss the case.\" This statement by Bethel was relayed in a different form by General Harbord in a telegram of July 5 to General Malin Craig (Chief of Staff, Third Army, Coblenz):"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"With reference to the case against Minor, unless ot her witnesses than Siegfried have been located by this time C in C directs the case b e dropped and Minor liberated. Please acknowledge and state action. The reply from Craig to General Harbord (July 5) re cords that Minor was liberated in Paris and adds, \"This is in accordance with his own wishes and suits our purposes.\" Craig also adds that other witnesses had been obtained. This exchange of telegrams suggests a degree of has te in dropping the charges against Robert Minor, and haste suggests pressure. There wa s no significant attempt made to develop evidence. Intervention by Colonel House and General Pershing at the highest levels in Paris and the cablegram from Colonel Hous e to Senator Morris Sheppard give weight to American newspaper reports that both House and President Wilson were responsible for Minor's hasty release without trial. 54 Minor returned to the United States and, like Thomp son and Robins before him, toured the U.S. promoting the wonders of Bolshevik Russia. By way of summary, we find that Federal Reserve Ban k director William Thompson was active in promoting Bolshevik interests in seve ral ways — production of a pamphlet in Russian, financing Bolshevik operations , speeches, organizing (with Robins) a Bolshevik revolutionary mission to German y (and perhaps France), and with Morgan partner Lamont influencing Lloyd George and the British War Cabinet to effect a change in British policy. Further, Raym ond Robins was cited by the French government for organizing Russian Bolsheviks for th e German revolution. We know that Robins was undisguisedly working for Soviet in terests in Russia and the United States. Finally, we find that Robert Minor, one of the revolutionary propagandists used in Thompson's program, was released under circ umstances suggesting intervention from the highest levels of the U.S. go vernment. Obviously, this is but a fraction of a much wider p icture. These are hardly accidental or random events. They constitute a coherent, conti nuing pattern over several years. They suggest powerful influence at the summit level s of several governments.

There appear s to be no doubt about his connection with the Guarantee [ sic ] Trust Company, Though it is surprising that so large and influential an enterprise should have dealings with a Bolshevik concern. Scotland Yard Intelligence Report, London, 1919 1 Following on the initial successes of the revolutio n, the Soviets wasted little time in attempting through former U.S. residents to establi sh diplomatic relations with and propaganda outlets in the United States. In June 19 18 the American consul in Harbin cabled Washington: Albert R. Williams, bearer Department passport 52,9 13 May 15, 1917 proceeding United States to establish information bureau for S oviet Government for which he has written authority. Shall I visa? 2 Washington denied the visa and so Williams was unsu ccessful in his attempt to establish an information bureau here. Williams was followed by Alexander Nyberg (alias Santeri Nuorteva), a former Finnish immigran t to the United States in January 1912, who became the first operative Soviet represe ntative in the United States. Nyberg was an activtive propagandist. In fact, in 1 919 be was, according to J. Edgar Hoover (in a letter to the U.S. Committee on Foreig n Affairs), \"the forerunner of LCAK Martens anti with Gregory Weinstein the most a ctive individual of official Bolshevik propaganda in the United States.\" 3 Nyberg was none too successful as a diplomatic repr esentative or, ultimately, as a propagandist. The State Departmment files record an interview with Nyberg by the counselors' office, dated January 29, 1919. Nyberg was accompanied by H. Kellogg, described as \"an American citizen, graduate of Harv ard,\" and, more surprisingly, by a Mr. McFarland, an attorney for the Hearst organizat ion. The State Department records show that Nyberg made \"many misstatements in regard to the attitude to the Bolshevik Government\" and claimed that Peters, the Lett terrorist police chief in Petrograd, was merely a \"kind-hearted poet.\" Nyberg requested the department to cable Lenin, \"on the theory that it might be helpfu l in bringing about the conference proposed by the Allies at Paris.\" 4 The proposed message, a rambling appeal to Lenin to gain international acceptance appearing at the P aris Conference, was not sent. 5 A RAID ON THE SOVIET BUREAU IN NEW YORK Alexander Nyberg (Nuorteva) was then let go and rep laced by the Soviet Bureau, which was established in early 1919 in the World To wer Building, 110 West 40 Street, New York City. The bureau was headed by a German ci tizen, Ludwig C. A. K."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Martens, who is usually billed as the first ambassa dor of the Soviet Union in the United States, and who, up to that time, had been v ice president of Weinberg & Posner, an engineering firm located at 120 Broadway , New York City. Why the \"ambassador\" and his offices were located in New Yo rk rather than in Washington, D.C. was not explained; it does suggest that trade rather than diplomacy was its primary objective. In any event, the bureau promptl y issued a call lot Russian trade with the United States. Industry had collapsed and Russia direly needed machinery, railway goods, clothing, chemicals, drugs — indeed, everything utilized by a modern civilization. In exchange the Soviets offered gold and raw materials. The Soviet Bureau then proceeded to arrange contracts with Ame rican firms, ignoring the facts of the embargo and nonrecognition. At the same time it was providing financial support for the emerging Communist Party U.S.A. 6 On May 7, 1919, the State Department slapped down b usiness intervention in behalf of the bureau (noted elsewhere), 7 and repudiated Ludwig Martens, the Soviet Bureau, and the Bolshevik government o1 Russia. This offici al rebuttal did not deter the eager order-hunters in American industry. When the Soviet Bureau offices were raided on June 12, 1919, by representatives of the Lusk Commi ttee of the state of New York, files of letters to and from American businessmen, representing almost a thousand firms, were unearthed. The British Home Office Dire ctorate of Intelligence \"Special Report No. 5 (Secret),\" issued from Scotland Yard, London, July 14, 1919, and written by Basil H. Thompson, was based on this sei zed material; the report noted: . . . Every effort was made from the first by Marte ns and his associates to arouse the interest of American capitalists and there are grou nds tot believing that the Bureau has received financial support from some Russian export firms, as well as from the Guarantee [ sic ] Trust Company, although this firm has denied the al legation that it is financing Martens' organisation. 8 It was noted by Thompson that the monthly rent of t he Soviet Bureau offices was $300 and the office salaries came to about $4,000. Martens' funds to pay these bills came partly from Soviet couriers — such as John Ree d and Michael Gruzenberg — who brought diamonds from Russia for sale in the U. S., and partly from American business firms, including the Guaranty Trust Compan y of New York. The British reports summarized the files seized by the Lusk inv estigators from the bureau offices, and this summary is worth quoting in full: (1) There was an intrigue afoot about the time the President first went to France to get the Administration to use Nuorteva as an intermedia ry with the Russian Soviet Government, with a view to bring about its recognit ion by America. Endeavour was made to bring Colonel House into it, and there is a long and interesting letter to Frederick C. Howe, on whose support and sympathy Nu orteva appeared to rely. There are other records connecting Howe with Martens and Nuorteva. (2) There is a file of correspondence with Eugene D ebs. (3) A letter from Amos Pinchot to William Kent of t he U.S. Tariff Commission in an envelope addressed to Senator Lenroot, introduces E vans Clark \"now in the Bureau of the Russian Soviet Republic.\" \"He wants to talk to you about the recognition of Kolchak and the raising of the blockade, etc.\""},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"(4) A report to Felix Frankfurter, dated 27th May, 1919 speaks of the virulent campaign vilifying the Russian Government. (5) There is considerable correspondence between a Colonel and Mrs. Raymond Robbins [sic] and Nuorteva, both in 1918 and 1919. In July 1918 M rs. Robbins asked Nuorteva for articles for \"Life and Labour,\" the or gan of the National Women's Trade League. In February and March, 1919, Nuorteva tried , through Robbins, to get invited to give evidence before the Overman Committee. He a lso wanted Robbins to denounce the Sisson documents. (6) In a letter from the Jansen Cloth Products Comp any, New York, to Nuorteva, dated March 30th, 1918, E. Werner Knudsen says that he understands that Nuorteva intends to make arrangements for the export of food -stuffs through Finland and he offers his services. We have a file on Knudsen, who passed information to and from Germany by way of Mexico with regard to British shi pping. 9 Ludwig Martens, the intelligence report continued, was in touch with all the leaders of \"the left\" in the United States, including John Ree d, Ludwig Lore, and Harry J. Boland, the Irish rebel. A vigorous campaign agains t Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia had been organized by Martens. The report concludes : [Martens'] organization is a powerful weapon for su pporting the Bolshevik cause in the United States and... he is in close touch with the promoters of political unrest throughout the whole American continent. The Scotland Yard list of personnel employed by the Soviet Bureau in New York coincides quite closely with a similar list in the Lusk Committee files in Albany, New York, which are today open for public inspection. 10 There is one essential difference between the two lists: the British analysis include d the name \"Julius Hammer\" whereas Hammer was omitted from the Lusk Committee report. 11 The British report characterizes Julius Hammer as follows: In Julius Hammer, Martens has a real Bolshevik and ardent Left Wing adherent, who came not long ago from Russia. He was one of the or ganizers of the Left Wing movement in New York, and speaks at meetings on the same platform with such Left Wing leaders as Reed, Hourwich, Lore and Larkin. There also exists other evidence of Hammer's work i n behalf of the Soviets. A letter from National City Bank, New York, to the U.S. Trea sury Department stated that documents received by the bank from Martens were \"w itnessed by a Dr. Julius Hammer for the Acting Director of the Financial Dep artment\" of the Soviet Bureau. 12 The Hammer family has had close ties with Russia an d the Soviet regime from 1917 to the present. Armand Hammer is today able to acqu ire the most lucrative of Soviet contracts. Jacob, grandfather of Armand Hammer, and Julius were born in Russia. Armand, Harry, and Victor, sons of Julius, were bor n in the United States and are U.S. citizens. Victor was a well-known artist; his son — also named Armand — and granddaughter are Soviet citizens and reside in the Soviet Union. Armand Hammer is chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and ha s a son, Julian, who is director of advertising and publications for Occidental Petr oleum."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Julius Hammer was a prominent member and financier of the left wing of the Socialist Party. At its 1919 convention Hammer served with Be rtram D. Wolfe and Benjamin Gitlow on the steering committee that gave birth to the Communist Party of the U.S. In 1920 Julius Hammer was given a sentence of three -and-one-half to fifteen years in Sing Sing for criminal abortion. Lenin suggested — with justification — that Julius was \"imprisoned on the charge of practicing illegal abortions but in fact because of communism.\" 13 Other U.S. Communist Party members were sentenced to jail for sedition or deported to the Soviet Union. Soviet re presentatives in the United States made strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to have Jul ius and his fellow party members released. Another prominent member of the Soviet Bureau was t he assistant secretary, Kenneth Durant, a former aide to Colonel House. In 1920 Dur ant was identified as a Soviet courier. Appendix 3 reproduces a letter to Kenneth Durant that was seized by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1920 and that describes Du rant's close relationship with the Soviet hierarchy. It was inserted into the record o f a House committee's hearings in 1920, with the following commentary: MR. NEWTON: It is a mailer of interest to this comm ittee to know what was the nature of that letter, and I have a copy of the let ter that I Want inserted in the record in connection with the witness' testimony. MR. Mason: That letter has never been shown to the witness. He said that he never saw the lette r, and had asked to see it, and that the department had refused to show it to him. We wo uld not put any witness on the stand and ask him to testify to a letter without se eing it. MR. NEWTON: The witness testified that he has such a letter, and he testified that they found it in his coat in the trunk, I believe. That letter was addressed to a Mr. Kenneth Durant, and that letter had within it anoth er envelope which was likewise sealed. They were opened by the Government official s and a photostatic copy made. The letter, I may say, is signed by a man by the na me of \"Bill.\" It refers specifically to soviet moneys on deposit in Christiania, Norway, a portion of which they waist turned over here to officials of the soviet government in this country. 14 Kenneth Durant, who acted as Soviet courier in the transfer of funds, was treasurer lot the Soviet Bureau and press secretary and publisher of Soviet Russia, the official organ of the Soviet Bureau. Durant came from a well -to-do Philadelphia family. He spent most of his life in the service of the Soviet s, first in charge of publicity work at the Soviet Bureau then from 1923 to 1944 as manager of the Soviet Tass bureau in the United States. J. Edgar Hoover described Durant as \"at all times . . . particularly active in the interests of Martens and of the Sovie t government.\" 15 Felix Frankfurter — later justice of the Supreme Co urts — was also prominent in the Soviet Bureau files. A letter from Frankfurter to S oviet agent Nuorteva is reproduced in Appendix 3 and suggests that Frankfurter had som e influence with the bureau. In brief, the Soviet Bureau could not have been est ablished without influential assistance from within the United States. Part of t his assistance came from specific influential appointments to the Soviet Bureau staff and part came from business firms outside the bureau, firms that were reluctant to ma ke their support publicly known."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" CORPORATE ALLIES FOR THE SOVIET BUREAU On February 1, 1920, the front page of the New York Times carried a boxed notation stating that Martens was to be arrested and deporte d to Russia. At the same time Martens was being sought as a witness to appear bef ore a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigating Soviet ac tivity in the United States. After lying low for a few days Martens appeared before th e committee, claimed diplomatic privilege, and refused to give up \"official\" papers in his possession. Then after a flurry of publicity, Martens \"relented,\" handed over his p apers, and admitted to revolutionary activities in the United States with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the capitalist system. Martens boasted to the news media and Congress that big corporations, the Chicago packers among them, were aiding the Soviets: Affording to Martens, instead of farthing on propag anda among the radicals and the proletariat he has addressed most of his efforts to winning to the side of Russia the big business and manufacturing interests of this country, the packers, the United States Steel Corporation, the Standard Oil Company and oth er big concerns engaged in international trade. Martens asserted that most of the big business houses of the country were aiding him in his effort to get the go vernment to recognize the Soviet government. 16 This claim was expanded by A. A. Heller, commercial attache at the Soviet Bureau: \"Among the people helping us to get recognition fro m the State Department are the big Chit ago packers, Armour, Swift, Nelson Morris and Cudahy ..... Among the other firms are . . . the American Steel Export Company, the Lehigh Machine Company, the Adrian Knitting Company, the International Harveste r Company, the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company, the Aluminum Company o f America, the American Car and Foundry Export Company, M.C.D. Borden & Son s.\" 17 The New York Times followed up these claims and reported comments of t he firms named. \"I have never heard of this man [Martens] be fore in my life,\" declared G. F. Swift, Jr., in charge of the export department of S wift & Co. \"Most certainly I am sure that we have never had any dealings with him of any kind.\" 18 The Times added that O. H. Swift, the only other member of the firm that co uld be contacted, \"also denied any knowledge whatever of Martens or his bureau in New York.\" The Swift statement was evasive at best. When the Lusk Committee invest igators seized the Soviet Bureau files, they found correspondence between the bureau and almost all the firms named by Martens and Heller. The \"list of firms that offe red to do business with Russian Soviet Bureau,\" compiled from these files, included an entry (page 16), \"Swift and Company, Union Stock Yards, Chicago, Ill.\" In other words, Swift had been in communication with Martens despite its denial to th e New York Times. The New York Times contacted United States Steel and reported, \"Judge Elbert H. Gary said last night that there was no foundation f or the statement with the Soviet representative here had had any dealings with the U nited States Steel Corporation.\" This is technically correct. The United States Stee l Corporation is not listed in the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Soviet files, but the list does contain (page 16) an affiliate, \"United States Stee l Products Co., 30 Church Street, New York City.\" The Lusk Committee list records the following about other firms mentioned by Martens and Heller: Standard Oil — not listed.

Then on Saturday, June 21, 1919, Santeri Nuorteva (Alexander Nyberg) confirmed in a press interview the role of International Harvest er: Q: [by New York T imes reporter]: What is your business? A: Purchasing director tot Soviet Russia. Q: What did you do to accomplish this? A: Addressed myself to American manufacturers. Q: Name them. A: International Harvester Corporation is among the m.

We have files in the office disclosing them. 19 In brief, the claims by Heller and Martens relating to their widespread contacts among certain U.S. firms 20 were substantiated by the office files of the Sovi et Bureau. On the other hand, for their own good reasons, these firms appeared unwilling to confirm their activities. EUROPEAN BANKERS AID THE BOLSHEVIKS"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"In addition to Guaranty Trust and the private banke r Boissevain in New York, some European bankers gave direct help to maintain and e xpand the Bolshevik hold on Russia. A 1918 State Department report from our Sto ckholm embassy details these financial transfers. The department commended its a uthor, stating that his \"re ports on conditions in Russia, the spread of Bolshevism in E urope, and financial questions . . . have proved most helpful to the Department. Departm ent is much gratified by your capable handling of the legation's business.\" 21 According to this report, one of these \"Bolshevik bankers\" acting in behalf of the emergin g Soviet regime was Dmitri Rubenstein, of the former Russo-French bank in Petr ograd. Rubenstein, an associate of the notorious Grigori Rasputin, had been jailed in prerevolutionary Petrograd in connection with the sale of the Second Russian Life Insurance Company. The American manager and director of the Second Russian Life Insurance Company was John MacGregor Grant, who was located at 120 Broadw ay, New York City. Grant was also the New York representative of Putiloff's Banque Russo-Asiatique. In August 1918 Grant was (for unknown reasons) listed on the Military Intelligence Bureau \"suspect list.\" 22 This may have occurred because Olof Aschberg in ea rly 1918 reported opening a foreign credit in Petrograd \"wit h the John MacGregor Grant Co., export concern, which it [Aschberg] finances in Swe den and which is financed in America by the Guarantee [sic] Trust Co.\" 23 After the revolution Dmitri Rubenstein moved to Stockholm and became financial agent for t he Bolsheviks. The State Department noted that while Rubenstein was \"not a B olshevik, he has been unscrupulous in moneT' making, and it is suspected that he may be making the contemplated visit to America in Bolshevik interest and for Bolshevik pay. 24 Another Stockholm \"Bolshevik banker\" was Abram Giva tovzo, brother-in-law of Trotsky and Lev Kamenev. The State Department repor t asserted that while Givatovzo pretended to be \"very anti-Bolshevik,\" he had in fact received \"large sums\" of moneT' from the Bolsheviks by courier for financ ing revolutionary operations. Givatovzo was part of a syndicate that included Den isoff of the former Siberian bank, Kamenka of the Asoff Don Bank, and Davidoff of the Bank of Foreign Commerce. This syndicate sold the assets of the former Siberi an Bank to the British government. Yet another tsarist private banker, Gregory Lessine , handled Bolshevik business through the firm of Dardel and Hagborg. Other \"Bols hevik bankers\" named in the report are stirrer and Jakob Berline, who previousl y controlled, through his wife, the Petrograd Nelkens Bank. Isidor Kon was used by thes e bankers as an agent. The most interesting of these Europe-based bankers operating in behalf of the Bolsheviks was Gregory Benenson, formerly chairman in Petrograd of the Russian and English Bank — a bank which included on its boa rd of directors Lord Balfour (secretary of state for foreign affairs in England) and Sir I. M. H. Amory, as well as S. H. Cripps and H. Guedalla. Benenson traveled to Pet rograd after the revolution, then on to Stockholm. He came. said one State Department official, \"bringing to my knowledge ten million rubles with him as he offered them to me at a high price for the use of our Embassy Archangel.\" Benenson had an arra ngement with the Bolsheviks to exchange sixty million rubles for £1.5 million ster ling. In January 1919 the private bankers in Copenhagen t hat were associated with Bolshevik institutions became alarmed by rumors tha t the Danish political police had marked the Soviet legation and those persons in con tact with the Bolsheviks for"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"expulsion from Denmark. These bankers and the legat ion hastily attempted to remove their funds from Danish banks — in particular, seve n million rubles from the Revisionsbanken. 25 Also, confidential documents were hidden in the of fices of the Martin Larsen Insurance Company. Consequently, we can identify a pattern of assistan ce by capitalist bankers for the Soviet Union. Some of these were American bankers, some were tsarist bankers who were exiled and living in Europe, and some were Eur opean bankers. Their common objective was profit, not ideology. The questionable aspects of the work of these \"Bols hevik bankers,\" as they were called, arises from the framework of contemporary e vents in Russia. In 1919 French, British, and American troops were fighting Soviet t roops in the Archangel region. In one clash in April 1919, for example, American casu alties were one officer, .five men killed, and nine missing. 26 Indeed, at one point in 1919 General Tasker H. Bli ss, the U.S. commander in Archangel, affirmed the British s tatement that \"Allied troops in the Murmansk and Archangel districts were in danger of extermination unless they were speedily reinforced.\" 27 Reinforcements were then on the way under the command of Brigadier General W. P. Richardson. In brief, while Guaranty Trust and first-rank Ameri can firms were assisting the formation of the Soviet Bureau in New York, America n troops were in conflict with Soviet troops in North Russia. Moreover, these conf licts were daily reported in the New York Times, presumably read by these bankers and businessmen. F urther, as we shall see in chapter ten, the financial circles tha t were supporting the Soviet Bureau in New York also formed in New York the \"United Americ ans\" — a virulently anti- Communist organization predicting bloody revolution , mass starvation, and panic in the streets of New York.

Thompson, who was in Petrograd from July until November last, has made a personal contribution of $1,000,000 to the B olsheviki for the purpose of spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria ... . Washington Post, February 2, 1918 While collecting material for this book a single lo cation and address in the Wall Street area came to the fore — 120 Broadway, New York City . Conceivably, this book could have been written incorporating only persons, firms, and organizations located at 120 Broadway in the year 1917. Although this res earch method would have been forced and unnatural, it would have excluded only a relatively small segment of the story. The original building at 120 Broadway was destroyed by fire before World War I. Subsequently the site was sold to the Equitable Off ice Building Corporation, organized by General T. Coleman du Pont, president of du Pont de Nemours Powder Company. 1 A new building was completed in 1915 and the Equit able Life Assurance Company moved back to its old site. 2 In passing we should note an interesting interlock in Equitable history. In 1916 the cashier of the Berlin Equitable Life office was William Schacht, the father of Hjalmar Horace G reeley Schacht — later to become Hitler's banker, and financial genie. Willia m Schacht was an American citizen, worked thirty years for Equitable in Germa ny, and owned a Berlin house known as \"Equitable Villa.\" Before joining Hitler, young Hjalmar Schacht served as a member of the Workers and Soldiers Council (a sovie t) of Zehlendoff; this he left in 1918 to join the board of the Nationalbank fur Deut schland. His codirector at DONAT was Emil Wittenberg, who, with Max May of Guaranty Trust Company of New York, was a director of the first Soviet international ba nk, Ruskombank. In any event, the building at 120 Broadway was in 1 917 known as the Equitable Life Building. A large building, although by no means th e largest office building in New York City, it occupies a one-block area at Broadway and Pine, and has thirty-four floors. The Bankers Club was located on the thirty- fourth floor. The tenant list in 1917 in effect reflected American involvement in th e Bolshevik Revolution and its aftermath. For example, the headquarters of the No. 2 District of the Federal Reserve System — the New York area — by far the most import ant of the Federal Reserve districts, was located at 120 Broadway. The offices of several individual directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, most impo rtant, the American International Corporation were also at 120 Broadway . By way of contrast, Ludwig Martens, appointed by the Soviets as the first Bols hevik \"ambassador\" to the United States and head of the Soviet Bureau, was in 1917 t he vice president of Weinberg & Posner — and also had offices at 120 Broadway.* "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Is this concentration an accident? Does the geograp hical contiguity have any significance? Before attempting to suggest an answe r, we have to switch our frame of reference and abandon the left-right spectrum of po litical analysis. With an almost unanimous lack of perception the aca demic world has described and analyzed international political relations in the c ontext of an unrelenting conflict between capitalism and communism, and rigid adheren ce to this Marxian formula has distorted modern history. Tossed out from time to t ime are odd remarks to the effect that the polarity is indeed spurious, but these are quickly dispatched to limbo. For example, Carroll Quigley, professor of internationa l relations at Georgetown University, made the following comment on the House of Morgan: More than fifty years ago the Morgan firm decided t o infiltrate the Left-wing political movements in the United States. This was relatively easy to do, since these groups were starved for funds and eager for a voice to rea ch the people. Wall Street supplied both. The purpose was not to destroy, dominate or t ake over... 3 Professor Quigley's comment, apparently based on co nfidential documentation, has all the ingredients of an historical bombshell if it ca n be supported. We suggest that the Morgan firm infiltrated not only the domestic left, as noted by Quigley, but also the foreign left — that is, the Bolshevik movement and the Third International. Even further, through friends in the U.S. State Departme nt, Morgan and allied financial interests, particularly the Rockefeller family, hav e exerted a powerful influence on U.S.-Russian relations from World War I to the pres ent. The evidence presented in this chapter will suggest that two of the operation al vehicles for infiltrating or influencing foreign revolutionary movements were lo cated at 120 Broadway: the first, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, heavily laced with Morgan appointees; the second, the Morgan-controlled American Internationa l Corporation. Further, there was an important interlock between the Federal Rese rve Bank of New York and the American International Corporation — C. A. Stone, t he president of American International, was also a director of the Federal R eserve Bank. The tentative hypothesis then is that this unusual concentration at a single address was a reflection of purposeful actions by specific firm s and persons and that these actions and events cannot be analyzed within the usual spec trum of left-right political antagonism. AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION The American International Corporation (AIC) was or ganized in New York on November 22, 1915, by the J.P. Morgan interests, wi th major participation by Stillman's National City Bank and the Rockefeller i nterests. The general office of AIC was at 120 Broadway. The company's charter authoriz ed it to engage in any kind of business, except banking and public utilities, in a ny country in the world. The stated purpose of the corporation was to develop domestic and foreign enterprises, to extend American activities abroad, and to promote the inte rests of American and foreign bankers, business and engineering."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Frank A. Vanderlip has described in his memoirs how American International was formed and the excitement created on Wall Street ov er its business potential. 4 The original idea was generated by a discussion between Stone & Webster — the international railroad contractors who \"were convin ced there was not much more railroad building to be done in the United States\" — and Jim Perkins and Frank A. Vanderlip of National City Bank (NCB). 5 The original capital authorization was $50 million and the board of directors represented the leading lights of the New York financial world. Vanderlip records that he wrote as follows to NCB president Stillman, enthusing over the enormous potential for American International Corporation: James A. Farrell and Albert Wiggin have been invite d [to be on the board] but had to consult their committees before accepting. I also h ave in mind asking Henry Walters and Myron T. Herrick. Mr. Herrick is objected to by Mr. Rockefeller quite strongly but Mr. Stone wants him and I feel strongly that he would be particularly desirable in France. The whole thing has gone along with a smoot hness that has been gratifying and the reception of it has been marked by an enthu siasm which has been surprising to me even though I was so strongly convinced we we re on the right track. I saw James J. Hill today, for example. He said at first that he could not possibly think of extending his responsibilities, but after I had finished telling him what we expected to do, he said he would be glad to go on the board, would take a large amount of stock and particularly wanted a substantial interest in t he City Bank and commissioned me to buy him the stock at the market. I talked with Ogden Armour about the matter today f or the first time. He sat in perfect silence while I went through the story, and, withou t asking a single question, he said he would go on the board and wanted $500,000 stock. Mr. Coffin [of General Electric] is another man who is retiring from everything, but has 'become so enthusiastic over this that he was w illing to go on the board, and offers the most active cooperation. I felt very good over getting Sabin. The Guaranty T rust is altogether the most active competitor we have in the field and it is of great value to get them into the fold in this way. They have been particularly enthusiastic at Ku hn, Loeb's. They want to take up to $2,500,000. There was really quite a little comp etition to see who should get on the board, but as I had happened to talk with Kahn and had invited him first, it was decided he should go on. He is perhaps the most ent husiastic of any one. They want half a million stock for Sir Ernest Castle** to whom they have cabled the plan and they have back from him approval of it. I explained the whole matter to the Board [of the C ity Bank] Tuesday and got nothing but favorable comments. 6 Everybody coveted the AIC stock. Joe Grace (of W. R . Grace & Co.) wanted $600,000 in addition to his interest in National Ci ty Bank. Ambrose Monell wanted $500,000. George Baker wanted $250,000.

Less than two years after its formation AIC was operating on a substantial scale in Australia, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, China, Japan, In dia, Ceylon, Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Cuba, Mexico, and other countries in Central America. American International owned several subsidiary com panies outright, had substantial interests in yet other companies, and operated stil l other firms in the United States and abroad. The Allied Machinery Company of America was founded in February 1916 and the entire share capital taken up by American I nternational Corporation. The vice president of American International Corporation was Frederick Holbrook, an engineer and formerly head of the Holbrook Cabot & Rollins C orporation. In January 1917 the Grace Russian Company was formed, the joint owners being W. R. Grace & Co. and the San Galli Trading Company of Petrograd. America n International Corporation had a substantial investment in the Grace Russian Compa ny and through Holbrook an interlocking directorship. AIC also invested in United Fruit Company, which wa s involved in Central American revolutions in the 1920s. The American Internationa l Shipbuilding Corporation was wholly owned by AIC and signed substantial contract s for war vessels with the Emergency Fleet Corporation: one contract called fo r fifty vessels, followed by another contract for forty vessels, followed by yet another contract for sixty cargo vessels. American International Shipbuilding was th e largest single recipient of contracts awarded by the U.S. government Emergency Fleet Corporation. Another company operated by AIC was G. Amsinck & Co., Inc. of New York; control of the company was acquired in November 1917. Amsinck was the source of financing for German espionage in the United States (see page 66) . In November 1917 the American International Corporation formed and wholl y owned the Symington Forge Corporation, a major government contractor for shel l forgings. Consequently, American International Corporation had significant interest in war contracts within the United States and overseas. It had, in a word, a vested interest in the continuance of World War I. The directors of American International and some of their associations were (in 1917): J.

The interlock of the twenty-two directors of Americ an International Corporation with other institutions is significant. The National Cit y Bank had no fewer than ten directors on the board of AIC; Stillman of NCB was at that time an intermediary between the Rockefeller and Morgan interests, and b oth the Morgan and the Rockefeller interests were represented directly on AIC. Kuhn, Loeb and the du Ponts each had one director. Stone & Webster had three di rectors.

THE INFLUENCE OF AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL ON THE REVOLUTION Having identified the directors of AIC we now have to identify their revolutionary influence. As the Bolshevik Revolution took hold in central Ru ssia, Secretary of State Robert Lansing requested the views of American Internation al Corporation on the policy to be pursued towards the Soviet regime. On January 16 , 1918 — barely two months after the takeover in Petrograd and Moscow, and bef ore a fraction of Russia had come under Bolshevik control — William Franklin Sands, e xecutive secretary of American International Corporation, submitted the requested memorandum on the Russian political situation to Secretary Lansing. Sands cov ering letter, headed 120 Broadway, began: To the Honourable  January 16, 1918 Secretary of State Washington D.C. Sir I have the honor to enclose herewith the memorandum which you requested me to make for you on my view of the political situation in Russia.

And as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York, Sands had just contributed $1 million to the Bolsheviks — such end orsement of the Bolsheviks by banking interests is at least consistent. Moreover, William Sands of American International w as a man with truly uncommon connections and influence in the State Department. Sands' career had alternated between the State Depa rtment and Wall Street, In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century he held vari ous U.S. diplomatic posts. In 1910 he left the department to join the banking firm of James Speyer to negotiate an Ecuadorian loan, and for the next two years represe nted the Central Aguirre Sugar Company in Puerto Rico. In 1916 he was in Russia on \"Red Cross work\" — actually a two-man \"Special Mission\" with Basil Miles — and re turned to join the American International Corporation in New York. 10 In early 1918 Sands became the known and intended r ecipient of certain Russian \"secret treaties.\" If the State Department files ar e to be believed, it appears that Sands was also a courier, and that he had some prior acce ss to official documents — prior,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"that is, to U.S. government officials. On January 1 4, 1918, just two days before Sands wrote his memo on policy towards the Bolsheviks, Se cretary Lansing caused the following cable to be sent in Green Cipher to the A merican legation in Stockholm: \"Important official papers for Sands to bring here were left at Legation. Have you forwarded them? Lansing.\" The reply of January 16 f rom Morris in Stockholm reads: \"Your 460 January 14, 5 pm. Said documents forwarde d Department in pouch number 34 on December 28th.\" To these documents is attache d another memo, signed \"BM\" (Basil Miles, an associate of Sands): \"Mr. Phillips . They failed to give Sands 1st installment of secret treaties wh. [which] he broug ht from Petrograd to Stockholm.\" 11 Putting aside the question why a private citizen wo uld be carrying Russian secret treaties and the question of the content of such se cret treaties (probably an early version of the so-called Sisson Documents), we can at least deduce that the AIC executive secretary traveled from Petrograd to Stoc kholm in late 1917 and must indeed have been a privileged and influential citiz en to have access to secret treaties. 12 A few months later, on July 1, 1918, Sands wrote to Treasury Secretary McAdoo suggesting a commission for \"economic assistance to Russia.\" He urged that since it would be difficult for a government commission to \" provide the machinery\" for any such assistance, \"it seems, therefore, necessary to call in the financial, commercial and manufacturing interest of the United States to provide such machinery under the control of the Chief Commissioner or whatever offic ial is selected by the President for this purpose.\" 13 In other words, Sands obviously intended that any commercial exploitation of Bolshevik Russia was going to inclu de 120 Broadway. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK The certification of incorporation of the Federal R eserve Bank of New York was filed May 18, 1914. It provided for three Class A directo rs representing member banks in the district, three Class B directors representing commerce, agriculture, and industry, and three Class C directors representing the Federa l Reserve Board. The original directors were elected in 1914; they proceeded to g enerate an energetic program. In the first year of organization the Federal Reserve Bank of New York held no fewer than 50 meetings. From our viewpoint what is interesting is the assoc iation between, on the one hand, the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank (in the N ew York district) and of American International Corporation, and, on the other, the e merging Soviet Russia. In 1917 the three Class A directors were Franklin D . Locke, William Woodward, and Robert H. Treman. William Woodward was a director o f American International Corporation (120 Broadway) and of the Rockefeller-c ontrolled Hanover National Bank. Neither Locke nor Treman enters our story. Th e three Class B directors in 1917 were William Boyce Thompson, Henry R. Towne, and Le slie R. Palmer. We have already noted William B. Thompson's substantial cas h contribution to the Bolshevik cause. Henry R. Towne was chairman of the board of directors of the Morris Plan of New York, located at 120 Broadway; his seat was lat er taken by Charles A. Stone of American International Corporation (120 Broadway) a nd of Stone & Webster (120 Broadway). Leslie R. Palmer does not come into our story. The three Class C"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"directors were Pierre Jay, W. L. Saunders, and Geor ge Foster Peabody. Nothing is known about Pierre Jay, except that his office was at 120 Broadway and he appeared to be significant only as the owner of Brearley Sch ool, Ltd. William Lawrence Saunders was also a director of American Internatio nal Corporation; he openly avowed, as we have seen, pro-Bolshevik sympathies, disclosing them in a letter to President Woodrow Wilson (see page 15). George Fost er Peabody was an active socialist (see page 99-100). In brief, of the nine directors of the Federal Rese rve Bank of New York, four were physically located at 120 Broadway and two were the n connected with American International Corporation. And at least four member s of AIC's board were at one time or another directors of the FRB of New York. We cou ld term all of this significant, but regard it not necessarily as a dominant interes t. AMERICAN-RUSSIAN INDUSTRIAL SYNDICATE INC. William Franklin Sands' proposal for an economic co mmission to Russia was not adopted. Instead, a private vehicle was put togethe r to exploit Russian markets and the earlier support given the Bolsheviks. A group of in dustrialists from 120 Broadway formed the American-Russian Industrial Syndicate In c. to develop and foster these opportunities. The financial backing for the new fi rm came from the Guggenheim Brothers, 120 Broadway, previously associated with William Boyce Thompson (Guggenheim controlled American Smelting and Refini ng, and the Kennecott and Utah copper companies); from Harry F. Sinclair, pre sident of Sinclair Gulf Corp., also 120 Broadway; and from James G. White of J. G. Whit e Engineering Corp. of 43 Exchange Place — the address of the American-Russia n Industrial Syndicate. In the fall of 1919 the U.S. embassy in London cabl ed Washington about Messrs. Lubovitch and Rossi \"representing American-Russian Industrial Syndicate Incorporated What is the reputation and the attitud e of the Department toward the syndicate and the individuals?\" 14 To this cable State Department officer Basil Miles, a former associate of Sands, replied: . . . Gentlemen mentioned together with their corpo ration are of good standing being backed financially by the White, Sinclair and Gugge nheim interests for the purpose of opening up business relations with Russia. 15 So we may conclude that Wall Street interests had q uite definite ideas of the manner in which the new Russian market was to be exploited . The assistance and advice proffered in behalf of the Bolsheviks by interested parties in Washington and elsewhere were not to remain unrewarded.

The crucial issue that presents itself here is not Reed's known pro-Bolshevik tenor and activities, but how Reed who had the entire confide nce of Lenin (\"Here is a book I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages,\" commented Lenin in Ten Days ), who was a member of the Third International, and who possessed a Military Revolutionary Committee pa ss (No. 955, issued November 16, 1917) giving him entry into the Smolny Institut e (the revolutionary headquarters) at any time as the representative of the \"American Socialist press,\" was also — despite these things — a puppet under the \"control\" of the Morgan financial interests through the American International Corporation. Doc umentary evidence exists for this seeming conflict (see below and Appendix 3). Let's fill in the background. Articles for the Metropolitan and the Masses gave John Reed a wide audience for reporting the Mexican and the Russian Bolshevik revolutions. Reed's biographer Granville Hicks has suggested, in John Reed, that \"he was . . . the spokesman of the Bolsheviks in the Un ited States.\" On the other hand, Reed's financial support from 1913 to 1918 came hea vily from the Metropolitan — owned by Harry Payne Whitney, a director of the Guaranty Trust, an institution cited in every chapter of this book — and also' from the New York private banker and merchant Eugene Boissevain, who channeled funds to Reed both directly and through the pro-Bolshevik Masses. In other words, John Reed's financial support came from two supposedly competing elements in the political spectrum. These funds were for writing and may be classified as: payments from Metropolitan from 1913 onwards for articles; payments from Masses from 1913 onwards, which income at least in part originated with Eugene Boissevain. A third category should be mentioned: Reed received some minor and apparently unconnected paym ents from Red Cross commissioner Raymond Robins in Petrograd. Presumabl y he also received smaller sums for articles written for other journals, and b ook royalties; but no evidence has been found giving the amounts of such payments. JOHN REED AND THE METROPOLITAN MAGAZINE The Metropolitan supported contemporary establishment causes includi ng, for example, war preparedness. The magazine was owned b y Harry Payne Whitney (1872-1930), who founded the Navy League and was pa rtner in the J.P. Morgan firm. In the late 1890s Whitney became a director of Amer ican Smelting and Refining and of Guggenheim Exploration. Upon his father's death in 1908, he became a director of numerous other companies, including Guaranty Trust Company. Reed began writing for Whitney's Metropolitan in July 1913 and contributed a half-dozen articles o n the Mexican revolutions: \"With Villa in Mexico,\" \"The C auses Behind/Mexico's"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Revolution,\" \"If We Enter Mexico,\" \"With Villa on t he March,\" etc. Reed's sympathies were with revolutionist Pancho Villa. Yo u will recall the link (see page 65) between Guaranty Trust and Villa's ammunition suppl ies. In any event, Metropolitan was Reed's main source of income. In the words of biographer Granville Hicks, \"Money meant primarily work for the Metropolitan and incidentally articles and stories for other paying magazines.\" But employment by Metropolitan did not inhibit Reed from writing articles critical of the Morgan and Rockefeller interests. One such piece, \"At the Throat of the Republic\" (Masses, July 1916), traced the relationship between munitions in dustries, the national security- preparedness lobby, the interlocking directorates o f the Morgan-Rockefeller interest, \"and showed that they dominated both the preparedne ss societies and the newly formed American International Corporation, organize d for the exploitation of backward countries.\" 17 In 1915 John Reed was arrested in Russia by tsarist authorities, and the Metropolitan intervened with the State Department in Reed's beha lf. On June 21, 1915, H. J. Whigham wrote Secretary of State Robert Lansing inf orming him that John Reed and Boardman Robinson (also arrested and also a contrib utor to the Masses) were in Russia \"with commission from the Metropolitan magazine to write articles and to make illustrations in the Eastern field of the War. \" Whigham pointed out that neither had \"any desire or authority from us to interfere w ith the operations of any belligerent powers that be.\" Whigham's letter continues: If Mr. Reed carried letters of introduction from Bu charest to people in Galicia of an anti-Russian frame of mind I am sure that it was do ne innocently with the simple intention of meeting as many people as possible ... . Whigham points out to Secretary Lansing that John R eed was known at the White House and had given \"some assistance\" to the admini stration on Mexican affairs; he concludes: \"We have the highest regard for Reed's great qualities as a writer and thinker and we are very anxious as regards his safe ty.\" 18 The Whigham letter is not, let it be noted, from an establishment journal in s upport of a Bolshevik writer; it is from an establishment journal in support of a Bolsh evik writer for the Masses and similar revolutionary sheets, a writer who was also the author of trenchant attacks (\"The Involuntary Ethics of Big Business: A Fable f or Pessimists,\" for example) on the same Morgan interests that owned Metropolitan. The evidence of finance by the private banker Boiss evain is incontrovertible. On February 23, 1918, the American legation at Christi ania, Norway, sent a cable to Washington in behalf of John Reed for delivery to S ocialist Party leader Morris Hillquit. The cable stated in part: \"Tell Boissevai n must draw on him but carefully.\" A cryptic note by Basil Miles in the State Department files, dated April 3, 1918, states, \"If Reed is coming home he might as well have money . I understand alternatives are ejection by Norway or polite return. If this so lat ter seems preferable.\" This protective note is followed by a cable dated April 1, 1918, an d again from the American legation at Christiania: \"John Reed urgently request Eugene Boissevain, 29 Williams Street, New York, telegraph care legation $300.00.\" 19 This cable was relayed to Eugene Boissevain by the State Department on April 3, 1918 ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Reed apparently received his funds and arrived safe ly back in the United States. The next document in the State Department files is a le tter to William Franklin Sands from John Reed, dated June 4, 1918, and written from Cro tonon-Hudson, New York. In the letter Reed asserts that he has drawn up a memorand um for the State Department, and appeals to Sands to use his influence to get releas e of the boxes of papers brought back from Russia. Reed concludes, \"Forgive me for b othering you, but I don't know where else to turn, and I can't afford another trip to Washington.\" Subsequently, Frank Polk, acting secretary of state, received a letter from Sands regarding the release of John Reed's papers. Sands' letter, dated June 5, 19 18, from 120 Broadway, is here reproduced in full; it makes quite explicit stateme nts about control of Reed: 120 BROADWAY NEW YORK June fifth, 1918 My dear Mr. Polk: I take the liberty of enclosing to you an appeal fr om John (\"Jack\") Reed to help him, if possible, to secure the release of the papers wh ich he brought into the country with him from Russia. I had a conversation with Mr. Reed when he first ar rived, in which he sketched certain attempts by the Soviet Government to initiate const ructive development, and expressed the desire to place whatever observations he had made or information he had obtained through his connection with Leon Trotz ky, at the disposal of our Government. I suggested that he write a memorandum on this subject for you, and promised to telephone to Washington to ask you to g ive him an interview for this purpose. He brought home with him a mass of papers which were taken from him for examination, and on this subject also he wished to speak to someone in authority, in order to voluntarily offer an>, information they mi ght contain to the Government, and to ask for the release of those which he needed for his newspaper and magazine work. I do not believe that Mr. Reed is either a \"Bolshev ik\" or a \"dangerous anarchist,\" as I have heard him described. He is a sensational journ alist, without doubt, but that is all. He is not trying to embarrass our Government, and f or this reason refused the \"protection\" which I understand was offered to him by Trotzky, when he returned to New York to face the indictment against him in the \"Masses\" trial. He is liked by the Petrograd Bolsheviki, however, and, therefore, anyt hing which our police may do which looks like \"persecution\" will be resented in Petrograd, which I believe to be undesirable because unnecessary. He can be handled and controlled much better by other means than through the police. I have not seen the memorandum he gave to Mr. Bulli tt — I wanted him to let me see it first and perhaps to edit it, but he had not the opportunity to do so. I hope that you will not consider me to be intrusiv e in this matter or meddling with matters which do not concern me. I believe it to be wise not to offend the Bolshevik leaders unless and until it may become necessary to do so — if it should become necessary — and it is unwise to look on every one as a suspicious o r even dangerous character, who has had friendly relations with the Bolsheviki in Russia. I think it"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"better policy to attempt to use such people for our own purposes in developing our policy toward Russia, if it is possible to do so. The lecture which Reed was prevented by the police from delivering in Philadelphia (he l ost his head, came into conflict with the police and was arrested) is the only lecture on Russia which I would have paid to hear, if I had not already seen his notes on the su bject. It covered a subject which we might quite possibly find to be a point of contact with the Soviet Government, from which to begin constructive work! Can we not use him, instead of embittering him and making him an enemy? He is not well balanced, but he is, unless I am very much mis taken, susceptible to discreet guidance and might be quite useful. Sincerely yours, William Franklin Sands The Honourable Frank Lyon Polk Counselor for the Department of State Washington, D.C. WFS:AO Enclosure 20 The significance of this document is the hard revel ation of direct intervention by an officer (executive secretary) of American Internati onal Corporation in behalf of a known Bolshevik. Ponder a few of Sands' statements about Reed: \"He can be handled and controlled much better by other means than thro ugh the police\"; and, \"Can we not use him, instead of embittering him and making him an enemy? . . . he is, unless I am very much mistaken, susceptible to discreet guidanc e and might be quite useful.\" Quite obviously, the American International Corpora tion viewed John Reed as an agent or a potential agent who could be, and probab ly had already been, brought under its control. The fact that Sands was in a pos ition to request editing a memorandum by Reed (for Bullitt) suggests some degr ee of control had already been established. Then note Sands' potentially hostile attitude towar ds — and barely veiled intent to provoke — the Bolsheviks: \"I believe it to be wise not to offend the Bolshevik leaders unless and until it may become necessary to do so — if it should become necessary . . .\" (italics added). This is an extraordinary letter in behalf of a Sovi et agent from a private U.S. citizen whose counsel the State Department had sought, and continued to seek. A later memorandum, March 19, 1920, in the State fi les reported the arrest of John Reed by the Finnish authorities at Abo, and Reed's possession of English, American and German passports. Reed, traveling under the ali as of Casgormlich, carried diamonds, a large sum of money, Soviet propaganda l iterature, and film. On April 21, 1920, the American legation at Helsingfors cabled t he State Department:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Am forwarding by the next pouch certified copies of letters from Emma Goldman, Trotsky, Lenin and Sirola found in Reed's possessio n. Foreign Office has promised to furnish complete record of the Court proceedings. Once again Sands intervened: \"I knew Mr. Reed perso nally.\" 21 And, as in 1915, Metropolitan magazine also came to Reed's aid. H. J. Whigham wro te on April 15, 1920, to Bainbridge Colby in the State Department: \"Have heard John Reed in danger of being executed in Finland. Hope the State Dept. can take immediate steps to see that he gets proper trial. Urgently request prompt action.\" 22 This was in addition to an April 13, 1920 telegram from Harry Hopkins, who was destined for fame under President Roosevelt: Understand State Dept. has information Jack Reed ar rested Finland, will be executed. As one of his friends and yours and on his wife's b ehalf urge you take prompt action prevent execution and secure release. Feel sure can rely your immediate and effective intervention. 23 John Reed was subsequently released by the Finnish authorities. This paradoxical account on intervention in behalf of a Soviet agent can have several explanations. One hypothesis that fits other eviden ce concerning Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution is that John Reed was in effec t an agent of the Morgan interests — perhaps only half aware of his double r ole — that his anticapitalist writing maintained the valuable myth that all capitalists are in perpetual warfare with all socialist revolutionaries. Carroll Quigley, as we h ave already noted, reported that the Morgan interests financially supported domestic rev olutionary organizations and anticapitalist writings. 24 And we have presented in this chapter irrefutable documentary evidence that the Morgan interests were also effecting control of a Soviet agent, interceding on his behalf and, more i mportant, generally intervening in behalf of Soviet interests with the U.S. government . These activities centered at a single address: 120 Broadway, New York City. Footnotes: 1 By a quirk the papers of incorporation for the Equi table Office Building were drawn up by Dwight W. Morrow, later a Morgan partner, but then a member of the law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett.

The latter work is notable only for a minor point on page 102: the willingness to blame a particularly unsavory imperialistic adventure on Adolf Stahl, a New York banker, while pointing oust quite unnecessarily that Stahl was of \"German-Jewish orig in.\" In August 1918 he published an article, \"Salvaging Russia,\" in Asia, to explain support of the Bolshevik regime. 11 All the above in U.S. State Dept.

William H. Coombs, reporting to the U.S. embassy in London, June 1, 1920 (U.S. State Dept. Decimal File, 861.51/752). (\"Eestibank\" was an Estonian bank) In 1918 the Soviets faced a bewildering array of in ternal and external problems. They occupied a mere fraction of Russia. To subdue the r emainder, they needed foreign arms, imported food, outside financial support, dip lomatic recognition, and — above all — foreign trade. To gain diplomatic recognition and foreign trade, the Soviets first needed representation abroad, and representation in turn required financing through gold or foreign currencies. As we have already seen , the first step was to establish the Soviet Bureau in New York under Ludwig Martens. At the same time, efforts were made to transfer funds to the United States and Eur ope for purchases of needed goods. Then influence was exerted in the U.S. to gain reco gnition or to obtain the export licenses needed to ship goods to Russia. New York bankers and lawyers provided significant — in some cases, critical — assistance for each of these tasks. When Professor George V. Lomonossoff, the Russian technical expert in the Soviet Bureau, need ed to transfer funds from the chief Soviet agent in Scandinavia, a prominant Wall Stree t attorney came to his assistance — using official State Department channels and the acting secretary of state as an intermediary. When gold had to be transferred to th e United States, it was American International Corporation, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and Gu aranty Trust that requested the facilities and used their influence in Washington t o smooth the way. And when it came to recognition, we find American firms pleadin g .with Congress and with the public to endorse the Soviet regime. Lest the reader should deduce — too hastily — from these assertions that Wall Street was indeed tinged with Red, or that Red flags were flying in the street (see frontispiece), we also in a later chapter present e vidence that the J.P. Morgan firm financed Admiral Kolchak in Siberia. Aleksandr Kolc hak was fighting the Bolsheviks, to install his own brand of authoritarian rule. The firm also contributed to the anti- Communist United Americans organization. WALL STREET COMES TO THE AID OF PROFESSOR LOMONOSSO FF The case of Professor Lomonossoff is a detailed cas e history of Wall Street assistance to the early Soviet regime. In late 1918 George V. Lomonossoff, member of the Soviet Bureau in New York and later first Soviet co mmissar of railroads, found"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"himself stranded in the United States without funds . At this time Bolshevik funds were denied entry into the United States; indeed, t here was no official recognition of the regime at all. Lomonossoff was the subject of a letter of October 24, 1918, from the U.S. Department of Justice to the Department of State. 1 The letter referred to Lomonossoff's Bolshevik attributes and pro-Bolshevi k speeches. The investigator concluded, \"Prof. Lomonossoff is not a Bolshevik al though his speeches constitute unequivocal support for the Bolshevik cause.\" Yet L omonossoff was able to pull strings at the highest levels of the administration to have $25,000 transferred from the Soviet Union through a Soviet espionage agent in Sc andinavia (who was himself later to become confidential assistant to Reeve Schley, a vice president of Chase Bank). All this with the assistance of a member of a prominent Wall Street firm of attorneys! 2 The evidence is presented in detail because the det ails themselves point up the close relationship between certain interests that up to n ow have been thought of as bitter enemies. The first indication of Lornonossoff's pro blem is a letter dated January 7, 1919, from Thomas L. Chadbourne of Chadbourne, Babb itt 8e Wall of 14 Wall Street (same Address as William Boyce Thompson's) to Frank Polk, acting secretary of state. Note the friendly salutation and casual reference t o Michael Gruzenberg, alias Alexander Gumberg, chief Soviet agent in Scandinavi a and later Lomonossoff's assistant: Dear Frank: You were kind enough to say that if I c ould inform you of the status of the $25,000 item of personal funds belonging to Mr. & Mrs. Lomonossoff you would set in motion the machinery necessary to obtain it here for them. I have communicated with Mr. Lomonossoff with respe ct to it, and he tells me that Mr. Michael Gruzenberg, who went to Russia for Mr. Lomonossoff prior to the difficulties between Ambassador Bakhmeteff and Mr. Lomonossoff, transmitted the information to him respecting this money through th ree Russians who recently arrived from Sweden, and Mr. Lomonossoff believes that the money is held at the Russian embassy in Stockholm, Milmskilnad Gaten 37. If inqu iry from the State Department should develop this to be not the place where the m oney is on deposit, then the Russian embassy in Stockholm can give the exact add ress of Mr. Gruzenberg, who can give the proper information respecting it. Mr. Lomonossoff does not receive letters from Mr. Gruzenberg, although he is informe d that they have been written: nor have any of his letters to Mr. Gruzenberg been deli vered, he is also informed. For this reason it is impossible to be more definite than I have been, but I hope something can be done to relieve his and his wife's embarrassment for lack of funds, and it only needs a little help to secure this money which belo ngs to them to aid them on this side of the water. Thanking you in advance for anything you can do, I beg to remain, as ever, Yours sincerely, Thomas L. Chadbourne. In 1919, at the time this letter was written, Chadb ourne was a dollar-a-year man in Washington, counsel and director of the U.S. War Tr ade Board, and a director of the U.S. Russian Bureau Inc., an official front company of the U.S. government.

In 1916 he became chairm an of the Democratic Finance Committee and later a director of Wright Aeronautic al and o[ Mack Trucks. The reason Lomonossoff was not receiving letters fr om Gruzenberg is that they were, in all probability, being intercepted by one of sev eral governments taking a keen interest in the latter's activities. On January 11, 1919, Frank Polk cabled the American legation in Stockholm: Department is in receipt of information that $25,00 0, personal funds of ....

Morris Apparently Frank Polk then wrote to Chadbourne (the letter is not included in the source) and indicated that State could find neither Lomonossoff nor Michael Gruzenberg. Chadbourne replied on January 21, 1919: Dear Frank: Many thanks for your letter of January 17. I understand that there are two Russian legations in Sweden, one being the soviet a nd the other the Kerensky, and I presume your inquiry was directed to the soviet leg ation as that was the address I gave you in my letter, namely, Milmskilnad Gaten 37, Sto ckholm. Michael Gruzenberg's address is, Holmenkollen Sanit arium, Christiania, Norway, and I think the soviet legation could find out all abou t the funds through Gruzenberg if they will communicate with him. Thanking you for taking this trouble and assuring y ou of my deep appreciation, I remain, Sincerely yours, Thomas L.

Frank Polk then cabled the American legation at Chr istiania, Norway, with the address of Michael Gruzenberg. It is not known whet her Polk knew he was passing on the address of an espionage agent, but his message was as follows: To American Legation, Christiania. January 25, 1919 .

Gruzenberg claims that t o-day he cabled attorney for Lomonossoff in New York, Morris Hillquitt [sic], that he, Gruzenberg, is in possession of the money, and before forwarding it i s awaiting further instructions from the United States, requesting in the cablegram that Lomonossoff be furnished with living expenses for himself and family by Hill quitt pending the receipt of the money. 3 As Minister Morris was traveling to Stockholm on th e same train as Gruzenberg, the latter stated that he would advise further with Mor ris in reference to this subject.

Lomonossoff can be reache d in care of Mr. Thomas L.

But why would a prestigious establishment law firm be so intimately interested in the health and welfare of a Bolshevik emissary? Perhaps a contempo rary State Department report gives the clue: Martens, the Bolshevik representative, and Professo r Lomonossoff are banking on the fact that Bullitt and his party will make a favorab le report to the Mission and the President regarding conditions in Soviet Russia and that on the basis of this report the Government of the United States will favor dealing with the Soviet Government as, proposed by Martens. March 29, 1919. 4 THE STAGE IS SET FOR COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF RUS SIA It was commercial exploitation of Russia that excit ed Wall Street, and Wall Street had lost no time in preparing its program. On May 1, 19 18 — an auspicious date for Red revolutionaries — the American League to Aid and Co operate with Russia was established, and its program approved in a conferen ce held in the Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. The officers and executi ve committee of the league represented some superficially dissimilar factions. Its president was Dr. Frank J. Goodnow, president of Johns Hopkins University. Vic e presidents were the ever active William Boyce Thompson, Oscar S. Straus, Jam es Duncan, and Frederick C. Howe, who wrote Confessions of a Monopolist, the rule book by which monopolists could control society. The Treasurer was George P. Whalen, vice president of Vacuum Oil Company. Congress was represented by Sen ator William Edgar Borah and Senator John Sharp Williams, of the Senate Fore ign Relations Committee; Senator William N. Calder; and Senator Robert L. Ow en, chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. House members were Henry R. Cooper and Henry D."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Flood, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Commit tee. American business was represented by Henry Ford; Charles A. Coffin, chair man of the board of General Electric Company; and M. A. Oudin, then foreign man ager of General Electric. George P. Whalen represented Vacuum Oil Company, an d Daniel Willard was president of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. The mor e overtly revolutionary element was represented by Mrs. Raymond Robins, whose name was later found to be prominent in the Soviet Bureau files and in the Lus k Committee hearings; Henry L. Slobodin, described as a \"prominent patriotic socia list\"; and Lincoln Steffens, a domestic Communist of note. In other words, this was a hybrid executive committ ee; it represented domestic revolutionary elements, the Congress of the United States, and financial interests prominently involved with Russian affairs. Approved by the executive committee was a program t hat emphasized the establishment of an official Russian division in th e U.S. government \"directed by strong men.\" This division would enlist the aid of universities, scientific organizations, and other institutions to study the \"Russian questi on,\" would coordinate and unite organizations within the United States \"for the saf eguarding of Russia,\" would arrange for a \"special intelligence committee for t he investigation of the Russian matter,\" and, generally, would itself study and inv estigate what was deemed to be the \"Russian question.\" The executive committee then pa ssed a resolution supporting President Woodrow Wilson's message to the Soviet co ngress in Moscow and the league affirmed its own support for the new Soviet Russia. A few weeks later, on May 20, 1918, Frank J. Goodno w and Herbert A. Carpenter, representing the league, called upon Assistant Secr etary of State William Phillips and impressed upon him the necessity for establishing a n \"official Russian Division of the Government to coordinate all Russian matters. They asked me [wrote Phillips] whether they should take this matter up with the Pr esident.\" 5 Phillips reported this directly to the secretary of state and on the next day wrote Charles R. Crane in New York City requesting his vi ews on the American League to Aid and Cooperate with Russia. Phillips besought Cr ane, \"I really want your advice as to how we should treat the league .... We do not wa nt to stir up trouble by refusing to cooperate with them. On the other hand it is a quee r committee and I don't quite 'get it.'\" 6 In early June there arrived at the State Department a letter from William Franklin Sands of American International Corporation for Sec retary of State Robert Lansing. Sands proposed that the United States appoint an ad ministrator in Russia rather than a commission, and opined that \"the suggestion of an a llied military force in Russia at the present moment seems to me to be a very dangero us one.\" 7 Sands emphasized the possibility of trade with Russia and that this poss ibility could be advanced \"by a well chosen administrator enjoying the full confidence o f the government\"; he indicated that \"Mr. Hoover\" might fit the role. 8 The letter was passed to Phillips by Basil Miles, a former associate of Sands, with the expression, \" I think the Secretary would find it worthwhile to look through.\""},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"In early June the War Trade Board, subordinate to t he State Department, passed a resolution, and a committee of the board comprising Thomas L. Chadbourne (Professor Lomonossoff's contact), Clarence M. Wool ley, and John Foster Dulles submitted a memorandum to the Department of State, urging consideration of ways and means \"to bring about closer and more friendly commercial relations between the United States and Russia.\" The board recommended a mission to Russia and reopened the question whether this should result from an inv itation from the Soviet government. Then on June 10, M. A. Oudin, foreign manager of Ge neral Electric Company, expressed his views on Russia and clearly favored a \"constructive plan for the economic assistance\" of Russia. 9 In August 1918 Cyrus M. McCormick of International Harvester wrote to Basil Miles at the State Department and praised the President's program for Russia, which McCormick tho ught would be \"a golden opportunity.\" 10 Consequently, we find in mid-1918 a concerted effor t by a segment of American business — obviously prepared to open up trade — to take advantage of its own preferred position regarding the Soviets. GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIAN BUSINESS In 1918 such assistance to the embryonic Bolshevik regime was justified on the grounds of defeating Germany and inhibiting German exploitation of Russia. This was the argument used by W. B. Thompson and Raymond Robins in sending Bolshevik revolutionaries and propaganda teams into Germany in 1918. The argument was also employed by Thompson in 1917 when conferring with Prime Minister Lloyd George about obtaining British suppo rt for the emerging Bolshevik regime. In June 1918 Ambassador Francis and his sta ff returned from Russia and urged President Wilson \"to recognize and aid the So viet government of Russia.\" 11 These reports made by the embassy staff to the Stat e Department were leaked to the press and widely printed. Above all, it was claimed that delay in recognizing the Soviet Union would aid Germany \"and helps the Germa n plan to foster reaction and counter-revolution.\" 12 Exaggerated statistics were cited to support the p roposal — for example, that the Soviet government represented nin ety percent of the Russian people \"and the other ten percent is the former propertied and governing class .... Naturally they are displeased.\" 13 A former American official was quoted as saying, \" If we do nothing — that is, if we just let things drift — we help weaken the Russian Soviet Government. And that plays Germany's game.\" 14 So, it was recommended that \"a commission armed with credit and good business advi ce could help much.\" Meanwhile, inside Russia the economic situation had become critical and the inevitability of an embrace with capitalism dawned on the Communist Party and its planners. Lenin crystallized this awareness before the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party: Without the assistance of capital it will be imposs ible for us to retain proletarian power in an incredibly ruined country in which the peasantry, also ruined, constitutes the overwhelming majority — and, of course, for thi s assistance capital will squeeze"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"hundreds per cent out of us. This is what we have t o understand. Hence, either this type of economic relations or nothing .... 15 Then Leon Trotsky was quoted as saying, \"What we ne ed here is an organizer like Bernard M. Baruch.\" 16 Soviet awareness of its impending economic doom sug gests that American and German business was attracted by the opportunity of exploiting the Russian market for needed goods; the Germans, in fact, made an ear ly start in 1918. The first deals made by the Soviet Bureau in New York indicate that earlier American financial and moral support of the Bolsheviks was paying off in t he form of contracts. The largest order in 1919-20 was contracted to Morr is & Co., Chicago meatpackers, for fifty million pounds of food products, valued a t approximately $10 million. The Morris meatpacking family was related to the Swift family. Helen Swift, later connected with the Abraham Lincoln Center \"Unity,\" was married to Edward Morris (of the meatpacking firm) and was also the brother of Harold H. Swift, a \"major\" in the 1917 Thompson Red Cross Mission to Russia. Table: CONTRACTS MADE IN 1919 BY THE SOVIET BUREAU WITH U.S. FIRMS Ludwig Martens was formerly vice president of Weinb erg & Posner, located at 120 Broadway, New York City, and this firm was given a $3 million order. SOVIET GOLD AND AMERICAN BANKS Gold was the only practical means by which the Sovi et Union could pay for its foreign purchases and the international bankers wer e quite willing to facilitate Soviet gold shipments. Russian gold exports, primarily imp erial gold coins, started in early 1920, to Norway and Sweden. These were transshipped to Holland and Germany for other world destinations, including the United Stat es. In August 1920, a shipment of Russian gold coins wa s received at the Den Norske Handelsbank in Norway as a guarantee for payment of 3,000 tons of coal by Niels Juul and Company in the U.S. in behalf of the Sovie t government. These coins were transferred to the Norges Bank for safekeeping. The coins were examined and weighed, were found to have been minted before the outbreak of war in 1914, and were therefore genuine imperial Russian coins. 17 Shortly after this initial episode, the Robert Doll ar Company of San Francisco received gold bars, valued at thirty-nine million S wedish kroner, in its Stockholm account; the gold \"bore the stamp of the old Czar G overnment of Russia.\" The Dollar Company agent in Stockholm applied to the American Express Company for facilities to ship the gold to the United States. American Exp ress refused to handle the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"shipment. Robert Dollar, it should be noted, was a director of American International Company; thus AIC was linked to the first attempt a t shipping gold direct to America. 18 Simultaneously it was reported that three ships had left Reval on the Baltic Sea with Soviet gold destined for the U.S. The S.S. Gauthod loaded 216 boxes of gold under the supervision of Professor Lomonossoff — now retu rning to the United States. The S.S. Carl Line loaded 216 boxes of gold under the supervision of t hree Russian agents. The S.S. Ruheleva was laden with 108 boxes of gold. Each box containe d three poods of gold valued at sixty thousand gold rubles each. This was followed by a shipment on the S.S. Wheeling Mold. Kuhn, Loeb & Company, apparently acting in behalf o f Guaranty Trust Company, then inquired of the State Department concerning th e official attitude towards the receipt of Soviet gold. In a report the department expressed concern because if acceptance was refused, then \"the gold [would] prob ably come back on the hands of the War Department, causing thereby direct governme ntal responsibility and increased embarrassment.\" 19 The report, written by Merle Smith in conference w ith Kelley and Gilbert, argues that unless the possesso r has definite knowledge as to imperfect title, it would be impossible to refuse a cceptance. It was anticipated that the U.S. would be requested to melt the gold in the ass ay office, and it was thereupon decided to telegraph Kuhn, Loeb & Company that no r estrictions would be imposed on the importation of Soviet gold into the United S tates. The gold arrived at the New York Assay Office and w as deposited not by Kuhn, Loeb & Company — but by Guaranty Trust Company of New Yo rk City. Guaranty Trust then inquired of the Federal Reserve Board, which i n turn inquired of the U.S. Treasury, concerning acceptance and payment. The su perintendent of the New York Assay Office informed the Treasury that the approxi mately seven million dollars of gold had no identifying marks and that \"the bars de posited have already been melted in United States mint bars.\" The Treasury suggested that the Federal Reserve Board determine whether Guaranty Trust Company had acted \"for its own account, or the account of another in presenting the gold,\" and par ticularly \"whether or not any transfer of credit or exchange transaction has resu lted from the importation or deposit of the gold.\" 20 On November 10, 1920, A. Breton, a vice president o f the Guaranty Trust, wrote to Assistant Secretary Gilbert of the Treasury Departm ent complaining that Guaranty had not received from the assay office the usual im mediate advance against deposits of \"yellow metal left with them for reduction.\" The letter states that Guaranty Trust had received satisfactory assurances that the bars were the product of melting French and Belgium coins, although it had purchased the me tal in Holland. The letter requested that the Treasury expedite payment for th e gold. In reply the Treasury argued that it \"does not purchase gold tendered to the United States mint or assay offices which is known or suspected to be of Soviet origin,\" and in view of known Soviet sales of gold in Holland, the gold submitted by Guaranty Trust Company was held to be a \"doubtful case, with suggestions of So viet origin.\" It suggested that the Guaranty Trust Company could withdraw the gold from the assay office at any time it wished or could \"present such further evidence to t he Treasury, the Federal Reserve"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Bank of New York or the Department of State as may be necessary to clear the gold of any suspicion of Soviet origin.\" 21 There is no file record concerning final dispositio n of this case but presumably the Guaranty Trust Company was paid for the shipment. O bviously this gold deposit was to implement the mid-1920 fiscal agreement between Guaranty Trust and the Soviet government under which the company became the Sovie t agent in the United States (see epigraph to this chapter). It was determined at a later date that Soviet gold was also being sent to the Swedish mint. The Swedish mint \"melts Russian gold, assays it and affixes the Swedish mint stamp at the request of Swedish banks or other Swed ish subjects owing the gold.\" 22 And at the same time Olof Aschberg, head of Svenska Ekonomie A/B (the Soviet intermediary and affiliate of Guaranty Trust), was offering \"unlimited quantities of Russian gold\" through Swedish banks. 23 In brief, we can tie American International Corpora tion, the influential Professor Lomonossoff, Guaranty Trust, and Olof Aschberg (who m we've previously identified) to the first attempts to import Soviet gold into th e United States. MAX MAY OF GUARANTY TRUST BECOMES DIRECTOR OF RUSKOMBANK Guaranty Trust's interest in Soviet Russia was rene wed in 1920 in the form of a letter from Henry C. Emery, assistant manager of the Forei gn Department of Guaranty Trust, to De Witt C. Poole in the State Department. The letter was dated January 21, 1920, just a few weeks before Allen Walker, the man ager of the Foreign Department, became active in forming the virulent anti-Soviet o rganization United Americans (see page 165). Emery posed numerous questions about the legal basis of the Soviet government and banking in Russia and inquired wheth er the Soviet government was the de facto government in Russia. 24 \"Revolt before 1922 planned by Reds,\" claimed United Americans in 1920, but Guaranty Trust had st arted negotiations with these same Reds and was acting as the Soviet agent in the U.S. in mid-1920. In January 1922 Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoove r, interceded with the State Department in behalf of a Guaranty Trust scheme to set up exchange relations with the \"New State Bank at Moscow.\" This scheme, wrote Herbert Hoover, \"would not be objectionable if a stipulation were made that all m onies coming into their possession should be used for the purchase of civilian commodi ties in the United States\"; and after asserting that such relations appeared to be in line with general policy, Hoover added, \"It might be advantageous to have these tran sactions organized in such a manner that we know what the movement is instead of disintegrated operations now current.\" 25 Of course, such \"disintegrated operations\" are con sistent with the operations of a free market, but this approach Herb ert Hoover rejected in favor of channeling the exchange through specified and contr ollable sources in New York. Secretary of State Charles E. Hughes expressed disl ike of the Hoover-Guaranty Trust scheme, which he thought could be regarded as de fa cto recognition of the Soviets while the foreign credits acquired might be used to the disadvantage of the United States. 26 A noncommittal reply was sent by State to Guaranty Trust. However,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Guaranty went ahead (with Herbert Hoover's support) , 27 participated in formation of the first Soviet international bank, and Max May of Guaranty Trust became head of the foreign department of the new Ruskombank. 28 Footnotes: 1 U.S. State Dept.

MORGAN GIVES A LITTLE HELP TO THE OTHER SIDE I would not sit down to lunch with a Morgan — excep t possibly to learn something of his motives and attitudes. William E. Dodd, Ambassador Dodd's Diary, 1933-1938 So far our story has revolved around a single major financial house — Guaranty Trust Company, the largest trust company in the United St ates and controlled by the J.P. Morgan firm. Guaranty Trust used Olof Aschberg, the Bolshevik banker, as its intermediary in Russia before and after the revolut ion. Guaranty was a backer of Ludwig Martens and his Soviet Bureau, the first Sov iet representatives in the United States. And in mid-1920 Guaranty was the Soviet fis cal agent in the U.S.; the first shipments of Soviet gold to the United States also traced back to Guaranty Trust. There is a startling reverse side to this pro-Bolsh evik activity — Guaranty Trust was a founder of United Americans, a virulent anti-Soviet organization which noisily threatened Red invasion by 1922, claimed that $20 m illion of Soviet funds were on the way to fund Red revolution, and forecast panic in the streets and mass starvation in New York City. This duplicity raises, of course, serious questions about the intentions of Guaranty Trust and its directors. Dea ling with the Soviets, even backing them, can be explained by apolitical greed or simpl y profit motive. On the other hand, spreading propaganda designed to create fear and pa nic while at the same time encouraging the conditions that give rise to the fe ar and panic is a considerably more serious problem. It suggests utter moral depravity. Let's first look more closely at the anti-Communist United Americans. UNITED AMERICANS FORMED TO FIGHT COMMUNISM 1 In 1920 the organization United Americans was found ed. It was limited to citizens of the United States and planned for five million memb ers, \"whose sole purpose would be to combat the teachings of the socialists, commu nists, I.W.W., Russian organizations and radical farmers societies.\" In other words, United Americans was to fight all t hose institutions and groups believed to be anticapitalist. The officer's of the preliminary organization estab lished to build up United Americans were Allen Walker of the Guaranty Trust Company; Da niel Willard, president of the Baltimore 8c Ohio Railroad; H. H. Westinghouse, of Westinghouse Air Brake Company; and Otto H. Kahn, of Kuhn, Loeb 8c Company and American International Corporation. These Wall Streeters were backed up by assorted university presidents arid Newton W. Gilbert (former governor of the Phil ippines). Obviously, United Americans was, at first glance, exactly the kind of organization that establishment"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"capitalists would be expected to finance and join. Its formation should have brought no great surprise. On the other hand, as we have already seen, these f inanciers were also deeply involved in supporting the new Soviet regime in Russia — although this sup port was behind the scenes, recorded only in government file s, and not to be made public for 50 years. As part of United Americans, Walker, Will ard, Westinghouse, and Kahn were playing a double game. Otto H. Kahn, a founder of the anti-Communist organization, was reported by the British socialist J. H. Thomas as having his \"face towards the light.\" Kahn wrote the preface to Thoma s's book. In 1924 Otto Kahn addressed the League for Industrial Democracy and p rofessed common objectives with this activist socialist group (see page 49). T he Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (Willard's employer) was active in the development of Russia during the 1920s. Westinghouse in 1920, the year United Americans was founded, was operating a plant in Russia that had been exempted from nationalizati on. And the role of Guaranty Trust has already been minutely described. UNITED AMERICANS REVEALS \"STARTLING DISCLOSURES\" ON REDS In March 1920 the New York Times headlined an extensive, detailed scare story about Red invasion of the United States within two years, an invasion which was to be financed by $20 million of Soviet funds \"obtained b y the murder and robbery of the Russian nobility.\" 2 United Americans had, it was revealed, made a surve y of \"radical activities\" in the United States, and had done so in its role as an or ganization formed to \"preserve the Constitution of the United States with the represen tative form of government and the right of individual possession which the Constituti on provides.\" Further, the survey, it was proclaimed, had the bac king of the executive board, \"including Otto H. Kahn, Allen Walker of the Guaran ty Trust Company, Daniel Willard,\" and others. The survey asserted that the radical leaders are confident of effecting a re volution within two years, that the start is to be made in New York City with a general strike, that Red leaders have predicted much bloodshed and that the Russian Sovie t Government has contributed $20,000,000 to the American radical movement. The Soviet gold shipments to Guaranty Trust in mid- 1920 (540 boxes of three poods each) were worth roughly $15,000,000 (at $20 a troy ounce), and other gold shipments through Robert Dollar and Olof Aschberg b rought the total very close to $20 million. The information about Soviet gold for the radical movement was called \"thoroughly reliable\" and was \"being turned over to the Government.\" The Reds, it was asserted, planned to starve New York into submi ssion within four days: Meanwhile the Reds count on a financial panic withi n the next few weeks to help their cause along. A panic would cause distress amo ng the workingmen and thus render them more susceptible to revolution doctrine ."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The United Americans' report grossly overstated the number of radicals in the United States, at first tossing around figures like two or five million and then settling for precisely 3,465,000 members in four radical organiz ations. The report concluded by emphasizing the possibility of bloodshed and quoted \"Skaczewski, President of the International Publishing Association, otherwise the Communist Party, [who] boasted that.the time was coming soon when the Communists w ould destroy utterly the present form of society.\" In brief, United Americans published a report witho ut substantiating evidence, designed to scare the man in the street into panic: The significant point of course is that this is the same group that was responsible fo r protecting and subsidizing, indeed assisting, the Soviets so they could undertake thes e same plans. CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING UNITED AMERICANS Is this a case of the right hand not knowing what t he left hand was doing? Probably not. We are talking about heads of companies, emine ntly successful companies at that. So United Americans was probably a ruse to divert p ublic — and official — attention from the subterranean efforts being made to gain en try to the Russian market. United Americans is the only documented example kno wn to this writer of an organization assisting the Soviet regime and also i n the forefront of opposition to the Soviets. This is by no means an inconsistent course of action, and further research should at least focus on the following aspects: (a) Are there other examples of double-dealing by i nfluential groups generally known as the establishment? (b) Can these examples be extended into other areas ? For example, is there evidence that labor troubles have been instigated by these g roups? (c) What is the ultimate purpose of these pincer ta ctics? Can they be related to the Marxian axiom: thesis versus antithesis yields synt hesis? It is a puzzle why the Marxist movement would attack capitalism head-on if its objective was a Communist world and if it truly accepted the dialectic. If th e objective is a Communist world — that is, if communism is the desired synthesis — an d capitalism is the thesis, then something apart from capitalism or communism has to be antithesis. Could therefore capitalism be the thesis and communism the antithes is, with the objective of the revolutionary groups and their backers being a synt hesizing of these two systems into some world system yet undescribed? MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AID KOLCHAK Concurrently with these efforts to aid the Soviet B ureau and United Americans, the J.P. Morgan firm, which controlled Guaranty Trust, was providing financial assistance for one of the Bolshevik's primary opponents, Admir al Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia. On June 23, 1919, Congressman Mason introduced Hous e Resolution 132 instructing the State Department \"to make inquiry as to all and singular as to the truth of . . . press"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"reports\" charging that Russian bondholders had used their influence to bring about the \"retention of American troops in Russia\" in order t o ensure continued payment of interest on Russian bonds. According to a file memo randum by Basil Miles, an associate of William F. Sands, Congressman Mason ch arged that certain banks were attempting to secure recognition of Admiral Kolchak in Siberia to get payment on former Russian bonds. Then in August 1919 the secretary of state, Robert Lansing, received from the Rockefeller-influenced National City Bank of New Yo rk a letter requesting official comment on a proposed loan of $5 million to Admiral Kolchak; and from J.P. Morgan & Co. and other bankers another letter requesting t he views of the department concerning an additional proposed £10 million sterl ing loan to Kolchak by a consortium of British and American bankers. 3 Secretary Lansing informed the bankers that the U.S . had not recognized Kolchak and, although prepared to render him assistance, \"the De partment did not feel it could assume the responsibility of encouraging such negot iations but that, nevertheless, there seemed to be no objection to the loan provide d the bankers deemed it advisable to make it.\" 4 Subsequently, on September 30, Lansing informed the American consul general at Omsk that the \"loan has since gone through in regul ar course\" 5 Two fifths was taken up by British banks and three fifths by American ba nks. Two thirds of the total was to be spent in Britain and the United States and the r emaining one third wherever the Kolchak Government wished. The loan was secured by Russian gold (Kolchak's) that was shipped to San Francisco. The timing of the pre viously described Soviet exports of gold suggests that cooperation with the Soviets on gold sales was determined on the heels of the Kolchak gold-loan agreement. The Soviet gold sales and the Kolchak loan also sug gest that Carroll Quigley's statement that Morgan interests infiltrated the dom estic left applied also to overseas revolutionary and counterrevolutionary movements. Summer 1919 was a t ime of Soviet military reverses in the Crimea and the Ukra ine and this black picture may have induced British and American bankers to mend t heir fences with the anti- Bolshevik forces. The obvious rationale would be to have a foot in all camps, and so be in a favorable position to negotiate for concess ions and business after the revolution or counterrevolution had succeeded and a new government stabilized. As the outcome of any conflict cannot be seen at the s tart, the idea is to place sizable bets on all the horses in the revolutionary race. Thus a ssistance was given on the one hand to the Soviets and on the other to Kolchak — while the British government was supporting Denikin in the Ukraine and the French go vernment went to the aid of the Poles. In autumn 1919 the Berlin newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittak (October 8 and 9) accused the Morgan firm of financing the West Russi an government and the Russian- German forces in the Baltic fighting the Bolsheviks — both allied to Kolchak. The Morgan firm strenuously denied the charge: \"This fi rm has had no discussion, or meeting, with the West Russian Government or with a nyone pretending to represent it, at any time.\" 6 But if the financing charge was inaccurate there i s evidence of collaboration. Documents found by Latvian governmen t intelligence among the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"papers of Colonel Bermondt, commander of the Wester n Volunteer Army, confirm \"the relations claimed existing between Kolchak's L ondon Agent and the German industrial ring which was back of Bermondt.\" 7 In other words, we know that J.P. Morgan, London, a nd New. York bankers financed Kolchak. There is also evidence that connects Kolch ak and his army with other anti- Bolshevik armies. And there seems to be little ques tion that German industrial and banking circles were financing the all-Russian anti -Bolshevik army in the Baltic. Obviously bankers' funds have no national flag.

I am not given to errant causes... John D. Rockefeller III, The Second American Revolution (New York: Harper & Row. 1973) THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED: A SYNOPSIS Evidence already published by George Katkov, Stefan Possony, and Michael Futrell has established that the return to Russia of Lenin and his party of exiled Bolsheviks, followed a few weeks later by a party of Mensheviks , was financed and organized by the German government. 1 The necessary funds were transferred in part throu gh the Nya Banken in Stockholm, owned by Olof Aschberg, an d the dual German objectives were: (a) removal of Russia from the war, and (b) c ontrol of the postwar Russian market. 2 We have now gone beyond this evidence to establish a continuing working relationship between Bolshevik banker Olof Aschberg and the Morgan-controlled Guaranty Trust Company in New York before, during, and after the Russian Revolution. In tsarist times Aschberg was the Morga n agent in Russia and negotiator for Russian loans in the United States; during 1917 Aschberg was financial intermediary for the revolutionaries; and after the revolution Aschberg became head of Ruskombank, the first Soviet international bank, while Max May, a vice president of the Morgan-controlled Guaranty Trust, became dir ector and chief of the Ruskom- bank foreign department. We have presented document ary evidence of a continuing working relationship between the Guaranty Trust Com pany and the Bolsheviks. The directors of Guaranty Trust in 1917 are listed in A ppendix 1. Moreover, there is evidence of transfers of funds f rom Wall Street bankers to international revolutionary activities. For example , there is the statement (substantiated by a cablegram) by William Boyce Tho mpson — a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a large stockhold er in the Rockefeller-controlled Chase Bank, and a financial associate of the Guggen heims and the Morgans — that he (Thompson) contributed $1 million to the Bolshevik Revolution for propaganda purposes. Another example is John Reed, the America n member of the Third International executive committee who was financed and supported by Eugene Boissevain, a private New York banker, and who was employed by Harry Payne Whitney's Metropolitan magazine. Whitney was at that time a director of Gu aranty Trust. We also established that Ludwig Martens, the first Soviet \"ambassador\" to the United States, was (according to British Intelligen ce chief Sir Basil Thompson) backed by funds from Guaranty Trust Company. In tra cing Trotsky's funding in the U.S. we arrived at German sources, yet to be identi fied, in New York. And though we"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"do not know the precise German sources of Trotsky's funds, we do know that Von Pavenstedt, the chief German espionage paymaster in the U.S., was also senior partner of Amsinck & Co. Amsinck was owned by the ever-pres ent American International Corporation — also controlled by the J.P. Morgan fi rm. Further, Wall Street firms including Guaranty Trust were involved with Carranza's and Villa's wartime revolutionary activities in Mex ico. We also identified documentary evidence concerning. a Wall Street synd icate's financing of the 1912 Sun Yat-sen revolution in China, a revolution that is today hailed by the Chinese Communists as the precursor of Mao's revolution in China. Charles B. Hill, New York attorney negotiating with Sun Yat-sen in behal f of this syndicate, was a director of three Westinghouse subsidiaries, and we have fou nd that Charles R. Crane of Westinghouse in Russia was involved in the Russian Revolution. Quite apart from finance, we identified other, and possibly more significant, evidence of Wall Street involvement in the Bolshevik cause. The American Red Cross Mission to Russia was a private venture of William B. Thomp son, who publicly proffered partisan support to the Bolsheviks. British War Cab inet papers now available record that British policy was diverted towards the Lenin- Trotsky regime by the personal intervention of Thompson with Lloyd George in Decem ber 1917. We have reproduced statements by director Thompson and depu ty chairman William Lawrence Saunders, both of the Federal Reserve Bank of New Y ork, strongly favoring the Bolshevists. John Reed not only was financed from W all Street, but had consistent support for his activities, even to the extent of i ntervention with the State Department from William Franklin Sands, executive secretary of American International Corporation. In the sedition case of Robert Minor t here are strong indications and some circumstantial evidence that Colonel Edward Ho use intervened to have Minor released. The significance of the Minor case is tha t William B. Thompson's program for Bolshevik revolution in Germany was the very pr ogram Minor was implementing when arrested in Germany. Some international agents, for example Alexander Gu mberg, worked for Wall Street and the Bolsheviks. In 1917 Gumberg was the representat ive of a U.S. firm in Petrograd, worked for Thompson's American Red Cross Mission, became chief Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia until he was deporte d from Norway, then became confidential assistant to Reeve Schley of Chase Ban k in New York and later to Floyd Odium of Atlas Corporation. This activity in behalf of the Bolsheviks originate d in large part from a single address: 120 Broadway, New York City. The evidence for this observation is outlined but no conclusive reason is given for the unusual concentr ation of activity at a single address, except to state that it appears to be the foreign c ounterpart of Carroll Quigley's claim that J.P. Morgan infiltrated the domestic left. Mor gan also infiltrated the international left. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was at 120 Bro adway. The vehicle for this pro-Bolshevik activity was American International C orporation — at 120 Broadway. AIC views on the Bolshevik regime were requested by Secretary of State Robert Lansing only a few weeks after the revolution began , and Sands, executive secretary of AIC, could barely restrain his enthusiasm for th e Bolshevik cause. Ludwig Martens,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the Soviet's first ambassador, had been vice presid ent of Weinberg & Posner, which was also located at 120-Broadway. Guaranty Trust Co mpany was next door at 140 Broadway but Guaranty Securities Co. was at 120 Bro adway. In 1917 Hunt, Hill & Betts was at 120 Broadway, and Charles B. Hill of t his firm was the negotiator in the Sun Yat-sen dealings. John MacGregor Grant Co., whi ch was financed by Olof Aschberg in Sweden and Guaranty Trust in the United States, and which was on the Military Intelligence black list, was at 120 Broadw ay. The Guggenheims and the executive heart of General Electric (also intereste d in American International) were at 120 Broadway. We find it therefore hardly surprisin g that the Bankers Club was also at 120 Broadway, on the top floor (the thirty-fourt h). It is significant that support for the Bolsheviks d id not cease with consolidation of the revolution; therefore, this support cannot be wholl y explained in terms of the war with Germany. The American-Russian syndicate formed in 1 918 to obtain concessions in Russia was backed by the White, Guggenheim, and Sin clair interests. Directors of companies controlled by these three financiers incl uded Thomas W. Lamont (Guaranty Trust), William Boyce Thompson (Federal R eserve Bank), and John Reed's employer Harry Payne Whitney (Guaranty Trust). This strongly suggests that the syndicate was formed to cash in on earlier support for the Bolshevik cause in the revolutionary period. And then we found that Guaran ty Trust financially backed the Soviet Bureau in New York in 1919. The first really concrete signal that previous poli tical and financial support was paying off came in 1923 when the Soviets formed the ir first international bank, Ruskombank. Morgan associate Olof Aschberg became n ominal head of this Soviet bank; Max May, a vice president of Guaranty Trust, became a director of Ruskom- bank, and the Ruskombank promptly appointed Guarant y Trust Company its U.S. agent. THE EXPLANATION FOR THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE What motive explains this coalition of capitalists and Bolsheviks? Russia was then — and is today — the largest untapp ed market in the world. Moreover, Russia, then and now, constituted the gre atest potential competitive threat to American industrial and financial supremacy. (A glance at a world map is sufficient to spotlight the geographical difference between th e vast land mass of Russia and the smaller United States.) Wall Street must have cold shivers when it visualizes Russia as a second super American industrial giant. But why allow Russia to become a competitor and a c hallenge to U.S. supremacy? In the late nineteenth century, Morgan/Rockefeller, an d Guggenheim had demonstrated their monopolistic proclivities. In Railroads and Regulation 1877-1916 Gabriel Kolko has demonstrated how the railroad owners, not the f armers, wanted state control of railroads in order to preserve their monopoly and a bolish competition. So the simplest explanation of our evidence is that a syndicate of Wall Street financiers enlarged their monopoly ambitions and broadened horizons on a glob al scale. The gigantic Russian market was to be converted into a captive market an d a technical colony to be exploited by a few high-powered American financiers and the corporations under"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"their control. What the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Fed eral Trade Commission under the thumb of American industry cou ld achieve for that industry at home, a planned socialist government could achieve for it abroad — given suitable support and inducements from Wall Street and Washin gton, D.C. Finally, lest this explanation seem too radical, re member that it was Trotsky who appointed tsarist generals to consolidate the Red A rmy; that it was Trotsky who appealed for American officers to control revolutio nary Russia and intervene in behalf of the Soviets; that it was Trotsky who squashed fi rst the libertarian element in the Russian Revolution and then the workers and peasant s; and that recorded history totally ignores the 700,000-man Green Army composed of ex-B olsheviks, angered at betrayal of the revolution, who fought the Whites and the Reds. In other words, we are suggesting that the Bolshevik Revolution was an alliance of statists: statist revolutionaries and statist financiers aligned agai nst the genuine revolutionary libertarian elements in Russia. 3 'The question now in the readers' minds must be, we re these bankers also secret Bolsheviks? No, of course not. The financiers were without ideology. It would be a gross misinterpretation to assume that assistance f or the Bolshevists was ideologically motivated, in any narrow sense. The financiers were power-motivated and therefore assisted any political vehicle that would give them an entree to power: Trotsky, Lenin, the tsar, Kolchak, Denikin — all received aid, more or less. All, that is, but those who wanted a truly free individualist society. Neither was aid restricted to statist Bolsheviks an d statist counter-Bolsheviks. John P. Diggins, in Mussolini and Fascism: The View from America, 4 has noted in regard to Thomas Lamont of Guaranty Trust that Of all American business leaders, the one who most vigorously patronized the cause of Fascism was Thomas W. Lamont. Head of the powerf ul J.P. Morgan banking network, Lamont served as something of a business c onsultant for the government of Fascist Italy. Lamont secured a $100 million loan for Mussolini in 1926 at a particularly crucial time for the Italian dictator. We might remember to o that the director of Guaranty Trust was the father of Corliss Lamont, a domestic Communist. This evenhanded approach to the twin totalitarian systems, communis m and fascism, was not confined to the Lamont family. For example, Otto Kahn, direc tor of American International Corporation and of Kuhn, Leob & Co., felt sure that \"American capital invested in Italy will find safety, encouragement, opportunity and reward.\" 5 This is the same Otto Kahn who lectured the socialist League of Industria l Democracy in 1924 that its objectives were his objectives. 6 They differed only — according to Otto Kahn — over the means of achieving these objectives. Ivy Lee, Rockefeller's public relations man, made s imilar pronouncements, and was responsible for selling the Soviet regime to the gu llible American public in the late 1920s. We also have observed that Basil Miles, in c harge of the Russian desk at the State Department and a former associate of William Franklin Sands, was decidedly helpful to the businessmen promoting Bolshevik caus es; but in 1923 the same Miles authored a profascist article, \"Italy's Black Shirt s and Business.\" 7 \"Success of the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Fascists is an expression of Italy's youth,\" wrote Miles while glorifying the fascist movement and applauding its esteem for American bus iness. THE MARBURG PLAN The Marburg Plan, financed by Andrew Carnegie's amp le heritage, was produced in the early years of the twentieth century. It sugges ts premeditation for this kind of superficial schizophrenia, which in fact masks an i ntegrated program of power acquisition: \"What then if Carnegie and his unlimit ed wealth, the international financiers and the Socialists could be organized in a movement to compel the formation of a league to enforce peace.\" 8 The governments of the world, according to the Marb urg Plan, were to be socialized while the ultimate power would remain in the hands of the international financiers \"to control its councils and enforce peace [and so] pro vide a specific for all the political ills of mankind.\" 9 This idea was knit with other elements with similar objectives. Lord Milner in England provides the transatlantic example of banki ng interests recognizing the virtues and possibilities of Marxism. Milner was a banker, influential in British wartime policy, and pro-Marxist. 10 In New York the socialist \"X\" club was founded in 1903. It counted among its members not only the Com munist Lincoln Steffens, the socialist William English Walling, and the Communis t banker Morris Hillquit, but also John Dewey, James T. Shotwell, Charles Edward Russell, and Rufus Weeks (vice president of New York Life Insurance Company). The annual meeting of the Economic Club in the Astor Hotel, New York, witness ed socialist speakers. In 1908, when A. Barton Hepburn, president of Chase National Bank, was president of the Economic Club, the main speaker was the aforementio ned Morris Hillquit, who \"had abundant opportunity to preach socialism to a gathe ring which represented wealth and financial interests.\" 11 From these unlikely seeds grew the modern internati onalist movement, which included not only the financiers Carnegie, Paul War burg, Otto Kahn, Bernard Baruch, and Herbert Hoover, but also the Carnegie Foundatio n and its progeny International Conciliation. The trustees of Carnegie were, as we have seen, pro minent on the board of American International Corporation. In 1910 Carn egie donated $10 million to found the Carnegie Endowment for International Peac e, and among those on the board of trustees were Elihu Root (Root Mission to Russia, 1917), Cleveland H. Dodge (a financial backer of President Wilson), Geo rge W. Perkins (Morgan partner), G. J. Balch (AIC and Amsinck), R. F. Herrick (AIC), H. W. Pritchett (AIC), and other Wall Street luminaries. Woodrow Wilson came under t he powerful influence of — and indeed was financially indebted to — this group of internationalists. As Jennings C. Wise has written, \"Historians must never forget that Woodrow Wilson... made it possible for Leon Trotsky to enter Russia with an A merican passport.\" 12 But Leon Trotsky also declared himself an internati onalist. We have remarked with some interest his high-level internationalist conne ctions, or at least friends, in Canada. Trotsky then was not pro-Russian, or pro-Allied, or pro-German, as many have tried to make him out to be. Trotsky was for world revolution, for world dictatorship; he"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"was, in one word, an internationalist. 13 Bolshevists and bankers have then this significant common ground — internationalism. Revol ution and international finance are not at all inconsistent if the result of revolu tion is to establish more centralized authority. International finance prefers to deal wi th central governments. The last thing the banking community wants is laissez-faire economy and decentralized power because these would disperse power. This, therefore, is an explanation that fits the ev idence. This handful of bankers and promoters was not Bolshevik, or Communist, or socia list, or Democrat, or even American. Above all else these men wanted markets, preferably captive international markets — and a monopoly of the captive world marke t as the ultimate goal. They wanted markets that could be exploited monopolistic ally without fear of competition from Russians, Germans, or anyone else — including American businessmen outside the charmed circle. This closed group was apolitica l and amoral. In 1917, it had a single-minded objective — a captive market in Russi a, all presented under, and intellectually protected by, the shelter of a leagu e to enforce the peace. Wall Street did indeed achieve its goal. American f irms controlled by this syndicate were later to go on and build the Soviet Union, and today are well on their way to bringing the Soviet military-industrial complex int o the age of the computer. Today the objective is still alive and well. John D . Rockefeller expounds it in his book The Second American Revolution — which sports a five-pointed star on the title page. 14 The book contains a naked plea for humanism, that is, a plea that our first priority is to work for others. In other words, a p lea for collectivism. Humanism is collectivism. It is notable that the Rockefellers, who have promoted this humanistic idea for a century, have not turned their OWN prope rty over to others.. Presumably it is implicit in their recommendation that we all work for the Rockefellers. Rockefeller's book promotes collectivism under the guises of \"cautious conservatism\" and \"the public good.\" It is in effect a plea for t he continuation of the earlier Morgan- Rockefeller support of collectivist enterprises and mass subversion of individual rights. In brief, the public good has been, and is today, u sed as a device and an excuse for self-aggrandizement by an elitist circle that plead s for world peace and human decency. But so long as the reader looks at world h istory in terms of an inexorable Marxian conflict between capitalism and communism, the objectives of such an alliance between international finance and internat ional revolution remain elusive. So will the ludicrousness of promotion of the public g ood by plunderers. If these alliances still elude the reader, then he should po nder the obvious fact that these same international interests and promoters are always wi lling to determine what other people should do, but are signally unwilling to be first in line to give up their own wealth and power. Their mouths are open, their pock ets are closed. This technique, used by the monopolists to gouge so ciety, was set forth in the early twentieth century by Frederick C. Howe in The Confessions of a Monopolist. 15 First, says Howe, politics is a necessary part of business . To control industries it is necessary to control Congress and the regulators an d thus make society go to work for you, the monopolist. So, according to Howe, the two principles of a successful"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"monopolist are, \"First, let Society work for you; a nd second, make a business of politics.\" 16 These, wrote Howe, are the basic \"rules of big bus iness.\" Is there any evidence that this magnificently sweep ing objective was also known to Congress and the academic world? Certainly the poss ibility was known and known publicly. For example, witness the testimony of Alb ert Rhys Williams, an astute commentator on the revolution, before the Senate Ov erman Committee: . . . it is probably true that under the soviet governmen t industrial life will perhaps be much slower in development than under the usual cap italistic system. But why should a great industrial country like America desire the creation and consequent competition of another great industrial rival? Are not the inte rests of America in this regard in line with the slow tempo of development which soviet Rus sia projects for herself? Senator Wolcott: Then your argument is that it woul d be to the interest of America to have Russia repressed? MR. WILLIAMS: Not repressed .... SENATOR WOLCOTT: You say. Why should America desire Russia to become an industrial competitor with her? MR. WILLIAMS: This is speaking from a capitalistic standpoint. The whole interest of America is not, I think, to have another great i ndustrial rival, like Germany, England, France, and Italy, thrown on the market in competition. I think another government over there besides the Soviet government would perhaps increase the tempo or rate of development of Russia, and we woul d have another rival. Of course, this is arguing from a capitalistic standpoint. SENATOR WOLCOTT: So you are presenting an argument here which you think might appeal to the American people, your point bei ng this, that if we recognize the Soviet government of Russia as it is constituted we will be recognizing a government that can not compete with us in industry for a grea t many years? MR. WILLIAMS: That is a fact. SENATOR WOLCOTT: That is an argument that under the Soviet government Russia is in no position, for a great many years at least, to approach America industrially? MR. WILLIAMS: Absolutely. 17 And in that forthright statement by Albert Rhys Wil liams is the basic clue to the revisionist interpretation of Russian history over the past half century. Wall Street, or rather the Morgan-Rockefeller compl ex represented at 120 Broadway and 14 Wall Street, had something very close to Wil liams' argument in mind. Wall Street went to bat in Washington for the Bolsheviks . It succeeded. The Soviet totalitarian regime survived. In the 1930s foreign firms, mostly of the Morgan- Rockefeller group, built the five-year plans.

Connett "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Appendix II THE JEWISH-CONSPIRACY THEORY OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOL UTION There is an extensive literature in English, French , and German reflecting the argument that the Bolshevik Revolution was the resu lt of a \"Jewish conspiracy\"; more specifically, a conspiracy by Jewish world bankers. Generally, world control is seen as the ultimate objective; the Bolshevik Revolution was but one phase of a wider program that supposedly reflects an age-old religio us struggle between Christianity and the \"forces of darkness.\" The argument and its variants can be found in the m ost surprising places and from quite surprising persons. In February 1920 Winston Churchill wrote an article — rarely cited today — for the London Illustrated Sunday Herald entitled \"Zionism Versus Bolshevism.\" In this' article Churchill conc luded that it was \"particularly important... that the National Jews in every countr y who are loyal to the land of their adoption should come forward on every occasion . . . and take a prominent part in every measure for combatting the Bolshevik conspira cy.\" Churchill draws a line between \"national Jews\" and what he calls \"internat ional Jews.\" He argues that the \"international and for the most atheistical Jews\" c ertainly had a \"very great\" role in the creation of Bolshevism and bringing about the R ussian Revolution. He asserts (contrary to fact) that with the exception of Lenin , \"the majority\" of the leading figures in the revolution were Jewish, and adds (al so contrary to fact) that in many cases Jewish interests and Jewish places of worship were excepted by the Bolsheviks from their policies of seizure. Churchill calls the international Jews a \"sinister confederacy\" emergent from the persecuted populatio ns of countries where Jews have been persecuted on account of their race. Winston C hurchill traces this movement back to Spartacus-Weishaupt, throws his literary ne t around Trotsky, Bela Kun, Rosa Luxemburg, and Emma Goldman, and charges: \"This wor ld-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitutio n of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing.\" Churchill then argues that this conspiratorial Spar tacus-Weishaupt group has been the mainspring of every subversive movement in the nine teenth century. While pointing out that Zionism and Bolshevism are competing for t he soul of the Jewish people, Churchill (in 1920) was preoccupied with the role o f the Jew in the Bolshevik Revolution and the existence of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Another well-known author in the 1920s, Henry Wickh am Steed describes in the second volume of his Through 30 Years 1892-1922 (p. 302) how he attempted to bring the Jewish-conspiracy concept to the attentio n of Colonel Edward M. House and President Woodrow Wilson. One day in March 1919 Wic kham Steed called Colonel House and found him disturbed over Steed's recent c riticism of U.S. recognition of the Bolsheviks. Steed pointed out to House that Wilson would be discredited among the many peoples and nations of Europe and \"insisted th at, unknown to him, the prime movers were Jacob Schiff, Warburg and other interna tional financiers, who wished above all to bolster up the Jewish Bolshevists in o rder to secure a field for German"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"and Jewish exploitation of Russia.\" 1 According to Steed, Colonel House argued for the establishment of economic relations with the So viet Union. Probably the most superficially damning collection of documents on the Jewish conspiracy is in the State Department Decimal File (861.00/5339). The central document is one entitled \"Bolshevism and Judaism,\" dated November 13, 1918. The text is in the form of a report, which states that the revolution in Russia was engineered \"in February 1916\" and \"it was found tha t the following persons and firms were engaged in this destructive work\": (1) Jacob Schiff Jew (2) Kuhn, Loeb & Company Jewish Firm Management: Jacob Schiff Jew Felix Warburg Jew Otto H. Kahn Jew Mortimer L. Schiff Jew Jerome J. Hanauer Jew (3) Guggenheim Jew (4) Max Breitung Jew (5) Isaac Seligman Jew The report goes on to assert that there can be no d oubt that the Russian Revolution was started and engineered by this group and that i n April 1917 Jacob Schiff in fact made a public announcement and it was due to his financial influence that the Russian revolution was successfu lly accomplished and in the Spring 1917 Jacob Schitf started to finance Trotsky, a Jew , for the purpose of accomplishing a social revolution in Russia. The report contains other miscellaneous information about Max Warburg's financing of Trotsky, the role of the Rheinish-Westphalian sy ndicate and Olof Aschberg of the Nya Banken (Stockholm) together with Jivotovsky. Th e anonymous author (actually employed by the U.S. War Trade Board) 2 states that the links between these organizations and their financing of the Bolshevik Revolution show how \"the link between Jewish multi-millionaires and Jewish prolet arians was forged.\" The report goes on to list a large number of Bolsheviks who we re also Jews and then describes the actions of Paul Warburg, Judus Magnes, Kuhn, Lo eb & Company, and Speyer & Company. The report ends with a barb at \"International Jewry \" and places the argument into the context of a Christian-Jewish conflict backed up by quotations from the Protocols of Zion.

It was agreed to suppress this material and the fil es conclude, \"I think we have the whole thing in cold storage.\" Another document marked \"Most Secret\" is included w ith this batch of material. The provenance of the document is unknown; it is perhap s FBI or military intelligence. It reviews a translation of the Protocols of the Meeti ngs of the Wise Men of Zion, and concludes: In this connection a letter was sent to Mr. W. encl osing a memorandum from us with regard to certain information from the American Mil itary Attache to the effect that the British authorities had letters intercepted from va rious groups of international Jews setting out a scheme for world dominion. Copies of this material will be very useful to us. This information was apparently developed and a lat er British intelligence report makes the flat accusation: SUMMARY: There is now definite evidence that Bolshe vism is an international movement controlled by Jews; communications are pas sing between the leaders in America, France, Russia and England with a view to concerted action.... 4 However, none of the above statements can be suppor ted with hard empirical evidence. The most significant information is conta ined in the paragraph to the effect that the British authorities possessed \"letters int ercepted from various groups of international Jews setting out a scheme for world d ominion.\" If indeed such letters exist, then they would provide support (or nonsuppo rt) for a presently unsubstantiated hypothesis: to wit, that the Bolshevik Revolution a nd other revolutions are the work of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Moveover, when statements and assertions are not su pported by hard evidence and where attempts to unearth hard evidence lead in a c ircle back to the starting point — particularly when everyone is quoting everyone else — then we must reject the story as spurious. There is no concrete evidence that Jews were involv ed in the Bolshevik Revolution because they were Jewish. There may indeed have been a higher proportion of Jews involved, but given tsarist trea tment of Jews, what else would we expect? There were probably many Englishmen or pers ons of English origin in the American Revolution fighting the redcoats. So what? Does that make the American Revolution an English conspiracy? Winston Churchill 's statement that Jews had a \"very great role\" in the Bolshevik Revolution is su pported only by distorted evidence. The list of Jews involved in the Bolshevik Revoluti on must be weighed against lists of non-Jews involved in the revolution. When this scie ntific procedure is adopted, the proportion of foreign Jewish Bolsheviks involved fa lls to less than twenty percent of the total number of revolutionaries — and these Jew s were mostly deported, murdered, or sent to Siberia in the following years. Modern R ussia has in fact maintained tsarist anti-Semitism. It is significant that documents in the State Depar tment files confirm that the investment banker Jacob Schiff, often cited as a so urce of funds for the Bolshevik Revolution, was in fact against support of the Bolshevik regime. 5 This position, as we shall see, was in direct contrast to the Morgan-Roc kefeller promotion of the Bolsheviks. The persistence with which the Jewish-conspiracy my th has been pushed suggests that it may well be a deliberate device to divert attent ion from the real issues and the real causes. The evidence provided in this book suggests that the New York bankers who were also Jewish had relatively minor roles in supp orting the Bolsheviks, while the New York bankers who were also Gentiles (Morgan, Ro ckefeller, Thompson) had major roles. What better way to divert attention from the real operators than by the medieval bogeyman of anti-Semitism?

DOCUMENT FIRST The Russian situation is lost and Russia lies entir ely open to unopposed German exploitation unless a radical reversal of policy is at once undertaken by the Allies. SECOND Because of their shortsighted diplomacy, the Allies since the Revolution have accomplished nothing beneficial, and have done cons iderable harm to their own interests."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THIRD The Allied representatives in Petrograd have been l acking in sympathetic understanding of the desire of the Russ ian people to attain democracy. Our representatives were first connected officially with the Czar's regime. Naturally they have been influenced by that environment. FOURTH Meanwhile, on the other hand, the Germans have cond ucted propaganda that has undoubtedly aided them materially in destroying the Government, in wrecking the army and in destroying trade and industry. If this continues unopposed it may result in the complete exploitation of the great country by G ermany against the Allies. FIFTH I base my opinion upon a careful and intimate study of the situation both outside and inside official circles, during my stay in Petrogra d between August 7 and November 29, 1917. SIXTH \"What can be done to improve the situation of the A llies in Russia\"? The diplomatic personnel, both British and American , should be changed to one democratic in spirit and capable of sustaining demo cratic sympathy. There should be erected a powerful, unofficial comm ittee, with headquarters in Petrograd, to operate in the background, so to spea k, the influence of which in matters of policy should be recognized and accepted by the DIPLOMATIC, CONSULAR and MILITARY officials of the Allies. Such committee sh ould be so composed in personnel as to make it possible to entrust to it w ide discretionary powers. It would presumably undertake work in various channels. The nature of which will become obvious as the task progress. es; it. would aim to meet all new conditions as they might arise. SEVENTH It is impossible now to define at all completely th e scope of this new Allied committee. I can perhaps assist to a better underst anding of its possible usefulness and service by making a brief reference to the work whi ch I started and which is now in the hands of Raymond Robins, who is well and favora bly known to Col. Buchan — a work which in the future will undoubtedly have to b e somewhat altered and added to in order to meet new conditions. My work has been p erformed chiefly through a Russian \"Committee on Civic Education\" aided by Mad ame Breshkovsky, the Grandmother of the Revolution. She was assisted by Dr. David Soskice, the private secretary of the then Prime Minister Kerensky (now of London); Nicholas Basil Tchaikovsky, at one time Chairman of the Peasants C o-operative Society, and by other substantial social revolutionaries constituti ng the saving element of democracy as between the extreme \"Right\" of the official and property-owning class, and the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"extreme \"Left\" embodying the most radical elements of the socialistic parties. The aim of this committee, as stated in a cable message from Madame Breshkovsky to President Wilson, can be gathered from this quotati on: \"A widespread education is necessary to make Russia an orderly democracy. We p lan to bring this education to the soldier in the camp, to the workman in the fact ory, to the peasant in the village.\" Those aiding in this work realized that for centuri es the masses had been under the heel of Autocracy which had given them not protecti on but oppression; that a democratic form of government in Russian could be m aintained only BY THE DEFEAT OF THE GERMAN ARMY; BY THE OVERTHROW OF GERM AN AUTOCRACY. Could free Russia, unprepared for great governmental responsibilities, uneducated, untrained, be expected long to survive with imperial Germany her next door neighbor? Certainly not. Democratic Russia wou ld become speedily the greatest war prize the world has even known. The Committee designed to have an educational cente r in each regiment of the Russian army, in the form of Soldiers' Clubs. These clubs were organized as rapidly as possible, and lecturers were employed to address the soldiers. The lecturers were in reality teachers, and it should be remembered that there is a percentage of 90 among the soldiers of Russia who can neither read nor wri te. At the time of the Bolshevik outbreak many of these speakers were in the field m aking a fine impression and obtaining excellent results. There were 250 in the city of Moscow alone. It was contemplated by the Committee to have at least 5000 of these lecturers. We had under publication many newspapers of the \"A B C\" class, p rinting matter in the simplest style, and were assisting about 100 more. These pap ers carried the appeal for patriotism, unity and co-ordination into the homes of the workmen and the peasants. After the overthrow of the last Kerensky government we materially aided the dissemination of the Bolshevik literature, distribu ting it through agents and by aeroplanes to the German army. If the suggestion is permissible, it might be well to consider whether it would not be desirable to have this same Bolshevik literature sent into Germany and Austria across the West and Italia n fronts. EIGHTH The presence of a small number of Allied troops in Petrograd would certainly have done much to prevent the overthrow of the Kerensky government in November. I should like to suggest for your consideration, if p resent conditions continue, the concentration of all the British and French Governm ent employes in Petrograd, and if the necessity should arise it might be formed into a fairly effective force. It might be advisable even to pay a small sum to a Russian forc e. There is also a large body of volunteers recruited in Russia, many of them includ ed in the Inteligentzia of \"Center\" class, and these have done splendid work in the tre nches. They might properly be aided. NINTH If you ask for a further programme I should say tha t it is impossible to give it now. I believe that intelligent and courageous work will s till prevent Germany from occupying the field to itself and thus exploiting R ussia at the expense of the Allies."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"There will be many ways in which this service can b e rendered which will become obvious as the work progresses.

I have felt distressed at inability to force a differ ent attitude toward the bureau and to somehow get funds to you. To cable $5,000 to you, a s was done last week, is but a sorry joke. I hope the proposal to sell gold in Ame rica, about which we have been cabling recently, will soon be found practicable. Y esterday we cabled asking if you"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"could sell 5,000,000 rubles at a minimum of 45 cent s, present market rate being 51.44 cents. That would net at least $2,225,000. L's pres ent need is $2,000,000 to pay Niels Juul & Co., in Christiania, for the first part of t he coal shipment from America to Vardoe, Murmansk, and Archangel. The first ship is nearing Vardoe and the second left New York about July 28. Altogether, Niels Juul & Co., or rather the Norges' Bank, of Christiania, on their and our account, hold $11, 000,000 gold rubles of ours, which they themselves brought from Reval to Christiania, as security for our coal order and the necessary tonnage, but the offers for purchase of this gold that they have so far been able to get are very poor, the best being $575 per kilo, whereas the rate offered by the American Mint or Treasury Department is now $644.42, and considering the large sum involved it would be a shame to let it go at too heavy a loss. I hope that ere you get this you will have been able to effect the sale, at the same time thus getting a quarter of a million dollars or more for the bureau . If we can't in some way pay the $2,000,000 in Christiania, that was due four days a go, within a very short time, Niels Juul & Co. will have the right to sell our gold tha t they now hold at the best price then obtainable, which, as stated above, is quite low. We don't know yet how the Canadian negotiations are going on. We understand Nuorteva turned over the strings to Shoen when N.'s arrest seemed imminent. We don't at this writing know where Nuorteva is. Our g uess is that after his enforced return to England from Esbjerg, Denmark, Sir Basil Thomson had him shipped aboard a steamer for Reval, but we have not yet heard from Reval that he has arrived there, and we certainly would hear from Goukovski or from N. himself. Humphries saw Nuorteva at Esbjerg, and is himself in difficulties with the Danish police because of it. All his connections are being probed for; his passp ort has been taken away: he has been up twice for examination, and it looks as if h e will be lucky if he escapes deportation. It was two weeks ago that Nuorteva arr ived at Esbjerg, 300 miles from here, but having no Danish visé, the Danish authori ties refused to permit him to land, and he was transferred to a steamer due to sail at 8 o'clock the following morning. By depositing 200 kroner he was allowed shore leave fo r a couple of hours. Wanting to get Copenhagen on long-distance wire and having pra ctically no more money, he once more pawned that gold watch of his for 25 kron er, therewith getting in touch with Humphries, who within half an hour jumped aboa rd the night train, slept on the floor, and arrived at Esbjerg at 7:30. Humphries fo und Nuorteva, got permission from the captain to go aboard, had 20 minutes with N., t hen had to go ashore and the boat sailed. Humphries was then invited to the police of fice by two plain-clothes men, who had been observing the proceedings. He was closely questioned, address taken, then released, and that night took train back to Copenha gen. He sent telegrams to Ewer, of Daily Herald, Shoen, and to Kliskho, at 128 New Bon d Street, urging them to be sure and meet Nuorteva's boat, so that N. couldn't again be spirited away, but we don't know yet just what happened. The British Government vigorously denied that they had any intention of sending him to Finland. Moscow has threatened reprisals if anything happens to him. Meantime, the investigatio n of H. has begun. He was called upon at his hotel by the police, requested to go to headquarters (but not arrested), and we understand that his case is now before the minis ter of justice. Whatever may be the final outcome, Humphries comments upon the reasonab le courtesy shown him, contrasting it with the ferocity of the Red raids i n America. He found that at detective headquarters they knew o f some of his outgoing letters and telegrams."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"I was interested in your favorable comment upon the Krassin interview of Tobenken's (you do not mention the Litvinoff one), because I h ad to fight like a demon with L. to get the opportunities for Tobenken. Through T. arri ved with a letter from Nuorteva, as also did Arthur Ruhl, L. brusquely turned down in l ess than one minute the application T. was making to go into Russia, would hardly take time to hear him, saying it was impossible to allow two correspondent s from the same paper to enter Russia. He gave a visé to Ruhl, largely because of a promise made last summer to Ruhl by L. Ruhl then went off to Reval, there to aw ait the permission that L. had cabled asking Moscow to give. Tobenken, a nervous, almost a broken man because of his turn down, stayed here. I realized the mistake that had been made by the snap judgment, and started in on the job of getting it c hanged. Cutting a long story short, I got him to Reval with a letter to Goukovsky from L. In the meantime Moscow refused Ruhl, notwithstanding L's visé. L. was maddened at affront to his visé, and insisted that it be honored. It was, and Ruhl prepared to le ave. Suddenly word came from Moscow to Ruhl revoking the permission and to Litvi noff, saying that information had reached Moscow that Ruhl was in service of Stat e Department. At time of writing, both Tobenken and Ruhl are in Reval, stuck. I told L. this morning of the boat leaving tomorrow and of the courier B. available, asked him if he had anything to write to Martens, o ffered to take it in shorthand for him, but no, he said he had nothing to write about that I might perhaps send duplicates of our recent cables to Martens. Kameneff passed by here on a British destroyer en r oute to London, and didn't stop off here at all, and Krassin went direct from Stock holm. Of the negotiations, allied and Polish, and of the general situation you know a bout as much as we do here. L's negotiations with the Italians have finally resulte d in establishing of mutual representation. Our representative, Vorovsky, has a lready gone to Italy and their representative, M. Gravina, is en route to Russia. We have just sent two ship loads of Russian wheat to Italy from Odessa. Give my regards to the people of your circle that I know. With all good wishes to you. Sincerely yours, Bill The batch of letters you sent — 5 Cranbourne Road , Charlton cum Hardy, Manchester, has not yet arrived. L's recommendation to Moscow, since M. asked to mov e to Canada, is that M. should be appointed there, and that N., after having some weeks in Moscow acquainting himself first hand, should be appointed representat ive to America. L. is sharply critical of the bureau for giving too easily visés and recommendations. He was obviously surprised and incensed when B. rea ched here with contracts secured in Moscow upon strength of letters given to him by M. The later message from M. evidently didn't reach Moscow. What L. plan s to do about it I don't know. I would suggest that M. cable in cipher his recommend ation to L. in this matter. L. would have nothing to do with B. here. Awkward situ ation may be created."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"L. instanced also the Rabinoff recommendation.

DOCUMENT The Berkeley Hotel, London April 13th, 1918. Hon. Walter H. Page, American Ambassador to England, London. Dear Sir: Several days ago I received a request from Mr. H. P . Davison, Chairman of the War Council of the American Red Cross, to confer with L ord Northcliffe regarding the situation in Russia, and then to proceed to Paris f or other conferences. Owing to Lord Northcliffe's illness I have not been able to confe r with him, but am leaving with Mr. Dwight W. Morrow, who is now staying at the Berkele y Hotel, a memorandum of the situation which Mr. Morrow will submit to Lord Nort hcliffe on the latter's return to London. For your information and the information of the Dep artment I enclose to you, herewith, a copy of the memorandum. Respectfully yours, [sgd.] Thomas D. Thacher. COMMENT Lord Northcliffe had just been appointed director o f propaganda. This is interesting in the light of William B. Thompson's subsidizing of B olshevik propaganda and his connection with the Morgan-Rockefeller interests. DOCUMENT NO. 10 DESCRIPTION This document is a memorandum from D.C. Poole, Divi sion of Russian Affairs in the Department of State, to the secretary of state conc erning a conversation with Mr. M. Oudin of General Electric. DOCUMENT"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"May 29, 1922 Mr. Secretary: Mr. Oudin, of the General Electric Company, informe d me this morning that his company feels that the time is possibly approaching to begin conversations with Krassin relative to a resumption of business in Rus sia. I told him that it is the view of the Department that the course to be pursued in thi s matter by American firms is a question of business judgment and that the Departme nt would certainly interpose no obstacles to an American firm resuming operations i n Russia on any basis which the firm considered practicable. He said that negotiations are now in progress betwe en the General Electric Company and the Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft for a resumption of the working agreement which they had before the war. He expects that the agreement to be made will include a provision for cooperation of Russia. Respectfully, DCP D.C. Poole COMMENT This is an important document as it relates to the forthcoming resumption of relations with Russia by an important American company. It il lustrates that the initiative came from the company, not from the State Department, an d that no consideration was given to the effect of transfer of General Electric technology to a self-declared enemy. This GE agreement was the first step down a road of major technical transfers that led directly to the deaths of 100,000 Americans and cou ntless allies."}]
