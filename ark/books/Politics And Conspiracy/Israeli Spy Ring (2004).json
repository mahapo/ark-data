I do not know whether the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks (the “Commission”) or the Senate and House Committees on Intelligence (the “Committees”) have had the opportunity to consider these issues carefully. If so, I hope this memorandum will be helpful. If not, I respectfully urge them, in accordance with the mandate of the Commission’s charter and in the exercise of the Committees’ responsibilities, to investigate the facts and resolve the questions presented. I regret that this memorandum comes to the Commission after the publication of its Final Report this past July (the “Commission’s Final Report”). As will become evident, however, it has taken some time to assemble"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the facts from the raw data and other information set forth in available governmental and other reports and relevant documents in the public record. Moreover, and in any event, the need to examine and resolve the compelling issues presented here outweighs the mere appearance of completeness by putting a permanent end to the Commission’s work. It is far more important, to all of us, that the Commission’s work be accurate and complete or, at the very least, that the Commission urge that these questions be explored and resolved by another panel as independent, distinguished and objective as itself. Both the Senate and House Committees should endeavor to explore and resolve these issues as well. 1. General Preliminary Conclusions This memorandum, on the basis of the information set forth below, the Exhibits hereto and the reports and other documents cited herein, comes to the following general preliminary conclusions. The confirmation or effective rebuttal of these conclusions can be arrived at only by a public inquiry and a thorough examination of all necessary and appropriate witnesses and all relevant documentary and other evidence. A detailed summary of these tentative conclusions is set forth at pages 49 to 52. I emphasize at the outset that the purpose of this memorandum is not to accuse any individual or individuals (excluding the hijackers themselves), or any company, of any unlawful act or any other act harmful to 2"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the United States. That will be the task of others only after, and solely if justified by, the determination of all the relevant facts in the course of the public inquiry.-- 1. In the months leading up to September 11, 2001, the Israeli DEA Groups 1 were spying on the United States. 2 They were at the same time keeping Arab groups in our country under surveillance, including the future hijackers and other FBI suspects in the catastrophic attacks of September 11. The base of operations for both the Israeli DEA Groups and the future hijackers of the World Trade Center Planes and the Pennsylvania Plane was in and around Hollywood, Florida. 2. During the same period, the Israeli New Jersey Group was keeping under surveillance Arab groups in Bergen and Hudson Counties, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, including the future hijackers of the Pentagon Plane, whose center of operations was also in Bergen and Hudson Counties. The Israeli New Jersey Group appears to have been aware, before they occurred, that hijackings had been planned by Arab terrorists, as evidenced by their jubilation when the World Trade Center was first struck, by the North Tower Plane. The leader of the Israeli New Jersey Group, who has fled the United States for Israel, is included, along with the names of the hijackers and FBI suspects, on the May 2002 FBI Suspect List. 3. The Israeli Government, through its external security agency, Mossad, warned the United States in August 2001 that an impending catastrophic attack on our soil was being planned by Arab terrorist cells located in the United States. The warnings were the result of the Israeli Groups’ surveillance of the future hijackers in this country.  4. The Mossad warnings were too vague and too late to have enabled the United States to take any action to prevent the imminent attacks at unspecified locations in 1 Capitalized terms used initially in this memorandum without definition have the respective meanings later specified. 2 As shown in this memorandum, the evidence establishing this fact appears to be conclusive. 3"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the U.S., or to detain the individuals who were planning them. 5. Why the Israeli government decided not to share with us all the critical information they had, and the extent of that information, is a subject for the public inquiry. They may have thought some sort of warning prudent in the event their surveillance activities later became a matter of public knowledge. But any energetic Israeli effort to assist the United States in preventing the attacks would not have served their strategic interest, in view of the disastrous effect those attacks were likely to have on the relationships between the United States and the Arab world. As a leader of the Israeli New Jersey Group said when he was arrested on the afternoon of September 11, “We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems.” 6. Whether and to what extent the CIA, though surely not aware of the plans of the future hijackers before the attacks, might have been aware of or condoned the Israeli Groups’ surveillance of Arab groups generally in the United States prior to September 11 is a further question that must be explored in the course of the public inquiry. The CIA’s explanation of why two future hijackers were placed on a Watchlist in August 2001, as set forth in the Commission’s Final Report, is implausible and may have been designed to conceal the Israeli warnings. This consideration, along with other important factors discussed below, opens the door to a thorough investigation of this issue as well. 2. Imperatives and Priorities It need hardly be observed that the demands of justice and national security, and the rights of the victims and their survivors, require that our first imperative, as a nation, be to find and bring to justice Osama bin Laden and his coadjutors, as well as other members of al Qaeda, and all others who bear responsibility for the horrendous loss of life on that terrible September day. That work is of course the charge of our political, 4"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"intelligence, defense, military and defense establishments and our judiciary. The Commission’s task is a collateral and subordinate one--to investigate the circumstances surrounding and our preparedness for the September 11 attacks, in the hope that we can prevent one from ever happening again. This is the charge of the Committees as well. This memorandum, therefore, while it naturally stresses, for the benefit of the Commission and the Committees, the present issues relating to surveillance and disclosure, before and at about the time of the attacks, should not be mistaken as any effort to place the blame for the cause of our suffering on anyone but al Qaeda and its members, or to weaken the resolve of our country in finding, capturing and punishing those who have brought so much misery to so many of us. 3. The DEA Report In June 2001, the Office of Security of the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) issued a long report (the “DEA Report”) describing in precise detail the attempts of approximately 125 or more nationals of a foreign country, most posing as art students, “to penetrate several DEA Field Offices in the continental United States.” Many of these individuals also visited the residences of numerous DEA officials and “other agencies’ facilities and the residences of their employees.” The DEA Report states that “these incidents have occurred since at least the beginning of 2000, and have continued to the 5"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"present.” They were ongoing activities in the summer of 2001. A copy of the DEA Report is attached as Exhibit A. 4. The Israeli DEA Groups Virtually all of the scores of individuals questioned or detained by the DEA and other federal and local law enforcement authorities were citizens of the State of Israel. They were generally organized in groups of eight to 10 people, with a single team leader (the “Israeli DEA Groups”). They usually worked, individually or in pairs, carrying makeshift art portfolios. They visited scores of DEA offices, laboratories and houses or apartments, ostensibly to offer or show the paintings or prints in the portfolios for sale or promotion to DEA personnel. a. Backgrounds in Intelligence, Electronic Intercept And Communications Units___________________ While Israel has compulsory military service, many of those questioned by U.S. authorities had served in the military intelligence services or in electronic or communications units of the Israeli army. Thus, for example, Lior Baram 3 of Plantation (near Hollywood), Florida, questioned by the DEA on January 22, 2001, had served two years in Israeli intelligence working with classified information; Dilka Borenstein, 4 questioned by INS at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (“DFW Airport”) on March 27, 2001, was a “recently discharged” military  3 DEA Report, paragraph 69, p. 20; paragraph 5, p. 48.

The DEA’s Office of Security concluded that the Israelis “may well be engaged in organized intelligence gathering.” 7 A spokesman for the Immigration & Naturalization Service (the “INS”) stated that dozens of these Israelis were expelled from the United States (from California, the Midwest, Florida and other states). “No one has tallied the total,” he said. 8 The expulsions were usually for visa violations. The leaders of the Israeli DEA Groups included Itay Simon (arrested on April 14, 2001 in Irving, Texas), recently discharged from the Israeli army where he had done classified work for the Israeli military. 9 Mr. Simon coordinated recruiting for the groups and served as an intermediary between five individuals in Israel and the U.S. operation. 10 Another leader was Michael Calmanovic (also arrested in Irving on that day), who rented a number  5 DEA Report, paragraph 53-56, pp. 16-17; paragraph 120, p. 57. 6 Ibid.

A third principal was Hanan Serfaty (or Sarfati), a team leader residing in Hollywood, Florida. When questioned by the DEA in Tampa, Florida, on March 1, 2001, he had in his possession bank deposit slips amounting to more than $100,000 from December 2000 through the first quarter of 2001, and withdrawal slips for slightly less than that amount during the period. Mr. Serfaty served in the Israeli military between the ages of 18 and 21, but refused to disclose to the DEA his activities between the ages of 21 and 24, including his activities since his U.S. arrival at age 23 in 2000. 14 Another was Peer Segalovitz of Tamarac, Florida (about 20 miles west of Hollywood—see MAP 1), an active officer in an Israeli special forces battalion who commanded 80 men in the Golan Heights. He was detained in Orlando on May 3, 2001. 15  11 DEA Report, paragraph 49, p 12; paragraph 106, p. 56. 12 DEA Report, paragraph 50, Pages 14-15.

Connections to Israeli Wiretapping and Telecommunications Companies__________ Tomer Ben Dor (mentioned above), another Israeli of interest to the DEA, was an employee of Nice-Systems Ltd., an Israeli company specializing in systems and solutions for detecting, locating, monitoring, evaluating and analyzing voice communications and other transmissions from a variety of sources--activities commonly known as wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping. Nice-Systems’ U.S. subsidiary, Nice Systems Inc., is located in Rutherford, New Jersey 16 , adjacent to East Rutherford where five members of the Israeli New Jersey group were arrested on September 11. When Mr. Ben Dor was interrogated by the INS at the DFW Airport in May 2001, an inspection of his bags revealed a printout containing a reference to a file entitled “DEA Groups.” 17  One member of the Israeli DEA Groups, Michal Gal, who was arrested in Irving, Texas, 18 was released on a $10,000 cash bond posted by Ophir Baer, an employee of Amdocs, Inc. an Israeli telecommunications firm with operations in the United States. The Amdocs employee described Mr. Gal as a “relative”. Messrs.

Israeli Surveillance of U.S. Government Offices, Laboratories and Residences and Other Strategic Areas During the first five months of 2001 (and including a few calls in 2000), the Israeli DEA Groups went to a total of about 57 DEA locations (28 offices and 29 residences), primarily in the southern United States 21 , ostensibly offering to sell or solicit an interest in paintings. These included 25 DEA offices and three laboratories: the DEA’s Southwest Laboratory near San Diego (and the residence of its Director), 22 the DEA’s Southeast Laboratory in Miami (and the residences of three of its chemists), 23 and the DEA’S South Central Laboratory (or property adjacent to it), as well as the residences of one of its chemists and another employee. 24 One Israeli asked to visit the house of a DEA employee “to match the frame to his furnishing,” an offer the employee declined. Members of the Israeli DEA Groups were also discovered taking photographs of a DEA office building and  19 DEA Report, paragraph 50, p. 14. 20 Un Réseau d’Espionnage Israélien a été Démantelé aux Etats-Unis, by Sylvain Cypel, Le Monde, March 2, 2002. 21 The DEA facilities and residences were located in 15 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia, and in Washington, D.C. 22 DEA Report, paragraphs 153-54, p. 41. 23 DEA Report, paragraphs 160-64, pages 42-43. 24 DEA Report, paragraphs 165-67, 169, pages 44-45. 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"parking lot in Orlando, Florida, 25 and on an active runway of the Volk Field Air National Guard Base at Camp Douglas, Wisconsin. 26 An Air Force alert was issued from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City concerning possible Israeli intelligence gathering at the base. 27 Israeli personnel were also found taking a photograph of the house of a special agent of the Environmental Protection Agency in Denver, Colorado, 28 and “diagramming” the inside of an office building of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Lexington, Kentucky. 29 d. Spying on the United States The Israeli DEA Groups were clearly spying on the Drug Enforcement Agency, and thus upon the United States. Many individuals in the DEA Groups may have been trying to do no more than sell paintings (albeit in violation of their visa status and thus unlawfully), but the total number of visits to DEA offices, laboratories and residences precludes any characterization of these efforts as a commonplace sales endeavor. 30 The DEA Report  25 DEA Report, paragraph 95, p. 28. 26 DEA Report, paragraph 178, p. 47. 27 DEA Report, paragraph 175, p. 46. 28 DEA Report, paragraph 172, p. 46. 29 DEA Report, paragraph 71, p. 21. 30 I do recall that a student (though in fact, none of the Israelis was a student, as established in the DEA Report) can make a good deal of money selling things on foot. During the summer following my sophomore year at Yale I sold encyclopedias door to door with Maynard Jackson, who drove the “van” in our operation, his black Pontiac convertible. Maynard was at B.U. Law School at the time. Each day I spoke to about 30 people at their doors and managed to make all or part of a sales presentation to about four families. So during the period (about 65 working days over a total of 10 weeks) I spoke to about 1,950 people at the door, made a presentation to about 260 families, and sold 25 to 30 sets.

The bulk of it records the activities of the Israeli DEA Groups when they call upon or attempt to infiltrate DEA offices, laboratories or residences. The DEA did not generally seek them out, keep them under surveillance, or otherwise try to find out what they were doing, other than making calls on and photographing or diagramming the facilities of the DEA and other governmental agencies. When the DEA Report was prepared, however, the DEA and the INS were of course unaware of the extensive activities and operations in the United States of the future September 11 hijackers and their suspected collaborators, whom the Israeli DEA Groups appear to have had in their sites as well. Why the Israeli DEA Groups would be engaged in both activities, where their spying on the DEA would clearly raise suspicions among U.S. law enforcement authorities, is unclear. It may well have been an effective distraction of others from or “cover” for their primary objective. This question is discussed further below at p. 43. official.

Israeli Surveillance of Arab Groups, the Future Hijackers and FBI Suspects_____________________ Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks, commonly known as Mossad, is the Israeli agency responsible for its external security. A few days after September 11, Israeli intelligence officials reported that two senior experts of Mossad had warned the United States in August 2001 that large-scale terrorist attacks on the U.S. mainland were imminent. They also informed U.S. officials of the existence of a cell of as many as 200 terrorists preparing the operation. 33 One highly placed investigator stated later that fall that there was evidence linking the Israeli DEA Groups to the gathering of intelligence about the September 11 attacks. He refused to disclose the evidence, however, since it was classified. A highly regarded American journal that broadly covers Israeli affairs reported in December 2001 that the Israeli DEA Groups were spying on Islamic networks in the United States linked to Middle East Terrorism. 34  There was no implication in these reports that the Israelis were involved in planning for or carrying out the September 11 attacks. Rather, it was suspected that the Israelis gathered advance information about the attacks and decided not to share it. “What investigators are saying is that that warning from Mossad was nonspecific 33 The October 3, 2001 FBI Suspect List (the “October 2001 FBI Suspect List” (Exhibit C), contains the names of about 350 suspects. 34 For a fuller account and analysis of these reports, see p. 32. 13"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"and general.” 35 f. Hollywood, Florida: The Operating Base of the Israeli DEA Groups____________________________ The locus of the most important operations of the Israeli DEA Groups was the area in and around Hollywood, Florida: “The majority of the incidents have occurred in the southern half of the continental U.S. with the most activity reported in the state of Florida. . . . Hollywood . . . seems to be a central point for these individuals with several having addresses in this area .” 36 [Emphasis supplied.] At the very time the DEA was setting down these words, in June 2001, just two or three months before the September 11 hijackings, 15 of the 19 future hijackers were also living in Hollywood, nine in the town itself and six in surrounding towns (see Exhibit B and MAPS 1 and 2). Hollywood, for months, had been and would continue to be the staging ground for the hijacking of the World Trade Center Planes and the Pennsylvania Plane. Among the Israeli groups, more than 30 lived in the Hollywood area, 10 in Hollywood itself. They were not only spying on the DEA but, in all likelihood, were keeping the future hijackers under surveillance as well. This appears to be the tragic riddle the DEA, unaware of the future hijackers’ existence, was unable to solve.

All of them attended flight school in Venice, Florida, not far from Fort Myers where the Hollywood Israeli DEA Groups were later found operating. Although the Israeli DEA Groups were questioned in Fort Myers by DEA agents a few months after the hijackers had left for Hollywood, 47 the reactive nature of the DEA Report makes it difficult to track the timing of the Israeli Groups’ movements except when they were spying on the DEA or to the extent they disclosed their movements, as they sometimes did, to DEA or INS agents or other law enforcement authorities. 48 Atta and al Shehhi were in the Hollywood area by the end of December 2000, when they took flight training courses in Opa-Locka, about 15 miles southwest of Hollywood. 49 Ziad Jarrah took flight training courses the  45 Boston Globe, September 15, 2001. 46 REPORT OF THE JOINT INQUIRY INTO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 –BY THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AND THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, S.

In a scene reminiscent of the keystone cops, and under clandestine DEA and INS surveillance, they tried to avoid being detected as a group and followed. The three arriving Israelis were Yoni Engel, Yotam Dagai and Or Alroei. Alroei was an associate of Michael Calmanovic. Engel was a former Israeli company commander.

A highly placed investigator said there are ‘tie-ins.’ But when asked for details, he flatly refused to describe them, saying ‘evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It’s classified information.’” 74 The Forward , the highly respected American journal, at first discounted Fox’s account, 75 but in an article three months later reported that— “[F]ar from pointing to Israeli spying against U.S. government and military facilities . . . the incidents in question [the activities of the Israeli  70 DEA Report, paragraph 2, p. 3; paragraph 125, pp. 35-6; paragraph 132, p. 37.

Inadequate Israeli Warnings in August 2001  As noted above, almost immediately after September 11, reports emerged of Israeli warnings, in August, that major terrorist attacks were imminent.

The FBI was also under pressure from U.S. political figures to release the members of the Israeli New Jersey Group, including Richard Armitage of the State Department and two New York Congressmen .

These Statements and Reports do, however, defer to our intelligence community’s desire to safeguard and maintain the secrecy of its “sources and methods”. These are likely to have included Israeli warnings and the Israelis’ own sources. But in view of the dramatic questions raised by the Israeli Groups’ activities in the United States in the months leading up to September 11, these sources and methods now need to be disclosed. As shown in the tabular comparison in Exhibit E, the accounts of Mossad’s warnings in August bear the unmistakable imprints of authenticity.

Mossad also alone warned of “suspected Iraqi involvement,” though this of course has never been established and is generally considered to be untrue.  That we did receive warnings of this general nature from Mossad seems more than likely. But the real issue, again, is, given the extensive surveillance by the Israeli Groups of U.S. Arab groups and, in all likelihood, of the future hijackers in their central bases of operation and elsewhere in the United States, were not the Israeli Groups, or some of their members, aware of what was going to happen in advance? Is this not dramatically shown by the behavior of the Israeli New Jersey Group the morning of September 11? And if so, did the Israeli government decide not to provide us with enough information to stop them? As noted in the next section, the Israelis may have given us warning in late August 2001 of the presence in the United States of Khaled al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi, resulting in the CIA’s having them placed on the State Department’s Tipoff Watchlist. 105 Or this may have been part of the Israeli warnings earlier in August.

How clear are investigators that some Israeli agents may have known something?” “It’s very explosive information, obviously, and there’s a great deal of evidence that they say they have collected none of it necessarily conclusive.

The Watchlisting of Khaled al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi in August 2001 _______________________  There was yet another press report of Mossad warnings in August 2001, which appeared in Die Zeit in October 2002. The report stated that the names of Mihdhar 106 Hijacker Timeline, pp. 38-9. 107 Transcript of dialogue between Brit Hume and Carl Cameron, Fox Television News, December 12, 2002. 36"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"and Hazmi were given to the CIA by Mossad on August 23, resulting in their Watchlisting on August 24. 108 Although the report is based upon unspecified “documents obtained by Die Zeit”, it is interesting given the contemporaneous (just after September 11) and credible reports of August Mossad warnings cited above. Collectively the reported warnings appear to offer the most likely reason for the Watchlisting of these two future hijackers in August 2001. The Commission and its Staff, however, make no mention of any Israeli warnings, and take the position, undoubtedly adopting the CIA’s public stance, that it was solely a series of reviews beginning in May 2001 that led to the Watchlisting. But as we shall see, this account is both difficult to follow and hard to believe. In any event it shows that no real action was taken to Watchlist Mihdhar or Hazmi until late August, after the Israeli warnings appear to have been received. The issue is important because any downplaying of Israeli warnings, whether done in order to conceal their or our “sources and methods” or for other reasons, draws attention away from the major question of the adequacy of the Mossad warnings and the surveillance role the Israeli Groups played in the United States in the months leading up to September 11. I shall try to restate the Commission’s and its Staff’s (and the CIA’s official) explanation of the Watchlisting here.  108 Deadly Mistakes by Oliver Schrömm, Die Zeit , October 1, 2002. 37"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"a. “John”, “Mary”, “Jane” and “Alice” In the spring of 2001 there were reported threats of terrorist attacks on U.S. interests abroad as noted more particularly in the first column of Exhibit E. According to the Commission’s Staff, in May of that year, a CIA officer called only “John” (to protect his identity) in Staff Statement No. 10 and in the Commission’s Final Report “wondered where the attacks might occur.” 109 John’s spontaneous interest was said to have been prompted by his recollection that Mihdhar and Hazmi had been present at a Kuala Lumpur meeting in January 2000. It was suspected the attack on the U.S. vessel Cole in October 2000 had been planned at that meeting. So in the month of May 2001, the story continues, John and a woman at the CIA (whom we shall call “Alice” here), reviewed the CIA’s cable traffic concerning the Kuala Lumpur meeting. Alice reportedly discovered that the CIA had learned, in March 2000 (though they had never shared this information with the FBI), that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa and that Hazmi had come to Los Angeles shortly after the Kuala Lumpur meeting. John did nothing at all, however. Two months later, at a time when the focus was still on threats to U.S. interests outside the United States) 110 in late July or some time in August, John asked  109 Commission Staff Statement No. 10, p. 7; Commission Final Report, p. 267. 110 Commission Staff Statement No. 10, at p. 4: “On July 2 [,2001] the FBI Counterterrorism Division sent a message to federal agencies and state and local law enforcement agencies that . . . stated, ‘the FBI 38"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"“Mary”, an FBI agent detailed to the CIA, to review the cable traffic one more time. It is unclear what inspired John to resume that work. He is said to have recalled or discovered that Khallad, a dangerous al Qaeda operative, had been identified as one of those who attended the Kuala Lumpur meeting. But John was not particularly concerned, and told Mary to do the work in her spare time. 111 On August 21, 2001, Mary is said to have discovered a bit more than Alice supposedly had in May: Hazmi had come to Los Angeles, as was known, but Mihdhar had used his visa to come as well, along with Hazmi, in January 2000. Working with Jane, an FBI agent assigned to the CIA, Mary also discovered that Mihdhar had left the United States later in 2000, but had just returned, on July 4, 2001. Because of Mary’s discoveries, Mihdhar and Hazmi were placed on the Watchlist. b. The Uncertain, Untranslated, Unwitnessed, Unremembered and Erroneous Identification of Khallad_______________   As the Commission’s Staff has said of this route to the Watchlist, “the details are complex.” 112 They are has no information indicating a credible threat of terrorist attack in the United States.’” 111 The Commission’s Staff and its Final Report say only that John spontaneously asked Mary to pick up Alice’s work in late July. But it was not until late August, at about the time of the reported Mossad warnings, that Mary supposedly discovered on her own that Mihdhar was in the United States. Staff Statement No. 10, p. 8; Commission Final Report, p. 270. The Joint Committee Report (p. 151) states that John’s interest was rekindled in July by his discovery of a cable indicating that Khallad had been present at the Kuala Lumpur meeting, but neither the Commission’s Staff nor its Final Report mentions such a cable. The discovery of the cable apparently prompted John to call Khallad a “major league killer” though the Commission (p. 268) suggests that this remark exhibited John’s concerns in May. Whatever John wrote, he wasn’t worried in July, as shown by what he is said to have told Mary. 112 Staff Statement No. 10, p. 5. 39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"also serendipitous to the point of undermining their credibility. In the first place, John is said to have recalled or discovered that Khallad had been identified from a photograph in January 2001, by a joint FBI/CIA source, as an attendee of the Kuala Lumpur meeting in January 2000. The FBI agent said to have been present at the January 2001 meeting, however, was unaware, apparently because of language problems, that any such identification had ever been made. 113 Moreover, “the CIA officer [ himself --who supposedly conducted the interview] does not recall this particular identification [at all] and thus cannot say why it was not shared with his FBI colleague.” 114 As we have seen, Alice, who was said to have “reviewed the cables” in 113 Commission Staff Statement No. 10, p. 6: “This is an example of how day-to-day gaps in information sharing can emerge even in a situation of goodwill on all sides. The information was from a joint FBI/CIA source. The source spoke essentially no English. The FBI person on the scene overseas [i.e., the agent who is said to have attended the meeting] did not speak the languages the source spoke. Due to travel and security issues, the amount of time spent with the source was necessarily kept short. As a result, the CIA officer usually did not simultaneously translate either the questions or the answers for his accompanying FBI colleague, and friend.” 114 Commission Staff Statement No. 10, p. 7; Commission Final Report, p. 267. The Commission itself in its Final Report, almost hilariously (because it does not explain why the CIA agent had no recollection of this event), has added to the speculative litany of reasons why the FBI agent did not recall any identification of Khallad. “The FBI agent also may have been absent from the room when the identification was made. The source had brought a sheaf of documents with him that the FBI agent left the room to copy while the interview of the witness continued. Because of the circumstances of the interview site, the agent would have been absent for a significant period of time. In addition, the case officer was frequently given photographs from a broad range of CIA stations to show to this particular witness. He did not focus on the purpose of showing the photographs; he was only concerned with whether the source recognized the individuals.” Commission Final Report, p. 537, n. 62. The CIA officer who also has no recollection of any identification of Khallad, is, of course, said ( a ) to have spoken the source’s language, ( b ) not to have left the room, and ( c ) to have known why he was seeking the identification 40"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"May, “took no action regarding these cables.” Neither did John. Indeed, the Commission’s Staff noted that Alice “cannot [even] recall this work.” 115 The Commission deleted the words regarding Alice’s loss of memory from its Final Report without explanation. 116 This untranslated, unwitnessed and forgotten identification that so inspired John to return later in the summer to the work forgotten by Alice seems to have been just as elusive. The joint source had been said in (someone’s) report to be less than certain (or “ninety percent certain”) 117 that the man in the photograph shown him was Khallad. And indeed, although both the Commission’s Final Report and its Staff Statements fail to tell us so, the purported identification itself later proved to be false. The man was not Khallad. 118 So Khallad had not been identified, and until after September 11 his everyday appearance remained as much a mystery as the purported meeting with the joint source that supposedly so inspired John on his way to the Watchlist before the Mossad warnings in August.  115 Ibid. Perhaps to bolster the hapless Alice, the Commission’s Final Report gives a name to another agent, “Dave”, who was mentioned but unnamed in Staff Statement No. 10. Dave seems to have done little more than try to find out whether another Cole suspect, Fahd al Quso, attended the Kuala Lumpur meeting. 116 Compare Staff Statement No. 10, p. 7, third full paragraph, lines 1 and 2, with Commission Final Report, p. 267, last line. 117 Commission Staff Statement No. 10, p. 6; Commission Final Report, p. 266. 118 Joint Committee Report, p. 154: “In the days following the September 11 attacks [t]he Bureau . . . learned that the January 2001 photo identification of Khallad by the joint FBI/CIA asset had been mistaken.

As noted above, they were then safely secluded and never found. d. William (of Ockham) John, Mary, Jane and Alice may all have been hard at work in Washington, and made a contribution, 119 but Occam’s razor 120 leads us a far straighter course to the Watchlist by way of the Mossad warnings in August, the likely result of the surveillance activities of the Israeli Groups and their (inadequate) warnings. Both Mihdhar and Hazmi, hijackers of the Pentagon Plane and leaders of the entire hijacker group, would easily have fallen under the surveillance of the Israeli New Jersey Group in Hudson and Bergen Counties, and of the Israeli DEA Groups in San Diego and (in the case of Hazmi) in the Hollywood area and possibly in Oklahoma. And it was only after the Mossad warnings were received that the CIA, finally, on August 27, 2001, told the FBI that Mihdhar and Hazmi were in the United States. 121  119 For example, both Khallad (under an alias—though he was presumably already Watchlisted) and another attendee at Kuala Lumpur were also Watchlisted on August 24.

Why the Israeli Groups? It is not necessary at this early stage of inquiry into these events to speculate on the original rationale for the U.S. activities of the two Israeli Groups. A study of that question will best be undertaken in the course of the public inquiry. But a few thoughts may lend some perspective to the question. It may be that originally the Israeli DEA Groups did little more than sell art (though illegally and in violation of their visas). Once the need or usefulness of keeping Arab groups under surveillance in the United States became apparent to the Israeli government, it may have viewed these art salesmen and their vans as ideal groups and vehicles into which to insert sophisticated agents with telecommunications, wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping equipment and intelligence expertise.  The vans in the operations of both Israeli Groups 122 were able to move about neighborhoods without raising undue concern. The “art students” in the Israeli DEA Groups were using their vans as sometime door-to-door salesmen. The personnel of Urban Moving Systems, the Mossad front, were ostensibly driving about northeastern New Jersey towns in their van (or vans) to help people move—a familiar suburban sight. 122 Only one van, that stopped on September 11, has been identified as used by the Israeli New Jersey Group. We do not yet know ( a ) whether Urban Moving Systems had a number of vans, ( b ) how many of its employees worked in vans beyond the five arrested on September 11, or ( c ) whether any of its employees fled to Israel along with Dominik Suter. 43"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" With ample room for personnel and electronic equipment, the vans were ideal vehicles for electronic eavesdropping. 123 The extent to which Nice Systems, the Israeli wiretapping company for which Tomer Ben Dor worked (the Israeli with the reference to “DEA Groups” in his computer files) will be a matter for the public inquiry. Nice Systems was ideally suited to provide equipment and expertise to the Israeli New Jersey Group because its U.S. headquarters were located in Rutherford, New Jersey, near the center of the Group’s operations (MAP 3).  The future hijackers were frequent users of land lines and cell telephones and thus were ideal subjects for electronic surveillance. Mihdhar regularly telephoned a terrorist facility in the Middle East from the United States. 124 Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were “constantly on their cell phones.” 125 Mohamed Atta made calls to Madrid from Coral Springs 126 and used his cell phone to call lodging establishments in Florida. 127 Ramzi Binalshibh, a plot leader based in Hamburg, frequently called Atta, 128 Shehhi 129 and Moussaoui 130 from Hamburg. Jarrah made hundreds of phone calls from Florida 131 and Hanjour, Hazmi and other hijackers made 75 calls in two days 132 to locate apartments, 123 As we have seen, both Israeli Groups used Chevrolet vans. The Israeli DEA Groups’ vans (to the extent identified) also included a GMC Safari van, a GMC full-size custom van, a Ford van, a Dodge mini-van, and unspecified panel vans.

As to the Israeli DEA Groups’ surveillance of the DEA, it is difficult if not impossible to learn from the public record, at this time, the precise nature of the information they were seeking from that agency. The DEA itself was not sure then, and it may not know to this day. The DEA had its own concerns about the Israeli DEA Groups relating to previous drug investigations, as noted above. Perhaps these concerns were well-founded. Perhaps the Israelis were using these units in part as a training ground (on our soil) for future agents, or were interested in learning the DEA’s methods for tracking drug traffickers and their money, a potential source of funding for terrorist groups. But in all likelihood the selling of art and (though far riskier) the DEA spying were covers for their more important work of keeping Arab groups under surveillance in the United States. This activity appears ultimately to have led the Israelis to the future hijackers, and forced upon them unwelcome decisions as to how much, and when, they should tell the United States of what they had learned. 11. The CIA’s Role and Responsibilities Finally, it is possible that the CIA was aware that the two Israeli Groups were tracking suspected Arab groups on our soil, but remained unaware until after September 11 that they had come across the future 45"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"hijackers. There is presently little evidence of the CIA’s possible knowledge of the Israeli Groups’ activities, beyond the sheer scope and magnitude of the Israeli DEA Groups’ operations in the U.S., the CIA’s general unwillingness to share information with the FBI, as outlined in the Commission’s Final Report, and, perhaps, the brazenness of the Israeli New Jersey Group on September 11. The CIA’s clumsy reconstruction of the miraculous work of “John”, “Mary”, “Jane” and “Alice”, which appears designed to point away from the Israeli warnings, also raises legitimate questions. The CIA was prohibited by law from engaging in field intelligence operations inside the United States. They may have been reluctant to cooperate with the FBI because of the burdensome constraints of constitutional protections benefiting potential defendants. They may also have regarded the Israelis as unusually effective because of their familiarity with Arab culture and their common understanding of the Arabic language. 133 A leading Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth , reported in the fall of 2002 that prior to the September 11 attacks, when members of the Israeli DEA Groups were being detained or arrested across the United States, the CIA  133 See the Joint Committee Report, p. xvii: “At home, the counterterrorism effort suffered from the lack of an effective domestic intelligence capability. The FBI was unable to identify and monitor effectively the extent of activity by al Qaeda and other international terrorist groups operating in the United States. . . . These problems greatly exacerbated the nation’s vulnerability to an increasingly dangerous and immediate international terrorist threat inside the United States.” 46"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"“actively promoted their expulsion.” 134 The implication in that article was that the CIA was simply being careless, not trying to spirit the Israelis safely out of the country. But at this point we cannot be certain. The CIA may have been eager to protect the surveillance activities of the Israeli Groups a whole in an operation that, ultimately, failed to protect us. Any delegation on the part of the CIA of its responsibilities abroad to foreign agents in the U.S. would, of course, have been unlawful. It would also have rendered our country particularly vulnerable because, as suggested above, the interests of the Israeli government and its agents are not necessarily consonant with our own. The CIA also failed to press for the continuing detention of the members of the Israeli New Jersey Group after their arrest on September 11. After three months the men were released and returned to Israel, even though their names had appeared in our own counter-intelligence data base, at least two of them were suspected Mossad agents, and their leader had fled to Israel on or about September 14—only to be placed on the May 2002 FBI Suspect List a few months later. The CIA is mentioned but once in the DEA Report, in connection with the Israeli DEA Groups’ effort to penetrate the DEA’s Southwest Laboratory near San Diego,  134 Mark Lefet in Yedioth Ahronoth , October 2, 2002, commenting on the October 1, 2002 Die Zeit article referred to in note 108.

It is clear that the DEA Report was itself inspired by the DEA’s own bewilderment by the very existence of the Israeli DEA Groups, by the scope of their operations throughout much of our country, by their overwhelming numbers, and by their expertise. The Forward article cited above states that the operations of the Israeli Groups heightened tensions between Washington and Israel— “not because of the operations’ [Arab] targets but because Israel reportedly violated a secret gentlemen’s agreement between the two countries under which espionage on each other’s soil is to be coordinated in advance.” 136 The real question today, however, appears to be whether the “gentlemen’s agreement” did indeed prevail here and, because we lacked adequate warning from our surrogates who were keeping the Arabs under surveillance, helped bring us to disaster.

Detailed Summary Set forth below is a detailed summary of the tentative conclusions reached in this memorandum, which amply illustrate the urgent need for a public inquiry into the activities of the Israeli DEA Groups and the Israeli New Jersey Group. The inquiry must include, without limitation, the examination of members of the Israel Groups and related persons; officials of the Israeli government and certain of its agencies, including Mossad; FBI suspects, agents of the DEA, the INS and the FBI; certain local law enforcement officials; agents of the CIA ( in camera to the extent required); other intelligence sources cited by the public press to the extent possible; the boxes of documents and computer hard drives (referred on page 29) seized by the FBI from the Israeli New Jersey Group; and of all other relevant documents, reports, communiqués and information.-- 1. The Israeli DEA Groups were spying on the Drug Enforcement Agency and thus upon the United States. The DEA itself has concluded that they were probably engaged in organized intelligence gathering on our soil. 49"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"2. A highly regarded American journal knowledgeable about Israeli affairs, has concluded ( a ) based on its own sources, that the Israeli DEA Groups were spying on radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle East terrorism, and ( b ) based on the representations of a former American intelligence official regularly briefed on these matters by law enforcement officials, that ( i ) at least two members of the Israeli New Jersey Group were Mossad operatives, ( ii ) Urban Moving, the company used by the Israeli New Jersey Group, was a front for Mossad and its operatives, and ( iii ) the Israeli New Jersey Group was spying on local Arabs. 3. The intelligence sources of a substantial American television network report that the Israeli DEA Groups may have gathered information about the September 11 attacks in advance, and not shared it with the United States. One investigator said that evidence linking the Israeli DEA Groups to such intelligence gathering was classified and could not be disclosed. 4. The Israeli DEA Groups were comprised of 125 or more Israelis operating on our soil. Their leaders and apparent associates included military commanders and experts with military backgrounds in intelligence, electronic intercepts and telecommunications. 5. The wiretapping and intelligence expertise of members of both Israeli Groups, and the use of vans in local neighborhoods where the future hijackers were planning the attacks, and the extensive use by the hijackers of cell phones and land lines, made the Israeli Groups ideally suited to gather information regarding the hijackers’ plans. 6. The principal operation of the Israeli DEA Groups was located in and around Hollywood, Florida, the central training and staging ground for the hijacking of North and South Tower Planes and the Pennsylvania Plane. The addresses and places of residence of the members of the Israeli DEA 50"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Groups in Hollywood itself were within hundreds of yards those of the future hijackers. 7. The operations of both the Israeli New Jersey Group and the hijackers of the Pentagon Plane were centered in Hudson and Bergen Counties in New Jersey, within a common radius of about six miles. 8. All five celebrating members of the Israeli New Jersey Group arrested on September 11 were aware, when the North Tower Plane struck the World Trade Center, based on their immediate reaction to the attack and the information said to be contained in their van, that the attack had been planned and carried out by Arab terrorists. 9. After being questioned by the FBI on September 11, the leader of the Israeli New Jersey Group immediately fled the United States to Israel. His name and aliases appear, along with those of the hijackers and other FBI suspects, on the May 2002 FBI Suspect list. 10. Israeli intelligence officials have reported that two senior officials of Mossad warned the United States in August 2001 that as many as 200 terrorists on American soil were planning an imminent large-scale attack on high visibility targets on the American mainland. One press report states that in August Mossad provided the CIA with the names of future hijackers Khaled al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi. 11. The CIA’s explanation of how Mihdhar’s and Hazmi’s names were placed on the Watchlist through the spontaneous efforts of CIA and FBI agents is not only difficult to follow but, as the sole reason for the Watchlisting, hardly credible. 12. Mossad’s own information appears to have come from its sources inside the United States. All of the facts and circumstances set forth in this memorandum appear to show that Mossad’s two likely sources of information were: ( a ) the Israeli DEA Groups, comparable in number to that 51"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"of the Arab suspects and who appear to have tracked the future hijackers in their central places of operation and in other states, and ( b ) the Israeli New Jersey Group, operating through their Mossad front in another principal locus of operations of the future hijackers, two of whom were Mossad agents, and five of whom appeared immediately aware of the origin of the attacks on September 11. 13. While little direct evidence supports the contention that the CIA was aware of or condoned the Israeli Groups’ tracking of Arab terrorist groups in the United States prior to September 11, the CIA’s pressing for the expulsion of members of the Israeli DEA Groups when they were detained before September 11, their failure to cooperate with the FBI, their circuitous explanation of how the above two hijackers were placed on the Watchlist, and other relevant considerations require that the issue be taken up as a part of the public inquiry into these painful events.

Additiona lly, there have been reports of Israeli art studen ts visiting the homes of numerous DEA employees. These incidents have occurred since at least the beginning of 2000, and ha ve continued to the present. The number of reported incident s increased in Nove mber/December 2000, and has continued to date. These incidents have involved several other law enforcement and Department of Defense agencies, with contacts made at other agencies' facilities and the residences of their employees. Geographica lly, these incidents are very widespread, ranging from California to Florida. The major ity of the incidents have occurred in the southern half of the continental U.S. with the most activity reported in the state of Florida. Since April 2001, the number of re ported incidents has d eclined, however, the geographic spread of the incidents has in creased to Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Los Angeles. The activities of these Israeli art students raised the suspicion of IS and other field offices when attempts were made to circumvent th e access control systems at DEA offices, and when these individuals began to solicit their paintings at the homes of DEA employees. The nature of the individuals' conduct, combined with intelligence information and historical information regarding past incide nts involving Israeli Organized Crime, leads IS to believe the incidents may well be an organized intelligence gathering activity. It is believed by IS that these inci dents should not be the basis for any immediate concern for the safety and security of DEA personnel, however, employees should continue to exercise due caution in safeguarding inform ation relating to DEA investigations, or activities.
