Foreword D uring the course of this century, our world has endured two wars, each of a scale more devastating than any before. Since the formal end of hostilities and the founding of a new world order based on the monetary arrangement drafted at Bretton Woods by American and British negotiators in 1944, the world has experienced new forms of almost continuous wars, conflicts constrained only by the realities of the nuclear age, though conflicts in human cost far more devasta- ting than the century's two world wars. On January 16,1991 began the most awesome deployment of military firepower in the history of air warfare. The nominal target of the hundreds of advanced aircraft carrying an estimated half million tons of bombs in the US-led as- sault, was a small nation of some 16 million inhabitants, in land area only slightly larger than the state of California. The decision to preci- pitate full-scale war against Iraq, however, was not rooted in the ag- gressive move by Iraq to take neighboring Kuwait on August 2,1990. Rather, the roots of that Gulf War must be understood in a history re- aching back a full century and more. Today, it is almost difficult to recall the universal burst of optimism which greeted the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. The Bal- kans are once again the center of a cruel and bloody series of wars which are creating tragic unrest across Europe. Western Europe is it- self reeling from economic recession or even depression, from repea- ted attacks on its own currency stability, from new aggressive trade sanctions on agriculture, steel and other export products. The indu- strial investment boom which many had expected with the opening of the east to democracy has yet to be seen. As well, the economies of the United States and most of the English-speaking world are suffe- ring from the deepest economic contraction since the 1930's, with no end in sight. How can it be that such a reversal of prospects has taken place in only three short years? Indeed, there is a single common thread linking today's tragic events in the Arabian Gulf, the unrest in the Balkans and Continental Europe, and the events leading up to the two earlier periods of breakdown and world war in this century. Our story is not the one conventionally presented in most history books. To many it may in fact seem implausible, even fantastic. The invisible thread connecting seemingly disparate events over the past century and more, is the real subject of this text. Our interpretation of the \"facts\" involved in this history is clearly controversial. The reader must judge if we have made our case convincingly. F.

This book is in- tended to shed light on how political and economic power around this raw material, petroleum, has been shaped by interests princi- pally under the control of two governments—England, and later, the United States. Britain, approaching the end of the 1890's, was the pre-eminent political, military, and economic power in the world in all respects. British gold, under the jealous, guarding eye of the Bank of Eng- land, was the basis for the role of the Pound Sterling as the well spring of world credit since 1815. Prussian military superiority was the actual key to the defeat of Napoleon's army at Waterloo. But Wellington and the British took the credit, and with it the lion's share of world gold reserves which subsequently flowed into Lon- don. \"As good as Sterling\" was the truism of that day. After a law of June 22,1816, gold was declared the sole measure of value in the British Empire. Over the next 75 years or more, British foreign pol- icy was increasingly preoccupied with securing for British cof- fers—the vaults of the Bank of England—the newly mined re- serves of world gold, whether in Australia, California or in South Africa. The corollary of this minerals policy was a policy of \"stra- tegic denial\" of those same identified gold reserves to competitor nations whenever possible. After 1815, British naval superiority was unchallenged on the world's seas. British ships carried British steel, coal and exports of 1 - THE THREE PILLARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE  9  the Manchester textile industry. English manufactures had led the world for decades. But behind her apparent status as the world's pre-eminent power, Britain was rotting internally. The more that British mer- chant houses extended credit for world trade, and City of London banks funneled loan capital to build railways in Argentina, the United States and Russia, the more the domestic economic basis of the English nation-state deteriorated. Few understood how ruth- lessly lawful was the connection between the two parallel pro- cesses at the time. Since the 1814-15 Congress of Vienna, which carved up post- Napoleonic Europe, with the diplomatic maneuvering of British Foreign Minister Lord Castlereagh, the British Empire had exacted rights to dominate the seas in return for the self-serving \"conces- sions\" granted to Habsburg Austria and the rest of Continental European powers, which concessions served to keep central Con- tinental Europe divided, and too weak to rival British global ex- pansion. British control of the seas, and, with it control of world shipping trade, was thus to emerge after Waterloo as one of the three pillars of a new British Empire. The manufactures of Continental Europe, as well as much of the rest of the world, were forced to respond to terms of trade set in London, by the Lloyds shipping insurance and banking syndicates. While Her Royal Britannic Majesty's Navy, the world's largest in that day, policed the world's major sea-lanes and provided cost-free \"insurance\" for British merchant shipping vessels, competitor fleets were forced to insure their ships against piracy, catastrophe, and acts of war through London's large Lloyd's insurance syndicate. Credit and bills of exchange out of the banks of the City of Lon- don were necessary for financing most of the world's shipping trade. The private Bank of England, itself the creature of the pre- eminent houses of finance in London's \"City\", as the financial dis- trict is called—houses such as Barings, Hambros, Rothschilds— manipulated the world's largest monetary gold supply in calcu- lated actions which could cause a flood of English exports to be dumped mercilessly onto any competitor market at will. Britain's unquestioned domination of international banking was the sec- ond pillar of English Imperial power following 1815. The third pillar, more and more crucial as the century wore on,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"10 A CENTURY OF WAR was British geo-political domination of the world's major raw materials—cotton, metals, coffee, coal and, by the century's end, the new \"black gold,\" petroleum. 'Free Trade' and the Sinews of British Power In 1820, Britain's Parliament passed a declaration of principle which was to usher in a series of changes which led, as one conse- quence, to the outbreak of World War I and its tragic aftermath al- most a century later. Acting on the urgings of a powerful group of London shipping and banking interests centered around the Bank of England and Alexander Baring of Baring Brothers merchant bankers, Parlia- ment passed a Statement of Principle in support of the concept ad- vocated by Scottish economist Adam Smith several decades ear- lier: so-called \"absolute free trade.\" By 1846, this declaration of principle had become formalized in a Parliamentary repeal of domestic English agriculture protection, the famous Corn Laws. The Corn Laws repeal was based on the calculation of powerful financial and trade interests of the City of London, that their world dominance gave them a decisive advan- tage, which they should push to the hilt. If they dominated world trade, \"free trade\" could only ensure that their dominance would grow at the expense of other less-developed trading nations. Under the hegemony of free trade, British merchant banks reaped enormous profits on the India-Turkey-China opium trade, while the British Foreign Ministry furthered their banking inter- ests by publicly demanding China open its ports to \"free trade,\" during the British Opium Wars. A new weekly propaganda journal of these powerful City of London merchant and finance interests, The Economist, was founded in 1843 with the explicit purpose of agitating for the re- peal of the Corn Laws. The British Tory Party of Sir Robert Peel pushed through the fateful Corn Law Repeal in May 1846, a turning point for the worse not only in British, but in world history. Repeal opened the door to a flood of cheap products in agriculture, which created ruin among not only English but also other nations' farmers. The 1 - THE THREE PILLARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE  11  merchants' simple dictum, \"buy cheap...sell dear,\" was raised to the level of national economic strategy. Consumption was deemed the sole purpose of production. Britain's domestic agriculture and farmers were ruined by the loss of the Corn Laws protectionism. Irish farmers were emiser- ated, as their largest export market suddenly lowered food prices drastically, as a result of Corn Law repeal. The mass starvation and emigration of Irish peasants and their families in the late 1840's— the tragic Irish Potato Famine of 1845-6 and its aftermath—was a direct consequence of this \"free trade\" policy of Britain. England's prior policy toward Ireland prohibited development of a strong self-sufficient manufacture, demanding it remain the economically captive bread basket to supply England's needs. Now that bread basket itself was destroyed in pursuit of the fictional free trade. After 1846, Hindu peasants from Britain's Indian colony, with their dirt poor wage cost,competed against British and Irish farm- ers, for the market of the British \"consumer.\" Wage levels inside Britain began falling with the price of bread. The English Poor Laws granted compensation for workers earning below human subsistence wage, with income supplement payments pegged to the price of a loaf of wheat bread. Thus, as bread prices plunged, so did living standards in England. In effect, repeal of Corn Laws protectionism opened the flood- gates throughout the British Empire to a \"cheap labor policy.\" The only ones to benefit, following an initial surge of cheap food prices in England, were the giant international London trading houses, and the merchant banks which financed them. The class separa- tions of British society were aggravated by a growing separation of a tiny number of very wealthy from the growing masses of very poor, as a lawful consequence of \"free trade.\" 1 . E. Peshine Smith, an American economist and fierce opponent of British free trade, writing at the time, summarized the effect of the British Empire's free trade hegemony over the world economy of the 1850's: \"Such has been the policy which still controls the leg- islation of Great Britain. It has, in practice, regarded the nation col- lectively as a gigantic trader, with the rest of the world, possessing a great stock of goods, not for use, but for sale, endeavouring to produce them cheaply, so that it might undersell rival shopkeep- ers; and looking upon the wages paid to its own people as so much lost to the profits of the establishment.\" 2 ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"12 A CENTURY OF WAR Peshine Smith contrasted this \"nation as giant shopkeeper\" doc- trine of the Britain of Adam Smith and company to the growing national economic thinking emerging on the Continent of Europe in the 1850's, especially under the German Zollverein and other na- tional economic policies of Friedrich List. 3 \"Their policy will be dictated by the instincts of producers, and not that of shopkeepers. They will look to the aggregate of produc- tion, not to the rate of profits in trade, as the test of national pros- perity. Accordingly, the great Continental nations, France, Russia and the German States—united in the Zollverein or Customs Union—have practically repudiated the idea which has so long controlled the commercial policy of England. What England has gained by that policy is thus described by one of her own learned and respected writers, Joseph Kay, who speaks of that nation as the one 'where the aristocracy is richer and more powerful than any other country in the world, the poor are more oppressed, more pauperized, more numerous in comparison to the other classes, more irreligious and very much worse educated than the poor of any other European nation, solely excepting uncivilized Russia and Turkey, enslaved Italy, mis- governed Portugal and revolutionized Spain'.\" 4 So a campaign began to shape ruling English ideology in 1851, using a viciously false Malthusian argument of over-population, rather than admit the reality of a deliberate policy of forced under- investment in new productive technologies. The name given the political doctrine which rationalized the brutal economic policy, was English Liberalism. In essence, English Liberalism, as it was defined towards the end of the 19th century, justified development of an ever more powerful imperial elite class, ruling on behalf of the \"vulgar ignorant masses,\" who could not be entrusted to rule on their own behalf. But the underlying purpose of the liberal elites of 19th century British government and public life was to preserve and serve the interests of an exclusive private power. In the last part of the 19th century, that private power was concentrated in the hands of a tiny number of bankers and institutions of the City of London. Britain's \"Informal Empire\" Such free trade manipulation has been the essence of British 1 - THE THREE PILLARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 13 economic strategy for the past one hundred fifty years. Britain's genius has been a chameleon-like ability to adapt that policy to a shifting international economic reality. But the core policy has re- mained—Adam Smith's \"absolute free trade,\" as a weapon against sovereign national economic policy of rival powers. By the end of the 19th century, the British establishment began an intense debate over how to maintain its global empire. Amid slogans about a new era of \"anti-imperialism,\" beginning the last quarter of the 19th century, Britain embarked on a more sophisti- cated and far more effective form for maintaining its dominant world role, through what came to be called \"informal empire.\" While maintaining core imperial possessions in India and the Far East, British capital flowed in prodigious amounts into especially Argentina, Brazil and the United States, to form bonds of financial dependence in many ways more effective than formal colonial ti- tles. The notion of special economic relationships with \"client states,\" the concept of \"spheres of influence\" as well as of \"bal- ance-of-power diplomacy,\" all came out of this complex weave of British \"Informal Empire\" toward the end of the last century. Since the English defeat of Spain's Armada in 1588, Britain had used the special circumstance that it was an island apart from Con- tinental Europe. She was saved the costs of having to raise a large standing army to defend her interests, leaving her free to concen- trate on mastery of the seas. Britain's looting of the wealth of the vast reaches of the world allowed her to maintain as well a bal- ance-of-power on the Continent, creating or financing coalitions against whichever nation seemed on the verge of dominating the European land mass stretching from Russia to Spain at any given time. In the artermath of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, in the reorga- nized Europe following the defeat of Napoleon, England per- fected the cynical diplomatic strategy known as \"Balance of Power.\" Never was it admitted by Her Majesty's Foreign Office es- tablishment that, as on a scale, with weights added to equalize op- posite sides of a center \"balance point,\" British Balance of Power diplomacy was rigorously defined, always, from the fulcrum or center point of London, that is, how England could play off rival economic powers to unique English advantage. After 1815, the peculiar \"genius\" of English foreign policy lay in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14 A GENTURY OF WAR its skill in shifting alliance relations, abruptly if necessary, as their perception of European or global strategic power shifted. English diplomacy cultivated this cynical doctrine, which dictated that England never held sentimental or moral relations with other na- tions as sovereign respected partners, but rather, England devel- oped her \"interests.\" English alliance strategies were dictated strictly by what England determined at any given period might best serve the definition of English \"interest.\" The shift from hos- tile relations with France in Africa to England's \"Entente Cordi- ale\" after the Fashoda showdown in 1898, or the shift from decades-long English backing for Ottoman Turkey to block the ex- pansion of Russia, in what was known4n Britain and India as the \"Great Game,\" were indicative of such dramatic alliance shifts. Increasingly during the last decades of the 19th century, English capital flowed into select capital-deficit countries such as Argen- tina, in order to finance, build, then run their national rail and transport infrastructure, a role usually encouraged by generous concessions from the host government. English capital also went to develop the local country's steamship lines and their ports. So were the economies of Argentina and other English \"client states\" effectively made into economic captives, with terms of trade and finance dictated from the City of London, by British merchant houses and trade finance banks. These client states of England thereby found that they had surrendered control over their essen- tial economic sovereignty far more efficiently than if British troops had occupied Buenos Aires to enforce tax collection in support of the British Empire. During the 1880's, Argentina's new railroads brought her goods, especially beef and wheat, to its ports for export. Exports doubled and her external debts, mainly to London banks, increased 700%. The country was a debt vassal of the British Empire; \"imperialism on the cheap\", as one commentator dubbed it. It was manifestly not the intent of British policy to develop strong sovereign indus- trial economies from these client-state relationships. Rather, it was to make the minimum investment necessary to exert control, while ensuring that other rival powers did not gain coveted raw materi- als or other treasures of economic power. During this time, British troops occupied Egypt in 1882 in order first to safeguard the sea lanes to India—the Suez Canal must not be allowed to fall into rival French hands! The British military oc- 1 - THE THREE PILLARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 15 cupation so destroyed any structure of Egyptian rule that, after 1882, British soldiers remained a permanent presence in this nodal point of Empire between London and India. Similarly, British presence in South Africa was initially to safe- guard the southern route to India, preventing rival powers from securing bases there which could flank British shipping trade. British control in the 1840's and 1850's over South Africa was not formal. Instead, Britain shut the Boer Republics off from access to the Indian Ocean in stages, beginning with their annexation of Natal in 1843, keeping the Boers out of Delagoa Bay and interven- ing to block the union of the Boer Republics under Pretorius in 1869. The aim was to ensure, by least means necessary, British su- premacy in the entire southern African region. Secure monopoly for Britain's control of trade was primary in this 19th century era of British Imperialism. British Secret Intelligence Services in this time also evolved in an unusual manner. Unlike the empires of France or other nations, Britain modelled its post-Waterloo empire on an extremely sophis- ticated marriage between top bankers and financiers of the City of London, Government cabinet ministers, heads of key industrial companies deemed strategic to the national interest, and the heads of the espionage services. Representative of this arrangement was City of London mer- chant banking scion, Sir Charles Jocelyn Hambro, who sat as a di- rector of the Bank of England from 1928 until his death in 1963. During the Second World War, Hambro was Executive Chief of British secret intelligence's Special Operations Executive (SOE) in the Government's Ministry of Economic Warfare, which ran war- time economic warfare against Germany, and trained the entire leadership of what was to become the postwar American Central Intelligence Agency and intelligence elite, including William Casey, Charles Kindelberger, Walt Rostow and Robert Roosa, later Kennedy Treasury Deputy Secretary and partner of Wall Street's elite Brown Brothers, Harriman. Rather than the traditional service to provide data from agents of espionage in foreign capitals, Britain's Secret Intelligence Ser- vice head was himself part of a secret, freemasonic-like network which wove together the immense powers of British banking, shipping, large industry, and government. Because it was secret, it wielded immense power over credulous or unsuspecting foreign"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"16 A CENTURY OF WAR economies. In the Free Trade era after 1846, this covert marriage of private commercial power with government was the secret of Brit- ish hegemony. British foreign policy was based on the cultivation, not of good neighborly relations with allies, but rather of calcu- lated \"interests,\" which dictated shifting alliances or national al- lies, abruptly, if required. The Great Depression of 1873 However, as a direct consequence of this British free trade trans- formation, a deep economic depression began by the early 1870's in England following a financial panic. The Free Trade doctrine had been premised on the assumption that British influence could ensure that same dogma would become economic policy in all of the world's major trading nations. That homogeneity was never achieved. Following a severe London banking panic in 1857, the City of London banking establishment, including the directors of the Bank of England, resolved on a novel device intended to prevent future outflows of gold from London banks. The Panic of 1857 had resulted from a foreign run on the international gold reserves held by the Bank of England. The run collapsed bank credit in the City and across the country. In response to the crisis, the English au- thorities devised a policy which resulted in a simple, if dangerous, evolution of central bank practice. The Bank of England, a private holding controlled not by the Government at the time, but rather by the financial interests of the City, realized that if it merely raised its central bank discount or interest rate to a sufficiently high level, relative to rates in compet- ing trading countries, which might be draining Britain's gold re- serves at any time, then the drain would cease, and, if rates were driven sufficiently high, gold would eventually flow back into the banks of the City of London from Berlin, New York, Paris, or Mos- cow. This interest rate policy was a powerful weapon in central bank- ing, which gave the Bank of England a decisive advantage over ri- vals. No matter that the usuriously high interest rates created dev- astating depressions in British manufacture or agriculture. The 1 1 - THE THREE PILLARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE  17  dominant faction in British economic policy, increasingly after the 1846 Corn Laws repeal, was not industry or agriculture, but fi- nance and international trade. In order to ensure the supremacy of British international banking, those bankers were willing to sacri- fice domestic industry and investment, much as happened in the United States after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in the 1960's. But the consequences of this new Bank of England interest rate policy for British industry came home with a vengeance when the Great Depression hit Britain in 1873, and lasted until 1896. Beginning with a financial crisis in the English banking world, as the pyramid of foreign lending for railway construction to the Americas, North and South, collapsed, the British Empire entered what was then called The Great Depression. Reflecting the rising unemployment and industrial bankruptcies of that depression, British prices collapsed by almost 50% in nominal terms, in an un- broken fall from 1873 to 1896. Unemployment became wide- spread. The lack of capital investment into British manufactures was al- ready evident at the International Exhibition of 1867. Products from entirely new manufactures of machinery, even textiles from Germany and elsewhere, clearly overshadowed the stagnant tech- nological levels of British manufacturing, the world leader only two decades earlier. British exports of iron, steel, coal, and other products declined in this period. It was a turning point in British history which signalled that the onset of \"free trade\" some three decades earlier, with repeal of the Corn Laws, had doomed Eng- lish industrial technology to decadance in order for financial inter- ests to assume supremacy in the affairs of the Empire. The period of Britain's easy leadership among the world's in- dustrial nations was clearly over by the 1890's. The free trade dogma of 19th Century British Empire, and its Malthusian rationalizations, were doomed to fail eventually. Its foundation was cannibalization of the economies of increasing parts of the globe in order to survive. Only a quarter century after the repeal of the Corn Laws, the British Empire sank into the worst and longest economic depression of its history. After 1873, British efforts to spread the virus of the \"English Disease,\" Adam Smith's \"cosmopolitan economic model\" of absolute free trade, became markedly less successful. Nations of Continental Europe, led by"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"18 A CENTURY OF WAR Germany, initiated a series of national economic protectionist measures, which allowed them to unleash the most dramatic rates of industrial growth seen in the past 200 years. This set the stage for a new debate within the British elite over how to maintain Empire and power in a rapidly changing world. The geopolitics of petroleum was introduced into this debate in 1882. Now it was a debate on how to maintain British naval supre- macy. Footnotes: 1. Commenting on British free trade policy in 1851, American economist Henry C. Carey, architect of the national economic strategy of Abraham Lincoln, noted, \"We have thus here a system that is unsound and unnatural, and second, a the- ory invented for the purpose of accounting for the poverty and wretchedness which are its necessary results. The miseries of Ireland are charged to over-popula- tion, although millions of acres of the richest soils of the kingdom are waiting drainage to take their place among the most productive in the world, and although the people of Ireland are compelled to waste more labour than would pay, many times over, for all the cloth and iron they consume...Over-population is the ready excuse for all the evils of a vicious system, and so will it continue to be until that system shall see its end. To main- tain it, the price of labour in England must be kept steadily at a point so low as to en- able her to underwrite the Hindoo, the German, and the American, with all the disad- vantage of freight and duties.\" Carey continues, \"England had monopolized machinery for so long a time that she had acquired skill that could not readily be rivalled; while she had, by this improper division of her population, kept the price of labour and capital at a lower point...than among her neighbours. Her establishments were gigantic, and always ready to sink those who might undertake competition; while the un- ceasing changes in her monetary arrangements, [Bank of England manipula- tions of gold supply— w.e.] the necessary consequences of the colonial system, were of themselves sufficient to spread ruin among all the nations connected with her.\" Carey cites the experience of America, with bank panics and an economic de- pression beginning 1837. American credit had shifted more and more into the control of the banks of the City of London after the 1820's, and away from List's notion of national economy.

With this vast increase in the importation of food from abroad has come the ruin of the people of Ireland. Deprived of man- ufacture and commerce [by England's economic policy], her people were driven to live by agriculture alone, and she was enabled to drag on a miserable exis- tence, so long as her neighbor [England] was content to make some compensa- tion for the loss of labour by paying her for her products higher prices than those at which they might have been elsewhere purchased.\" \"With the repeal of the Corn Laws, that resource has failed,\" Carey contin- ues, \"and the result is a state of poverty, wretchedness and famine, that has obliged the [Irish] landowner to maintain the people, whether they work or not; and this is one of the conditions of slavery re-established in that unhappy coun- try.

The role of petroleum already had become cen- tral in this conflict, to a degree that few outside a tiny elite of Lon- don and New York bankers and financiers realized until years later. Toward the final decade of the 19th century, British banking and political elites had begun to express the first signs of alarm over two specific aspects of the impressive industrial development in Germany. The first was emergence of an independent, modern German merchant and military naval fleet. Since 1815 and the Congress of Vienna, the English Navy had been the unchallenged lord of the seas. The second strategic alarm was sounded over an ambitious German project to construct a railway linking Berlin with, ultimately, Baghdad, then part of the Ottoman Empire. In both areas, the naval challenge and construction of a rail in- frastructure linking Berlin to the Persian Gulf, oil figured as a de- cisive, if still hidden, motive force for both the British and the Ger- man side. We will see why these two developments were regarded as virtual casus belli by the Anglo-Saxon establishment at the turn of the century. By the 1890's, British industry had been surpassed in both rates and quality of technological development by an astonishing emer- 2 - GERMANY AND THE GEOPOLITICS OF THE \"GREAT WAR\"  21  gence of industrial and agricultural development within Ger- many. With the United States concentrated largely on its internal expansion after its Civil War, the industrial emergence of Germany was increasingly seen as the largest \"threat\" to Britain's global hegemony during the last decade of the century. By the 1870's, decades of piecemeal German adoption of the eco- nomic reforms of Friedrich List, creation of a national modern rail transport infrastructure and tariff protection for emerging domes- tic industries, began to yield notable results, more so in the context of the political unity of the German Reich after 1871. Until approximately the 1850's, imitation of the apparently suc- cessful British economic model was the dominant policy followed in Germany, and the free trade economics of such British econo- mists as Adam Smith or David Ricardo were regarded as holy gos- pel in German universities. But increasingly, after England went into prolonged depression in the 1870's which hit Germany and Austria as well, Germany began to realize the serious flaws in con- tinuing faithfully to follow the \"British model.\" As Germany in- creasingly turned to a form of national economic strategy, and away from British \"free trade\" adherence, in building a national industry and agriculture production, the results were remarkable. As one indication of this shift away from the English model, from 1850 to the eve of the First World War in 1913, German total domestic output increased five-fold. Per capita output increased in the same period by 250%. The population began to experience a steady increase in its living standard, as real industrial wages doubled between 1871 and 1913. But the heart of the German industrial revolution was the explo- sion of technological progress. Germany established a national system of technological schools (Technische Hochschulen) and colleges, modelled on the French Ecole Polytechnique, for the ed- ucation of scientific and engineering cadre for industry, and a system of \"Handelshochschulen,\" organized with support from the various chambers of commerce and industry, for education of business cadre. Moreover, German universities placed emphasis on natural sciences in their curricula. German engineering and sci- ence began to blossom. This was paralleled by a nationwide system of \"Fachschulen\" for training of skilled tradesmen. The net result of it all was a dramatic increase in the technological compe- tence of the German working population after the 1870's."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"22 A CENTURY OF WAR As late as 1870, British large industrial companies dwarfed their young German rivals. But that was to change drastically over the next three to four decades. In the decades before 1914, in terms of fueling world industry and transportation, coal was king. In 1890, Germany produced 88 million tons of coal, while Britain produced more than double as much, 182 million tons. But by 1910, German output of coal climbed impressively to 219 million tons, while Brit- ain had only a slight lead at 264 million tons. Steel was at the center of Germany's growth, with the rapidly emerging electrical power and chemicals industries close behind. Using the innovation of the Gilchrist Thomas steel-making pro- cess, which capitalized on the high-phosphorus ores of Lorraine, German steel output increased 1,000% in the twenty years from 1880 to 1900, leaving British steel output far behind. As late as 1890, Britain still led Germany in production of pig iron, with 7.9 million tons versus 4.6 million tons for Germany. But by 1910, Ger- man pig iron output was 50% greater than Britain's at 14.6 million tons to 10 million tons. At the same time, the cost of making Germany's steel dropped to one-tenth the cost of the 1860's. By 1913, Germany was smelting almost two times the amount of pig iron as British foundries. 1 The rail infrastructure to transport this rapidly expanding flow of industrial goods was the initial \"locomotive\" for Germany's first \"Wirtschaftswunder.\" While the initial expansion of the Ger- man railway system began in the 1840's and 1850's, under the ini- tial influence of List's Zollverein and his national railway plan state-backed rail infrastructure fully doubled the kilometers of track from 1870 to 1913. Following the development of centralized electric power gener- ation and long-distance transmission under the impulse of Oskar von Miller and others, the German electrical industry grew from an infant industry employing 26,000 in 1895 to dominate fully half of all international trade in electrical goods by 1913. German chemical industry, under the impulse of great researchers such as Justus von Liebig and others, grew from one vastly inferior to both French and British industry, to become the world's leader in ana- line dye production, pharmaceuticals and chemical fertilizers. Introduction of scientific agriculture chemistry by von Liebig and others led also to astonishing rates of productivity increase during this period for German agriculture. Going from a situation 2 - GERMANY AND THE GEOPOLITICS OF THE \"GREAT WAR\"  23  in the early decades of the 1800's which was literally desperate, with outbreaks of famine and harvest failure, when it seemed more economical to import grain from Russia or even Argentina, Germany re-imposed a protective tariff blocking imports of cheap grain in the 1890's. The mechanization of farming began to show progress, going from 20,000 harvesting machines in 1882 to some 300,000 by 1907. Despite often inferior and sandy soils, German chemical fertilizer development led to improving harvest yields. Grain harvest yields had improved as a result, by 80% at the time of the World War, compared with the period before 1887 when fertilizers were first introduced on a significant scale. By contrast, Russia, at the outbreak of the war, with three million acres more under grain cul- tivation, produced 19 million tons less grain than Germany. By 1913 Germany was 95% self-sufficient in meat production, despite per capita meat consumption having doubled since 1870, while Britain in 1913 imported 45% of its meat requirements. Paralleling the expansion of its industry and agriculture, Ger- many went from a net emigration country in the early 1800's, to a country with strong population growth by the end of the century. Between 1870 and 1914 Germany's population increased almost 75% from 40,000,000 to more than 67,000,000 people. Large industry grew in a symbiosis after the 1880's together with large banks such as Deutsche Bank, under what became known as the \"Grossbanken\" model, or simply \"German model\" of inter- locking ownership between major banks and key industrial com- panies. 2 Germany's \"Wirtschaftwunder\" arose in this period after 1870. The much-proclaimed industrial recovery from the devastation of war and world depression in the late 1950's represented, to a very significant degree, the recovery of the foundations laid during the 1880's up to 1914. A Berlin Bank Panic The development of an independent national economic policy in Germany took its second impetus from the consequences, ironi- cally, of a banking panic. In 1890, as a result of the near-failure of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"24 A CENTURY OF WAR the prestigous London merchant bank, Baring Brothers, arising from their huge losses in Argentine bond speculation and invest- ment, and the ties of German banking to this Argentine specula- tion, a Berlin bank panic ensued, as the dominoes of an interna- tional financial pyramid began to topple. Berlin, and German investors generally, were caught up in inter- national railroad speculation mania in the 1880's. With the crash of the elite Baring Bros., with some $75,000,000 invested into var- ious Argentine bonds, down came the illusions of many Germans about the marvels of financial speculation. In the wake of the financial collapse of Argentina, a large wheat exporter to Europe, Berlin grain traders Ritter & Blumenthal had foolishly attempted a \"corner\" on the entire German wheat mar- ket, planning to capitalize on the consequences of the financial troubles in Argentina. This only aggravated the financial panic in Germany when their scheme collapsed, bankrupting the esteemed private banking house of Hirschfeld & Wolf in its wake, and caus- ing huge losses at the Rheinisch-Westphalische Bank, further trig- gering a general run on German banks and a collapse of the Ber- lin Stock Market, lasting into the autumn of 1891. Responding to the crisis, the Chancellor named a Commission of Inquiry of 28 eminent persons, under the chairmanship of Reichsbank President Dr. Richard Koch, to look into the causes and to propose legislative measures to prevent further such pan- ics from occuring. The Koch Commission was composed of a broad and representative cross-section of German economic soci- ety including representatives from industry, agriculture, univer- sities, political parties, as well as banking and finance. The result of the commission's work, most of it voted into law by the Reichstag in the Exchange Act in June 1896, and the Depot- gesetz of that July, was the most severe legislation restricting fi- nancial speculation of any industrial country of the time. Futures positions in grain were prohibited. Stock market speculation pos- sibilities were severely constrained, one result of which has been the relative absence of stock market speculation as a major factor affecting German economic life since then. The German Exchange Act of 1896 definitively established a dif- ferent form of organization of finance and banking in Germany, from that of England or America—Anglo-Saxon banking. Not only this, but many London financial houses reduced their activ- 2 - GERMANY AND THE GEOPOLITICS OF THE \"GREAT WAR\"  25  ity in the restrictive German financial market after the 1890's as a result of these restrictions, lessening the influence of City of Lon- don finance over German economic policy. Significantly, to the present day, these fundamental differences between Anglo-Saxon banking and finance and a \"German model\" as largely practiced in Germany, Holland, Switzerland and Japan, are still somewhat visible. 3 The Necessity of Ship and Rail Infrastructure Thus, while England's national industrial and finance policy, es- pecially after 1873, fostered industrial retardation of technological progress, that of Germany fostered quite the opposite. By 1900, the trends of divergence between the two countries were evident to all. But a growing friction between Germany and England in the years before 1914 was centered on two special aspects of Germany's impressive overall economic development. First and foremost was the dramatic emergence of Germany as a pre-emi- nent modern shipping nation, ultimately threatening the decades- long English domination of the seas. As long as Germany did not control her own modern merchant ship fleet, and did not have a navy to defend it, Germany could never determine her own economic affairs. England was still the sovereign on the world's oceans, and intended to remain so. This was the heart of British geopolitical strategy. Under such condi- tions, an increasing majority in Germany argued that the nation's economic life would be ever subject to the manipulations of a for- eign shipping power for the essential terms of its vital interna- tional trade. In 1870, the total merchant fleet of the German Reich barely to- talled 640,000 tons. The German merchant fleet at the time was the fifth largest in the world, behind the British, American, French, and Norwegian. By 1914, the German fleet had risen to Number Two, just behind England, and gaining rapidly. German export goods in 1870 were subject to both the rates and ships of other nations, above all England. By 1914, this had changed dramatically. Already by 1901, 9,000,000 tons on 52,000 different ships left German ports sailing under German flag. By"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"26 A CENTURY OF WAR 1909, these figures had increased to 65,000 vessels totalling 13,000,000 tons under German flag. In this time, fully 70% of all German trade was dependent on the sea. Control of the terms of this trade was clearly vital for the economic security of Germany. But few in London finance and shipping circles welcomed that prospect. The parallel developments in German steel and engineering were directly applied to construction of a modern merchant shipping fleet. Replacement of wind power with steam propulsion and of wooden hulls, first with iron reinforcing and later with steel hulls, allowed Germany's merchant fleet to become larger and more efficient. In 1891, the German fleet could count three steam- ers over 7,000 BWT. By 1914, the German flag carried five steam- ers above 20,000 BWT, nine between 15-20,000 BWT, and 66 between 7,000 and 10,000 BWT. During this time, German sea transport developed with extraor- dinary rapidity and efficiency. By 1914 two large companies, the Hamburg-American and the North German Lloyd, held some 40% of all Germany's commercial marine. Organization, economies of scale, and emphasis on construction of the most efficient and mod- ern ships, was the secret of the spectacular growth in this period. A French observer of the day, commenting on the extraordinary success of German marine transport in this period noted, \"It is this concentration which makes possible the rapid amortization of capital and, in consequence, the 'scrapping' of ships which have become old, the perpetual rejuvenation of the floating machinery. You do not find in the German mercantile marine old vessels of thirty or forty years. What the German industries, properly speak- ing—metallurgy, electro-technique, etc.—secure by standardized production, the German merchant service obtains by the fre- quency and regularity of sailings.\" He adds, \"In the case of the Ger- mans, the creation of shipping lines does not follow trade, it precedes it, and in preceding it, it brings it into existence.'\"^ Following the final incorporation of Hamburg into the German Reich in 1888, Hamburg, and later Bremen-Bremerhaven, became the centers for construction of the most modern and efficient port facilities in all Europe, drawing the rail freight of much of central Europe north, to be shipped out to world markets. Through estab- lishment of a national infrastructure policy which encouraged cheapest possible transport communications, Germany in the 2 - GERMANY AND THE GEOPOLITICS OF THE \"GREAT WAR\"  27  decade and a half before 1914 expanded its shipping presence throughout the world, as well into traditional market monopolies of English shipping in British colonies or traditional British \"spheres of influence\" such as Egypt, or even the Americas. In 1897, little more than one year after the Reichstag passed the restrictive financial speculation controls, Grand-Admiral von Tir- pitz announced the first German naval construction program, which the Reichstag approved in 1898, followed in 1900 by a sec- ond law doubling the number of naval ships to be built. By 1906, England had launched a superior new, all-big gun bat- tleship class with the Dreadnought, which was swifter and carried more firepower than any existing battleship. In response in 1906, Germany passed a little-publicized law mandating replacement of the German naval fleet every 20 years. By 1909, to the astonish- ment of the British, Germany launched its Nassau series with four ships superior to the Dreadnaught ships were soon superceded by both British and German shipbuilders with an even more ad- vanced Super-Dreadnaught series. Britain never imagined that Ger- many could develop such a modern fleet in its own naval yards, and in such a short time. Reviewing the background of the 1914 Great War in an Oxford University lecture in 1951, Sir Llewellyn Woodward tersely stated, \"Germany, like every other power, was free to build for herself as large a fleet as she might wish. The ques- tion was one of expediency and of realist calculation. A German battle fleet could not be other than a challenge to Great Britain, the dom- inant sea power.\" 5 . It was becoming clear to some in England by about 1910 that dramatic remedies would be required to deal with the awesome German economic emergence. For the first time, as we shall now see, petroleum also emerged as a significant factor in the geopolit- ical calculus of war. Footnotes: 1.

CHAPTER THREE: A Global Fight for Control of Petroleum Begins A British Admiral sees beyond lamp oil I N 1882, THE BLACK heavy sludge we know today as petro- leum had little commercial interest other than for fuel to light new mineral oil lamps, a technique developed in Berlin in 1853 by a German lamp manufacturer named Stohwasser. The fuel was then known as \"rock oil\" because it seeped through rocks in cer- tain oil areas such as Titusville, Pennsylvania, Baku in Russia, or in Galicia, now part of Poland. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller created the Standard Oil Co. to exploit this market for lamp oil and vari- ous oil medicine \"cures\" in the United States. The development of the internal combustion engine had not yet revolutionized world industry. But at least one man understood the military-strategic implica- tions of petroleum for future control of the world seas. Beginning with a public address in September 1882, Britain's Admiral Lord Fisher, then Captain Fisher, argued to anyone in the British estab- lishment who would listen that Britain must convert its naval fleet from bulky coal-fired propulsion to the new oil fuel. Since 1870 Russian steamers on the Caspian Sea had burned a heavy fuel oil the Russians called \"mazut.\" Fisher and a few other far-sighted in- dividuals began to argue for adoption of the new fuel. He insisted that oil-power would allow Britain to maintain decisive strategic advantage in future control of the seas. Fisher had done his homework on the qualitative superiority of petroleum over coal as a fuel, and knew his reasoning was sound. A battleship powered by a diesel motor burning petroleum issued"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"30 A CENTURY OF WAR no tell-tale smoke, while a coal ship's emission was visible up to 10 kilometers away. Where some 4 to 9 hours were required for a coal-fired ship to reach full power, an oil motor required only 30 minutes and could reach peak power within 5 minutes. To provide oil fuel for a battle ship required the work of 12 men for 12 hours. The same equivalent of energy for a coal ship required the work of 500 men and 5 days. For equal horsepower propulsion, the oil- fired ship required 1 /3 the engine weight, and almost one-quarter of the daily tonnage of fuel, a critical factor for a fleet, whether commercial or military. The radius of action of an oil-powered fleet was up to four times as great as that of the comparable coal ship. 1 But at the time, Fisher was regarded by his English peers as an eccentric dreamer. Meanwhile, by 1885 a German .engineer, Gottlieb Daimler, de- veloped the world's first workable petroleum motor to power a road vehicle. Although automobiles were regarded as playthings of the ultra-rich until the turn of the century, the economic poten- tials of the petroleum era were beginning to be more broadly real- ized by many beyond Admiral Fisher and his circle. D'Arcy captures the secret of the burning rocks By 1905, British Secret Services and the British government had finally realized the strategic importance of the new fuel. Britain's problem was that it had no known oil of its own. It had to rely on America, Russia or Mexico to supply it, an unacceptable condition in time of peace, impossible in the event of a major war. A year before, in 1904, Captain Fisher had been promoted to the rank of Britain's First Sea Lord, the supreme commander of Brit- ish naval affairs. Fisher promptly established a committee to \"con- sider and make recommendations as to how the British navy shall secure its oil supplies.\" Britain's presence in Persia and the Arabian Gulf—the latter still part of the Ottoman Empire—was quite limited in this time. Per- sia was not part of the formal British Empire. For some years, Brit- ain had maintained consulates at Bushire and Bandar Abbas, and kept British naval ships in the Gulf to deter other powers from en- 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS  31  tertaining designs on strategic waters so close to Britain's most vital colonial source of looting, India. In 1892, Lord Curzon, later Viceroy of India, writing on Persia, stated, \"I should regard the concession of a port upon the Persian Gulf to Russia, by any power, as a deliberate insult to Great Britain and as a wanton rupture of the status quo, and as an international provocation to war...\" 2 But in 1905, Her Majesty's Government, through the agency of the notorious British \"ace of spies,\" Sidney Reilly, secured an ex- traordinarily significant exclusive right over what were then be- lieved to be vast untapped petroleum deposits in the Middle East. In early 1905, Her Majesty's Secret Service sent Reilly (born Sig- mund Georgjevich Rosenblum in Odessa, Russia) with the mis- sion to extract rights to exploit the mineral resources of Persia from an eccentric Australian amateur geologist and engineer named William Knox d'Arcy. D'Arcy, a devout Christian who had studied history deeply, be- came convinced that accounts of \"pillars of fire\" at the holy sites of the ancient Persian God of Fire, Ormuzd, derived from the prac- tice of the priests of Zoroaster lighting naptha—oil—seeping from the rocks in those select sites. He spent years wandering the areas where these ancient Persian temples existed, searching for oil. He made numerous visits to London to secure financial support for his quest, with diminishing support from British bankers. Sometime in the 1890's, the new Persian monarch, Reza Khan Pahlevi, a man committed to modernizing what today is Iran, called on D'Arcy as an engineer who knew Iran thoroughly, ask- ing him to aid Persia in development of railways and the begin- nings of industry. In 1901, in gratitude for his services to Persia, the Shah awarded to D'Arcy a \"firman,\" or royal concession, giving D'Arcy \"full powers and unlimited liberty, for a period of sixty years, to probe, pierce and drill at their will the depths of Persian soil; in conse- quence of which all the sub-soil products sought by him without exception will remain his inalienable property.\" D'Arcy paid the equivalent of 20,000 dollars cash and agreed to pay the Shah a 16% \"royalty\" from sales of whatever petroleum was discovered. Thus the eccentric Australian secured one of the most valuable legal documents of the day, granting him and \"all his heirs and assigns and friends\" exclusive rights to tap the oil potential of Persia until 1961. D'Arcy's first successful oil dis-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"32 A CENTURY OF WAR covery came in the region of Shushtar north of the Persian Gulf. 3 Sidney Reilly managed to track D'Arcy down in 1905, just as the latter was on the verge of signing a joint oil exploration partner- ship with the French through the Paris Rothschild banking group, before retiring back to his native Australia. Reilly, disguised as a priest and skillfully playing on d'Arcy's strong religious inclinations, persuaded d'Arcy instead to sign over his exclusive rights to Persian oil resources in an agreement with a British company which he claimed to be a good \"Christian\" enterprise, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Scottish financier Lord Strathcona was brought in by the British government as a key shareholder of Anglo-Persian, while the government's actual role in Anglo-Persian was kept secret. Reilly had thus secured Britain's first major petroleum source. By rail from Berlin to Baghdad In 1889, a group of German industrialists and bankers, led by Deutsche Bank, secured a concession from the Ottoman govern- ment to build a railway through Anatolia from the capital, Con- stantinople. This accord was expanded ten years later, in 1899, when the Ottoman government gave the German group approval for the next stage of what became known as the Berlin-Baghdad Railway project. The second agreement was one consequence of the 1898 visit to Constantinople by German Kaiser Wilhelm II. German-Turkish relations had gained high importance over those ten years. Germany had decided to build a strong economic alliance with Turkey beginning in the 1890's, as a way to develop potentially vast new markets to the East for export of German industrial goods. The Berlin-Baghdad Railway project was to be the center- piece of a brilliant and quite workable economic strategy. Poten- tial supplies of oil lurked in the background and Britain stood op- posed. The seeds of animosities tragically acted out in the Middle East in the 1990's trace directly back to this period. For more than two decades, the question of construction of a modern railway linking Continental Europe with Baghdad was at the center of German-English relations as a point of friction. In the 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS 33 estimation of Deutsche Bank director Karl Helfferich, the person responsible at the time for the Baghdad rail project negotiations, no other issue led to greater tensions between London and Berlin in the decade and half before 1914, with the possible exception of the issue of Germany's growing naval fleet. 4 In 1888, under the leadership of Deutsche Bank, a consortium se- cured a concession for construction and maintenance of a railway connecting Haidar-Pascha outside Constantinople, with Angora. The company was named the Anatolian Railway Company, and included Austrian and Italian shareholders as well as a small Eng- lish shareholding. Work on the railway proceeded so well, that the section was completed ahead of schedule and construction was further extended south to Konia. By 1896 a rail line was open which could go from Berlin to Konia deep in the Turkish interior of the Anatolian highlands, a stretch of some 1,000 kilometers of new rail constructed in less than 8 years in an economically desolate area. It was a true engineering and construction accomplishment. The ancient rich valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was coming into sight of modern transportation infrastructure. Hitherto, the only rail infrastructure built in the Middle east had been British or French, all of it ex- tremely short stretches in Syria or elsewhere to link key port cities, but never to open up large expanses of interior to modern indus- trialization. For the first time, the railway gave Constantinople and the Ot- toman Empire vital modern economic linkage with its entire asiatic interior. The rail link, once extended to Baghdad and a short distance further to Kuwait, would provide the cheapest and fast- est link between Europe and the entire Indian subcontinent, a world rail link of the first order. From the English side, this was exactly the point. \"If 'Berlin- Baghdad' were achieved, a huge block of territory producing every kind of economic wealth, and unassailable by sea-power would be united under German authority,\" warned R.G.D. Laffan, at that time a senior British military adviser attached to the Serbian Army. \"Russia would be cut off by this barrier from her western friends, Great Britain and France,\" Laffan added. \"German and Turkish armies would be within easy striking distance of our Egyptian interests, and from the Persian Gulf, our Indian Empire"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"34 A CENTURY OF WAR would be threatened. The port of Alexandretta and the control of the Dardanelles would soon give Germany enormous naval power in the Mediterranean.\" 5 Laffan hinted at the British strategy to sabotage the Berlin- Bagh- dad link. \"A glance at the map of the world will show how the chain of States stretched from Berlin to Baghdad. The German Em- pire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bulgaria, Turkey. One little strip of territory alone blocked the way and prevented the two ends of the chain from being linked together. That little strip was Serbia. Serbia stood small but defiant between Germany and the great ports of Constantinople and Salonika, holding the Gate of the East..Serbia was really the first line of defense of our eastern posses- sions. If she were crushed or enticed into the 'Berlin-Baghdad' system, then our vast but slightly defended empire would soon have felt the shock of Germany's eastward thrust.\" Thus it is not surprising to find that behind the enormous unrest and wars throughout the Balkans in the decade before 1914, in- cluding the Turkish War, the Bulgarian War, and continuous un- rest in the region, the guiding hand of England was actively fos- tering conflict and wars, directed at rupturing the Berlin-Constan- tinople alliance, and especially the completion of the Berlin-Bagh- dad rail link, just as Laffan hints. But it would be a mistake to view the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway project as a \"Ger- man\" coup against England. Germany repeatedly sought English cooperation in the project. Since the 1890's, when agreement was reached with the Turkish government to complete a final 2,500 ki- lometer stretch of rail, which would complete the line down to what is today Kuwait, Deutsche Bank and the Berlin government made countless attempts to secure English participation and co-fi- nancing of the enormous project. In November 1899, following his visit to Constantinople, Ger- man Kaiser Wilhelm II went to meet with Queen Victoria in Wind- sor Castle to personally intercede in favor of soliciting a significant British participation in the Baghdad project. Germany well knew that Britain asserted interests in the Persian Gulf and Suez in de- fense of her India Passage, as it was known. Without positive Eng- lish backing, it was clear that the project would face great difficul- ties, not least political and financial. The size of the final leg of the railway was beyond the resources of German banks, even one as large as Deutsche Bank, to finance alone. 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS  35  From its side, however, for the next fifteen years, England sought with every possible means to delay and obstruct progress of the railway, while always holding out the hope of ultimate agreement to keep the German side off balance. This game lasted literally until the outbreak of war in August, 1914. But the trump card which Her Royal Britannic Majesty played in the final phase of the negotiations around the Baghdad railway, was her tie with the corrupt Sheikh of Kuwait. In 1901, English warships off the Kuwait coast dictated to the Turkish Government that henceforth they must consider the Gulf port located just below the Shaat al Arab, controlled by the Anaza tribe of Sheikh Mubarak al-Sabah, to be a \"British Protectorate.\" At that point, Turkey was too economically and militarily weak to do anything but feebly protest the British de facto occupation of this distant part of the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait in British hands blocked successful completion of the Berlin-Baghdad rail from im- portant eventual access to the Persian Gulf waters and beyond. In 1907, Sheihk Mubarak Al-Sabah, a ruthless sort who report- edly seized power in the region in 1896 by murdering his two half- brothers as they slept in his palace, was convinced to sign over, in the form of a \"lease in perpetuity,\" the land of Bander Shwaikh to \"the precious Imperial English Government.\" The document was co-signed by Major C.G. Knox, Political Agent of the Imperial Eng- lish Government in Kuwait. Reportedly, there were generous por- tions of English gold and rifles to make the signing more palatable to the Sheikh. By October 1913, Lt.-Colonel Sir Percy Cox secured a letter from the ever-obliging Sheikh, wherein the Sheikh agreed not to grant any concession for development of oil in the land \"to anyone other than a person nominated and recommended by the British gov- ernment.\" 6 . By 1902, it was known that the region of the Ottoman Empire known as Mesopotamia—today Iraq and Kuwait—contained re- sources of petroleum. How much and how accessible was still a matter for speculation. This discovery shaped the gigantic battle for global economic and military control which continues to the end of the 20th century. In 1912, Deutsche Bank, in the course of its financing of the Baghdad rail connection, negotiated a concession from the Otto- man Emperor giving the Baghdad Rail Co. full \"right-of-way\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"36 A CENTURY OF WAR rights to all oil and minerals on a parallel 20 kilometers either side of the rail line. The line had reached as far as Mosul in what today is Iraq. By 1912, German industry and government realized that oil was the fuel of its economic future, not only for land transport but for naval vessels. At that time, Germany was itself locked in the grip of the large American Rockefeller Standard Oil Company trust. Standard Oil's Deutsche Petroleum Verkaufgesellschaft controlled 91% of all German oil sales. Deutsche Bank held a minority 9% share of Deutsche Petroleums Verkaufgesellschaft, hardly a deci- sive interest. In 1912, Germany had no independent, secure supply of oil. But geologists had discovered oil in that part of Mesopotamia today called Iraq, between Mosul and Baghdad. The projected line of the last part of the Berlin-Baghdad rail link would go right through the area believed to hold large oil reserves. Efforts to pass legislation in the Berlin Reichstag in 1912-13 to es- tablish a German state-owned company to develop and run the new found oil resources, independent of the American Rockefeller combine, were stalled and delayed, until the outbreak of World War in August 1914 pushed it off the agenda. The Deutsche Bank plan was to have the Baghdad rail link transport Mesopotamian oil over land, free from possible naval blockade by the British and thereby make Germany independent in its petroleum require- ments. The new Dreadnaughts But it was not until 1909, that Admiral Fisher's plans for Britain's oil-fired navy began to be implemented. Germany had just launched the first of its advanced improvement of the English Dreadnought series. The German Von der Tann carried 80,000 horsepower engines, which, while still coal-fired, were capable of a then astounding 28 knots speed. Only two British ships could match that speed. Britain's coal-fired fleet was at its technological limit and British naval supremacy was decisively threatened by the rapidly expanding German economic marvel. By 1911, a young Winston Churchill succeeded Lord Fisher as 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS  37  First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill immediately began a cam- paign to implement Fisher's demand for an oil-powered navy. Using Fisher's arguments, Churchill pointed out that, with ships of equal size, oil gives far greater speed, and, per unit of weight, gives a decisive advantage in domain of action without refueling. In 1912, the United States produced more than 63% of the world's petroleum, Russia's Baku 19%, and Mexico about 5%. Britain's Anglo-Persian Exploration Co. was not yet producing major supplies of petroleum, but even then, British government strategy had determined that British presence in the Persian Gulf was essential national interest. As we have seen, Germany's re- lentless extension of the Berlin-Baghdad railway line played a sig- nificant role in this determination. By July 1912, Prime Minister Asquith's government, on Churchill's urging, appointed a Royal Commission on Oil & The Oil Engine. The retired Lord Fisher was named to chair it. By early 1913, acting secretly, and again at Churchill's urging, the British Government bought up a majority share ownership of Anglo-Persian Oil (today British Petroleum). From this point, oil was at the core of British strategic interest. 7 If England could not only secure her own direct petroleum needs for the transport and energy technology of the future, but, perhaps more decisive, deny economic rivals access to secure pe- troleum reserves in the world, the dominant role of Britain might be maintained into the next decades. In short, if England's stagnat- ing industry could not compete with Germany's emerging Daim- ler motors, it would control the raw material on which the Daim- ler motors must run. Just what this policy of British petroleum control implied for the course of world history will become more clear. Sir Edward Grey's fateful Paris trip Why would England risk a world war in order to stop the devel- opment of Germany's industrial economy in 1914? The ultimate reason why England declared war in August, 1914, lay fundamentally \"in the old tradition of British policy, through which England grew to great power status, and through which she"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"38   A CENTURY OF WAR sought to remain a great power,\" stated German banker, Karl Helf- ferich, in 1918. \"England's policy was always constructed against the politically and economically strongest Continental power,\" he stressed. \"Ever since Germany became the politically and economically strongest Continental power, did England feel threatened from Germany more than from any other land in its global economic po- sition and its naval supremacy. Since that point, the English-Ger- man differences were unbridgeable, and susceptible to no agree- ment in any one single question.\" Helfferich sadly notes the accu- racy of the declaration by Bismarck in 1897, \"The only condition which could lead to improvement of German-English relations would be if we bridled our economic development, and this is not possible.\" 8 In April, 1914, George, King of England, and his Foreign Minis- ter Edward Grey, made an extraordinary visit to meet French Pres- ident Poincare in Paris. It was one of the few times Sir Edward Grey left the British Isles. Russia's Ambassador to France, Iswol- ski, joined, and the three powers firmed up a secret military alli- ance against the German-Austro-Hungarian powers. Grey delib- erately did not warn Germany beforehand of its secret alliance policy, whereby England would enter a war which engaged any one of the carefully-constructed web of alliance partners England had built up against Germany. 9 The British establishment had determined well before 1914 that war was the only course suitable to bring the European situation \"under control.\" British interests dictated, according to their bal- ance-of-power logic, a shift from her traditional \"pro-Ottoman and anti-Russian\" alliance strategy of the 19th century, to a \"pro- Russian and anti-German\" alliance strategy as early as the late 1890's, when the emerging alliance between France's Gabriel Ha- notaux and Russia's Serge Witte, together with an emerging in- dustrial Germany, seemed imminent. Fashoda, Witte, Great Projects and Great Mistakes Indeed, fear of the emerging German economic challenge to- wards the end of the 1890's was so extreme among the leading cir- 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS  39  cles of the British establishment, that Britain made a drastic change in its decades-long Continental alliance strategy, in a bold effort to tilt European events back to England's advantage. A seminal event, which crystalized this alliance shift, was, oddly enough, an eyeball-to-eyeball military confrontation over Egypt, where historically both England and France had major interests through the Suez Canal Company. In 1898, French troops march- ing across the Sahara to the east under Colonel Jean Marchand, en- countered British forces under command of General Kitchener at Fashoda on the Nile. A tense military showdown ensued, with each ordering the other side to withdraw, until finally, after con- sultation with Paris, Marchand withdrew. The Fashoda Crisis, as it became known, ended in a de facto Anglo-French balance-of- power alliance against Germany, in which France foolishly ceded major possibilities to industrialize Africa. The decision to send the French Expeditionary Force under Marchand to Fachoda for a head-on military confrontation with England in Africa, came from Colonial Minister Theophile Del- casse. Britain had steadily moved to what became a de facto mili- tary occupation of Egypt and the Suez Canal, despite French claims to the area going back to Napoleon. Since 1882, British troops had \"temporarily\" occupied Egypt, and British civil ser- vants ran the government in order to \"protect\" French and British interests in the Suez Canal Company. England was stealing Egypt out from under France. Delcasse acted against the better interests of France and against the explicit policy design of French Foreign Minister Gabriel Ha- notaux. Hanotaux, who was absent from government for a critical six months when the Fashoda folly was decided, had a conception of development and industrialization of France's African colonies. A moderate Republican who was known as an Anglophobe, Ha- notaux had a conception of an economically unified French Africa centered around development of Lake Chad, with a railroad link- ing the interior from Dakar in French Senegal to French Djibouti on the Red Sea. The idea was referred to in France as the Trans-Sa- hara Railway project. It would have transformed the entirety of Saharan Africa from West to East. It would also have blocked major British strategic objectives to control the entire region from Africa, across Egypt and into India. Hanotaux carefully pursued a policy of normalizing relations"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"40 A CENTURY OF WAR between France and Germany, a development most threatening to British balance-of-power machinations. In early 1896, the German Foreign Secretary asked the French Ambassador in Berlin whether France would consider joint action in Africa for \"limiting the insa- tiable appetite of England...[It] is necessary to show England that she can no longer take advantage of the Franco-German antago- nism to seize whatever she wants.\" Then, the infamous Dreyfus Affair erupted in the press in France. Its direct aim was to rupture the delicate efforts of Hano- taux to stabilize relations with Germany. A French army Captain named Dreyfus was prosecuted on charges of spying for the Ger- mans. Hanotaux intervened into the initial process in 1894, cor- rectly warning that the Dreyfus affair would lead to \"a diplomatic rupture with Germany, even war.\" Dreyfus was exonerated years later, and it was revealed that Count Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy, in the pay of the Rothschild banking family, had manufactured the evidence against Dreyfus. By 1898, Hanotaux was out of office, and succeeded by the malleable Anglophile, Theophile Delcasse. After Fachoda in 1898, Britain skillfully enticed France, under Foreign Minister Delcasse, to give up fundamental colonial and economic interests in Egypt and concentrate on a French policy against Germany, with Britain secretly agreeing to back French claims on Alsace-Lorraine, as well as supporting French ambitions in other areas not vital to British designs. Describing these British diplomatic machinations around Fachoda some years later (in 1909), Hanotaux remarked, \"It is an historical, proven fact that any colonial expansion of France has been seen with fear and concern in England. For a long time, England has thought that, in the dom- ination of the Seas, she has no other rival to consider than that power endowed by nature with a triple coastline of the Channel, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. And when, after 1880, France, induced by the circumstances and stimulated by the gen- ius of Jules Ferry, began to reconstitute her dismembered colonial domain, she came up against the same resistance. In Egypt, in Tu- nisia, Madagascar, Indo-China, even the Congo and Oceania, it is always England she confronts.\" After Fachoda, the Entente Cordiale was fashioned and ulti- mately formalized in a secret agreement between France and Brit- ain, signed by Delcasse, Hanotaux' successor, in 1904. Germany's economic threat was the glue binding the two unlikely allies. 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS 41 Commenting on this sad turn of events afterwards, Hanotaux noted the success with which Britain had imposed a new foreign policy on France, \"a marvelous invention of English diplomatic genius to divide its adversaries.\" Over the next eight years, Britain reversed its geopolitical alli- ance policy in another profound manner as well, and shifted de- velopments in Russia to British advantage. Beginning 1891, Rus- sia had embarked on an ambitious industrialization program with the passage of a stringent protective tariff and railroad infrastruc- ture program. In 1892, the man responsible for the railroad plan, Count Sergei Witte, became Minister of Finance. Witte had en- joyed close relations with France's Hanotaux and a positive basis for Franco-Russian relations developed around the construction of the railway system of Russia. The most ambitious project initiated in Russia at that time had been construction of a railroad linking Russia in the West to Vla- divostock in the far East—the Trans-Siberian Railway project, a 5,400 mile-long undertaking, which would transform the entire economy of Russia. This was the most ambitious rail project in the world. Witte himself was a profound student of the German eco- nomic model of Friederich List, having translated List's \"National System of Political Economy\"into Russian, which Witte termed, \"the solution for Russia.\" Witte spoke of the rail project's effect on uplifting the culturally backward regions of the interior. \"The railroad is like a leaven which creates a cultural fermentation among the population. Even if it is passed through an absolutely wild people along the way, it would raise them in a short time to the level requisite for its oper- ation,\" he said in 1890. A central part of Witte's plan was to de- velop peaceful and productive relations with China, independent of British control of China's ports and sea lanes, through the over- land openings which the Siberian rail line would facilitate. As Finance Minister from 1892 until he was deposed during the suspiciously-timed Russian 1905 \"revolution,\" Witte transformed Russia's prospects dramatically from its former role as \"bread bas- ket\" for British grain trading houses, into a potentially modern in- dustrial nation. Railroads became the largest industry in the coun- try and were inducing transformation of the entire range of related steel and other sectors. Furthermore, Witte's friend and close col- laborator, the scientist Dimitri Mendeleyev, who had founded"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"42 A CENTURY OF WAR Russian agro-chemistry based on the ideas of the German Justus Liebig, was appointed by Witte to head a new Office of Standard Weights and Measures, in which he introduced the metric system to further facilitate trade with the Continent of Europe. Britain energetically opposed the economic policies of Witte and the Trans-Siberian Railway project with every means at its dispo- sal, including attempts to influence reactionary Russian landed nobility linked to English grain trade. Shortly after the inception of the Trans-Siberian Rail project, a British commentator, A. Colq- hum, expressed the dominant view of the British Foreign Office and the City of London. Referring to the new Russian rail project, undertaken with French financing and which would ultimately link Paris to Moscow to Vladivostock by rail, Colqhum declared, \"This line will not only be one of the greatest trade routes that the world has ever known, but it will also become a political weapon in the hands of the Russians whose power and significance it is dif- ficult to estimate. It will make a single nation out of Russia, for whom it will no longer be necessary to pass through the Darda- nelles or through the Suez Canal. It will give her an economic in- dependence, through which she will become stronger than she has ever been or ever dreamed of becoming.\" For decades, British balance-of-power alliance strategy in Europe had been built around support of Ottoman Turkey's Empire, as part of what British strategists called the Great Game—blocking the emergence of a strong and industralized Russia. Support of Turkey, which controlled the vital Dardanelles access to warm wa- ters for Russia, had been a vital part of British geopolitics until that time. But as German economic links with the Ottoman Empire grew stronger at the end of the century and into the early 1900's, so did British overtures to Russia, and against Turkey and Germany. It took a series of wars and crises, but following unsuccessful British attempts to block Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway to Vla- divstock, which the Russians largely completed in 1903, Russia was badly humiliated in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, in which Britain had allied with Japan against Russia. After 1905, Witte was forced to resign his position as Chairman of the Council of Minis- ters under Czar Nicholas II. His successor argued that Russia must come to terms with British power, and proceeded to sign over rights to Afghanistan and large parts of Persia to the British, and agreed to significantly curtail Russian ambitions in Asia. 3 - A GLOBAL FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF PETROLEUM BEGINS  43  Thus, an Anglo-French-Russian Triple Entente in effect had been fully established by 1907. Britain had created a web of secret alli- ances web encircling Germany, and had laid the foundations for its coming military showdown with the Kaiser's Reich. The next seven years were ones of preparation for the final elimination of the German threat. 10 . Following British consolidation of its new Triple Entente strat- egy of encirclement of Germany and allies, a series of continuous crises and regional wars were unleashed in the \"soft underbelly\" of Central Europe, the Balkans. In the so-called First Balkan War in 1912, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece, backed secretly by England, declared war against the weak Ottoman Turkey, resulting in strip- ping Turkey of most of her European possessions, followed by a second 1913 Balkan War over the spoils of the first, in which Roma- nia joined to help crush Bulgaria. The stage was being set for Britain's Great European War. On July 28,1914, three months after Edward Grey's Paris talks, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, was as- sassinated in Sarajevo by a Serb, setting off a predictably tragic chain of events which detonated the Great War.

An examina- tion of the actual financial relations of the principal parties to the war reveals an extraordinary background of secret credits, cou- pled with detailed plans to reallocate raw material and physical wealth of the entire world after the war, especially areas believed to hold significant petroleum reserves in the Ottoman Empire. By most accounts, the trigger which unleashed the Great War was pulled by a Serbian assassin on June 28,1914, at the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, when he murdered Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Following a month of fren- zied negotiations, Austria declared war on July 28 against the tiny state of Serbia, holding her responsible for the assassination. Aus- tria had been assured of German support should Russia back Ser- bia. The following day, July 29, Russia ordered mobilization of her army in the event war became necessary. That same day, the German Kaiser telegrammed Czar Nicholas, begging the Czar not to mobilize, and causing the Czar momen- tarily to rescind his order. On July 30, the Russian High Command persuaded the hesitant Czar to resume the mobilization. On July 31, the German Ambassador to St. Petersburg handed the Czar a German declaration of war against Russia, then reportedly burst into tears and ran from the room."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"46 A CENTURY OF WAR The German General Staff, having been prepared for possible war on both the Eastern and Western fronts, implemented the Schlieffen Plan. As France and Russia had mutual defense com- mitments, Germany decided that France must be defeated swiftly, correctly calculating that Russia would be slower to mobilize. On August 3, 1914, Germany declared war on France, and German troops entered Belgium en route to attack France. Then, on August 4, only eight days following Austria's declara- tion of war against tiny Serbia, Britain announced it had declared war against Germany. The nominal reason given was Britain's prior committment to protect Belgian neutrality. The actual reason was far from any spirit of neighborly charity.  \\  Britain's decision to go to war against Germany in August 1914 on the Continent was remarkable, to say the least, given that the British Treasury and the Pound Sterling system, the dominant cur- rency system of world trade and finance, were de facto bankrupt. Recently declassified internal memoranda from the British Trea- sury staff of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George, raise additional questions. In January 1914, a full six months before the nominal casus belli at Sarajevo, Sir George Paish, senior British Treasury official, was asked by the Chancellor to make a definitive study of the state of the all-important British gold reserves. In 1914, the Sterling Gold Standard was the prop of the world monetary system. In fact, Sterling had become so accepted in inter- national commerce and finance for more than 75 years, that Ster- ling itself was considered \"as good as gold.\" In 1914, Sterling played a role comparable to that of the U.S. dollar before August 15,1971. Sir George's confidential memorandum reveals thinking in the highest levels of the City of London at the time: \"Another influ- ence fanning the agitation for banking reform has been the grow- ing commercial and banking power of Germany, and the growth of uneasiness lest the gold reserves of London should be raided just before or at the beginning of a great conflict between the two countries.\" This confidential report was written more than six months before the heir to the Austrian throne was assassinated in Sarajevo. Paish then discussed his concern over the growing sophistica- tion of the large German trade banks following the 1911-12 Balkan crisis, which had led the German banks to stock up their gold re- serves. Sir George warned his Chancellor Lloyd George that any 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 47 future run on the banks of London, under prevailing conditions, \"might seriously hamper a nation in raising money to conduct a great war.\" 1 On May 22,1914, a senior British Treasury official, Basil Black- ett, drafted another confidential memorandum for Chancellor Lloyd George. This memo dealt with the \"Effect of War on Our Gold reserves.\" Blackett writes, revealingly, \"It is of course impos- sible clearly to forecast what would be the effect of a general Eu- ropean war in which most of the Continental countries as well as Great Britain were engaged, leaving only New York (assuming the neutrality of the United States) among the big money markets of the world available from which gold could be attracted to the seats of war.\" 1 Equally astonishing, in light of Britain's decision to go to war that fateful August 4, was a letter from Sir George Paish to Lloyd George dated 2 a.m. Saturday morning, August 1,1914: \"Dear Mr. Chancellor, The credit system upon which the business of this country is formed, has completely broken down, and it is of su- preme importance that steps should be taken to repair the mischief without delay; otherwise, we cannot hope to finance a great war if, at its very commencement, our greatest houses are forced into bankruptcy.\" 2 . Specie payments (gold and silver bullion) were promptly sus- pended by the Bank of England, along with the Bank Act of 1844. This decision placed large sums of gold into the hands of the Bank of England, in order that Britain's government could finance food and war materiel purchases for the newly declared war against Germany. Instead of gold, British citizens were given Bank of Eng- land notes as legal tender for the duration of the emergency. By August 4, the British financial establishment was ready for war. But the secret weapon was to emerge later, as the special rela- tionship of' His Majesty's Treasury with the New York banking syndicate of Morgan, as we shall soon see. Oil in the Great War Between 1914 when fighting began and 1918 when it ended, pe- troleum had definitively emerged as the recognized key to success of a revolution in military strategy. The age of air warfare, mobile"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"48   A CENTURY OF WAR tank warfare and swifter naval warfare all depended on abundant and secure supplies of the new fuel. England, under the foreign policy guidance of Sir Edward Grey, precipitated what became the bloodiest, most destructive war in modern history, in the months leading up to August 1914. Accord- ing to official statistics, deaths directly due to the war or indirectly inflicted by it numbered between 16,000,000 and 20,000,000, with the great majority, 10,000,000 or more, being civilian deaths. The British Empire itself incurred more than 500,000 dead and total casualties of almost 2,500,000 in the four-year long world \"war to end all wars.\" Rarely discussed, however, is the fact that the strategic geo-po- litical objectives of England, well before 1914, included not merely the crushing of its greatest industrial rival, Germany, but, through the conquest of war, the securing of unchallenged British control over the precious resource which by 1919 had proven itself as the strategic raw material of future economic development—petro- leum. This was part of what some English establishment strate- gists then termed the Great Game, creation of a new global British Empire, whose hegemony would be unchallenged for the rest of the century, a British-led New World Order. A study of the major theaters of the 1914-1918 Great War reveals the extent to which securing petroleum supplies was already at the center of military planning. Oil had opened the door to a terrify- ing new mobility in modern warfare. The German campaign into Rumania under Field Marshall von Mackensen, had the priority of reorganizing Steaua Romana, the previously English, Dutch, French and Rumanian oil refining, production and pipeline capac- ities, into a single combine. During the course of the war Rumania was the only secure German petroleum supply for her entire air force, tank forces, and U-boats. The British campaign in the Darde- nelles, the disastrous defeat of Gallipoli, was undertaken to secure the oil supplies of the Russian Baku to the Anglo-French war ef- fort. The Ottoman Sultan had embargoed shipments of Russian oil out through the Dardenelles. By 1918, the rich Russian oil fields of Baku on the Caspian Sea were the object of intense military and political effort from the side of Germany, and also Britain, which pre-emptively occupied them for a critical matter of weeks, denying the German General Staff vital oil supplies in the August 1918 period. Denial of Baku was a 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 49 decisive last blow against Germany, which sued for peace some weeks later, only months after it seemed Germany had defeated the Allied forces. It was proven that oil was at the center of geo- politics. By the end of the First World War, no major power was unaware of the vital strategic importance of the new fuel, petroleum, for fu- ture military and economic security. At the end of the Great War, fully 40% of the British naval fleet was oil fired. In 1914, at the onset of the war, the French army had a mere 110 trucks, 60 trac- tors and 132 airplanes. By 1918, four years later, France had in- creased to 70,000 trucks and 12,000 airplanes, while the British and, in the final months the Americans, put 105,000 trucks and over 4,000 airplanes into combat service. The final Anglo-French- American offensives of the war consumed a staggering 12,000 bar- rels of oil daily, on the Western Front. By December 1917, French supplies of oil had become so low that General Foch enveighed on President Clemenceau to send an urgent appeal to President Woodrow Wilson. \"A failure in the sup- ply of petrol would cause the immediate paralysis of our armies, and might compel us to a peace unfavorable to the Allies,\" Cle- menceau wrote to Wilson. \"The safety of the allies is in the balance. If the Allies do not wish to lose the war, then, at the moment of the great German offensive, they must not let France lack the petrol which is as necessary as blood in the battles of tomorrow.\" Rockefeller's Standard Oil group answered Clemenceau's ap- peal, giving Marshall Foch's forces vital petrol. Lacking sufficient Rumanian oil supply as well as access to the Baku, despite a Rus- sian-German Brest-Litovsk agreement to cease hostilities, German forces were unable to successfully mount a final offensive in 1918, as trucks necessary to bring sufficient reserves were unable to se- cure petrol. Britain's Foreign Minister, Lord Curzon commented, quite accu- rately, \"The Allies were carried to victory on a flood of oil...With the commencement of the war, oil and its products began to rank as among the principal agents by which they would conduct, and by which they could win it. Without oil, how could they have pro- cured the mobility of the fleet, the transport of their troops, or the manufacture of several explosives?\" The occasion was a Novem- ber 21,1918 victory dinner, ten days after the armistice ending the war. France's Senator Henry Berenger, director of France's war-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"50 A CENTURY OF WAR time Comite General du Petrole, added that oil was the \"blood of victory. Germany had boasted too much of its superiority in iron and coal, but it had not taken sufficient account of our superiority of oil.\" 3 With this emerging role of petroleum in the war, we should now follow the thread of the postwar Versailles reorganization, with a special eye to British objectives. Britain's creation of the League of Nations through the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919, became a vehicle to give a facade of inter- national legitimacy to a naked imperial territory seizure. For the fi- nancial establishment of the City of London, the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of British lives in order to dominate future world economic development through raw materials control, espe- cially of the new resource oil, was a seemingly small price to pay. England's Secret Eastern War If anything demonstrated the hidden agenda of the British allied powers in the 1914-18 war against the central powers grouped around Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey, it was a secret diplomatic accord signed in 1916, during the heat of battle. The signatories were Britain, France, and later Italy and Czarist Russia. Named after the two officials, English and French, who drafted the paper, the Sykes-Picot Agreement spelled out betrayal, and England's intent to grab commanding control of the undeve- loped petroleum potentials of the Arabian Gulf after the war. While France was occupied with Germany in a bloody and fruit- less slaughter along the French Maginot Line, Britain moved an astonishingly large number of its own soldiers, more than 1,400,000 troops, into the Eastern Theatre. England's public explanation for this extraordinary commit- ment of preciously scarce men and materiel to the eastern reaches of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf, was that this would ensure the more effective fighting capacity of Russia against the Central Powers, as well as to allow Russian grain out through the Darde- nelles into Western Europe where it was badly needed. This was not quite the reality however. Following 1918, England continued to maintain almost one million soldiers stationed 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 51 throughout the Middle East. The Persian Gulf had become an \"English Lake\" by 1919. The angry French feebly protested that, while millions of their forces bled on the Western Front, Britain took advantage of the stalemate to win victories against the weaker Turkish Empire. France had lost almost 1,500,000 soldiers and another 2,600,000 badly wounded. In November 1917, following the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, Lenin's Communists discovered among the documents of the Czarist Foreign Ministry a secret document which they quickly made public. It was a Great Powers' plan to carve up the entire Ot- toman Empire after the war, and parcel out relevant parts to the victorious powers. The details had been worked out in February 1916, and were secretly ratified by the relevant governments in May 1916. The world at large knew nothing of this secret wartime diplomacy. From the British side, Sir Mark Sykes, an adviser on Eastern Af- fairs to Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Secretary of State for War, drafted the document. The document was designed to secure French acquiescence to a huge diversion of British manpower from the European Theatre into the Middle East. To get that French concession, Sykes was authorized to offer French negotiator Georges Picot, former Consul-General in Beirut, valuable postwar concessions in the Arab portion of the Ottoman Empire. France was to get effective control over what was called \"Area A,\" encompassing Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon), including the major inland towns of Aleppo, Hama, Horns and Damascus, as well as the oil-rich Mosul to the northeast, including the oil concessions then held by Deutsche Bank in the Turkish Petroleum Gesellschaft. This French control paid nominal lip service to recognition of Arab \"independence\" from Turkey, under a French \"protectorate.\" Under the Sykes-Picot accord, Britain would control \"Area B\" in the region to the south-east of the French region, from what today is Jordan, east to most of Iraq and Kuwait, including Basra and Baghdad. Further, Britain was to get the ports of Haifa and Acre, and rights to build a railway from Haifa through the French zone to Baghdad, with rights to use it for troop transport. Italy was promised a huge section of the mountainous coastline of Turkish Anatolia and the Dodecanese Islands, while Czarist Russia was to receive the areas of Ottoman Armenia and Kurdi- stan, southwest of Jerevan. 4 ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"52   A CENTURY OF WAR Out of these secret Sykes-Picot paragraphs, the British created the arbitrary divisions which largely exist down to the present day, including the creation of Syria and Lebanon as French \"protecto- rates,\" and Trans-Jordan, Palestine (Israel), Iraq, and Kuwait as English entities. Persia, as we have seen, had been under effective British control since 1905, and Saudi Arabia was considered unim- portant to British strategic interests at that point, one of the few major blunders they were to realize later to their great dismay. Britain had been forced by its relative weakness following the disastrous failure of its Gallipoli Expedition in 1915 to grant France the oil concessions of the Mosul, in addition to recognition of previous French claims over the Levant. But Britain's loss of the Mosul oil riches was only a temporary tactical expedient, in her long-term designs to dominate world petroleum supplies, as we shall see. \"Selling the same horse twice\" When details of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement became pub- lic, the major embarrassment for Britain was the simultaneous and blatantly contradictory assurances England had given Arab lead- ers in order to secure Arab revolt against Turkish rule during the war. Britain had gained the invaluable military assistance of Arab forces under Sherif Husain ibn Ali, the Hashemite Emir of Mecca, and guardian of the Muslim Holy Places of Mecca and Medina. Britain had assured the Arab forces who served under the com- mand of T.E Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\"), that the reward for their help in defeating the Turks would be English assurance of full postwar sovereignty and Arab independence. The assurances were contained in a series of letters between Sir Henry McMahon, England's High Commissioner in Egypt, to Sherif Husain of Mecca, then self-proclaimed leader of the Arabs. Lawrence was fully witting in the British fraud to the Arabs at the time. \"1 risked the fraud,\" he admitted some years later in his memoirs, \"on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and speedy victory in the East, and that better we win and break our word, than lose...The Arab inspiration was our main tool for 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 53 winning the Eastern war. So I assured them that England kept her word in letter and spirit. In this comfort they performed their fine things; but of course, instead of being proud of what we did to- gether, I was continually and bitterly ashamed.\" 5 The loss of 100,000 Arab lives was part of this \"cheap and speedy victory.\" But Britain quickly betrayed those promises in a move to secure to its own interests the vast oil and political riches of the Arab Middle East. Adding insult to injury, once publication of the Sykes-Picot agreement revealed a contrary commitment to France in the Mid- dle East, Great Britain and France issued a new Anglo-French Dec- laration on November 7,1918, four days before the European Ar- mistice ending the war with Germany. The new declaration in- sisted that Britain and France were fighting for \"the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks, and the establishment of national governments and admin- istrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.\" 6 That noble result never came about. Once the solemn pledges of Versailles had been signed, Britain, with its approximately one million strong military force in the region, established its military supremacy over the French area of the Middle East as well. By September 30, 1918, France had agreed to British terms for creating what were called \"zones of temporary military occupa- tion.\" Under this agreement, the British would occupy Turkish Palestine under what was called Occupied Enemy Territory Ad- ministration, along with the other parts of the British sphere. Knowing French inability to significantly deploy troops into the designated French areas, after the exhaustion of war in Europe, Britain generously offered to act as the overall supreme military and administrative guardian, with General Sir Edmund Allenby, Commander-in-Chief Egyptian Expeditionary Force, as the de facto military dictator over the entire Arab Middle East after 1918, including the French sphere. In a private discussion in London in December 1918, British Prime Minister Lloyd George told France's Clemenceau that Britain wanted France to attach the \"Mosul to Iraq, and Palestine from Dan to Beersheba under British control.\" In return, France was said to have been assured of the remaining claims to Greater Syria, as well as a half share in the exploitation of Mosul oil, and a guarantee of British support in the postwar pe-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"54   A CENTURY OF WAR riod in Europe, should France ever have to \"respond\" to German action on the Rhine. 7 This private understanding set the stage for later events in a pro- foundly tragic manner. Arthur Balfour's strange letter to Lord Rothschild Postwar British designs for redrawing the military and eco- nomic map of the Ottoman Empire included an extraordinary new element for its completion—more extraordinary, in that the advo- cates of the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine were Eng- lish \"Gentile Zionists\" for the most part, including Lloyd George. 8 On November 2,1917, in the darkest days of the Great War, with Russia's war effort on behalf of the Anglo-French alliance collaps- ing under economic chaos and the Bolshevik seizure of power, and with the might of America not yet fully engaged in Europe as a combatant on the side of Britain, Britain's Foreign Secretary, Ar- thur Balfour, sent the following letter to Walter Lord Rothschild, representative of the English Federation of Zionists: \"Dear Lord Rothschild, I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration of sym- pathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet: 'His Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours for the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may preju- dice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country.' I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation. Yours sincerely, Arthur fames Balfour\" 9 The letter was the basis on which a post-1919 British League of Nations Mandate over Palestine was established, and under whose guiding hand, territorial changes of global consequences were to be wrought. The almost casual reference to \"existing non- Jewish communities in Palestine\" by Balfour and the Cabinet was 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 55 a reference to the more than 85% of the existing population, who were Palestinian Arabs. In 1917, less than 1% of the inhabitants of Palestine were Jewish. It is notable that the letter was an exchange between two close friends. Both Balfour and Walter Lord Rothschild were members of an emerging imperialist faction in Britain, which sought to create an enduring global Empire, one based on more sophisti- cated methods of social control. Also notable, is the fact that Lord Rothschild spoke, not as head of any international organization of Jewry, but rather as a member of the English Federation of Zionists, whose president at the time was Chaim Weizmann. Rothschild money had essentially created that organization, and had subsidized since 1900 the emigration of hundreds of Jews fleeing Poland and Russia to Palestine, through the Jewish Colonisation Association, of which England's Lord Rothschild was president for life. England was generous in offer- ing lands far away from her shores, while in the same period she was far from having open arms to welcome persecuted Jewish ref- ugees to her own shores. But more relevant than the evident hypocrisy in the Balfour- Rothschild exchange, was the British geopolitics which lay behind the Balfour note. It is not insignificant that the geographical loca- tion for the new British-sponsored Jewish homeland lay in one of the most strategic areas along the main artery of the enlarged post- 1914 British Empire, in a sensitive position along the route to India as well as in relation to the newly-won Arab petroleum lands of Ottoman Turkey. A minority settlement under British protectorate in Palestine, argued Balfour and others in London, would give London strategic possibilities of enormous importance. It was, to say the least, a cynical ploy from the side of Balfour and his circle. Balfour backs the new concept of Empire Beginning approximately in the early 1890's, a group of English policy elites, primarily from the privileged colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, formed what was to become the most influential poli- cy network in Britain over the next half century and more. The group denied its existence as a formal group, but its footprints can"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"56 A CENTURY OF WAR be found around the establishment of a new journal of Empire, The Round Table, founded in 1910. The group argued that a more subtle and more efficient system of global empire was required to extend the effective hegemony of Anglo-Saxon culture into the next century. At the time of its inception, this \"Round Table\" group as it was sometimes called, was explicitly anti-German and pro-Empire. Writing in the Round Table in August 1911, three years before Eng- land declared war against Germany, the influential Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian) declared, \"There are at present two codes of inter- national morality—the British or Anglo-Saxon and the continental or German. Both cannot prevail. If the British Empire is not strong enough to be a real influence for fair dealing between nations, the reactionary standards of the German bureaucracy will triumph, and it will then only be a question of time before the British Em- pire itself is victimized by an international 'hold-up' on the lines of the Agadif incident. Unless the British people are strong enough to make it impossible for backward rivals to attack them with any pros- pect of success, they will have to accept the political standards of the ag- gressive military powers.\" 10 In place of costly military occupation of British colonies, they argued for a more repressive tolerance shaped around creation of a British \"Commonwealth of Nations,\" which were to be given the illusion of independence, enabling England also to reduce the costs of expensive far-flung armies of occupation from India to Egypt, and now across Africa and the Middle East. The term \"in- formal empire\" was sometimes used to describe the shift. This emerging faction was grouped around the influential Lon- don Times, and included such voices as Albert Lord Grey, historian and member of British secret intelligence Arnold Toynbee, as well as H.G. Wells, Alfred Lord Milner of the South Africa project, and the proponent of a new field termed geopolitics, Halford J. Mack- inder, of the London School of Economics. Its principal think-tank became the Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham House), formed in the corridors of Versailles in 1919. The idea of a Jewish-dominated Palestine, beholden to England for its tenuous survival and surrounded by a balkanized group of squabbling Arab states, formed part of this group's concept of a new British Empire. Mackinder, commenting at the time of the Versailles peace conference, described his influential group's vi- 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 57 sion of the role a British protectorate over Palestine would play in the of British advance toward a post-1918 global empire, to be shaped around the new British-defined and dominated League of Nations. Mackinder described how the more far-thinking of the British establishment viewed their Palestine project in 1919: \"If the World- Island be inevitably the principle seat of humanity on this globe, and if Arabia, as the passage-land from Europe to the Indies and from the Northern to the Southern Heartland, be central to the World-Island, then the hill citadel of Jerusalem has a strategical position with reference to world-realities not differing essentially from its ideal position in the perspective of the Middle Ages, or its strategical position between ancient Babylon and Egypt.\" He noted that \"the Suez Canal carries the rich traffic between the Indies and Europe to within striking distance of an army based on Palestine, and already the trunk railway is being built through the coastal plain by Jaffa, which will connect the Southern with the Northern Heartland.\" Commenting on the special significance of the thinking behind his friend Balfour's 1917 proposal to Lord Rothschild, Mackinder noted, \"The Jewish national seat in Palestine will be one of the most important outcomes of the war. That is a subject on which we can now afford to speak the truth...a national home at the physical and his- torical center of the world, should make the Jew 'range' (sic) him- self ...There are those who try to distinguish between the Jewish re- ligion and the Hebrew race, but surely the popular view of their broad identity is not far wrong.\" 11 Their grand design was to link England's vast colonial posses- sions, from the gold and diamond mines of Cecil Rhodes' and Rothschild's Consolidated Gold Fields in South Africa, north to Egypt and the vital shipping route through the Suez Canal, and on through Mesopotamia, Kuwait and Persia into India in the East. British conquest of the German colony of Tanganyika (German East Africa) in central Africa in 1916 was not a decisive battle in a war to bring Germany to the Peace table; it constituted completion of a vital link in this chain of British imperial control, from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo. The Great Power able to control this vast reach would control the world's most valuable strategic raw materials from gold, the basis of the international Gold Standard for world trade, to petroleum,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"58   A CENTURY OF WAR emerging as the energy source of the modern industrial era in 1919. This has remained as much geopolitical reality in the 1990's as it was in 1919. With such control, every nation on earth would fall under the sceptre of the Britannic Empire. Until his death in 1902, Cecil Rhodes was the prime financial backer of this elite new \"in- formal empire\" group. The Boer War (1899-1902) was a project of the group, financed and personally instigated by Rhodes in order to secure firm Eng- lish control of the vast mineral wealth of the Transvaal, at that time in control of a Dutch-origin Boer minority. The war itself, in which Winston Churchill rose to public notice, was precipitated by Rhodes and Alfred Milner, and others of their circle, in order to bring what was believed to be the world's richest gold-producing region firmly under British control. The Transvaal held the world's largest gold discovery since the 1848 California Gold Rush, and its capture was essential to the continued role of London as the capitol of the world's financial system and of its gold standard. Lord Milner, Jan Smuts and Rhodes all were part of the new Empire faction which defeated the independent Boers, and created a Union of South Africa as part of their Great Game. 12 Thus, by 1920 Britain had succeeded in establishing her firm con- trol over all of southern Africa, including former German South West Africa, as well as the newly-discovered vast petroleum wealth of the former Ottoman Empire, by means of its military presence, conflicting promises, and the establishment of a British Protecto- rate over Palestine as a new Jewish homeland. But all accounts were not quite in order in 1920. The British Empire had come out of the war as bankrupt as she had entered it, if not more so. 4 - OIL BECOMES THE WEAPON, THE NEAR EAST THE BATTLEGROUND 59 Footnotes: 1.

One small detail, pushed to the background during the actual conduct of war from 1914 to 1918, however, was that this victory was secured on bor- rowed money. American savings amounting to billions of dollars, organized by the Wall Street house of J.R Morgan & Co., were a decisive compo- nent of the British victory. At the time of the Versailles Peace con- ference in 1919, England owed the United States the staggering sum of $4.7 billion in war debts, while its own domestic economy was in a deep postwar depression, its industry in shambles, and domestic price inflation 300% higher after the four years of war. The British national debt had increased more than nine-fold, some 924% from 1913 to the end of the war in 1918, to a then-enormous sum of 7.4 billion Pounds Sterling. If the British Empire emerged as the territorial victor of Ver- sailles, the United States, or at least certain powerful international banking and industrial interests, emerged with the clear idea that they, and no longer Britain, were now the most powerful world ec- onomic power in the early 1920's. For the next several years, a bit- ter and almost bloody power struggle took place between British and American international interests to settle this question. By the beginning of the 1920's, the three pillars of English impe- rial power—control of world sea-lanes, control of world banking and finance, and control of strategic raw materials—were each 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS 61 under threat from a newly-created American \"internationalist\" es- tablishment. Trained for decades by London, this \"Anglophile\" American grouping decided it no longer needed to remain the do- cile pupil. For the coming decade, a bitter struggle between the combined but conflicting goals of Britain and the United States was fought. The seeds of the Second World War were planted in this same conflict. The stakes were enormous. Would the United States emerge as the world's dominant political superpower by virtue of her eco- nomic status? Or would she remain a useful, but distinctly junior partner, in a British dominated Anglo-American condominium after Versailles? In other words, would the capital of the new world empire after Versailles remain London, or would it become Washington? The answer was not at all obvious in 1920. Indicative of the intensity of this Anglo-American economic and political rivalry was a dispatch in 1921 from the British Ambassa- dor to Washington, who told the Foreign Office in London, \"The central ambition of the realist school of American politicians is to win for America the position of leading nation in the world, and also of leader among the English-speaking nations. To do this, they intend to have the strongest navy and the largest mercantile ma- rine. They intend also to prevent us from paying our debt by send- ing goods to America and they look for an opportunity to treat us as a vassal state so long as our debt remains unpaid.\" 1 Since the 1870s, Britain's most important foreign investment market had been the United States, in the form of railroad and other investments, through relations built up with select New York banking houses. Accordingly, in October 1914, the British War Office dispatched a special representative to neutral America, to arrange purchase of war materials and other vital supplies for what was then seen as a relatively short war. By January 1915, four months into the Great War, the British gov- ernment had named a private New York banking house, J.R Mor- gan & Co., to be its sole purchasing agent for all war supplies from the neutral United States. Morgan was designated Britain's exclu- sive financial agent for all British war lending from private U.S. banks as well. In a short time, Britain in turn became the guaran- tor for all such war purchases and loans by the French, Italians, and Russians in the war against the German-Austrian continental powers. It was a giant credit pyramid, on top of which sat the in-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"62 A CENTURY OF WAR fluential American House of Morgan. Never had a single banking house gambled on such high and risky global stakes. The British Empire and Britain herself were virtually bankrupt on the outbreak of war in 1914, as we have noted. But British fi- nancial officials were confident of the backing from the United States and the Anglophile circles of New York banking. The role of Morgan and the New York financial community was supremely important to the war efforts of the Entente Powers. Under an exclusive arrangement, purchase of all American muni- tions, war materials, as well as necessary grains and food supplies for Britain, France and the other Allied powers in Europe, was tun- neled through the House of Morgan. Morgan also utilized its Lon- don affiliate, Morgan Grenfell & Co., whose senior partner, E.C. Grenfell, was a director of the Bank of England, and an intimate friend of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George. Morgan's Paris office, Morgan Harjes & Co. completed the essential Entente circle. Such power in the hands of one single investment house, given the scale of British war requirements, was without precedent. Morgan, with its franchise as sole purchasing agent for the en- tire Entente group, became virtual arbiter over the future of U.S. industrial and agriculture export economy. Morgan decided who would, or would not, be favored with highly profitable and very sizeable export orders to the European war effort against Ger- many. Firms such as DuPont Chemicals grew into multinational giants as a result of their privileged ties to Morgan. Remington and Win- chester arms companies were also favored Morgan \"friends.\" Major grain trading companies grew up in the Midwest as well, to feed Morgan's European clients. The relations were incestuous, as most of the Morgan loans raised privately for the British and French were raised through the corporate resources of DuPont and friends, in return for a guarantee of the huge European muni- tions market. The position of this private banking house was all the more re- markable, since at this time Woodrow Wilson's White House was professing strict neutrality. But that neutrality became a thinly veiled fraud, as billions of dollars of vital war supplies and cred- its flowed to the British side over the next years. As purchasing agent alone, Morgan took a 2% commission on the net price of all 1880-1914 In 1882, Britain's Admiral \"Jack\" Fisher began the battle to convert the Royal Navy from coal to oil fuel.

The business grew so large, that Morgan took in E.R. Stettinius, later to become Secretary of State, as a senior Mor- gan partner to handle war purchases for what was becoming a col- losal operation. All of this activity was in strict violation of international law re- garding a neutral, which forbade allowing belligerents to build supply bases in neutral countries. In a U.S. Senate inquiry, Morgan himself was later charged of having made excess profits, and of having directed purchases to firms in which Morgan partners had an interest. By 1917, the British War Office had placed purchase or- ders totalling more than $20,000,000,000 through the House of Morgan. This is not to mention the direct loans raised by Britain, France, et al, through Morgan and this New York financial syndi- cate. In 1915, U.S. Treasury Secretary McAdoo convinced a nervous President Wilson that such private American loans were necessary in order to \"maintain American exports.\" The flows continued. By 1915, American exports to Britain had increased 68% from the level of 1913. By the eve of American war entry in 1917 on the side of Britain, the Entente powers had raised some $1,250,000,000 through the private efforts of Morgan, Citibank, and the other major New York investment houses, a staggering sum in that day. Morgan's relation to the financial powers of the newly-created New York Federal Reserve Bank, under control of former J.P Mor- gan banker, Governor Benjamin Strong, was essential to the suc- cess of the private financial mobilization. Even so, the risky enter- prise several times threatened to break down. The threat in January 1917 of British and French collapse, after Russia fell back in exhaustion from the war effort, provided more than enough incentive for Morgan and this New York financial community to mobilize their combined propaganda and other re- sources. They did this with the careful assistance of the highest levels of British secret intelligence and friendly American press outlets, when it became clear nothing else but U.S. war entry would turn the looming disaster in Europe facing J.P. Morgan and Morgan's European clients. They organized for America to enter the Euro- pean war on the \"right\" side—in support of British interests. Mor- gan & Co, and Britain as well, faced complete financial ruin by early 1917, had they not succeeded."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"64   A CENTURY OF WAR Fortunately for Morgan and for London, German General Erich Ludendorff provided the basis for the Anglo-Morgan interests to avert financial ruin. In February 1917, Germany declared unre- stricted submarine warfare in an attempt to block supply of Amer- ican oil tankers to the British-allied Europeans, among other things. The sinking of American ships was the excuse needed for the Mor- gan-tied press to demand an end to American neutrality. 2 . Once the Congress of the United States declared war against Ger- many on April 2,1917, the New York financial community, with the backing of the New York Federal Reserve's Governor Strong, launched the most ambitious financial operation in history. Had Woodrow Wilson not been persuaded to sign the Federal Reserve Act into law on Dec. 23,1913, it is questionable whether the United States would have ever committed the resources it did to a war in Europe. Without the new law, it is also doubtful whether Britain would have launched her bold designs against the rival em- pires of the Continent in August 1914. The House of Morgan and the powerful international financial interests of the City of London played the critical role in shaping a U.S. Federal Reserve System in the months just before the outbreak of the European war. In stark contrast to the German experience when the Reichstag severely restricted financial speculation in the 1890' s, the group of interests which shaped the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 were dom- inated to the last man by the elite circles of the House of Morgan, for the benefit of New York's emerging role as an international capital center. New York bankers were beginning to adopt the style of British imperial finance. In August 1917, the Federal Reserve mobilized sales of Liberty Loans and bonds to finance U.S. Government war costs. Bonds of the U.S. Treasury sold to private investors in this great \"patriotic\" mobilization, were sold through Morgan and the other leading New York investment houses. The total of these Liberty Loans and bonds was a breathtaking sum of more than $21,478,000,000 by June 30,1919. Never before in history had such sums been mobi- lized in such a short time. Morgan's commission on this business was handsome, indeed. By 1920, Morgan partner, Thomas W Lamont, noted with obvi- ous satisfaction that, as a result of the four years of war and global devastation, \"the national debts of the world have increased by $210,000,000,000 or about 475% in the last six years, and as a natu- 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS   65   ral consequence, the variety of government bonds and the num- ber of investors in them have been greatly multiplied.\" Lamont added, \"These results have made themselves manifest in all the in- vestment markets of the world; but nowhere, perhaps, in greater measure than in the United States.\" 3 Once the House of Morgan and the allied New York investment community had tasted the role of the world's leading financial power, they seemed willing to do anything to keep their grip on that power. Morgan's men, including Thomas Lamont and fellow Wall Street crony Bernard Baruch, sat at the table during the closed-door Ver- sailles sessions which drew up the \"bill\" for the Great War. They jointly established a special permanent Commission for Repara- tions in order to determine the precise amount and means for Ger- many to repay its war damages against the Entente powers. Being good conservative bankers, Morgan and friends could not let the war loans of the British and allied powers simply be forgot- ten in the euphoria of peace, despite assumptions of A.J. Balfour and others in the British government that such magninimity would follow. Morgan & Co. had quietly shifted their private Brit- ish government loans over to the general debt of the U.S. Treasury as soon as the U.S. officially entered the war, in effect making the British debts the burden of the American taxpayers after the war. Despite this, Morgan interests made sure they had a major stake in the postwar Versailles reparations financing. As U.S. war debt had grown beyond anything known before in U.S. history, the dis- tinction between Morgan's interests and that of the U.S. Govern- ment became blurred. The U.S. Government increasingly made it- self simply a useful instrument for the extension of the new power of New York's international bankers. New York Banks challenge the City of London During the course of the Versailles talks, a new institution of Anglo-American coordination in strategic affairs was formed. Lionel Curtis, a longtime member of the secretive Round Table or \"new Empire\" circle of Balfour, Milner and others, proposed orga- nizing a Royal Institute of International Affairs during a private"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"66 A CENTURY OF WAR gathering held in the midst of the Versailles deliberations, in the Hotel Majestic on May 30,1919. Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), Lord Robert Cecil and other members of the Round Table circle were in that formative meeting. The first nominal mission of the new insti- tute would be to write the \"official\" history of the Versailles peace conference. The Royal Institute received an initial endowment of 2,000 Pounds Sterling from Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan. Histo- rian Arnold J. Toynbee was the institute's first paid staff member. The same circle at Versailles also decided to establish an Ameri- can branch of the London Institute, to be named the New York Council on Foreign Relations, in order to obscure its close British ties. The New York Council was initially composed almost entirely of the Morgan men and financed by Morgan money. It was hoped that this tie would serve to weld American interests into harmony with England's after Versailles. This was not to occur for some years, however. 4 It took the entirety of the 1920's in often bitter, almost military, conflicts over war-debt repayment terms, rubber agreements, naval accords, the parity of a new Gold Standard and, most signif- icantly, control of untapped oil regions of the world, before the Anglo-American condominium emerged in its present form, and before the policy harmony between the circles of Morgan's Coun- cil on Foreign Relations and London's Royal Institute could take hold. In 1922, a Wall St. lawyer, John Foster Dulles, a key partici- pant at the Versailles talks who had authored the Treaty's Article 231, the infamous German \"war guilt clause,\" wrote in the Coun- cil on Foreign Affairs magazine Foreign Affairs about the thinking of Morgan and his fellow New York bankers. It was quite simple, he stated: \"There cannot be a war without losses. The resulting losses are measured by debts. The debt assumes varying forms— internal, reparations, Inter-Allied, etc.—and is generally repre- sented by bonds or notes.\" Dulles calculated that Britain and the other Allied Powers owed the U.S. $12,500,000,000 at 5% interest. Britain, France, and the other Entente countries, in turn, were owed the sum of $33,000,000,000 by Germany, according to the Versailles demands. The figures were beyond the imagination at that time. The sum, 132 billion Gold Marks, was decided finally in May, 1921. Ger- many was offered a six-day ultimatum to accept or, if she rejected, the industrial Ruhr Valley would be militarily occupied. This lat- 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS 67 ter issue was to reemerge soon after, and a global fight for oil played a crucial motivating role in the background. Germany, the main target of Versailles negotiators, had also lost valuable raw material resources, as all her colonial possessions were taken away at Versailles. Her 25% share of the Turkish Petro- leum Gesellschaft was seized, and ultimately given over to France by Britain. The American Congress refused to sign the Versailles Treaty and the included League of Nations apparatus to enforce it, but Mor- gan and the New York Federal Reserve axis proceeded to domi- nate the financial destiny of Europe in the postwar period. The combined burden of the German reparations debt, as well as the Inter-Allied debts of the respective \"victors\"—war debts of France, Italy, Belgium to Britain, and in turn, of Britain to the United States—overwhelmed all of world finance and monetary policy from 1919 through to the October 1929 crash on Wall Street. The entire pyramid of post-Versailles international finance was built upon the edifice of the punitive war debt structure. Morgan and the now powerful New York banks refused to compromise on the debt issue. The scale of Europe's combined war debt burden was so large, that its annual debt service demands on the world financial system were greater than the entire annual foreign trade of the United States during the 1920s. New York's international banking community redirected world capital flows to the service of this staggering debt burden. Debt-servicing was carried out at the ex- pense of the desperately needed investment into rebuilding and modernizing the war-torn economies of Europe. J.P. Morgan & Co. enjoyed the competitive advantages of a dev- astated European economy in which New York credit could dic- tate the terms. For them, profits from the new European lending were greater than gains from investment in postwar U.S. economic growth and expansion. New York financial interests centered around Morgan and the New York Federal Reserve under Mor- gan-man Benjamin Strong deliberately kept U.S. interest rates low. As a consequence, American loans flooded postwar Europe and the rest of the world, where capital earned a higher risk premium than at home, while London and the new Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, nervously watched American finan- cial incursion into their traditional markets."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"68 A CENTURY OF WAR Early postwar Anglo-American rivalry in the vital banking area reached an alarming level when the U.S. threatened to coopt the gold and raw materials center of the British Empire in 1924, only two decades earlier secured through the bloody Boer War. In late 1924, the South African government invited an interna- tional commission headed by American financial expert, Princeton Prof. Edwin W. Kemmerer, to give advice on whether South Africa should return to an international Gold Standard, regardless of whether Britain did or not. As late as 1924, the devastation of the war had still prevented Britain from being able to return to a Gold Standard without suffering severe economic hardship, at a time when England still had one and half million unemployed. Kemmerer told the South Africans they should establish direct financial ties to New York banks, and bypass their traditional de- pendence on London. As powerful financial interests in the City of London well knew, this would open the door for the U.S. to eco- nomically co-opt what England had militarily fought to secure, and with it, gain dominant U.S. power over the world gold sup- ply, and thereby power over world credit. London acted quickly to preempt this consequence, but the wound did not heal rapidly. 5 British interests benefited from the much-discussed retreat of the United States during Versailles, into a neo-isolationism. The U.S. Congress turned away from Wilson's support of the British League of Nations idea, as well as most features of the new world order emerging out of the Carthaginian Versailles deliberations. With America in the background, Britain could move aggressively in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East to establish her vital long- term hegemony. But it became increasingly clear that powerful American bank- ing and petroleum interests were anything but isolationist. British power would have to either defeat this threat, or effectively co-opt it into a new Atlantic Union. England Moves for Oil Supremacy The ink on the Versailles treaty had barely dried when powerful American oil interests of the Rockefeller Standard Oil companies realized that they had been skillfully cut out of the spoils of war 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS   69   by their British alliance partners. The newly-carved Middle East boundaries, as well as the markets of postwar Europe, were dom- inated by British Government interests through its covert owner- ship of Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In April 1920, without American participation, ministers of the Allied Supreme Council met in San Remo, Italy to work out the de- tails of which country got what oil interests in the former Ottoman Middle East. Britain's Prime Minister Lloyd George and French Premier Alexandre Millerand formalized the San Remo Agree- ment, which gave France a 25% share of oil exploited by the Brit- ish from Mesopotamia (Iraq), while it was agreed that Mesopota- mia would become a British Mandate under the aegis of the new League of nations. The French were given what had been the 25% German Deuts- che Bank share of the old Turkish Petroleum Gesellschaft, which was \"acquired\" from the Germans as part of the spoils of Ver- sailles. The remaining 75% control of the huge Mesopotamian oil concession was directly in the hands of the British government through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Royal Dutch Shell. The French government created a new state-backed company, Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (CFP) the following year, under leadership of French industrialist Ernest Mercier, to develop its new Mesopotamian interests. Sir Henry Deterding, a naturalized British citizen who headed Royal Dutch Shell, and served as an intimate influential of British secret intelligence in that capacity, had secured dominant control over the huge untapped oil reserves of the Mosul and Mesopota- mia by promising France a share for its needs in neighboring French Syria. The San Remo agreement itself was the work of Sir John Cadman, then head of the Petroleum Imperial Policy Com- mittee, later head of the UK government's Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Cadman and Deterding privately shaped the terms of the San Remo accord. Not surprisingly, British state petroleum hegemony was greatly enhanced by it. Under the San Remo Agreement, Britain \"gave\" France 25% of all petroleum extracted in Mesopotamia. France, in return, granted generous rights to the British oil companies to run an oil pipeline through French Syria to an oil port on the Mediterranean. The pipeline and everything related to it, were to be exempt from French taxation. Cadman calculated that the lack of substantial"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"70 A CENTURY OF WAR French oil capacities would ensure virtual British monopoly of the emerging oil wealth of the entire Middle East. The San Remo agreements included a clause which allowed Britain to exclude any foreign concessions on its territories. In addition, San Remo formalized an agreement whereby France would harmonize policy with England over oil relations with both Romania, and Bolshevik Russia. The consequences of the latter ag- reement will become clear shortly. With France far more weakened by the war economically than Britain, San Remo appeared to be a coup by London, to ensure French support for a global oil domin- ion centered around the oil riches of the Arab Middle East of the old Ottoman Empire. Churchill and the Arab Bureau In March 1921, His Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Co- lonial Affairs, Winston Churchill, convened some 40 top British experts on the Near East in Cairo, to discuss ultimate political di- visions in the newly-won territories of the region. Out of this gath- ering, at which all top British Arabists, including Churchill's close friend T.E. Lawrence, Sir Percy Cox, Gertrude Bell and others were present, the British Colonial Office Middle East Department was created, superseding, in effect, the 1916 Arab Bureau. Under the scheme agreed on in Cairo, Mesopotamia was renamed Iraq and given to the son of Hashemite Husain ibn Ali of Mecca, Feisal bin Husain. British Royal Air Force planes were permanently based in Iraq and the administration of Feisal's Iraq was placed under the effective control of Anglo-Persian Oil Company officials. When the U.S. State Department registered its official protest on behalf of American Standard Oil companies eager to share the con- cessions in the Middle East, British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon sent a curt reply to the British Ambassador in Washington on April 21,1921, that no concessions were to be allowed American compa- nies in the British Middle East. 6 The San Remo accord ignited a fierce battle for control of world oil between British and American interests, which raged through the 1920's and played a decisive part in shaping the form of U.S. and British diplomatic and trade relations to the new Bolshevik re- 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS 71 gime in the Soviet Union in the critical first years under Lenin, and later Stalin. Alarmed American oil and banking interests feared Britain was well on the way to securing a global monopoly on oil at U.S. ex- pense. Deterding's Royal Dutch Shell had an iron grip on the vast oil concessions of the Dutch East Indies, on Persia, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and most of the postwar Middle East. Latin America became then the focus for a fierce battle between British and American interests into the 1920's. A Battle for Control of Mexico Shortly after the discovery of huge petroleum reserves in the coastal Mexican town of Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico in 1910, U.S. President Wilson sent American troops into Mexico. The real objective was not to defeat the Mexican regime as such, but Brit- ish interests behind that regime. In 1912, Using a minor incident in which U.S. Marines were detained while in the Tampico Port as a pretext, President Wilson ordered the U.S. naval fleet to take Vera Cruz. U.S. Marines landed under fire and seized the Mexican Cus- toms House in an encounter in which 20 Americans and 200 Mex- icans perished. Their objective was to oust the regime of General Victoriano Hu- erta, which had been placed in power and was financially backed by the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. Mexican Eagle presi- dent, Weetman Pearson, later Lord Cowdray, was an English oil promoter who had been recruited to the British Intelligence Ser- vice, and who worked closely with Deterding and Shell in carving out Mexico's oil potentials for British interests. Mexican Eagle had managed to obtain concessions for half of Mexico's oil by the time of Wilson's invasion. With clear expectations of a coming war with Germany, Britain decided tactfully to back away from Huerta's regime, and General Venustiano Carranza's government was immediately recognized as the legitimate one by President Wilson. Rockefeller's Standard Oil ran guns and money to Carranza, including $100,000 in cash and large fuel credits. U.S. oil had taken Mexico from British oil. At the time, Tampico's wells were the world's envy, with one well,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"72 A CENTURY OF WAR Cerro Azul, pumping a record 200,000 barrels of oil per day. When Carranza then proceeded to act to defend Mexican na- tional economic interests rather than those of American oil com- panies, he became the target of an intense campaign in which Stan- dard Oil financially backed the roving bandit, Pancho Villa, against Carranza in 1916. General Pershing, just prior to the U.S. entry into the European war, was sent into Mexico with troops for a brief and unsuccessful mission. With U.S. entry into the European War on the side of Eng- land imminent, Britain and America mutually decided to boycott Mexico under Carranza. Fortunately for Mexico, exigencies of war more or less left the country with a respite from the Anglo-Amer- ican oil wars, and Carranza remained president until 1920, when, following Versailles, he was assassinated. But among the legacies Carranza left behind him was Mexico's first national Constitution, approved in 1917, which contained a special paragraph 27, vesting the Nation with \"direct ownership of all minerals, petroleum and all hydro-carbons—solid, liquid, or gaseous...\" The only ground on which non-Mexican nationals could obtain concessions to develop oil, was to agree to full sover- eignty of Mexican law in their business affairs, without interfer- ence from foreign governments. Nontheless, British and American oil interests continued a fierce behind-the-scenes battle for Mexico's oil into the 1920's, lasting until the late 1930's, when a de- cisive nationalization of all foreign oil holdings by the Cardenas government led the British and American oil majors to boycott Mexico for the next 40 years. The secret of British Oil control During the time from the discovery of major oil fields in 1910 into the mid-1920's, the British company, Mexican Eagle Petro- leum Ltd. under chairman Weetman Pearson (Lord Cowdray), was able to maintain a strong presence in Mexican oil exploitation, representing itself as a counter to the demands of the American Rockefeller oil companies. Pearson worked for British Secret Intelligence, as did all other major British oil groups. In 1926, he sold his Mexican Eagle inter- P' 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS   73   ests to Deterding's Royal Dutch Shell group. Pearson became Lord Cowdray, and his Mexican oil fortune was established in a pro- tected trust, the Pearson Group, which as remains today one of the most influential corporate groups in Britain. It owns the publish- ing enterprises of the London Economist and the Financial Times, and a significant share of the influential London-New York-Paris merchant bank, Lazard Freres. In global pursuit of major oil reserves, the policy of the British Foreign Office, Secret Intelligence services, and British oil inter- ests, were intermeshed in a secret and highly effective manner, as no other country's, were at this time, with the possible exception of Bolshevik Russia. 7 By the early 1920'S/ the British Government controlled a formid- able arsenal of apparently private companies which in reality served the direct interests of Her Majesty's Government to domi- nate and ultimately control all the identified major regions be- lieved to contain significant petroleum deposits. Four companies played an instrumental role, all of which were an integral part of British 1 Secret Intelligence activities. Royal Dutch Shell, despite its name, had passed into the secret control of parties who were proxies for the British government. Deterding, a Dutchman, first saw the potential of petroleum as a civil servant in Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, and rose to be- come president of a small Dutch lamp oil company using Indone- sian oil, the Royal Dutch Oil Company. In 1897, Deterding realized the crucial importance of his control- ling the vast overseas terms of trade, and formed a strategic alli- ance with a ship transport company. He merged his Royal Dutch Oil Co. with the London-based Shell Transport & Trading Co. of the shrewd English shipping magnate Marcus Samuel Lord Bearsted, the man who built the world's first oil transport tanker ship. The alliance between Deterding's Royal Dutch and Samuel's Shell Transport & Trading Co. created the world's most powerful trust, not least because it enjoyed the covert backing of the British gov- ernment. It soon rivalled the leading Rockefeller Standard Oil group even within America, through California Oil Fields Ltd and Roxana Petroleum Co. of Oklahoma, both wholly owned by Shell from abroad, but exempt from the U.S. anti-trust laws which re- stricted Rockefeller's Standard Oil in the United States. At the same time that they created Anglo-Persian Oil Company"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"74 A CENTURY OF WAR to exploit for the exclusive interest of the British government the oil resources of Persia and the Middle East, the British authorities created another related company, little-known but intimately tied to British Foreign Office and secret Intelligence Services world- wide in the quest for control of future oil discoveries. The com- pany was called The d'Arcy Exploitation Company. The battle for oil had assumed a markedly political character by the early 1920's, and Britain's d'Arcy Exploitation Company was in the midst of the politics. \"The agents of the d'Arcy Exploitation Company in Central America or West Africa, China or Bolivia, seem always first of all the agents of the British government,\" noted one contemporary. 8 Finally, the fourth entity of the English Government's world- wide secret oil war at this time was a nominally Canadian com- pany, headed by a Mr. Alves, called British Controlled Oilfields, or BCO. BCO was also secretly owned by His Majesty's Britannic Government, as were Shell and the others. Alves' mission was to secure key new oil provinces for Britain in Central and South America, countering the designs of the American Rockefeller com- panies. Alves secured British recognition of the Tinoco government in Costa Rica in 1918, in return for which his BCO was rewarded with an oil concession covering seven million acres near the Panama border and the important Canal Zone. The U.S. had refused to rec- ognize Tinoco, and in 1921, when a border dispute \"arose\" be- tween Panama and Costa Rica, the U.S. intervened in what was dubbed the Central American \"toy war\" on behalf of a new Costa Rican regime which immediately declared all previous conces- sions of the deposed Tinoco regime, most especially that with BCO, to be \"null and void.\" American oil companies immediately obtained large new concessions, and the new Costa Rica regime found itself able to secure large new loans from New York banks on easy credit terms. At that point, BCO moved south to Maracaibo in Venezuela where, in 1922, large prolific new wells had been discovered near the mouth of the Orinoco. Alves had secured the largest wells for his British Controlled Oilfields. Royal Dutch Shell was quick to follow, setting up its wholly-owned Venezuelan Oil Concessions Ltd, and Colon Development Co. Of course, Rockefeller's Stan- dard Oil Company, through the Standard Oil Company of Vene- 5 - COMBINED & CONFLICTING GOALS   75   zuela, was soon fighting for hegemony as well, in what was to be- come one of the most important petroleum countries in the world in the early 1920's. The successes of the British, with their unique reliance on secret backing by their government, able to utilize British Secret Intelli- gence services worldwide, were considerable. In 1912, on the eve of the Great War, England commanded no more than 12% of world oil production through British companies. By 1925, she controlled the major part of the world's future supplies of petroleum. In an article in a British bank journal, Sperling's Journal, dated September 1919, Sir Edward Mackay Edgar, reviewed the overall situation: \"I should say that two-thirds of the improved fields of Central and South America are in British hands...The Alves group (British Con- trolled Oilfields), whose holdings encircle practically two-thirds of the Caribbean Sea, is wholly British, working under arrangements which ensure that perpetual control of its undertakings shall remain in British hands...Or take again that greatest of all oil organizations, the Shell group. It owns exclusively or controls interests in every im- portant oilfield in the world, including in the United States, Russia, Mexico, the Dutch East Indies, Rumania, Egypt, Venezuela, Trini- dad, India, Ceylon, the Malay States, North and South China, Siam, the Straits Settlements, and the Philippines. We shall have to wait a few years before the full advantages of this situation shall begin to be reaped, but that that harvest eventually will be a great one, there can be no manner of doubt...America before long will have to purchase from British companies, and to pay for, in dollar currency in progres- sively increasing proportion, the oil she cannot do without, and is no longer able to furnish from her own store.\" 9 But in 1922, an unexpected shock forced a process which led to a \"truce\" in tnis Anglo-American conflict of the post-Versailles pe- riod some years later. A threatening new combination, coming out of the East, forced Washington and London to forge a condo- minium of global power, in which oil has formed the strategic cen- ter of that power to the present day. We must go to Genoa to see how this development shaped events of global consequence. Once again, it is Germany which crosses British policy design, and forces the closer English collaboration with its Washington rival."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"76 A CENTURY OF WAR Footnotes: 1.

CHAPTER SIX: The Anglo-Americans Close Ranks A conference in Genoa O N APRIL 16, 1922, in Genoa's Villa de Alberti, the Ger- man delegation to the postwar international economics conference dropped a bomb whose shock waves reached across the Atlantic. It was a political bomb. The German Foreign Minister, Walther Rathenau, announced to the assembled minis- ters of state, with the Russian Foreign Minister Chicherin present, that Germany and the Soviet Union had entered into a bilateral agreement whereby Russia agreed to forgive its war reparations claims on Germany in return for a German agreement to sell in- dustrial technology to the Soviet Union, among other things. The Rapallo Treaty, named for the village near Genoa where the Germans and Soviets had finalized it, astonished the delegates at the Villa de Alberti. Above all, it produced an immediate panic re- action, especially among the British and French members present. The Genoa Conference was called on British urging, in order to accomplish a number of British strategic objectives in the post-Ver- sailles period of the early 1920's. It was meant to lay the basis for re-establishment of the pre-1914 London-centered international Gold Standard; and secondly, by inviting Bolshevik Russia (the pariah in the international community since the new Bolshevik Government had unilaterally repudiated all debts of the Czarist government), the British intended to use the conference to reopen diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. Significantly, the Ameri- can government had been convinced not to participate at Genoa on any official basis, leaving the field even more to British domination. Britain's overture to Moscow was no small gesture. Renewed diplomatic relations were intended to open the door to lucrative trade deals which would allow Royal Dutch Shell and other British petroleum interests to control Russia's war-ravaged Baku oilfields."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"78 A CENTURY OF WAR While secretly financing a White Russian counter-revolution be- ginning in 1918, in concert with Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, Shell's Deterding quietly went to France and bought up the pre-Revolutionary oil leases for the Russian Baku, anticipating the imminent collapse of an economically isolated and badly dam- aged Soviet regime. This was the period of the notorious Lockhart Plot, in which Britain's Moscow envoy, Sir Robin Bruce Lockhart, together with Sidney Reilly, were tried in absentia and sentenced to death for the August, 1918 attempt on Lenin's life. It was also the period of Brit- ish and allied military landings at Archangel. Under Churchill's Colonial Office, British policy had been to back an exile govern- ment around the dubious figure of Boris Savinkoff, former Minis- ter of War under the ill-fated Kerensky regime, and at the time a morphine addict. With the backing of Churchill and the British government, Shell's Deterding channeled large sums of money to a White Russian counter-revolution under the leadership of Gen- erals Wrangel and Denikine, Admiral Kolchak, and others as late as 1920. Deterding formed the Anglo-Causasian Company in an- ticipation of his taking the prize of Baku oil. At one point, an in- creasingly frustrated Deterding even funneled monies to create a Baku separatist movement which was to have honored Deterding's oil concessions. 1 Four years of such efforts to covertly and overtly overthrow of the new Bolshevik regime had failed to yield results. By 1922, Brit- ish tactics had shifted, intending to intersect what London saw as a more pragmatic, actually desperate, economic policy coming from Lenin's Moscow, through the 1921 New Economic Program. Sinclair and the American bid As determined as Deterding and the British were in 1922 to se- cure monopoly rights to develop and control the vast Russian oil- fields, powerful American oil interests, including the Rockefeller Standard group, were equally determined. By 1922, it appeared that conditions were ideal for the new Brit- ish approach to Russia. Britain's chief apparent rival for Soviet oil concessions, the American Sinclair Petroleum Company of Harry 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS  79  Sinclair, was implicated in a conveniently-timed scandal which erupted in the U.S. over oil leases on the Wyoming Teapot Dome Naval Reserve. Harry Sinclair, who portrayed himself as an Oklahoma oil \"in- dependent,\" was actually a convenient \"middle-man\" for the Standard oil and banking interests to secure markets where a di- rect Standard bid might arouse suspicion, above all from Britain's powerful rival Shell group. In the early 1920's, Sinclair was not the \"maverick\" self-made man he appeared. On the board of directors of his Sinclair Refining Company was Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of the former president. Archibald Roosevelt, his brother, was vice-president of Sinclair Oil. William Boyce Thompson, director of Rockefeller's Chase Bank in New York, Standard Oil's bank, was also on Sinclair's board. Harry Sinclair had met with Leonid Krassin, Soviet representa- tive in London in the early 1920's. As a result of their talks, he, to- gether with U.S. Senator Albert Fall and Archibald Roosevelt, went to Moscow, where they negotiated an agreement to obtain the concession to develop the prized Baku field as well as rights to develop the oil deposits of the Sakhalin Island, and to form a 50- 50% joint venture company with the Soviet government to share equally in the profits from its oil sales worldwide. The Sinclair group agreed to invest a sum of not less than $115 million in the project, and to obtain a large loan in the United States for the Russian government. Moscow knew of Sinclair's close ties to President Harding and the Republican administration in Washington. A U.S. loan required U.S. diplomatic recognition of Russia, breaking the international isolation of the Soviet Union. Sinclair agreed, and Harding was persuaded to accord the Soviet government recognition. But suddenly in Wyoming, reportedly with the covert encour- agement of representatives of Deterding's rival Shell group, a scandal began to surface implicating Sinclair, Fall, and even Pres- ident Harding, involving grants of lucrative oil leases from U.S. Government property at Teapot Dome, Wyoming. In the subse- quent media scandals and Congressional inquiries, no mention was made of the remarkable coincidence that the Teapot Dome af- fair hit just as Sinclair and the U.S. had secured the prized Baku oil concession out from under Deterding and the British. 2 Harding had been about to announce U.S. diplomatic and trade"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"80 A CENTURY OF WAR ties with Soviet Russia when the Teapot Dome affair, and Harry Sinclair's involvement, hit the front page of the Wall Street Journal on April 14,1922. Within a year, Harding himself died under pe- culiar circumstances. The Coolidge presidency dropped Sinclair, the Baku project, and with it any plans to recognize Russia. There was more than a little suspicion that the skillful hand of British Se- cret Intelligence was active in blocking this American bid to dom- inate Russian oil development. Germany Tries to Outflank the British This was the setting in which the Genoa conference took place, intended to become a victory for British interests in securing their grip on the enormous Soviet economic resources in the wake of the major setback for the American effort. But Rathenau and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Georgi W. Chich- erin, signed a comprehensive treaty in the course of the several- weeks long Genoa deliberations, without the prior knowledge of the British, French, or American governments. Rathenau's preferred option was by no means to deal with the Soviet Union. He had made repeated pleas and proposals to the British and other allied governments, initially in his capacity as German Economic Reconstruction Minister after Versailles, to allow the German economy to get back on its feet, so that German export earnings could begin to pay the Versailles war reparations burden. Again and again, his pleas were rejected. Adding injury to insult, in 1921 the British Government imposed a prohibitive 26% import tariff on all German imports, further obstructing Ger- man efforts to work out a realistic debt repayment process. Faced with this Anglo-French fist under his nose, Rathenau, scion of a noted German engineering family and former chairman of the large AEG electrical company, determined to develop a strategy of allowing German industry to rebuild itself through de- velopment of heavy industry exports to Soviet Russia. Since the Versailles Treaty, deficit financing had been a necessary expedient of the German Government amid the ruins of the Ger- man postwar economy. In effect, the Reichsbank printed money to cover the state's deficits, creating a situation in which money sup- 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 81 ply expanded more rapidly than the productive output of Germany's economy during the early 1920's. The result was in- evitablely inflationary, but the alternative options appeared lim- ited, short of national economic suicide. As Rathenau well knew, the costs of the unsuccessful war itself had laid the seeds of an already dangerous inflation in the econ- omy. By 1919, the gold parity of the Reichsmark had fallen to half its pre-war levels . Official statistics showed that the war had created a wholesale price inflation of 150%, and black market prices were much higher. The war had been financed through the expedient of enormous state indebtedness to the German popula- tion. Unlike Britain, which had been able to finance its war costs from foreign sources, especially J.P. Morgan & Company in New York, Germany had been blocked from these major credit markets. Moreover, after the war the Allied victors systematically stripped Germany of her most vital economic resources. All her valuable colonies, especially Tanganyika and South West Africa, were taken by Britain. The growing economic markets of the Ot- toman Empire, opened up through the expansion of the Baghdad Railway were gone. Germany itself had lost its most valuable source of iron ore for its steel industry in Alsace-Lorraine and in the Eastern parts, including Silesia, with its rich mineral and agri- culture regions. Germany lost 75% of her iron ore, 68% of her zinc ore, 26% of her coal as a consequence of Versailles. Alsatian textile industries and potash mines were gone. Her entire merchant fleet, one-fifth of her river transport fleet, one quarter of her fishing fleet, 5,000 locomotives, 150,000 railroad cars and 5,000 motor trucks, were taken by the Allied powers after Versailles. All of this was justified as part of an as yet undefined German war \"repara- tions\" levy. In May 1921, the Allied Reparations Committee met and drew up what was called the London Ultimatum, the \"final\" payments plan demanded of Germany. It fixed Germany's Reparations Debt to the victorious Allies at the astronomical sum of 132 billion gold Marks, an amount which even British reparations expert, John Maynard Keynes, said was more than 3 times the maximum which Cermany could possibly pay. The reparations debt was to accu- mulate an annual 6% interest charge. A 26% duty on the declared value of all German exports was to be paid to the Allied Repara- tions Agent in Berlin, in addition to numerous added onerous con-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"82 A CENTURY OF WAR ditions, such as imposition of several taxes as \"guarantee.\" Pay- ment-in-kind for any part of the reparation sum could be unilater- ally demanded by the Reparations Commission. The \"London Ultimatum,\" was not merely an ultimatum in name. The terms were that unless the German parliament fully agreed to the unbelievable conditions set forth within six days. Al- lied troops would occupy and control the Ruhr industrial heart- land of Germany. Not astonishingly, the Reichstag approved the draconian ultimatum by a slim majority. 3 The really alarming aspect of the Rapallo Treaty, for certain in- fluential circles in London, was the implications of its provisions. A major infusion of German machinery and equipment, steel and other technology, was to be sold to Russia to rebuild and expand her Baku oil fields. In return, Germany established a network of jointly-owned Ger- man-Soviet oil and gasoline distribution centers in Germany to market the Soviet oil under the firm DEROP, the Deutsch-Russis- che Petroleumgesellschaft. This had the added advantage of al- lowing Germany to get out from under the iron grip of British and American oil interests, who had a total monopoly on German pe- troleum sales after Versailles. Rathenau never refused the London Ultimatum reparations demands. But he insisted on practical means of realizing those demands. 4 Military Occupation of the Ruhr The response to Rapallo arrived quickly. Within two days of its formal announcement, on April 18 at Genoa, the German delega- tion was presented with an Allied note of protest over Germany's having negotiated the Russian accord \"behind the backs\" of the Reparations Committee. Then, on June 22,1922, little more than two months after the Ra- pallo Treaty was made public, Walther Rathenau was assassinated as he was leaving his home in the Berlin, Grunewald. Two right- wing extremists, later identified as members of a pro- monarchist \"Organization C,\" were charged with the murder, and it was por- trayed as part of the growing wave of extremism and anti-semi- tism. But reports circulated in Germany pointing to \"foreign inter- 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 83 ests,\" and some said Britain, or British interests, stood behind the two hit-men. In any event, the most prominent statesman and ar- chitect of Rapallo was gone, and the nation was shaken to its roots. The murder of Rathenau was only the beginning of a horror to which few nations before or since have been subjected. Britain took care to distance herself publicly from the French re- vanchist policy of Poincare's regime, but England had worked out a quid pro quo behind the scenes. France was to cede rights over the French territories in the Mosul, granted her during the secret Sykes-Picot accords of 1916, to the British. In return, as noted in an earlier chapter (Chapter 3), Britain gave France a private assurance that Britain would do no more than offer verbal protest to a French military occupation of the Ruhr. It well suited British balance-of- power requirements, that France be the marcher lord to bring Ger- many into submission. 5 All the Poincare regime needed, was a credible pretext. On De- cember 26,1922, at the scheduled year-end meeting of the Allied Reparations Committee in London, French President Poincare an- nounced that Germany had violated the strict terms of the Ver- sailles Treaty by failing to deliver to France the agreed volume of wood for telegraph poles, as well as a minor shortfall in coal de- liveries. 6 The Real Origins of Weimar Hyperinflation Following the assassination of Rathenau, by July 1922, the Gold Mark rate plunged internationally to 493 Marks to the U.S. Dollar. Confidence in political stability in Germany sank to new post-Ver- sailles lows. The Reichsbank began expanding the money supply dramatically, in a frantic attempt both to meet unpayable London reparations demands, while maintaining employment and a strong export industry domestically to service the reparations re- quirements imposed. By December, the Mark had fallen to the alarming level of 7,592 to the Dollar. Then, on January 9,1923, the Reparations Committee voted 3 to 1 (with Britain formally on record opposing France, Belgium and the newly-installed Mussolini Government of Italy), that Ger- many was in default of her reparations payments. On January 11,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"84 A CENTURY OF WAR Poincare ordered the military forces of France, with token partici- pation from Belgium and Italy, to march into Essen and other cit- ies of the German industrial Ruhr to occupy it by force. England hypocritically denounced the occupation, though she had threat- ened precisely the same action in 1921. In reaction, the German government called on its citizens to en- gage in universal passive resistence to the occupation. The Gov- ernment ordered all German officials, including Reichsbahn per- sonnel, to refuse to take orders from the occupying authorities. Workers refused to work in the steel mills and factories of the Ruhr. To support the families of striking miners and other work- ers, the Government resorted to expanded printing of money. The area occupied was merely 100 kilometers long and some 50 kilom- eters wide, yet it contained 10% of the entire German population, produced 80% of Germany's coal, iron and steel and accounted for fully 70% of its freight traffic. The French occupation brought the industrial activity of Ger- many almost to a grinding halt. It took until the end of 1923 for French troops and engineers to bring production in the Ruhr up to even one-third of the former level of 1922. More than 150,000 Ger- mans were deported from the Ruhr occupation zone, some 400 were killed, and more than 2,000 wounded. The economic strain of the German resistence was incalculable. The French occupation forces had cut the Ruhr off economically from the rest of the nation. Funds of German banks and Reichs- bank branches, and inventories of factories and mines, were all seized. Germany ceased all reparations payments to France, Bel- gium, and Italy for the duration of the resistence, but scrupulously maintained its payments and deliveries in kind to Britain. Germany's currency was utterly ruined as a consequence. As we have noted, already by the end of 1922, when it became obvious that France's Poincare government wanted to force a military oc- cupation, the Mark's value began to fall. By January, after the Ruhr occupation, the Mark dropped to 18,000 to the dollar. Attempts by the Reichsbank to defend the currency at all costs held the level somewhat until May, when all possibilities had been exhausted. By May, the results of the Ruhr economic losses became so catas- trophic that Berlin was forced to abandon efforts to save the cur- rency. From that point onward, the situation was totally out of control. 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 85 By July, the Mark had fallen exponentially to 353,000 to the Dollar. By August, it reached the unbelievable level of 4,620,000 to the Dollar. The plunge continued until November 15, when it hit 4,200,000,000,000 to the Dollar. No such phenomenon had been ex- perienced in the economic history of nations up to that time. With some months' time lag, German wholesale prices increas- ingly began to reflect the collapse of the currency. From an index- level of 100 in July 1922, just after the Rathenau assassination, prices increased some thirty-fold by the onset of the Ruhr occupa- tion at the end of January, 1923 to 2,785. By July, prices soared to the unbelievable level of 74,787 compared with the level of 100 a year earlier. By September, it was 23,949,000, and finally by No- vember, 750,000,000,000. The savings of the entire population were destroyed. Living standards collapsed. While a small few were able to build immense fortunes at the beginning, the vast majority sank into poverty. Government bonds, mortgages, bank deposits, everything became worthless. The entire stable middle stratum of the country was pauperized. By September, 1923, the Government, now under a coalition headed by Gustav Stresemann, ordered an end to the passive re- sistence. In November 1923, a formal agreement with France and the other occupying forces was signed. Hyperinflation had peaked. But this was only the softening up of Germany for what was to appear a welcome relief. In October, 1923, the U.S. Secretary of State, Charles Evans Hughes, former chief counsel to Rockefeller's Standard Oil, rec- ommended a new scheme to President Calvin Coolidge to con- tinue the reparations pyramid of debt collection which had been shaken since the April 1922 Rapallo shock. Hughes won appoint- ment of a banker tied to the J.P Morgan group, General Charles C. Dawes, a man whose prior career had been tainted with corrup- tion and Republican party payoff scandals in Illinois. Dawes, as chairman of what came to be called the Dawes Com- mittee, presented his plan to the Allied Reparations Committee on April 9,1924. His plan was immediately seized upon by all par- ties, including the exhausted German government. France's Poin- care lost in the May elections, and a cabinet under Edouard Her- riot immediately agreed as well to the Dawes Reparations scheme. On September 1, the Dawes Reparations plan formally began. The Dawes plan was the first major indication of the growing Anglo-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A CENTURY OF WAR American agreements to consolidate and join forces in the post- Versailles period. London had wisely thought it better to let the Americans take the center stage, while preserving its powerful in- fluence on American policy. 7 The Dawes Plan was the Anglo-American banking community's reassertion of full fiscal and financial control over Germany. It was vastly more effective than Poincare's soldiers, but it required the military intervention and the attendant hyperinflation crisis to en- able its enactment. By November, 1923, a German banker, Hjalmar Schacht, was named Commissioner of the Currency. Schacht, who had devel- oped a close correspondence at this time with Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, implemented the notorious Ren- tenmark in an attempt to stabilize the Mark by a fiction of declared real estate backing. On November 20, the day the Rentenmark sta- bilization plan was made public, Rudolf Havenstein, Reichsbank president since 1908, died, in the first of a remarkable series of such events. Stresemann and Finance Minister Rudolf Hilf erding had re- peatedly attempted to get the unwilling Havenstein to step down. It soon became clear why. On December 4,1923, the Reichsbank board of governors voted their overwhelming choice that Karl Helfferich, former Deutsche Bank director and architect of the Baghdad Railway project before the War, be named successor to Havenstein. Stresemann and the Government had other preferences. On December 18, 1923, his choice, and the friend of the Anglo-American Morgan interests, Hjalmar Schacht, was named President of the Reichsbank. The way was clear for the Dawes Plan to proceed. Helfferich died a few months later in a suspicious train accident. 8 Germany paid reparations under the Dawes Plan for five years until 1929. At the end of 1929, she owed more than at the begin- ning. It was a scheme of organized looting by the international banking community dominated by London and New York. Guar- antees for reparations payments of special funds in Germany were made. An Agent-General for Reparations, S. Parker Gilbert, a J.P. Morgan partner and protege of Owen D. Young, was installed in Berlin to collect the payments to the Anglo-American banks. With their risk thus all but nil, the London and New York banks began a vastly profitable lending to Germany, money which was recy- cled in the form of reparations with commission and interest back 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 87 to the banks of New York and London. It was a vast international credit pyramid, at the top of which sat London and, ultimately, New York banks. Between 1924-1931, Germany paid 10.5 billion Marks in repara- tions, but borrowed 18.6 billion Marks from abroad. German re- covery after 1923, under the guiding hand of Montagu Norman and his Reichsbank colleague, Hjalmar Schacht, was all controlled by the borrowings from the Anglo-Americans. There were no more fears of Rapallo initiatives upsetting the Anglo-American order—that is, until the pyramid collapsed in 1929 as the credit flows from New York and London banks into Germany to roll over the debt suddenly stopped. 9 An Anglo-American Red Line But by then, the Anglo-American power struggle for primacy in world finance and economic affairs had been resolved. The oil wars, which had shaken the world for more than a decade, were finally resolved in a \"ceasefire,\" which resulted in creation of the the enormously powerful Anglo-American oil cartel, later dubbed the \"Seven Sisters.\" The peace agreement was formalized in 1927, at the Achnacarry, Scotland castle of Shell's Sir Henri Deterding. John Cadman, representing the British government's Anglo-Per- sian Oil Co. (British Petroleum), and Walter Teagle as president of Rockefeller's Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon), gathered under the pretence of a grouse shoot, to conclude the most powerful ec- onomic cartel in modern history. The Seven Sisters were effec- tively one institution. Their secret pact was formalized as the \"As Is Agreement of 1928,\" or the \"Achnacarry Agreement.\" British and American oil majors agreed to accept the existing market divisions and shares, to set a secret world cartel price, and end the destructive competi- tion and price wars of the last decade. The respective governments merely ratified this private accord the same year in what became the \"Red Line Agreement.\" Since this time, with minor interrup- tion, the Anglo-American grip over the world's oil reserves has been hegemonic. Threats to break that grip have been met with ruthless response, as we shall later see."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"88   A CENTURY OF WAR In 1927,Britain and a weakened France agreed to let the Ameri- cans into the Middle East, and revised the secret wartime accords to reflect this. A Red Line from the Dardenelles down through Pal- estine, to Yemen, up through the Persian Gulf, encompassing Tur- key, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait was drawn. Inside the line, the oil interests of the three countries worked out iron-clad divisions of territory, which have largely held to this day. Inside Iraq, Anglo-Persian, the Royal Dutch Shell group, and the French Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, which had been \"given\" the old Deutsche Bank share of the Turkish Pe- troleum Gesellschaft from 1914, along with the Rockefeller group, gained \"concessions\" from Iraq for exclusive exploitation for 75 years of Iraq's oil. Kuwait was given to Anglo-Persian and the American Mellon family's Gulf Oil. 10 By 1932, all seven major companies in the Anglo-American sphere— Esso (Standard of N.J.), Mobil (Standard of N.Y.), Gulf Oil, Texaco, Standard of California (Chevron), as well as Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo-Persian Oil Co. (British Petroleum)—were part of the Achnacarry cartel. The cartel then devised a strategy to deal with companies not in the cartel, so called \"outsiders.\" According to the terms of their car- tel agreement, \"It is recognized that it is desireable to convert un- controlled outlets into the controlled class; in view of this, the purchase by the 'as is' members (i.e. Achnacarry cartel companies-ed.) of going distributing concerns outside 'as is' is to be recommended as tending to improve the stability of the markets.\" The cartel was also pre- pared to deal with outsiders less compliant, as we shall soon see. 11 . The sinews of the Anglo-American \"Special Relationship,\" had been definitively formed in oil. The way was now clear for major new initiatives. Deterding, Montagu Norman and Schacht's 'Hitler Project' The unstable international monetary order imposed after Ver- sailles by London and New York bankers on a defeated Central Europe came to an abrupt, if predictable, end in 1929. Montagu Norman, then the world's most influential central banker as Gov- 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 89 ernor of the Bank of England, precipitated the crash of the Wall Street stock market in October 1929. The Bank of England's Nor- man had asked the Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, George Harrison, to raise U.S. interest rate levels. Harrison complied, and the most dramatic financial and economic collapse in U.S. history ensued in the following months. By early 1931, Montagu Norman and a small circle in the British establishment had plans to shift the political dynamic in Central Europe in a most astonishing manner. At the time, Austria's largest banking institution was the Cre- ditanstalt of Vienna. Closely tied to the Austrian branch of the House of Rothschild, the Creditanstalt had grown during the 1920's through an unhealthy process of merging smaller troubled banks. The largest such merger was forced onto Creditanstalt dur- ing the month of the October 1929 stock market crash, when it was asked by the authorities to take over the Vienna Bodenkreditan- stalt, a real estate lender which itself had swallowed several other unhealthy banks in the previous several years. At the beginning of 1931, Creditanstalt appeared to be one of the mightiest of world banks. In reality, it was one of the sickest. The draconian Versailles conditions imposed by Britain, France, and the United States had dismantled the Austro- Hungarian Empire, isolating Austria's economy from the valuable economic ties and raw materials of Hungary and lands of eastern Europe. Austria's industrial economy never recovered from the devastation of the First World War. Industry had rundown plants, outmoded equip- ment and huge, unredeemable war loans. The consequence of the political circumstances in Austria in the 1920's led major-parts of insolvent Austrian industry to pass into the hands of the ever- larger Creditanstalt. Thus by early 1931, Austria in general and the Vienna Creditan- stalt in particular were the weak link of an international credit chain which had been built on the unhealthy foundation laid by the New York banking firm of J.P. Morgan in concert with the Bank of England and the London banks. Creditanstalt was unable to generate sufficient capital for its activities from the depressed Austrian economy, and became largely dependent on very short term borrowings from London and New York to finance its acti- vities. The Bank of England itself was actually a significant lender to Creditanstalt."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"90 A CENTURY OF WAR In March 1931, the French Government and French Foreign Min- ister Briand declared themselves in determined opposition to an- nounced negotiations between Berlin and Vienna for the forma- tion of an Austro-German trade and customs union, a belated at- tempt to counter a growing world economic depression which had set in from America some months earlier. France reportedly ordered its banks to cut short-term credit lines to Creditanstalt in a bid to bring enormous pressure to bear on the Austrian govern- ment. What ensued that May, as rumors of a run on the deposits of Creditanstalt broke in the Vienna press, was a credit crisis which shook all of Europe. The Austrian National Bank and ultimately the Austrian State, were forced to come to the rescue of the Cred- itanstalt in what became the largest bank failure in history. Subse- quent examination revealed that the crisis need never have reached such dramatic dimensions. It was intended to do so by certain powerful London and New York financiers, who were pre- paring a dramatic shift in European geopolitics. 12 By the end of the 1920's, influential circles in Britain and the United States had decided on a radical course for Germany. J.P. Morgan bankers had already proved to themselves the use- fulness of radical top-down political solutions to ensure repay- ment of bank loans, when they gave the crucial foreign credit to the fascist regime of Italian strong-man Benito Mussolini. In No- vember 1925, Italian Finance Minister Volpi di Misurata an- nounced that the Mussolini government had reached an agree- ment on repaying the Versailles war debts of Italy to Britain and the United States. One week later, J.P. Morgan & Co., financial agents of the Mussolini government in the United States, an- nounced a crucial $100 million loan to Italy to \"stabilize the Lira.\" In reality, Morgan had decided to stabilize Mussolini's fascist re- gime. On the urging of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Montagu Norman, the powerful Governor of the Bank of England, Volpi di Misurata established a single Italian central bank in 1926, the Bank of Italy, to control national monetary policy and further ensure repayment of foreign debts. Mussolini had proven himself to be the ideal strong-man to discipline Italian labor unions, drive down wages and enforce sufficient austerity to guarantee foreign bank lending, or so Morgan's people in New York thought. The man who controlled U.S. monetary policy at the time, for- mer Morgan banker Benjamin Strong, an intimate personal friend 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 91 and collaborator of England's Montagu Norman, met with Volpi and Bank of Italy Governor Bonaldo Stringher, to confirm the final details of the Italian \"stabilization\" program. From Poland to Ro- mania during the 1920's, the same combination of powerful per- sons—J.P. Morgan & Co., Montagu Norman and the New York Federal Reserve—organized effective economic control over most countries of Continental Europe, under the pretext of establish- ment of \"credit-worthy\" national policies, an informal precursor of the International Monetary Fund role of the 1980's. The New York banks were the source of the significant short-term capital for this lending, and the Bank of England provided the political expe- rience together with the British Foreign Office establishment, to impose the policy. 13 The most concerted efforts of this Anglo-Saxon circle were fo- cused on Germany during the 1920's. Following the successful im- position of Hjalmar Schacht as President of the Reichsbank in 1923, and Schacht's implementation of the draconian Dawes Plan for war reparations repayment, drafted by Morgan & Co., the Ger- man economy became dependent on short-term loans from Lon- don and New York banks and their collaborators in Paris during the 1920's. For the banks, these German short-term credits were the most lucrative in the entire world financial markets of the day. For many of Germany's banks, including the fourth-largest, the Darmstadter und Nationalbank Kommandit-Gesellschaft (Danat), dependence on short-term New York and London capital borrow- ings had become substantial, and at punitively high interest rates. Weimar hyperinflation had largely destroyed the capital and re- serves of major German banks during the early part of the decade. Thus the expansion of German bank lending during the late 1920's was done by banks with a precariously small capital base in the event of loan default or other crises. Germany was in a unique po- sition among major European industrial countries by the time of the 1929-30 New York Stock Market collapse. She owed interna- tional bank creditors an estimated 16 billion Reichmarks in such short-term debts. This unsound banking structure only required a small push to topple it in its entirety. The push came from the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which, in a series of moves in 1929, raised their interest rates after more than two years of un- precedented stock market speculation as they pursued ever lower"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"92 A CENTURY OF WAR interest rates. The predictable crash on the New York stock market and the London market led to a massive withdrawal of U.S. and British banking funds from Germany and Austria. By May 13, 1931, the fuse was ready for the torch. On that day, the large Vienna Creditanstalt collapsed. The French had decided to \"punish\" Austria for entering into customs union talks with Germany, by imposing currency sanctions. Cred- itanstalt was a Rothschild bank with heavy ties to French banking. As French funds were recalled from Austria, it toppled the fragile Creditanstalt, the largest Austrian bank, which had large interests in some 70% of Austria's industry. In the attempt to stop the run on the Creditanstalt, Austrian banks called in all funds they had in German banks. Creditanstalt was the weak link which started the domino collapse of banking in all central Europe. The ensuing banking crisis, economic depression, and related tragic developments in Austria and Germany, were dictated virtu- ally to the letter by Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, the Governor of the New York Federal Reserve, George Harrison, and the House of Morgan and friends in Wall Street. A decision was made to cut all credits to Germany, although even a minimal roll- over of nominally small sums would have likely stopped the cri- sis from exploding out of control at this early stage. Instead, capital began to flow out of Germany in ever-greater amounts. On the demand of Montagu Norman and George Harri- son in New York, a new Reichsbank President, Hans Luther, duti- fully abstained from doing anything to stop the collapse of large German banks. The immediate consequence of the Creditanstalt collapse in Vienna was the related failure of the Danat-Bank of Germany. The Danat-Bank, heavily dependent on foreign credits, lost almost 100 million Reichmarks of deposits that May. The next month, Danat lost 848 million Reichmarks, or 40% of all deposits, while Dresdner Bank lost 10%, and even Deutsche Bank lost 8% of deposits. By late June, Bankers Trust, a Morgan bank, cut the credit line to Deutsche Bank. New York Federal Reserve Bank Governor George Harrison de- manded that Reichsbank head Hans Luther impose rigorous credit austerity and tightening in German capital markets, claim- ing this was the only way to stop the flight of foreign capital. It en- sured the overall collapse of the German banking system and in- dustry into the worst depression imaginable. 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS  93  Montagu Norman backed Harrison, and the Governor of the Bank of France joined them in blaming Germany for the crisis. Desperate last-minute efforts by the Bruning government to per- suade Hans Luther to seek an emergency stabilization credit from other central banks to contain the national banking crisis were, as a result, refused by Luther. When he finally capitulated and asked Montagu Norman for help, Norman slammed the door in his face. Germany as a consequence effectively no longer had any lender of last resort. By July 1931, some two months after the collapse of the Vienna Creditanstalt had begun, the flight of capital out of Germany, the Basle Nationalzeitung reported that the Danat-Bank was \"in diffi- culties,\" which was sufficient in the electric climate to trigger a full panic run on that bank. The bank's chairman, Goldschmidt, later charged that the Reichsbank had selectively precipitated his bank's failure with discriminatory credit rationing. The ensuing banking crisis and collapse of industry created \"the hardest win- ter in one hundred years.\" It was the breeding ground for radical political alternatives. In March 1930, some months before the credit cutoff against Ger- many was imposed by the Anglo-American bankers, Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht surprised the government by handing in his resignation. The actual issue he resigned over was the offer of an emergency stabilization credit of 500 million Reichmarks, which the Berlin government had been offered by the Swedish in- dustrialist and financier, Ivar Kreuger, the famous Swedish \"match king.\" Kreuger and his American bankers, Lee Higginson & Co., were major lenders to Germany and other countries which had been cut off by the London and New York banks. But Kreuger's loan offer of early 1930 had explosive and unacceptable political consequences for the long-term strategy of Montagu Norman's friends. German Finance Minister Rudolf Hilferding urged Schacht, who, under the terms of the Dawes reparations plan, had to approve all foreign loans, to accept the Kreuger loan. Schacht refused, and on March 6, handed Reichspresident von Hindenburg his resignation. Schacht had been called to other du- ties. Kreuger himself was found dead some months later, in early 1932 in his Paris hotel room. The official autopsy registered the death as suicide, but detailed inquiry by Swedish researchers"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"94 A CENTURY OF WAR decades later made a conclusive case that Kreuger had been mur- dered. The persons who stood to gain most from Kreuger's death were in London and New York, although the actual details will likely remain buried along with Kreuger. Germany's hope for re- lief also ended with Kreuger's death. Germany was totally cut-off from international credit. 14 For his part, Schacht was anything but idle following his resig- nation from the Reichsbank. Schacht devoted his full energies to organizing financial support for the man he and his close friend, Bank of England Governor Norman, agreed upon as the solution for Germany's crisis. Since 1926, Schacht had been a secret backer of the radical NSDAP movement of Adolf Hitler. After resigning his Reichsbank post, Schacht acted as a key liaison between powerful but skepti- cal German industrial leaders, the so-called \"Schlotbarone\" of the Ruhr, and foreign financial leaders, especially England's Lord Norman. British policy at this juncture was to create the \"Hitler Project,\" knowing full well what its ultimate geopolitical and military di- rection would be. As Colonel David Stirling, the founder of Britain's elite Special Air Services, related in private discussion al- most a half century later, \"The greatest mistake we British did was to think we could play the German Empire against the Russian Empire, and have them bleed one another to death.\" The British support for the Hitler option reached to the very highest levels. Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was made infamous for the 1938 Munich appeasement which set Hitler's armies marching to Sudetenland in the east. Philip Kerr (later Lord Lothian), of the Cecil Rhodes Round Table group which we met earlier, was a close adviser to Neville Chamberlain. Loth- ian backed the Hitler project as part of the infamous Cliveden Set in English circles, as did Lord Beaverbrook, the most influential British press magnate of the day, who controlled the mass-circula- tion Daily Express and Evening Standard. But perhaps the most in- fluential backer of Hitler's movement at this time in Britain was Edward VIII, King of England, later Duke of Windsor after his ab- dication. But certain influential American establishment figures were hardly ignorant of what the Hitler movement was about. Leading Wall Street and U.S. State Department circles had been in on the 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 95 project from an early stage. Even before the ill-fated 1923 Munich \"beer hall Putsch,\" a U.S. State Department official stationed in Munich as part of the Versailles occupation of Germany, Robert Murphy, later a central figure in the postwar Bilderberg group, personally met the young Hitler, introduced through General Erich Ludendorff. Murphy, who had served under Allen Dulles in Berne during World War I gathering intelligence on the German Reich, was in Munich with another influential U.S. government of- ficial, Truman Smith, assigned to U.S. Army Intelligence occupy- ing Germany. In his memoirs, Smith later recalled his arrival in Munich in late 1922. \"I talked at length about National Socialism with the Munich Consul, Mr. Robert Murphy (later a very distinguished American Ambassador), General Erich Ludendorff, Crown Prince Rupert of Bavaria and Alfred Rosenberg. The latter later became the politi- cal philosopher of the Nazi party. On this visit I also saw much of Ernst F.S. ('Putzi') Hanfstaengl, of the well-known Munich art family. 'Putzi' was a Harvard graduate and later became Hitler's foreign press chief...My interview with Hitler lasted some hours. The diary I kept in Munich indicates I was deeply impressed by his personality and thought it likely that he would play an impor- tant part in German politics.\" In his November 1922 report to his superiors in Washington, Smith filed the following recommendation regarding his evalua- tion of the tiny Hitler group. Speaking of Hitler, Smith said, \"His basic aim is the overthrow of Marxism...and the winning of labor to the nationalist ideals of state and property...The clash of party interests has...demonstrated the impossibility of Germany's res- cue from her present difficulties through democracy. His move- ment aims at the establishment of a national dictatorship through non-parliamentary means. Once achieved, he demands that the reparations demands be reduced to a possible figure, but that done, the sum agreed on to be paid to the last Pfennig, as a matter of national honor. To accomplish this the dictator must introduce universal reparations service and enforce it with the whole force of the state. His power during the period of fulfillment cannot be hampered by any legislature or popular assembly...\". To ensure that his colleagues in Washington's Division of Mili- tary Intelligence got the point, Smith added his personal evalua- tion of Hitler, \"In private conversation he disclosed himself as a"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"96 A CENTURY OF WAR forceful and logical speaker, which, when tempered with a fanat- ical earnestness, makes a very deep impression on a neutral lis- tener.\" 15 Already in late autumn of 1931, a man arrived at London's Liv- erpool Street railway station from Germany. His name was Alfred Rosenberg. Rosenberg met with the editor in chief of the influen- tial London Times, Geoffrey Dawson. The Times gave Hitler's movement invaluable positive international publicity in the com- ing months. But the most important meeting Rosenberg had dur- ing this first visit to England in 1931, was with Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, and arguably the most influen- tial single person in world finance of the day. Norman had three hatreds, according to his trusted personal secretary—the French, the Catholics, and the Jews. Norman and Rosenberg had no diffi- culty finding common ground in their talks. The introduction to Norman had come through Hjalmar Schacht. Since their first meeting in 1924, Schacht and Norman struck a up friendship which lasted until Norman's death in 1945. Rosenberg concluded his fateful London visit with a meeting with a leading person of the London Schroeder Bank, affiliated with J. H. Schroeder Bank in New York and with the Cologne- based private bank, J.H. Stein of Baron Kurt von Schroeder. The man Rosenberg met from Schroeder Bank in London was F. C. Tiarks, also a member of the Bank of England directorate and a close friend of Montagu Norman. As Baron von Schroeder and Hjalmar Schacht went to leading German industrial and financial persons to secure support for the NSDAP after 1931, the first question of nervous and skeptical in- dustrialists was, \"How does international finance, and especially Montagu Norman, regard the prospect of a German government under Hitler?\" Was Norman prepared to come in with financial credit for Germany in such an event? The reality is that, at this crit- ical juncture, when Hitler's NSDAP had little more than 6 million votes in the 1930 elections, the international backing of Montagu Norman, Tiarks and friends in London was decisive. On January 4, 1932, at the Cologne villa of Baron Kurt von Schroeder, Adolf Hitler, von Papen and the Cologne banker, von Schroeder, secretly arranged financing of Hitler's NSDAP, at that time de facto bankrupt with huge debts, until Hitler's planned sei- zure of power. Another meeting between Hitler and Franz von 6 - THE ANGLO-AMERICANS CLOSE RANKS 97 Papen took place on January 4,1933, at von Schroeder's Cologne villa, where the plan was finalized to topple the weak Schleicher government and build a right-wing coalition. On January 30,1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the German Reich. Alfred Rosenberg's final visit to London was in May 1933, this time as one of the closest figures in the new Hitler government. He went directly to the country home of Sir Henri Deterding in Buck- hurst Park in Ascot, the head of Royal Dutch Shell and the world's most influential businessman. According to English press ac- counts, the two had a warm and eventful discussion. Rosenberg had first met Deterding during his 1931 London trip. Royal Dutch Shell had intimate contact with, and provided support to the Ger- man NSDAP. While the details were kept secret, reliable British re- ports of the day claimed that Deterding had provided substantial financial support to the Hitler Project in its critical early phases. While the Bank of England had adamantly refused to give a pfennig of credit to Germany at the critical period in 1931, thus precipitating the banking and unemployment crisis which made desperate alternatives such as Hitler even thinkable to leading cir- cles in Germany, as soon as Hitler had consolidated power, in early 1933, the same Montagu Norman moved with indecent haste to re- ward the Hitler government with a vital Bank of England credit. Norman made a special visit to Berlin in May 1934 to arrange fur- ther secret financial stabilization of the new regime. Hitler re- sponded by making Norman's dear friend, Schacht, his Minister of Economics as well as President of the Reichsbank. The latter post Schacht held until 1939. 16 Footnotes: 1.

IHAPTER SEVEN: Oil and the New World Order of Bretton Woods A New Empire rises from the ashes of war I N 1945, FOLLOWING SIX YEARS of a war spanning the entire globe, which left more than 55 million dead in its wake, the world had changed in many significant ways. However, for vast regions of the world, most especially in eastern Europe and the less-developed regions in the southern hemisphere, 1945 merely marked a transition to a new form of chronic war—most often economic. In 1919, following the Versailles Peace Conference, the British Empire was at its largest extent, its dominion covering one quar- ter the entire surface of the world, the Empire \"upon which the sun never set.\" A mere thirty years later, by 1949, the British Empire was disintegrating in every region as demands for colonial inde- pendence were made against the oppressive mother country. The British Empire was in the throes of the largest upheaval of perhaps any kingdom in history. Following the mutiny of the Indian Royal Navy in February 1946, the postwar British Government of Labour Prime Minister Clement Atlee appointed Viscount Mountbatten of Burma to be the last Viceroy of India, with the task of arranging the fastest pos- sible withdrawal of English forces and government administra- tion. Mountbatten's partition of the vast Indian subcontinent into a bizarre quilt of East and West Pakistan with predominantly Mus- lim populations, separated by India, was completed by August 15, 1947, five months after Mountbatten's arrival in India. Within a few short years, Britain ceded formal colonial control over large parts of her empire in Africa, the Pacific, the Mediterra- nean. It was not out of beneficence or a sudden burning passion"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"100   A CENTURY OF WAR for the principle of self-determination of subject peoples, but rather driving necessity which dictated a reshaped form of post- war dominion in the late 1940's and early 1950's. As a consequence of the war, the trading mechanisms of the Em- pire which had formed the foundation of British financial power, were shattered. Vast overseas investments had long since been sold to pay war costs. The English National Debt had soared to un- precedented heights. Domestically, England's plant and equip- ment were rotted and worn out, even electricity supply was no longer reliable, housing stock was delapidated, the population ex- hausted. By the end of the war, British export trade had withered to a mere 31% of its 1938 pre-war level. Britain was completely dependent on the postwar support of the United States. For its part, the United States, or rather, the interna- tionalist elements of the East Coast Establishment, as it was be- coming known, realized that if it were to dominate the post-war world, it needed the vast worldwide expertise and cooperation of London. The long-discussed new concept of Empire, first intro- duced in the early years before World War I by Lord Lothian, Lord Milner, Cecil Rhodes and the Round Table circle, as we mentioned earlier, was rapidly becoming reality. After 1945, Britain would exert global influence indirectly, through developing and deepen- ing a \"special relationship\" with the United States. The seeds of this \"special relationship\" had been carefully planted following Versailles, with the simultaneous establishment of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the New York Council on Foreign Relations as conduits of the strategic policy debate. During the war, a new element was added. While England and the United States agreed to a full integration of their military com- mands, the still-fledgling U.S. intelligence operations, under the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), worked principally out of a Lon- don command center in joint cooperation with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). The emergence of the postwar Amer- ican Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the entire array of U.S. covert government institutions evolved directly out of these war- time British ties. The consequences for later American policy were to be as enormous as they were tragic. A signal turning point in redirecting American energies and pol- icy in the immediate postwar period, was the British intervention into the domestic American debate. In a supremely calculated 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  101  move, Winston Churchill came to Fulton Missouri, President Truman's home state, to deliver his famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech on March 5,1946. What is generally not discussed are the policy gains for the postwar British position secured by Churchill's cal- culated rhetoric. Granted, Stalin was indeed violating letter and spirit of various wartime agreements made with Churchill and Roosevelt, but Churchill's aim at Fulton was to manipulate the naive and inexperienced American president into a renewed Anglo-American \"special relationship.\" Shortly after Churchill's extraordinary visit, during which he in- tentionally lost $75 in playing a game of poker with Truman, the former Prime Minister had turned events to the distinct favor of England. The prototype of the CIA was established on the wartime network of the London-trained OSS. American defense policy was based on joint U.S.-British sharing of intelligence and military de- fense secrets. Truman began to purge his administration of any anti-British elements, most notably Agriculture Secretary and An- glophobe Henry Wallace. U.S. and British intelligence agencies re- sumed close collaboration in all areas. The Dollar Standard, 'Big Oil' and New York Banks Anglo-American petroleum interests emerged from the Second World War in a position enormously more powerful. In the final agreement for a postwar New World Order in monetary and eco- nomic affairs hammered out between British and American nego- tiators in 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, Anglo-Ameri- can hegemony over world petroleum played a central role in the thinking of Lord Keynes and his American counterpart, Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White. The Bretton Woods System was to be built around the \"three pil- lars\" of an International Monetary Fund, whose member country contributions would constitute an emergency reserve available in times of balance of payment distress; a World Bank, which would loan to member governments for large public projects; and a Gen- eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), designed to create a managed agenda of \"free trade.\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"102   A CENTURY OF WAR Lord Keynes and his American counterparts skillfully designed certain clauses to ensure a postwar Anglo-American hegemony over world monetary and trade affairs. First, de facto voting con- trol was given to the United States and Britain within the IMF and World Bank. Second, Bretton Woods created what was called a Gold Exchange System. Under this system, each member country's national currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar, in turn,was set at an official rate of $35 per fine ounce of gold, the rate set by President Roosevelt in 1934, during the depths of the Great Depression, and before a world war. Because the New York Federal Reserve Bank had accumulated the bulk of the world's official gold reserves during the war, and because the Dollar emerged from the ravages of the war as the world's strongest currency, backed by what was unquestionably the world's strongest economy, few were in a position to argue with what amounted to a postwar U.S. Dollar Standard. Among those least inclined to complain about the terms of the Bretton Woods monetary order, were the large American petro- leum companies, the Rockefeller companies of the Standard Oil group, together with the Pittsburgh Mellon family's Gulf Oil. They had secured a major stake in concessions for oil in the Middle East, above all in Saudi Arabia. Partly through the clever diplomacy of President Roosevelt and the bungling of Britain's Winston Churchill, Saudi Arabia slipped from the British grip during the war. Saudi King Abdul Aziz gained an unprecedented Lend-Lease agreement in 1943 from Roosevelt, a gesture to ensure Saudi good- will to American oil interests after the war. Roosevelt acted on advice of Harold Ickes, then Petroleum Co- ordinator for National Defense, and the State Department which in December 1942 had noted, \"It is our strong belief that the devel- opment of Saudi Arabian petroleum resources should be viewed in the light of the broad national interest.\" This was the first time American national security had been officially linked with the fate of the desert kingdom more than 10,000 miles from its shores on the Persian Gulf. It was not to be the last time. State Department planners realized that the implication was that U.S. foreign policy, at least in key areas, might become more imperial, along British lines of controlling strategic interests in lands far from its shores, as the pillar of its postwar power. l In the first years after the end of the Second World War, few other 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  103  Americans realized the implications. They were far too preoccu- pied with returning to normal life after depression and war. Marshall Plan forms postwar oil hegemony Little attention has been paid to some details of the postwar Eu- ropean Recovery Program, the Marshall Plan, named after its ar- chitect, Secretary of State George C. Marshall. From its inception in 1947, the largest single expenditure by ERP recipient countries in Western Europe, was to use Marshall Plan dollars to purchase oil, oil supplied by primarily American oil companies. According to official records of the State Department, more than 10% of all U.S. Marshall Plan aid went to buy American oil. 2 By the end of the war, the U.S. oil industry had become every bit as international as its British counterpart. Its main resources were in Venezuela, the Middle East and other far away places. After the war, Big Oil, as the five U.S. companies were called—Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon), Socony-Vacuum Oil (Mobil), Standard Oil of California (Chevron), Texaco, and Gulf Oil—moved to take de- cisive control of Europe's postwar petroleum markets. The ravages of war severely affected European dependence on coal as the primary energy source. Germany had lost her eastern coal reserves, and coal output in the war-torn west was only 40% of prewar levels. British coal output was 20% below the level of 1938. The oil of eastern Europe was behind what Churchill called the Iron Curtain, inaccessible to the west. In 1947, half of all west- ern Europe's oil was being supplied by the five American compa- nies. The American oil majors did not hesitate to take advantage of this remarkable opportunity. Despite some Congressional inquiry and mid-level bureaucratic protest at the obvious misuse of Marshall Plan funds, the Ameri- can oil majors forced Europe to pay a dear price, a very dear price. They more than doubled the price they charged European custom- ers between 1945 and 1948, going from $1.05/barrel to $2.22/bar- rel. Although the oil was supplied from the inexpensive Middle East reserves of the U.S. companies, the freight rates were calcu- lated in a deliberately complex formula, tied to freight rates from the Caribbean to Europe, a far higher cost."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"104 A CENTURY OF WAR Even within European markets, there were staggering cost dif- ferences. Greece was forced to pay $8.30/ton for fuel oil, the same fuel oil for which Britain paid only $3.95/ton. Furthermore, the U.S. companies, with support of the Washington government, re- fused to allow Marshall Plan dollars to be used to build indige- nous European refining capacity, further tightening the strangle hold of American Big Oil on postwar Europe. 3 As the two major British oil companies, Anglo-Persian and Shell, recovered their capacities, the American five were forced to expand to seven companies, parcelling out the oil markets' of postwar Eu- rope and the rest of the world. By the 1950's, the position of the Anglo-American oil companies appeared unassailable. They con- trolled incredibly cheap Middle eastern supplies, and captive mar- kets in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America. The price of petroleum seemed a constant of daily life during the 1950's. The companies reaped enormous profit for their dollar sales of oil to the new world market. The automobile and its asso- ciated industries had become the single largest component of the American economy. U.S. tax dollars poured billions into construc- tion of a national modern highway infrastructure under the Eisen- hower National Defense Highway Act, using the pretext that fast motorways were required to flee cities in event of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. The railroad infrastructure was neglected and allowed to decay to the advantage of far less energy- efficient motor transport. This was the time when a Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, former chairman of a major Detroit automobile corporation, could say without flinching, \"What's good for Gen- eral Motors is good for America.\" He should have added, good as well for Exxon, Texaco and the oil majors. Oil had become the most important commodity to fuel the economy. The power of New York banks tied to U.S. oil A little-noted consequence of this extraordinary global market grab by the major American oil companies following the Second World War, was the parallel rise of New York oil-linked banking groups tied to oil to international dominance. Since the period of the Dawes reparations loans and related lending of the 1920's, 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  105  New York banks had increasingly oriented their business to the international arena, away from domestic finance. As U.S. petro- leum companies became an ever larger element in international oil supply during World War II, New York banks benefitted from the capital inflows of world oil trade. The powerful New York banks exerted influence to modify the original Bretton Woods scheme devised by Keynes and Dexter White to preserve this advantage. During the early 1950's, a wave of little-noted New York bank mergers contributed to increasing the already enormous political and financial influence of the New York banks over domestic U.S. policy. In 1955, Rockefeller's Chase National Bank merged with the Bank of Manhattan and the Bronx County Trust to create the Chase Manhattan Bank. The National City Bank of New York, also closely tied to the international operations of the Standard Oil group, like Chase, acquired the First National Bank of New York to form the First National City Bank, later Citibank Corp. Bankers' Trust took over the Public Bank & Trust, Title Guarantee & Trust and several other regional banks to form another powerful group, while the Chemical Bank & Trust merged with the Corn Exchange Bank and the New York Trust Co. to form New York's third largest bank group, Chemical Bank New York Trust, also tied to Standard Oil. J.P. Morgan & Co. merged in the same time with Guaranty Trust Co. to form Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., the fifth largest bank. The net effect of this postwar cartelization of American banking and financial power into the tiny handful of banks in New York, strongly oriented to the fortunes of international petroleum mar- kets and policy, had enormous consequence for the following three decades of American financial history, overshadowing all other policy influences in U.S. and international policy, with the possible exception of the Vietnam war deficit-financing. New York banking had traditionally oriented abroad, but now it concentrated disproportionate power over world finance, unlike ever before. It resembled the power of the old London imperial banking groups such as Midland Bank, Barclays, and the like. By 1961, the deposits concentrated into the five largest New York banks were fully 75% of all bank deposits of the entire metropoli- tan region, America's largest economic region. 4 The membership of the increasingly-influential New York Coun- cil on Foreign Relations during the 1950's also reflected this concen- tration of financial and economic power. The CFR chairman was"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"106 A CENTURY OF WAR Wall Street lawyer John J. McCloy, also chairman of Chase Bank and a former lawyer for the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests. While most Americans only dimly realized the ominous impli- cations of the concentration of economic and financial power into a small number of hands in New York banking, corporations and related law firms during the early postwar years in the 1950's, the point was not lost on their English cousins in the City of London. American society was increasingly reshaped along the lines of British \"informal empire,\" with finance, raw materials control, and control of international terms of trade, rather than the tradi- tional American foundation of technological and industrial progress. Mohammed Mossadegh takes on Anglo-American oil While Britain appeared to be losing her most extensive attributes of Empire during the 1950's, she tenaciously held to a re-ordered set of colonial priorities. Rather than stake everything on main- taining the extensive formal empire reaching to India, she re- grouped around the far more profitable empire of world oil and strategic raw material control, with the assistance of the United States. Thus, Egypt and the Suez Canal, through which the bulk of Middle East oil flowed into Europe, became a strategic priority, as did maintenance of British interests in the oil-producing Middle East Gulf states, especially Iran, where the British Government, through its Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, continued to hold a lock- grip on the country's political and economic fortunes, despite the pressures of world war. Since the earlier-described British efforts at the time of William Knox d'Arcy in 1901-2 to gain monopoly of Persian oil rights, Brit- ain had fought like a tiger to control what became of Iran's oil min- erals. During the Second World War, Britain played an especially perfidious role, persuading Stalin to join forces in invading Iran on the flimsy pretext that the presence of a handful of German engi- neers in the neutral territory of Iran constituted a casus belli. A month after British and Russian forces occupied Iran in August 1941, the Shah abdicated in favor of his son Mohammed Reza Pah- 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  107  Reza Pahlevi, who, under the circumstances, was disposed to ac- comodate the Anglo-Russian occupation. The British occupation forces, later complemented by a smaller American contingent, sat idly by while their wartime \"ally\" Rus- sia requisitioned most food supplies from the Northern zone of Iran occupied by the Soviet army. Tens of thousands of Iranians died of hunger while 100,000 Russian and 70,000 British and In- dian troops were given priority in supplies. Typhoid and typhus became epidemic. Diversion of supplies along the Iranian railroad carrying Anglo-American Lend-Lease goods to Russia during the winter of 1944-45 killed thousands more for want of heating oil in the bitter winter. British policy during the entire period was systematic humiliation of nationalist Iranian elements and the government, while encouraging the most superstitious and feudal reaction inside the country. In a desperate bid to seek help from a third party, the Iranian government asked for American aid, and an American military of- ficer, General M. Norman Schwartzkopf (father of the commander of U.S. forces in the 1990-91 Operation Desert Storm), went to Iran in 1942, where he trained a national police force for a six year pe- riod until 1948. Schwartzkopf and his Iranian army contacts later proved to be crucial in the operation to topple Iran's nationalist Premier, Mossadegh, in August 1953. Despite the solemn declaration of the wartime Teheran Confer- ence, signed by Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt, regarding the res- toration of postwar Iranian sovereignty, Russia demanded an ex- tensive exclusive oil concession in the northern part of Iran bor- dering Azerbaijan, while England demanded further concession for the government-linked Royal Dutch Shell. In the midst of this blatant foreign blackmail from what amounted to occupation forces on Iranidn territory, in December 1944, Iranian nationalist leader, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, introduced a bill in the Ira- nian Parliament which would prohibit oil negotiations with for- eign countries. Mossadegh cited a November 2,1944 Times of London editorial which proposed a postwar partition of Iran among the three pow- ers, England, Russia, and the United States. The resolution passed, but it explicitly left the resolution of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com- pany concession in southern Iran for a later debate, the old d'Arcy concession from 1901."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"108 A CENTURY OF WAR By 1948, following a bitter fight, including taking the case before the new United Nations, Iran had finally succeeded in forcing a withdrawal of foreign troops from her soil. But the country and its economy were still under the effective control of the British Gov- ernment through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Iran's southern region contained the richest oil province then known in the entire world, and it was controlled under the exclusive concession given decades earlier to the British. Since 1919 British administrative of- ficials had de facto run the administration of the country to secure this vital monopoly. Niceties of Iranian sovereignty were pushed to the side. But following the end of the Second World War, with the anti- colonial movement emerging from India across Africa into Asia, Iran no longer would tolerate such an abrogation of its national sovereignty. In late 1947, the Government of Iran proposed to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. that it increase the ridiculously low revenue share which Anglo-Iranian allowed the Government of Iran for the world's most profitable oil exploitation. Iran cited the case of Venezuela, where the American Standard Oil companies had agreed to pay 50-50% to the government of Venezuela. Iran noted that, if she had such terms, instead of get- ting a paltry $36 million per year for draining its precious natural resource, it would have accrued $100 million, at that time a size- able sum. As it was, Iran calculated that Anglo-Iranian and the British were de facto paying total royalties of a mere 8% of their net profit. Britain held exclusive concession over a vast area com- prising 100,000 square miles on which it was refusing to engage in significant new exploration. Iran calculated that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. made a profit of $320,000,000 in 1948 on its production of 23 million tons of Iranian oil, while paying Iran a royalty of $36,000,000. In light of the data presented, the government of Iran suggested that the original concession be renegotiated with the principle of justice and fairness in mind. 5 This suggestion was no cause for joyous celebration. BBC radio began broadcasting faked news accounts designed to embarrass the Iranian Government, charging that Foreign Minister Esfandi- ari had agreed to humiliating concessions to British Foreign Min- ister Ernest Bevin for amending Iran's Constitution. That was only the initial response. The talks about altering the Anglo-Iranian agreement dragged 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  109  on through 1949, without significant concession from the British side. Their strategy was to stall and delay, while always working to weaken the Iranian government. But in Iranian parliamentary elections towards the end of 1949, Dr. Mossadegh and his small National Front party campaigned on the issue of the oil negotia- tion. The National Front won six seats in the new parliament and by December Mossadegh was named head of a Parliamentary Commission on the oil issue. Iran had asked 50-50% profit-sharing as well as Iranian participation in the management of Anglo-Iran- ian Oil Co. British refusal to meet Iran even half-way continued, as one government after another fell over the contentious issue in Iran until April, 1951, when Mohammed Mossadegh was made Prime Minister. Contrary to subsequent propaganda from various circles in Washington and London, Mossadegh was not a proxy for the Tudeh communists, or Russia, or any wild extremist, but a pas- sionate patriot of Iran and a staunch enemy of Soviet Russia, what- ever his faults may have been. On March 15, the Iranian Parliament, the Majlis, voted to accept the Mossadegh commission's recommendation and nationalize, with fair compensation, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The final nationalization plan was approved by the Majlis the day before Mossadegh was asked to form his government, on April 28,1951. In British eyes, Iran had committed the unforgivable sin. It had effectively acted to assert national interest over British interests. Britain promptly threatened to retaliate, and within days British naval forces arrived near Abadan. Here the hypocrisy of the Brit- ish came to light. Previously, the British Foreign Office had refused to intervene into negotiations between Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. and Iran, claiming it would not interfere in the affairs of a \"private com- pany,\" despite the fact that 53% of Anglo-Iranian was held by His British Majesty's Government. Now, with Anglo-Iranian national- ized by Iran, \"the British government not only intervened in the ne- gotiation between Iran and the company but also backed up its de- mands by dispatching units of the Royal Navy to Iranian waters, and threatened the occupation of Abadan by paratroopers for the ostensible reason of protecting British interests.\" Abadan was the site of the world's largest oil refinery, part of Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. 6 In the 28 months of Mossadegh's premiership, the British la- bored under one overwhelming obstacle. Iran was fully within its legal rights to nationalize a company on its territory so long as she"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"no A CENTURY OF WAR offered just compensation, which is what Mossadegh's govern- ment had offered. Moreover, Iran would guarantee the same level of oil supply to Britain as before nationalization, as well as offer- ing to continue to employ British nationals in Anglo-Iranian. By September, 1951, Britain had declared full economic sanc- tions against Iran, including embargo against Iranian oil ship- ments, as well as a freeze on all Iranian assets in British banks abroad. British warships were stationed just outside Iranian coastal waters; land and air forces were dispatched to Basrah in British-controlled Iraq, close to the Abadan refinery complex. The British embargo was joined by all the major Anglo-American oil companies. Economic strangulation was London's and Wash- ington's response to assertions of national sovereignty from deve- loping states which interfered with their vital assets. British secret intelligence corrupted informants within the Iranian central bank, Bank Melli, and other parts of the government to gain a minute- by-minute reading of the exact effect of their economic sanctions on the country. Prospective buyers of nationalized Iranian oil were warned by the Anglo-American oil companies that they would face legal ac- tion on grounds that a compensation agreement had not yet been signed between Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. and Iran. This tortuous legal argument covered a self-fulfilling strategy. The company and the British refused to sign any compensation agreement. Mean- while, as month after month passed, the bite of the embargo on Iran's fragile economy took hold, and the economic troubles beset- ting Mossadegh's regime multiplied. The major source of the country's export earnings, oil revenues, plummeted from $400 million in 1950 to less than $2 million in July 1951, and Mossadegh fell in August 1953. Mossadegh went to the United States personally in September 1951 to address the UN Security Council, which timidly voted to defer the matter, whereupon Mossadegh went to Washington in a vain effort to enlist American help for his country's position. Mos- sadegh's major political blunder made was his lack of apprecia- tion of the iron-clad cartel relationship of Anglo-American inter- ests around the vital issue of strategic petroleum control. U.S. \"me- diator\" W. Averill Harriman had gone to Iran, accompanied by a delegation packed with people tied to Big Oil interests, including State Department economist Walter Levy. Harriman recom- 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  111  mended that Iran accept the British \"offer.\" When Mossadegh went to Washington, the only suggestion he heard from the State Department was to appoint Royal Dutch Shell as Iran's manage- ment company. When the British insisted the case be brought before the World Court for arbitration, Mossadegh, himself educated in law in Bel- gium and Switzerland, argued his country's case successfully, and the Court denied Britain jurisdiction, referring the matter back to Iran's internal jurisdiction, on July 22,1952. Commenting on the situation in October 1952, journalist Ned Russell of the New York Herald Tribune accurately noted, that there were few if any leaders of small nations with Mossadegh's cou- rage, who, watching their country suffer under a massive financial and economic blockade imposed by Britain and now the United States, would tell Truman and Churchill, \"no.\" Russell noted that Churchill's ploy was to \"pit the United States and Britain together against Dr. Mossadegh.\" By 1953, Anglo-American intelligence had its response ready. In May of that year, the new U.S. President, Dwight Eisenhower, turned down Mossadegh's request for economic aid, on advice of his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and the CIA chief, Allen Dulles. On August 10, CIA Director Allen Dulles met with U.S. Ambassador to Teheran, Loy Henderson, and the Shah's sister in Switzerland. At the same time, in August 1953, after a five-year ab- sence, Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf, Sr. arrived in Teheran to see \"old friends.\" He was close to the Shah and to key army generals he had trained earlier, who were being promised power in the event of a successful coup against Mossadegh. With the aid of royalist elements in the Iranian armed forces, British and American intelligence staged a coup and forced Mossadegh's arrest, his influence having been severely under- mined by two years of unrelenting Anglo-American economic warfare against the country, combined with subversion of key support for the government. Britain's Secret Intelligence Services had convinced the CIA's Allen Dulles and his brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who then convinced Eisenhower that the overthrow of Mossadegh was indispensable. The CIA cooperated fully with the British SIS, under code name Operation AJAX, in the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in August 1953. The young Reza Shah Pahlevi was backed by the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"112 A CENTURY OF WAR Anglo-Americans in opposition to Mossadegh. The Shah re- turned, and economic sanctions were lifted. Anglo-American oil interests had prevailed and had shown what they were prepared to do in the postwar era to anyone who tried to challenge their mandate. Ironically, those same Anglo-American interests would turn on the Shah himself some 25 years later. 7 - The U.S.-Soviet Cold War period provided a marvelous oppor- tunity to British and American intelligence services. Any signifi- cant opposition which stood in the way of major policy initiatives, could conveniently be painted with a red brush as communist or \"communist-leaning.\" Nowhere was this easier to apply than against little-known leaders of developing or newly-independent former colonial nations. This was the tactic used by London and by Washington all too often during the postwar decades. As a con- sequence, Mohammed Mossadegh became known in western ac- counts as an irresponsible wild radical who was working with communists against vital western strategic security. Italy attempts independence in oil and development One European company expressed interest in purchasing oil from Mossadegh's nationalized oil supply. This was in Italy. More specifically, it was the founder of a new Italian state enterprise, who later caused severe headaches for the Anglo-American oil cartel—Enrico Mattei. Enrico Mattei had \"Entschlossenheit\" (determination) in the clas- sical Prussian meaning of the term. He was the leader of the larg- est non-communist resistance organization in Italy during the Sec- ond World War. When Alcide de Gasperi formed his Christian Democratic government in 1945, he named Mattei to become the head of the north-Italian region for a moribund entity created two decades earlier called Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, or AGIP. Despite the fact that Italy had switched sides in 1943, two years of Allied fighting and bombing up the peninsula following more than two decades of Mussolini's fascism had left the country in ruins. In 1945, Italy's Gross National Product was only at the level of 1911, and had fallen in real terms by 40% from the level of 1938. 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  113  A large increase in population, despite war losses> came as a result of repatriation from lost colonies. Starvation threatened, and the standard of living was alarmingly low. In this situation, Enrico Mattei set out to create indigenous en- ergy resources to begin the reconstruction of Italy's postwar econ- omy. Despite a mandate to prepare AGIP for privatization as rap- idly as possible, Mattei set about to find oil and gas. This he did with an aggressive exploration effort under the Po Plain in the north of Italy, with a series of increasingly significant discoveries, first in 1946 near Caviaga, then a major find south of Cremona at Cortemaggiore in 1949, where not only natural gas, but also the first oil in Italy was found. Mattei was given carte blanche to build his enterprise after these finds, having become overall head of AGIP. Efforts by the jealous American oil majors to co-opt this new rival in the Italian energy market were resisted. Mattei was a staunch Italian nationalist, determined to build the economy of the nation as a self-sufficient country. The drain on the precious dollar reserves of Italy to pay oil imports from the American and British oil majors was the largest problem in the postwar balance of payments deficit of Italy. Mattei tackled this problem with a boldness which cut across awesome obstacles. A 2,500-mile long network of gas pipelines was constructed to bring the natural gas from Cortemaggiore into the industrial cities of Milan and Turin. The revenues from the new gas finds were used to finance the ex- pansion of the industrial infrastructure of AGIP across Italy's in- dustrial north. It was Mattei, referring to the ruthless cartelization of world oil markets, who coined the term, \"Sette Sorelle\" or Seven Sisters, to refer to the seven Anglo-American companies who ruled the world of oil in the 1950's. Mattei was determined that Italy not be subjugated to the power of these Seven, whom he accurately ac- cused of pursuing a worldwide policy of limiting production to maintain highest prices for their holdings, and selling their crude oil to oil-poor Europe at prices rigged to maintain their production price in the expensive Continental United States. Mattei set out to secure maximum production and supply at the lowest price pos- sible. Needless to say, he soon came into bitter conflict with those seven powerful companies and their friends in government. In February 1953, Mattei successfully lobbied for passage of a"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"114   A CENTURY OF WAR new law which created a central semi-autonomous state energy holding, Ente Natzionale Idrocarburi, or ENI, as it came to be known. ENI, with Mattei as its founding president, subsumed AGIP for oil and gas and refining, and the pipeline subsidiary SNAM, and was soon to develop tankers and a network of gaso- line stations across Italy surpassing those of Esso and Shell in qual- ity and customer service, the first to incorporate modern restau- rants and other conveniences. Using the same development for- mula he had applied in AGIP, Mattei used the proceeds from ENI to invest in construction of oil refineries, a giant chemicals plant, a synthetic rubber plant using ENI natural gas as feedstock, a heavy engineering subsidiary, which constructed all ENI refineries and related infrastructure, as well as acquisition of an oil tanker fleet to haul ENI crude oil from abroad, independent of the Anglo- American shipping monopoly. By 1958, total proceeds from ENI's Italian natural gas sales alone topped the considerable sum of $75,000,000 yearly. This was money saved—otherwise precious Italian dollar reserves would have had to be spent for imported oil and coal. Perhaps no single individual accomplished more in the 15 years after the war to de- velop industry in Italy. 8 As early as 1954, the U.S. Embassy in Rome became visibly alarmed at the activities of Enrico Mattei. \"For the first time in the economic history of Italy,\" stated an American Embassy memo- randum to Washington, \"a government-owned entity has found itself in the unique position of being financially solvent, capably led, and responsible to no one other than its leader.\" 9 Mattel's bold development initiative But if Mattel's efforts to secure energy independence within Italy irritated the Seven Sisters and the Anglo-American interests behind them, Mattel's growing efforts to secure independent sup- plies of crude oil from abroad turned that annoyance into rabid ha- tred of the Italian industrialist. This most notably, when the Anglo- Americans learned what kind of contracts Mattei was willing to sign, especially with developing countries. When the Shah of Iran was restored after the fall of Mossadegh 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  115  with the active backing of British and American intelligence, he did not move to completely undo the work of the defeated Prime Minister. The National Iranian Oil Company was to remain a state entity with control over all subsurface oil and gas reserves. But by April 1954, less than a year after the coup, the Anglo-American companies, joined by their \"little sister,\" France's state-owned CFP, entered into negotiations with the Government of Iran and NIOC to secure a 25 year participation agreement for exploitation of oil on 100,000 square miles of Iranian territory. Anglo-Iranian Oil, which that same year changed its name to British Petroleum, was given the lion's share of its old d'Arcy con- cession, or 40%. Royal Dutch Shell got the second largest, 14%, giv- ing the British companies the majority or 54% of Iran's output from the area. The American majors divided 40% of the oil includ- ing among a handful of selected \"independents\", which were part of the old Standard Rockefeller group. France's CFP obtained 6%. Mattei approached the Seven Sisters to discuss a small ENI partic- ipation in the Iran concession, and was given what he later called a \"humiliating\" rejection by the Anglo-Americans. Not to be thwarted, in 1955, a year before Britain's own humili- ation at Suez, Mattei entered into successful negotiations with Egypt's new nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. ENI secured a share of the concession to develop the oil of Egypt's Sinai penin- sula, which had grown into a considerable volume of some 2.5 mil- lion tons per year of crude oil by 1961, the vast bulk of which was then refined in ENI refineries to fill the rapidly expanding demand in Italy for petroleum, all without having to be paid for in scarce U.S. dollars. But Mattel's real challenge to the Anglo-American major oil companies came in Iran in 1957. Mattei began negotiations with the Shah in the spring of 1957 for an unprecedented arrangement. Under its terms, the National Iranian Oil Company was to be part- ner with ENI in a deal whereby Iran received 75% of total profits, ENI 25% in a new joint venture, Societe Irano-Italienne des Pe- troles (SIRIP), which had a 25-year exclusive right to explore and develop on some 8,800 square miles of promising petroleum pros- pects in the non-allocated regions of Iran. A senior British official stated at the time, \"The Italians are determined somehow or an- other to muscle in on Middle East oil.\" The view in Washington and London was much the same as that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"116 A CENTURY OF WAR of the Seven Sisters. Mattel's revolutionary initiatives, if allowed to go unchecked, would upset the entire global world oil order. The standard agreement from the major U.S. and UK companies with developing countries was 50-50% on the crude oil, with ample margin for manipulation of downstream profits built in. If Mattei were \"let into the club\" of the Sisters, they feared that Bel- gian and German and other companies would also demand a rightful share of oil possibilities. Thus, the U.S. and British govern- ments officially protested to the Shah's government against the pending deal with Mattei. But to no immediate avail. In August, 1957, Mattei and the Ira- nians had secured their revolutionary agreement. Speaking about the potentials of his new contract, Mattei declared his view that \"the Middle East should now be industrial Europe's Middle West,\" signalling his intention of using the oil agreement as a first step towards European construction of significant industrial and technological infrastructure in the Middle East. By March 1961, the first ENI oil tanker, \"Cortemaggiore,\" landed at the Italian port Bari, with the first fruits of the new Iranian part- nership, 18,000 tons of crude oil from the Persian Gulf. Mattei had pioneered some of the first successful underwater oil explorations in his SIRIP joint venture. In Italy, Mattei continued pressure on the Seven Sister companies through a policy of progressive price reductions at the gasoline pump for consumers, as well as persuading the Italian government to reduce the severely high excise tax on gasoline. As a direct result of this policy, in which the Anglo-American companies were reluc- tantly forced to acquiesce, gasoline prices in Italy dropped 25% between 1959 and 1961, a factor which is credited with significantly aiding Italy's first real postwar economic revival. Outside Italy, Mattei continued an active foreign policy of seek- ing out those regions which had been deliberately neglected by the Anglo-Americans as \"too small\" to warrant attention. ENI and Mattei personally went to newly-independent countries of Africa and Asia, and discussed prospects unlike any then being offered these forgotten former colonies. Mattei would build local oil refineries in the given country, which were owned by that country. This broke with the ironclad Seven Sister control of the vastly more lucrative refining end of the business. The supplier country would no longer be merely a pri- 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  117  mitive raw material source, but would begin to develop the basis of modern indigenous industry from the proceeds of its mineral wealth. In return, ENI would get a guaranteed return on its capi- tal invested in the country, it would secure the exclusive engineer- ing and construction contracts for the refining facilities, and be the exclusive worldwide marketer for the oil. But it was in October 1960 that Enrico Mattei blew the fuses in the White House and #10 Downing Street, as well as in the head- quarters of the Seven Sisters. Italy's leading anti-communist resis- tance leader, life-long Christian Democrat Enrico Mattei, was in Moscow. Once again, Moscow and the vast Russian petroleum re- sources became the focus of European negotiations, as in the 1920's at Rapallo. And, once again, the Anglo-Americans were dead opposed to the success of the negotiations. Since 1958, ENI had contracted to buy a small volume of crude oil from the Soviet Union, less than 1 million tons annually. But word leaked out in the West that a far more ambitious undertak- ing was being discussed in Moscow between Mattei and Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Patolitschev. On October 11,1958, Mattei signed an agreement whereby in exchange for guaranteed deliv- ery of 2.4 million tons of Soviet oil annually, over a five year pe- riod, ENI would ensure a significantly expanded Soviet oil export capability into the West. The oil would not be paid in cash, but in kind, in the form of deliveries of large-diameter oil pipe. This would enable construction of a huge pipeline network bringing Soviet oil from the Volga-Urals into Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. When complete, that pipeline network would bring some 15 million tons annually of Soviet crude oil into Eastern Eu- rope, where it was to be exchanged for industrial goods and food products to the USSR. At that time, the USSR desperately needed large diameter oil pipe, and lacked the capacity to produce it in the necessary volume and quality. ENI secured the support of the Italian Government and the state owned Finsider Group was commissioned to build a new steel- works in Taranto, with a capacity to deliver 2 million tons of large diameter pipe annually. The Taranto plant was rushed to comple- tion, and began to produce pipe for the Soviet market by Septem- ber, 1962. Italy was able to buy crude oil from the Soviet Union at a price of $1.00/barrel f.o.b. Black Sea, compared with a cost in Kuwait of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"118 A CENTURY OF WAR $1.59/barrel plus an added $ .69/barrel for shipping costs, and for the United States in the early 1960's for oil of comparable quality at $2.75/barrel. With the added boost of new jobs in the Italian steel and chemicals sector, few in Italy were alarmed at charges in certain American and British press that Mattei was a \"crypto-com- munist\" or, at the very least, had become a \"fellow traveler\" with Moscow. 10 , One month after the Finsider pipe works began rolling steel for Soviet pipelines, on October 27,1962, under circumstances which to the present day stir speculation and charges of deliberate sabo- tage, the private airplane carrying Enrico Mattei crashed after tak- ing off from Sicily en route to Milan, killing all three on board. Mattei was fifty six, at the peak of his powers. The Rome CIA Sta- tion Chief at that time, Thomas Karamessines, left Rome suddenly afterwards without explanation. He was later instrumental in the Chilean coup against Salvador Allende. It was perhaps merely co- incidental, but, at the time of Mattel's suspicious death, CIA chief John McCone held more than $1 million in shares in Standard Oil of California (Chevron). A detailed report by Karamessines, dated 28 October, 1962, on the Mattei assassination, has never been made public by the U.S. Government. Washington cites \"matters con- cerning national security\" as the reason for its refusal. Before his death, Mattei had managed to secure construction of Italy's first nuclear power test reactor, and had created a new sub- sidiary of ENI, called ENEL, a state electricity utility to work in the development of the country's electric grid with ambitious plans for nuclear energy well in view. Furthermore, in addition to his agreements with Iran, Egypt, and the Soviet Union for oil supply, he had signed similar developmental agreements with Morocco, Sudan, Tanzania, Ghana, India, and Argentina. In noting Mattel's death, the London Economist, the weekly of the British financial establishment founded to open the way for Corn Laws repeal in the 1840's, and owned by the trust of Royal Dutch Shell's Lord Cowdray, had the following editorial com- ment. \"Just how great or how sinister a man Enrico Mattei was will long remain the subject of passionate debate: put him somewhere between (Royal Dutch Shell's) Deterding and Kreuger (Ivar Kreuger, Swedish financier who died in 1931 also under suspi- cious circumstances). But it is difficult to think of any other man in world oil or in Italy, the areas where Mattei cast the longest 7 - OIL AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER OF BRETTON WOODS  119  shadow, whose abrupt subtraction from the scene might make as much difference to either.\" The New York Times called him, \"the most important individual in Italy,\" who, more than any other in- dividual, was responsible for Italy's postwar \"Italian economic miracle.\" 1X At the time of his death, Mattei was preparing to meet with the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who was then pressing the U.S. oil companies to reach some form of detente with Mattei. The agenda of that Kennedy-Mattei talk was never real- ized. One can only speculate about the possibilities. Instead, in lit- tle more than a year, Kennedy himself was assassinated, the trail of blood also leading to the door of U.S. intelligence, through a complex web of organized crime cutouts.

In 1957, a new form of economic cooperation, the European Eco- nomic Community, with France, West Germany and Italy at the center, was formed with the signing of the Treaty of Rome. In Jan- uary 1959, according to terms of that treaty, the European Eco- nomic Community was born. The Federal Republic of Germany began recovering from the ravages of war, on its way to rebuild- ing Europe's strongest industrial capacities. In France, General Charles de Gaulle returned to power in 1958 and began a vigorous program to build modern infrastructure, expand France's devas- tated industrial and agricultural economy, and restore the nation's fiscal stability under the guidance of an emergency restructuring plan drafted by his economic adviser, Jacques Rueff. By the late 1950's, Italy was enjoying the fruits of economic prosperity, largely the consequence of the initiatives set into motion by ENI's Enrico Mattei. In fact, in the first two decades following the end of the Second World War, the non-communist economies of Europe and many developing sector countries experienced an unprecedented indus- trial and agriculture growth. Continental European manufactur- ing industry was expanding at a healthy 5% annual rate by the early 1960's. The total volume of world trade had been stagnant 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 121 for the decade after 1938. Now, between 1948 and 1963, it in- creased some 250% in relative terms, and with no end to the growth in sight. By 1957, for the first time ever, world trade in manufactured goods exceeded that in primary goods—food and raw materials. The locomotive of this expansion was the rapidly growing trade of European Common Market. In 1953, the countries comprising the Common Market counted for 19% of world export trade; by 1960, they had surpassed U.S. exports, both in relative and abso- lute terms at 26% of total world exports and some $30 billion. Western European investment in new steel plants, highway and electricity infrastructure, port modernization for cities such as Hamburg, Rotterdam, and other major terminals, together created the foundations for an impressive expansion of the West European economy's productivity. Measured in terms of output per man- hour of the industrial labor force, labor productivity in Western Continental Europe grew at a healthy rate of nearly 7% per annum from the 1950's into the 1960's, fully one-and-a-half times more rapidly than in the United States in this period. 1 In the course of this dramatic industrial and trade growth in Continental Europe, European trade relations with the developing sector also expanded significantly beginning in the late 1950's, leading to more rapid industrial growth in many developing na- tions than at any time this century. Indicative of the process was the growth of the developing sector's share of world manufactur- ing production, which grew from 6.5% of an expanding total out- put in 1953, to almost 9% by 1963—an increase of 50% in relative terms over the decade, and far greater in absolute terms of output. 2 When de Gaulle was brought back to power in France in 1958, this gave a strong new political voice to the economically expand- ing European continent. De Gaulle, a seasoned military and politi- cal figure, had no illusions about ultimate British designs in Eu- rope, and increasingly regarded American postwar designs as dan- gerously similar to those of the British. On assuming the presi- dency in 1958, de Gaulle began a series of fruitless exchanges with President Eisenhower, proposing a fundamental reform of the NATO structure in order to allow a French \"veto\" on use of nuclear weapons, among other things. In September 1959, General de Gaulle expressed his concerns in a letter to the American president: \"In the course of two world wars, America was France's ally, and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"122   A CENTURY OF WAR France has not forgotten what she owes to American help. But nei- ther has she forgotten that during the First World War, that help came only after three long years of struggle which nearly proved mortal for her, and that during the Second she had already been crushed before you intervened...! know as you yourself know, what a nation is, with its geography, its interests, its political system, its public opinion, its passions, its fears, its errors. It can help another, but it cannot identify itself with another. That is why, although remaining faithful to our alliance, I cannot accept France's integration into NATO.\" 3 When Washington turned a deaf ear to France's proposals, de Gaulle initiated an independent French \"force de frappe\" nuclear force, and announced France was withdrawing its Mediterranean naval fleet from the NATO command. In 1960, France successfully tested its first atomic bomb in the Sahara. De Gaulle was articulat- ing a new independent voice for the emerging post-war Continen- tal Europe. One of the first steps de Gaulle took after assuming the Presi- dency of France in 1958 was to invite German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to meet with him at de Gaulle's private retreat in Co- lombey-les-deux-Eglises. The meeting took place in September 1958. It was the beginning not only of an historic political rap- prochement between the two former wartime antagonists, but of a close personal friendship as well between the two seasoned statesmen. The process culminated some five years later, on Janu- ary 22, 1963, when de Gaulle and Adenauer signed \"The Treaty Between the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Ger- many,\" outlining a process of close heads-of-state cooperation, combined with various forms of economic and industrial policy coordination. The de Gaulle-Adenauer accords sent alarm bells ringing in both Washington and London. Continental Europe, under the leader- ship of de Gaulle, Adenauer, and Italy's Aldo Moro, was becom- ing far too independent in every respect for the comfort of some. Nor did it pass unnoticed in London, that the very day after the historic signing of the Franco-German treaty, France's government announced she would veto British application to enter the Euro- pean Common Market, a veto exercised by de Gaulle out of the years of deep distrust for British motives regarding a strong inde- pendent Continental Europe. 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 123 Anglo-American 'Grand Design' against Adenauer's Europe Early in 1962, the policy circles influencing the Washington Ad- ministration of John Kennedy had formulated their alternative to the assertion of European independence represented by the grow- ing collaboration between Germany under Adenauer and France under Charles de Gaulle. A group of policy advisers including the ever-influential John J. McCloy, who had been High Commis- sioner for Germany from 1949 to 52, White House National Secur- ity Adviser McGeorge Bundy, Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon, Under Secretary of State George Ball, and the CIA's Robert Bowie, formulated a counter to the Franco-German notion of a strong in- dependent Europe, with what they termed their \"Atlanticist Grand Design.\" With effusive rhetoric supporting the Europe of Jean Monnet, the essence of the Washington policy was that the new Common Mar- ket should open itself to American imports, and be firmly locked into a NATO military alliance in which the British and American voices dominated. Washington's plan also demanded support for British membership in the six-nation Common Market, a move which de Gaulle adamantly opposed for very good reasons. By the time of the January 1963 de Gaulle-Adenauer meeting, Washington's opposition policy was in full force, in coordination with that of Britain. Kennedy's State Department made no secret of its extreme displeasure over the French-German accord. The U.S. Embassy in Bonn had been instructed to exert maximum pressure on select members of both the Christian Democrats of Adenauer, the liberal FDP of Erich Mende, and the opposition Social Democr- tats. Two days before the first formal reading of the Franco-German Treaty in the German Bundestag, on April 24,1963 Ludwig Erhard, a firm opponent of de Gaulle and an outspoken Atlanticist who fa- vored British entry into the Common Market, was elected Adenauer's successor. The culmination of Adenauer's life's work, ratification of the Franco-German treaty, was robbed from him at the last moment by Anglo-American interests. After this, the content of the French-German accord, though for- mally ratified, amounted to a lifeless piece of paper. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard presided ineffectively over a divided party. By"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"124 A CENTURY OF WAR July 1964, de Gaulle himself painted a grim picture of the state of German-French relations when asked by press to comment on the progress of the Franco-German accord. \"One could not say,\" de- clared de Gaulle with bitterness over his relations with Adenauer's successor, \"that Germany and France have yet agreed to make policy together, and one could not dispute that this results from the fact that Bonn has not believed, up to now, that this pol- icy should be European and independent.\" For the moment, the influential London and Washington circles had blocked the danger of a powerful bloc of Continental Euro- pean policy independent from Anglo-American Atlantic designs. The weakest European link, postwar \"occupied\" Germany, had been broken for the moment. Britain's basic 19th century \"balance of power\" strategy against Continental Europe had again been maintained, as in the years before 1914. This time, England had re- established \"balance\" through the surrogate arm of the U.S. State Department. Now it remained for the Anglo-Americans to deal with de Gaulle directly. But that was to prove no easy affair. 4 1957: America at the turning point While Washington had initially encouraged creation of a Euro- pean Common Market in order to provide a more efficient market for American industrial and capital exports, the last thing certain circles in the Anglo-American establishment wanted was a politi- cally and economically independent Continental Europe. This problem took on a sinister new twist when, beginning late 1957, the United States underwent the first phase of a deep, per- sisting postwar economic recession with resulting industrial stag- nation and growing unemployment, a recession which lasted into the mid-1960's. The fundamental causes of the recession were not difficult to forsee, had anyone seriously sought them. The vast investment into industrial plant and equipment, which lifted the U.S. eco- nomy out of the 1930's depression, took place almost two decades earlier, during the wartime industrial buildup of 1939-43. By 1957, both plant and equipment, as well as labor force skill levels, needed to be rejuvenated with more modern resources. In the late 8 - A STERLING CRISIS.AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 125 1950's, the United States required immense reinvestments into its productive labor force, education system and technology base, if it was to continue to be the world's leading industrial economy. But, sadly for the United States and the rest of the world, leading U.S. policy circles ensured that precisely the wrong policy alterna- tive dominated Washington in the wake of the 1957 recession. A debate took place in U.S. policy circles over how to respond to the crisis. The New York Council on Foreign Relations, the Rocke- feller Brothers Fund, and others drafted policy options. An ambi- tious young Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, became an ap- pendage of the Rockefeller group at this time. The issue was what to do about the deeper implications of the U.S. recession. The natural demand of industry and farmers for cheap credit and technological progress and capital investment was overshadowed by the powerful combination of the liberal East Coast Establishment. As noted earlier, by the end of the 1950's New York banks had merged into enormously powerful concen- trations of financial power and were looking far beyond American shores for sources of profit. A decisive voice in this debate was the chairman of the New York Council on Foreign Relations, John J. McCloy. McCloy per- sonally brought Kissinger down from Harvard in the late 1950s to shape the policy options being readied for the nation by the \"Wise Men\" of McCloy's Council on Foreign Relations. McCloy, a Wall Street lawyer, was chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank at the time. As we have noted earlier, Chase Manhattan was the bank of \"Big Oil.\" The large U.S. oil multinationals and their New York bankers viewed the entire world market as their domain in the 1950's, not the narrow confines of the United States. Saudi Arabia, in a certain sense, was more \"strategic\" than Texas. As we shall see, this difference was to become crucial. The post-1957 U.S. policy debate was tilted to the advantage of the international banks of Lower Manhattan and Wall Street by the influential national television and newspaper media which they controlled. Their control of then-emerging network television, centered in New York where it enjoyed intimate links with the big international banks of McCloy and friends and their control over select news media such as the New York Times, was central to the success of these New York interests in promoting policies which went directly counter to the best interests of the nation and its ci-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"126 A CENTURY OF WAR tizens at this critical turn. It was in this period that these interests were popularly identified as the Liberal East Coast Establishment. \"That '58 Chevy...\" The Iowa farmer or the skilled machinist in Cincinnati had little idea of what was at stake at the end of the 1950's, the last days of the Eisenhower presidency. Large, internationally-oriented New York banks prepared to abandon U.S. investment for greener pas- tures abroad. Henry Ford once stated that he would gladly pay the highest wages in industry, sell the world's cheapest car, and become the world's richest man in the process—all by using the most modern technology. Unfortunately, by the early I960's, most influential voices in the U.S. policy establishment had forgotten Ford's lesson. They were too obsessed with making a \"quick buck\" with the ty- pical merchant's game of \"buy cheap, sell dear.\" At Ford Motor Company itself, Robert McNamara, an accoun- tant, had taken over corporate control by the end of the 1950s. The U.S. Establishment walked away from investment in rebuilding American cities, from educating a more skilled labor force, from investing in more modern factory production and improving the national economy. Instead, their dollars flowed out of the U.S.A. to grab up, \"on the cheap,\" already operating industrial compa- nies in Western Europe, South America, or the emerging econo- mies of Asia. Increasingly after the 1957 crisis, large U.S. industry and banks began to follow the ill-conceived \"British model\" of industrial pol- icy. Systematic cheating on product quality became the fashion of the day. Milton Friedman and other economists preferred to name this \"monetarism,\" but it was nothing more than the wholesale in- festation of Britain's post- 1846 \"buy cheap, sell dear\" methods into America's productive base. Pride in workmanship and com- mitment to industrial progress began to give way to the corporate financial \"bottom line,\" a goal calculated every three months for corporate stockholders. The average American needed to look no further than his family automobile to see how it worked. Detroit, rather than make the re- 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 127 quired change to more modern plant and equipment after 1957 to increase its technological productivity, began chiseling instead. By 1958, the amount of steel used in a General Motors Chevrolet was cut to half that of the 1956 model. Needless to say, death rates on U.S. highways soared as one result. The domestic steel industry also reflected this big drop. U.S. blast furnaces poured out 19 mil- lion tons of steel for automotive use in 1955, but by 1958 this had fallen to 10 million tons. By the early 1960s, \"what's good for Gen- eral Motors\" was becoming bad for America and for the world. The American worker paid much more for that 1958 Chevy. Slick Madison Avenue advertising, ever-larger tail fins, and chrome trim served to hide the reality. U.S. industry was persuaded to commit systematic suicide, cheating the customer to make up for falling profits. But, like the drunk falling from a 20-story window, who imagines at first that he is enjoying the free flight, most did not understand the real implications of this 1960s \"post-indus- trial\" drift for another ten or twenty years. The dollar wars of the 1960's With higher interest rates to be earned abroad by buying up op- erating Western European companies on the cheap, New York bankers began to turn their back on the United States. Europe had a huge shortage of capital because of the war and devastation of industry. As a result, Europe was forced to pay far higher interest rates to attract the only \"international\" currency then available— U.S. dollars from the large New York banks. For their part, Chase Manhattan, Citibank and others took the chance to make windfall profits in Europe, often doubling what their money earned if they were to invest in municipal bonds to rebuild U.S. sewage systems, bridges, or housing stock. The prob- lem was that Washington, fearful of alienating the powerful New York financial community, refused to address this vital problem in any serious way. The money fled U.S. shores for higher profits abroad. By early 1957, for the first time since World War II, funds began to flow out of the United States in amounts greater than those com- ing in. During the period from 1957 to 1965, U.S. annual net capi-"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"128 A CENTURY OF WAR tal export into Western Europe mushroomed from less than $25 billion to more than $47 billion, a staggering sum in the currency of the day. But if it were only American dollars which were leaving U.S. shores, this would have been one problem. The added problem was that U.S. gold reserves also began a continuous and at times precipitous decline, increasingly after 1958. The breakdown of the postwar Bretton Woods monetary system was rapidly approach- ing, but American policy-makers refused to see the writing on the wall. They were listening to the New York banks, big oil compa- nies, and large American corporations, which were turning to cheap labor production outside the United States to improve profit margins. By the end of the 1950's, the overwhelming advantage of the United States dollar as the world reserve currency of the postwar Bretton Woods system had turned into a liability, with a ven- geance. As Western Europe began to achieve independent indus- trial stature again, with far higher rates of productivity than the aging U.S. economy, this only dramatized the growing weakness of the U.S. economic position by the time of President Kennedy's inauguration in early 1961.   '\"   When the American negotiators at Bretton Woods set down their terms for the postwar international monetary order in 1944, they established it on a basis which contained a fatal flaw. Bretton Woods established a \"Gold Exchange Standard\" under which all member countries of the new International Monetary Fund agreed to fix the value of their currency, not directly to gold, but directly to the U.S. dollar, which in turn had fixed its value to a fixed weight of gold at $35 per fine ounce. This $35/ounce was the price at which the dollar had been fixed ever since Roosevelt set it in 1934, during the depths of the Great Depression. That dollar-gold ratio had not been altered in more than a quarter century, despite an intervening World War and the dramatic postwar developments in the world economy. As long as the United States remained the only strong economic power in the western world, these fundamental flaws could be ig- nored. In the decade after the war, Europe urgently needed dollars to finance reconstruction and for purchase of American and Brit- ish oil for its economic recovery. The U.S. also held the vast bulk of world gold reserves. But by the beginning of the 1960's, as Eu- 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 129 rope began to grow at rates outpacing that of the U.S., it was be- coming clear to many that something had to change in the fixed Bretton Woods arrangement. But Washington, under the growing influence of the powerful New York banking community, refused to play by the very rules it had imposed on its allies in 1944. New York banks began to invest abroad in new sources of higher profits. The failure in Washington under both Eisenhower and his Democratic successor, Kennedy, to effectively challenge this vast outflow of vital investment capital, was the center of a problem which turned the decade of the 1960's into a succession of ever worsening international monetary crises. New York's international bankers were not eager to advertise the fact that they were earning huge profits by walking away from investing in America's future. Between 1962 and 1965, U.S. corpo- rations in Western Europe earned between 12 to 14 percent return on investments, according to a January 1967 Presidential Report to Congress. The same dollar investment in U.S. industry earned less than half that! The banks quietly lobbied Washington to keep their game going. They kept their dollars in Europe rather than repatriate the profits to invest in American development. This was the beginning of what came to be known as the Eurodollar market. It was to be the cancer which, by the late 1970's, threatened to destroy the entire host—the world monetary system. It would have been far better, of course, for the U.S., and also for the rest of the world, had the U.S. Congress and the White House insisted on tax and credit policies to channel those billions, at fair rates of return, into new U.S. plant and equipment, advanced tech- nologies, transportation infrastructure, modernization of the rot- ting rail system, and developing the untapped industrial market potential of the Third World for U.S. industrial exports. More sen- sible for the U.S. perhaps, but not for the power of the influential New York banks. If a given national economy produces the same volume of sala- ble goods under the same technological basis over a period of, say, ten years, and prints double the volume of its domestic currency for that same volume of goods as at the beginning of the decade, the \"consumer\" notes the effect as a significant price inflation. He pays two dollars in 1960 for a loaf of bread which cost him only one dollar in 1950. But when this effect was spread around the en-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"130   A CENTURY OF WAR tire world economy by virtue of the dominant position of the U.S. dollar, the inflated reality could be masked for a bit longer. The re- sults, however, were every bit as destructive. In his first days in office, under guidance from his advisers, Pres- ident Lyndon Baines Johnson, a small-town Texas politician, with little knowledge of international politics, let alone monetary pol- icy, reversed an earlier decision of John Kennedy. President John- son was led to believe a full-scale military war in South East Asia would solve many problems of the stagnant U.S. economy, and also show the world America was still resolute. The Vietnam \"option\" is taken There have been volumes written since the tragic Vietnam war about the reasons and causes for it. But, on one level, it was clear that a significant faction of American defense industry and New York finance had encouraged the decision of Washington to go to war, despite its absurd military justification and a divisive domes- tic reaction, because the military buildup offered their interests a politically salable excuse to revive a massive diversion of U.S. in- dustry into production of defense goods. More and more during the 1960's, the heart of the U.S. economy was being transformed into a kind of military economy, where a Cold War against com- munist danger was used to justify tens of billions of dollars of spending. The military spending became the backup for the glo- bal economic interests of the New York financial and oil interests, another echo of 19th century British Empire, dressed in the garb of 20th century anti-communism. The Vietnam war strategy was deliberately designed by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, with Pentagon planners and key advisers around Lyndon Johnson, to be a \"no-win war\" from the onset, in order to ensure a prolonged buildup of this defense component of the economy. The American voter, Washington reasoned, would accept large costs, if it produced local jobs in defense plants for a new war against an alleged \"godless encroachment of commu- nism\" in Vietnam, despite the gaping U.S. budget deficits. Under the rules of the Bretton Woods system , by inflating the 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 131 dollar through huge spending deficits at home, Washington, in ef- fect, could force Europe and other trading partners to \"swallow\" this U.S. war cost in the form of cheapened dollars. As long as the United States refused to devalue the dollar against gold to reflect the deterioration of U.S. economic performance since 1944, Europe had to pay the cost by accepting dollars at the same ratio as it had some twenty years before. To finance the enormous deficits of his 1960s Great Society and Vietnam buildup, Johnson, fearful of losing votes if he raised taxes, simply printed dollars by selling more U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the deficits. In the early 1960's, the U.S. Federal Budget deficit averaged approximately $3 billion annually. It hit an alarm- ing $9 billion in 1967 as the war costs soared, and by 1968 it reached a then staggering $25 billion. In this period, European central banks began to accumulate large dollar accounts which they used as official reserves, the so- called Eurodollar accumulation abroad. Ironically, in 1961, Wash- ington requested that the allies in Europe and Japan, the Group of Ten countries, ease the drain on U.S. gold reserves by retaining their growing U.S. dollar reserves instead of redeeming the dollars for U.S. gold, as mandated under Bretton Woods. European central banks earned interest on these dollars by in- vesting into U.S. Government Treasury bonds. The net effect was that European central banks thereby \"financed\" the huge U.S. de- ficits of the 1960s Vietnam debacle. American futurist Herman Kahn reportedly exclaimed to a friend, when told how this deficit financing operated, \"We've pulled off the biggest ripoff in history! We've run rings around the British Empire.\" But it was not so ob- vious who was running rings around whom at this time. The City of London was preparing a comeback with expatriate American dollars. Obviously the economic status of European economies such as Germany and France was different in 1964 from what it had been in 1944, when Bretton Woods was drafted. But U.S. policy circles refused to listen to their protestations, especially from de Gaulle's France, because they reasoned that a devaluation of the dollar would cut the power of the \"omnipotent\" New York banks in the world capital markets. Washington had imitated the disastrous ex- ample of England in the period before the 1914 War. Earlier, when New York bankers first began to funnel large"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"132 A CENTURY OF WAR funds out of the United States to speculate in Western Europe or Latin America, President Kennedy attempted to spark renewed American technological optimism and encourage considerable in- vestment into new technologies by announcing the Apollo pro- gram moon-shot and the creation of NASA. There was still a sig- nificant majority in America in 1962 which believed that the coun- try should \"produce its way out\" of the crisis. But on November 22,1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. New Orleans Judge Jim Garrison, at the time in- volved in investigating leads to the assassination in his capacity as New Orleans District Attorney/years later continued to insist that the murder had been carried out by the CIA with aid of select or- ganized crime figures including Carlos Marcello. Among other things, Kennedy was on the verge of pulling American forces out of Vietnam after talks with former Gen, Douglas A. MacArthur days before his murder, an intended policy shift confirmed by his close friend and adviser Arthur Schlesinger. The reasons for the assassination of John F. Kennedy are a sub- ject of much speculation today, and have been since November 1963. But it is clear that the young president was moving on a va- riety of strategic fronts to establish his own mould for U.S. policy, a direction which, on issue after issue, began to run at odds with the powerful financial and political interests controlling the liberal East Coast establishment. In May 1961, more than two years be- fore his fateful motorcade tour along Dealy Plaza in Dallas, Ken- nedy came to Paris where he met personally with Gen. de Gaulle. In his book, \"Memoirs of Hope\" de Gaulle gives a telling per- sonal assessment of the American President. Kennedy had pre- sented to de Gaulle the American argument for backing the dicta- torship of Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam and initial steps to in- stall elements of an American expeditionary corps under cover of economic aid to the Southeast Asian country. Kennedy argued to de Gaulle that the support was essential to build a bulwark against Soviet expansion in Indochina. \"But instead of giving him the ap- proval he wanted, I told the President that he was taking the wrong road,\" de Gaulle writes. \"You will find,\" de Gaulle told Kennedy, \"that intervention in this area will be an endless entanglement.\" De Gaulle went on to elaborate his reasons. \"Kennedy listened to me.\" De Gaulle con- cludes his impressions: \"Kennedy left Paris. I had been dealing 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 133 with a man whose age, and whose justifiable ambition inspired immense hopes. He seemed to me to be on the point of taking off into the heights, like some great bird...For his part, on his return to Washington he was to say in a 'Report to the American People' on June 6 that he had found General de Gaulle a 'wise counsellor for the future and an informative guide to the history that he had helped to make...I could not have more confidence in any man.'\" It seems that some powerful interests in the Anglo-American world were less than enthusiastic about the prospects of such con- fidence between the French general and the young American pres- ident becoming a full-fledged turn in the direction for United States foreign policy. When Lyndon B. Johnson became President on November 22,1963, he could never be accused of inspiring sim- ilar hopes. As President, Lyndon Johnson never dared defy the powerful Wall Street interests. 5 LBJ soon escalated Vietnam from a CIA \"technical advisory\" into a full-scale military conflict, pouring tens of billions of dollars and 500,000 uniformed men into a self-defeating war in Southeast Asia. The war kept Wall Street bond markets busy financing a record level of U.S. Treasury debt, while select defense-related U.S. industry kept their profits flowing from the Asian campaign. Per- sistant U.S. economic stagnation, which worried the politician Johnson, was seemingly \"solved\" by the boom in war spending, so that he secured a landslide victory over Republican Barry Gold- water in 1964. But he bought his \"victory\" at a staggering cost. The beginnings of America's internal rot Faced with the need to address America's growing urban decay, on August 20,1964 President Johnson signed the Equal Opportu- nities Act. In signing it, he boasted with characteristic bravado, \"Today, for the first time in the history of the human race, a great nation is able and willing to make a commitment to eradicate pov- erty among its people.\" The War on Poverty and LBJ's Great Soci- ety program, as he called it, hardly eradicated poverty. It provided an additional excuse for one of the largest increases of deficit spending and financial looting in modern history, and was well fi- nanced by European dollars."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"134 A CENTURY OF WAR Millions of the nation's youth were herded into colleges during the mid-1960s, as a form of \"hidden unemployment.\" The univer- sity student population rose from less than 4 million in 1960 to al- most 10 million in 1975. It was the excuse for Wall Street to float additional billions of dollars of state-guaranteed public bonds for university construction. Investment in expansion of the real indus- trial economy was shifted into this \"post-industrial\" or \"service economy,\" similar to the path Britain had travelled on its road to ruin late in the last century. For the m6ment, Social Security and welfare spending increased, while disastrous consequences loomed for the future as entire sections of the population were thrown onto a permanent human scrap heap of unemployment. The NASA space program reached a spending peak in 1966 of $6 billion, and was sharply cut by Johnson every year after that. The technology push in American universities began to stagnate and then decline. Students were encouraged to pursue careers in \"social relations\" and Zen meditation instead. University educa- tion, once the heart of the American Dream, was transformed into low-quality mass production, as standards were deliberately low- ered during the 1960's. Investment in transport, electric power installations, water sup- plies, and other necessary infrastructure, began to steadily deteri- orate as a portion of the total economy. If you don't care about pro- ducing industrial goods anymore, the New York bankers reasoned, why invest more in roads or bridges to carry them to market? In order to sell this policy of de facto disinvestment in the econ- omy of the United States which took form during the 1960's, the more far-sighted of the Anglo-American establishment realized that they must alter the traditional American commitment to sci- entific and industrial progress. With the Vietnam War and the unleashing of the drug, free-sex, \"flower power\" counterculture of Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary, this is what a part of the Anglo-American liberal establish- ment set out to do. Under a top-secret CIA research project code- named MK-Ultra, British and American scientists began carrying out experiments using psychedelic and other mind-altering drugs. By the middle 1960s, this project resulted in what was known as the Hippie movement, sometimes referred to as the launching of New Age Thinking, or the \"Age of Aquarius.\" Its heroes were rock and drug advocates such as The Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison, and 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 135 LSD-victim author Ken Kesey Mystical irrationality was rapidly re- placing faith in scientific progress for millions of American youth. 6 Government commitments to scientific and industrial develop- ment were cut, as the Johnson administration embraced Wall Street's \"post-industrial\" policy A new, young elite, preoccupied with personal pleasure and cynical about national purpose, began to come out of American college campuses, starting at Harvard, Princeton, and other so-called elite universities. They had \"turned on, tuned in, and dropped out,\" as Harvard professor Timothy Leary expressed it. To transform thinking in America's corporations and industry, managers were also treated to a new form of training, \"T-group sessions,\" run by outside psychologists from the National Train- ing Labs, or \"sensitivity training,\" to dull the wits and help pre- pare the population to accept the coming shocks. People were so preoccupied with being more sensitive and understanding of others' defects, that they lost sight of the fact that the nation was losing its sense of purpose. In 1968, the same year Senator Robert Kennedy was killed in Los Angeles by a \"lone assassin\" when he threatened to win the Dem- ocratic convention, civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King was killed outside his Memphis motel room. Few realized the strategic circumstances around King's murder. He had come to Memphis to lend his powerful support to a black municipal workers' strike in a drive to unionize the non-union South. In the new era of \"run- away plants\" following the 1957 recession, the Southern U.S. was to be simply another \"cheap labor\" haven for industrial produc- tion. This would work only so long as trade unions, which domi- nated industrial centers of Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago and New York, were kept out of the \"New South.\" The big factories fled to the cheap non-union labor areas of the South or to developing countries; slums, drug addiction, and un- employment grew in epidemic scale in Northern industrial cities. Wall Street's policy of disinvestment in established U.S. industry began to show real effects. White, skilled, blue-collar workers in Northern cities were pitted against increasingly desperate, un- skilled, black, and hispanic workers for a shrinking number of jobs. Riots were deliberately incited during the 1960's in industrial cities like Newark, Boston, Oakland, and Philadelphia, by govern- ment-backed \"insurgents\", such as Tom Hayden. The goal of this"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"136 A CENTURY OF WAR operation was to break the power of established industrial trade unions in the Northern cities by labelling them racist. These do- mestic insurgents were nurtured by the Ford Foundation's Grey Areas Program, the model for President Johnson's War on Poverty. Johnson's \"War on Poverty\" was a government-financed opera- tion aimed to exploit the economic decay the Anglo-American establishment's policies had created. The goal was to break resis- tance to what were about to be unheard-of levels of wage-gouging and emiseration of the American population. The financial estab- lishment was preparing to impose nineteenth-century British co- lonial-style looting on the United States, and manipulated \"race war\" was to be their weapon. The newly created U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity weak- ened the policy voice of traditional American labor and influential urban constituency political machines. Targeted white blue-collar industrial operatives, only a decade earlier hailed as the lifeblood of American industry, were suddenly labelled \"reactionary,\" and \"racist\" by the powerful liberal media. These workers were mostly fearful and confused as they saw their entire social fabric collaps- ing in the wake of the disinvestment policy of the powerful banks. Harvard Dean McGeorge Bundy ran the Vietnam War as White House National Security Adviser under Kennedy and later John- son. By 1966, as head of the influential Ford Foundation, Bundy went to New York to turn the U.S.A. into a new \"Vietnam\". Black was pitted against white, unemployed against employed in this new \"Great Society\", while Wall Street bankers benefitted from slashing union wages and infrastructure investment, or funnelled investment overseas to cheap labor havens in Asia or South Amer- ica. This writer had direct personal experience with this sad chap- ter in American history. Sterling, the weak link, breaks By the early 1960's, de Gaulle's independent policy initiatives were not the only major problem facing the financial interests go- verning New York and the City of London. In 1959, the external li- abilities of the United States still approximated the total value of her official gold reserves, some $20 billion for both. By 1967, the 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 137 year the Pound Sterling crisis threatened to break the entire Bret- ton Woods fabric, the U.S. total of external liquid liabilities had soared to $36 billion while her gold reserves had plummeted down to only $12 billion, one third the liability sum. As U.S. short- term liabilities abroad began to exceed its gold stock, certain as- tute financial institutions reckoned, quite correctly, that something sooner or later had to break. In his first State of the Union Address to Congress in January 1961, President Kennedy noted that, \"since 1958 the gap between the dollars we spend or invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened. This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11 billion in the last three years, and holders of dollars abroad converted them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5 billion of gold from our reserve.\" There are indications that President Kennedy seriously tried to tackle the growing dollar drain. Shortly before his death, in a mes- sage to Congress of July 18, 1963, Kennedy proposed a series of measures designed to redress the growing U.S. balance of pay- ments problem through measures aimed at increasing U.S. manu- factures exports and through a controversial Interest Equalization Tax. The aim was to impose a tax of up to 15% on American capi- tal invested abroad, in order to encourage domestic investment of American capital, rather than foreign. Kennedy did not live to see through his version of the Interest Equalization Tax legislation. When it was finally passed in Sep- tember, 1964, certain powerful financial New York and London fi- nancial interests had inserted a seemingly innocent amendment, which exempted one country from the effects of the new tax- Canada, a key part of the British Commonwealth! Montreal and Toronto thereby became the vehicle for an enormous loophole which ensured that the U.S. dollar outflow continued, mediated through London-controlled financial institutions. It was one of the more skillful financial coups of British history. Furthermore, bank loans made by foreign branches of American banks to foreign residents were exempt from the new U.S. tax. U.S. banks scrambled to establish branches in London and other appro- priate centers. Once again, the City of London had maneuvered to become a centerpiece of world finance and banking through de- velopment of the vast new \"Eurodollar\" banking and lending market with its center in London."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"138   A CENTURY OF WAR London's sagging fortunes began once more to brighten as the former \"world's banker\" began to corner the market in expatriate U.S. dollars. The Bank of England and London's Sir Siegmund Warburg, with the assistance of his friends in Washington, espe- cially Undersecretary of State George Ball, had cleverly lured the dollars into what was to become the largest concentration of dol- lar credit outside of the U.S. itself—the London Eurodollar mar- ket—by the 1970's, an estimated $1.3 trillion pool of \"hot money,\" all of it \"offshore,\" i.e., beyond the control of any nation or central bank. New York banks and Wall Street brokerage houses set up of- fices in London to manage the blossoming new Eurodollar casino, away from prying eyes of U.S. tax authorities. U.S. banks obtained cheap funds from the Eurodollar market as well as large multina- tional corporations. During the early 1960's, Washington willingly allowed the floodgates to open wide to a flight of the dollar from American shores into the new \"hot money\" Eurodollar market. Buyers of these new Eurodollar bonds, called Eurobonds, were anonymous persons, cynically called \"Belgian dentists\" by the Lon- don, Swiss, and New York bankers running this new game. These Eurobonds were \"bearer\" bonds, no name of buyers registered any- where, so they became a favorite for so-called Swiss investors seek- ing to evade taxes, or even for drug kingpins wanting to launder illegal profits. What better thing than to hold your black earnings in Eurodollar bonds, with interest paid by General Motors? As an astute Italian analyst of this Eurodollar process, Marcello De Cecco, noted, \"the Eurodollar market was the most important financial phenomenon of the 1960's, for it was here that the finan- cial earthquake of the early 1970's originated.\" 7 In contrast to the benefits to London's international financial stature from the Canadian loophole and deposits of American dol- lars in select London-based banks, the industrial economy of Great Britain by the mid-1960's was a rotting mess and getting worse. Confidence in Britain's Pound Sterling, the second \"pillar\" of the original postwar Bretton Woods system after the American dollar, was eroding rapidly. Britain's external trade balance and general economic situation had been precarious for some time, with rising official committments abroad to maintain vestiges of Empire, a rotting industrial base, and woefully inadequate reserves. When the Labour Party took office in October 1964, the crisis had become more or less chronic. 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 139 After the war, under Bretton Woods, Britain, through her Ster- ling Bloc ties with colonies and former colonies, had been able to make the Pound Sterling a strong currency, which in many parts of the world was regarded the equal of the dollar as a stable re- serve currency. Member countries in the British Commonwealth were required, among other \"courtesies,\" to deposit their national gold and foreign exchange reserves in London and to maintain Sterling balances in City of London British banks. Britain's quota share in the IMF was second only to that of the United States. Therefore, the Pound was disproportionately important to the stability of the Bretton Woods dollar order in the 1960's, despite the clearly depleted condition of her economy. During the 1960's England, like America, was a net exporter of funds to the rest of the world, despite the fact that her technolog- ically stagnant industrial base created increasing trade deficits. Continental European economies, through growth of trade within the new Common Market and their productive advantages from strong investment in technology, grew at strong rates. Thus Britain's deficiencies and lack of new technological invest- ment grew ever larger by comparison. The powerful financial interests of the City of London again preferred to focus single- mindedly on drawing the world's financial flows into London banks by maintaining the highest interest rates of any major in- dustrial nation throughout the mid-1960's. Industry went into a slump, unable to borrow for needed technological innovations. By 1967, the British position was alarming. Despite several large emergency borrowings from the IMF to help stabilize the Pound Sterling, British foreign debts continued to grow, rising another $2 billion, or some 20% in that year alone. In January, 1967, de Gaulle's principal economic adviser, Jacques Rueff, came to Lon- don to deliver a proposal for raising the official price of gold held by the leading industrial nations. The United States and Britain continuously refused to hear such arguments, which would have meant a de facto devaluation of their currencies. Throughout 1967, the Bank of England's gold reserves declined. Foreign creditors, sensing the obviously imminent devaluation of the weakening Pound, scrambled to redeem paper for gold, which they calculated must rise in value. By June 1967, de Gaulle's government announced that France had withdrawn from the American-instigated \"Gold Pool.\" In"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"140 A CENTURY OF WAR 1961, under U.G.pressure, the central banks of ten leading indus- trial countries had created the Group of Ten as it became known. In addition to the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, and Italy were added Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Canada, and Japan. The Group of Ten had agreed in 1961 to pool reserves in to a special fund, the Gold Pool, to be administered in London by the Bank of England. Under the arrangement, a band-aid at best, as events revealed, the U.S. central bank contributed only half the costs of continuing to maintain the world price of gold at the artificially low $35/ounce of 1934. The other nine, plus Switzerland, agreed to pay the sec- ond half of such \"emergency\" interventions, on the argument the situation would be temporary. But the \"emergency\" had become chronic by 1967. Washington refused to bring its war spending deficits under control, and Ster- ling continued to weaken along with the collapsing British econ- omy. De Gaulle withdrew from the Gold Pool, not wanting to lose additional French central bank gold reserves to the bottomless pit of interventions. American and British financial press, led by the London Economist, began a heightened attack against French policy. But de Gaulle made one tactical blunder in the process. On Jan- uary 31,1967, a new law came into effect in France which allowed unlimited convertibility for the French Franc. At the time, with French industrial growth among the strongest in Europe, and the Franc, backed by strong gold reserves, one of the strongest curren- cies, convertibility was seen as a confirmation of France's success- ful economic policy since de Gaulle took office in 1958. It was soon to become the Achilles heel which finished de Gaulle's France at the hands of Anglo-American financial interests. French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, in a public speech in February 1967, reaffirmed French adherence to a gold-backed monetary system as the only way to avoid international manipu- lations, adding that the \"international monetary system is func- tioning poorly because it gives advantages to countries with a re- serve currency [i.e., U.S. and UK—w.e.]: these countries can afford inflation without paying for it.\" In effect, the Johnson administration and the Federal Reserve simply printed dollars and sent them abroad in place of its gold. The lines were more sharperly drawn over the course of 1967. France's central bank determined to exchange its dollar and Ster- 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 141 ling reserves for gold, leaving the voluntary 1961 \"gold pool\" ar- rangement. Other central banks followed. The situation assumed near panic dimensions; some 80 tons of gold were sold on the Lon- don market toward the end of the year in an unheard-of period of five days, in a failed effort to stop the speculative attack. Fear grew that the entire Bretton Woods edifice was about to crack at the weakest link, the Pound Sterling. By the second half of 1967, financial speculators were selling Pounds and buying dollars or other currencies, which they then used to buy commercial gold in all possible markets from Frank- furt to Pretoria, sparking a steep rise in the market price of gold, in contrast to the $35/ounce official U.S. dollar price. The Sterling crisis indirectly focussed attention on the growing vulnerability at the core of the international monetary system, the U.S. dollar itself. By November 18,1967, the British Labour government of Har- old Wilson bowed to the inevitable, despite strong pressure from Washington, and announced a 14% devaluation of Sterling from $2.80 down to $2.40 per Pound, the first devaluation since 1949. The Sterling crisis abated, but the dollar crisis was only beginning. Once Sterling was devalued, speculative pressures turned di- rectly to the U.S. dollar at the end of 1967. International holders of dollars went to the New York Federal Reserve Gold Discount Win- dow and demanded their rightful gold in exchange. The market price of gold began an even steeper rise as a result, despite efforts of the U.S. Federal Reserve to dump its gold reserves onto the mar- ket to stop the rise. Washington, under the sway of the powerful dollar-based New York banks, adamantly refused to budge from the $35/ounce official valuation of gold. But the withdrawal of France, one of the largest holders of gold, from the Group of Ten Gold Pool, had intensified Washington's problem. By the end of the year, Washington's official gold stock declined another $1 bil- lion, to only $12 billions. De Gaulle is toppled The crisis gathered momentum into 1968, and between March 8 and March 15 of that year the Gold Pool in London had to provide nearly 1,000 tons to hold the gold price. The weighing-room floor,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"142 A CENTURY OF WAR loaded with gold at the Bank of England, almost collapsed under the weight. U.S. Air Force planes were, commandeered to rush gold in from the U.S. depot at Fort Knox. On March 15, the U.S. re- quested a two-week closing of the London gold market. By April, 1968, a special meeting of the Group of Ten was con- vened, on Washington's request, in Stockholm. U.S. officials planned to unveil yet another scheme, the creation of a new \"paper gold\" substitute through the IMF, so-called Special Draw- ing Rights (SDR), in an effort to postpone the day of reckoning. At the Stockholm gathering, designed to set the stage for official IMF adoption of the Washington SDR scheme at the upcoming IMF meeting the following month, France defiantly blocked unan- imous agreement, with France's Minister Michel Debre reassert- ing traditional French policy on a return to the original rules of Bretton Woods. De Gaulle's adviser Rueff had repeatedly pro- posed a \"shock\" devaluation of the U.S. dollar of 100% against gold, which would have been elegantly simple, would have dou- bled official U.S. gold reserves in dollar terms and would have been sufficient to allow the U.S. to convert the approximate $10 billion of foreign-held dollars, while still maintaining the value of its gold reserves as before. This would have been far more rational and painless, in human terms, than what ensued from Wash- ington's side. But, tragically, it did not happen. 9 Within days of the French refusal to back Washington's SDR dol- lar bailout scheme, France itself was the target of the most serious political destabilization of the postwar period. Beginning with leftist students at the University of Strasbourg, soon all of France was brought to a chaotic halt as students rioted and struck across France. Coordinated with the political unrest (which, interestingly the French Communist Party attempted to calm down), U.S. and British investment houses started a panic run on the French Franc which gained momentum as it was touted loudly in Anglo-Amer- ican financial media. The May 1968 student riots in France were the response of the vested London and New York financial interests to the one G-10 nation which continued to defy their mandate. Taking advantage of the new French law allowing full currency convertibility, these financial houses began to cash in Francs for gold, draining French gold reserves by almost 30% by the end of 1968, and bringing a full-blown crisis in the Franc. 8 - A STERLING CRISIS AND THE ADENAUER-DE GAULLE THREAT 143 Sadly, the counterattack of the Anglo-Americans succeeded. Within a year, de Gaulle was out of office and France's voice se- verely weakened. In one of his last meetings while still President, de Gaulle agreed to meet with British Ambassador to France, Christopher Soames, in February 1969. The General told Soames, in a broad review of French postwar policy, once again, that Eu- rope must be independent, and that that independent stance had been profoundly compromised by various \"pro-American\" senti- ments of many European countries, most especially Britain. 10 One other country openly daring to defy the powerful financial interests of London and New York at this time was the largest gold-producer in the west, the Republic of South Africa. During the early part of 1968, South Africa refused to sell its newly-mined gold for Pounds or dollars at the official price of $35/ounce. France and South Africa had been holding talks to form a new gold basis for reforming the Bretton Woods monetary order. This provoked a U.S.-led central bank boycott of South Africa, a move again repeated by the same interests almost exactly 20 years later, in the mid-1980's. Despite the apparent elimination of the French \"threat,\" it was to prove a phyrric victory for Washington and London. Footnotes: 1.

CHAPTER NINE: Running the world economy in reverse -Who really made the 1970's oil shocks? Nixon pulls the plug B Y 1969, AT THE END OF PRESIDENT Richard Nixon's first year in office, the U.S. economy was again in recession. U.S. interest rates were sharply lowered by 1970 in order to com- bat the downturn. Speculative \"hot money\" began to leave the dollar in record amounts once more, because of the falling interest rates. Higher short-term profits were harvested in Europe and elsewhere. One result of the almost decade-long American refusal to de- value the dollar, and her reluctance to take serious action to con- trol the huge unregulated Eurodollar market, was increasingly un- stable short-term currency speculation. As most of the world's bankers well knew, King Canute could pretend to hold the waves back for only so long. Richard Nixon turned to an expansionary domestic U.S. mone- tary policy in 1970. As a result, the capital inflows of the previous year reversed, and the U.S. incurred a net capital outflow of $6.5 billions. But, the U.S. recession persisted. Interest rates continued to drop into 1971, and money supply continued to expand. Capi- tal outflows reached immense dimensions, for that time, totalling $20 billions. In May of 1971, the United States recorded its first monthly trade deficit as well. That triggered a virtually interna- tional panic sell-off of U.S. dollars. The situation was, indeed, be- coming desperate. By 1971, U.S. official gold reserves represented less than one quarter of her official liabilities: theoretically, if all foreign dollar"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"146   A CENTURY OF WAR holders demanded gold instead, Washington would have been unable to comply without drastic measures. 1 The Wall Street establishment persuaded President Nixon to abandon fruitless efforts to support the dollar against a flood of international demand to redeem for gold. But, unfortunately, they did not want the required dollar devaluation against gold which had been intensely sought for almost a decade. On August 15,1971, Nixon took the advice of a close circle of key advisers which included his chief Budget adviser, George Shultz, and a policy group then at the Treasury Department, which in- cluded Paul Volcker and Jack F. Bennett. Bennett later went on to become a director of Exxon. That sunny quiet August day, the President of the United States announced a move which rocked the world: formal suspension of dollar convertibility into gold, effectively putting the world com- pletely onto a direct dollar-standard, with no gold backing. By doing this, the U.S. unilaterally ripped the central provision of the 1944 Bretton Woods system apart. Foreign holders of U.S. dollars could no longer redeem their paper for U.S. gold reserves. Nixon's unilateral action was reaffirmed in protracted interna- tional talks that December in Washington between the leading Eu- ropean governments, Japan, and a few others. The result was a bad compromise known as the Smithsonian Agreement. With an exag- geration which exceeded even that of his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, after the Smithsonian talks, Nixon announced that they were, \"the conclusion of the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world.\" The U.S. formally devalued the dol- lar a mere 8% against gold, placing gold at $38/fine ounce instead of the long-standing $35, hardly the 100% devaluation being asked by allied countries. The agreement also officially permitted a band of currency value fluctuation of 2.25% instead of the original 1% of the IMF Bretton Woods rules. By declaring to world dollar holders that their paper would no longer be redeemed for gold, Nixon \"pulled the plug\" on the world economy, setting a series of events into motion which would rock the world as never before. Confidence in the Smithso- nian agreement began to collapse within weeks. De Gaulle's defiance of Washington in April 1968 on the issue of gold, and his adherance to the rules of Bretton Woods, was not suf- ficient to force through the badly needed reordering of the inter- 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS? 147 national monetary system; but it had sufficiently poisoned the well of Washington's ill-conceived IMF Special Drawing Rights scheme to cover over the problems of the dollar. The suspension of gold redemption, and the resulting interna- tional \"floating exchange rates\" of the early 1970's, solved noth- ing. It only bought time. An eminently workable solution would have been for the U.S. to set the dollar to a more realistic level. From France, de Gaulle's for- mer economic adviser, Jacques Rueff, continued to plead for a $70/oz. gold price, instead of the $35 level which the U.S. unsuc- cessfully defended. This would calm world speculation and allow the U.S. to redeem her destabilizing Eurodollar balances abroad, without plunging the domestic U.S. economy into severe chaos, Rueff argued. If it was done right, it could have given a tremen- dous spur to U.S. industry, since its exports would cost less in for- eign currency. American industrial interests would again have predominated over financial voices in U.S. policy circles. But rea- son did not prevail. The Wall Street rationale was that the power of its financial do- main must be untouched, even if at the expense of economic pro- duction or American national prosperity. Gold itself has little intrinsic value. It has certain industrial uses. Historically, because of its scarcity, it has served as a standard of value against which different nations have fixed the terms of their trade and therefore their currencies. When Nixon decided to no longer honor U.S. currency obligations in gold, he opened the floodgates to a worldwide Las-Vegas-speculation binge of a di- mension never before experienced in history. Instead of calibrat- ing long-term economic affairs to fixed standards of exchange, after August 1971 world trade was simply another arena of spec- ulation on which direction various currencies would fluctuate. The real architects of the Nixon strategy were in the influential City of London merchant banks. Sir Siegmund Warburg, Edmond de Rothschild, Jocelyn Hambro, and others saw a golden opportu- nity in Nixon's dissolution of the Bretton Woods gold standard that summer of 1971. London was once again to become a major center of world finance, and again on \"borrowed money,\" this time American Eurodollars. After August 1971, dominant U.S. policy under White House National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger was to control, not"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"148 A CENTURY OF WAR to develop, economies throughout the world. U.S. policy officials proudly began calling themselves \"neo-Malthusians.\" Population reduction in developing nations, rather than technology transfer and industrial growth strategies, became the dominating priority during the 1970s, yet another throwback to nineteenth-century British colonial thinking. We shall soon see how this transforma- tion took place. The ineffective basis of the Smithsonian Agreement led to fur- ther deterioration in 1972. Massive capital flows again left the dol- lar for Japan and Europe, until February 12,1973, when Nixon fi- nally announced a second devaluation of the dollar, of 10% against gold. That set the gold price where it remains to this day for the Federal Reserve, at $42.22/ounce. At this point, all the major currencies began a process called the \"managed float.\" Between February and March of 1973, the value of the U.S. dollar dropped another 40% against the German Deutschmark. Permament instability was introduced into world monetary affairs in a way not seen since the early 1930's, but this time, strategists in New York, Washington and the City of London were preparing an unexpected surprise to regain the upper hand and recover from the devastating loss of the monetary pillar of their system. An unusual meeting in Saltsjoebaden The design behind Nixon's August 15,1971 dollar strategy did not emerge until October 1973, more than two years later, and even then, few persons outside a handful of insiders grasped the con- nection. The August 1971 demonetization of the dollar was used by the London-New York financial establishment to buy precious time, while policy insiders prepared a bold new monetarist de- sign, a \"paradigm shift\", as some preferred to term it. Certain influential voices in the Anglo-American financial estab- lishment devised a strategy to again create a strong dollar and to increase their relative political power in the world, just when it ap- peared they were in a decisive rout. In May 1973, with the dramatic fall of the dollar still fresh, a group of 84 of the world's top financial and political insiders met 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS? 149 at the secluded island resort of the Swedish Wallenberg banking family, at Saltsjoebaden, Sweden. This gathering of Prince Bern- hard's Bilderberg Group heard Walter Levy outline a \"scenario\" for an imminent 400 percent increase in OPEC petroleum revenues. The purpose of the secret Saltsjoebaden meeting was not to pre- vent the expected oil price shock, but to plan and manage the about-to-be-created flood of oil dollars, a process U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger later called \"recycling the petro-dollar flows.\" Present at Saltsjoebaden were Robert O. Anderson of Atlantic Richfield Oil Co.; Lord Greenhill, chairman of British Petroleum; Sir Eric Roll of S.G. Warburg, creator of the Eurobonds; George Ball of Lehman Brothers investment bank the man who some ten years earlier, as Assistant Secretary of State, told his banker friend Siegmund Warburg to develop London's Eurodollar market; David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank; Zbigniew Brzezin- ski; the man soon to be President Carter's National Security Ad- viser; Italy's Gianni Agnelli, and Germany's Otto Wolff von Ame- rongen, among others. Henry Kissinger was a regular participant at the Bilderberg gatherings. 2 The Bilderberg annual meetings first began, in utmost secrecy, in May, 1954, by an Anglophile group which included George Ball, David Rockefeller, Dr. Joseph Retinger, Holland's Prince Bern- hard, George C. McGhee (then of the U.S. State Department and later a senior executive of Mobil Oil). Named for the place of their first gathering, the Hotel de Bilderberg near Arnheim, the annual Bilderberg meetings gathered top elites from Europe and America for secret deliberations and policy discussion. Consensus was then \"shaped\" in subsequent press comments and media coverage, but never with reference to the secret Bilderberg talks themselves. This Bilderberg process became one of the most effective vehicles of postwar Anglo-American policy-shaping. In 1973, the powerful men grouped around Bilderberg decided to launch a colossal assault against industrial growth in the world, in order to tilt the balance of power back to the advantage of Anglo-American financial interests. In order to do this, they deter- mined to use their most prized weapon—control of the world's oil flows. Bilderberg policy was to trigger a global oil embargo in order to force a dramatic increase in world oil prices. Since 1945, world oil trade had, by international custom, been priced in dol- lars. American oil companies dominated the postwar market. A"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"150 A CENTURY OF WAR sharp sudden increase in the world price of oil, therefore, meant an equally dramatic increase in world demand for U.S. dollars to pay for that necessary oil. Never in history had such a small circle of interests, centered in London and New York, controlled so much of the entire world's economic destiny. The Anglo-American financial establishment resolved to use their oil power in a manner no one could imagine possible. Their scheme was utterly outrageous, and that was their chief advantage, they clearly reckoned. Kissinger's Yom Kippur oil shock On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria invaded Israel, igniting what became known as the \"Yom Kippur\" war. Contrary to pop- ular impression, the \"Yom Kippur\" war was not the result of sim- ple miscalculation, a blunder, or an Arab decision to launch a mil- itary strike against the state of Israel. The entire constellation of events surrounding outbreak of the October war was secretly or- chestrated from Washington and London, using the powerful dip- lomatic secret channels developed by Nixon's White House Na- tional Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger. Kissinger effectively controlled the Israeli policy response through his intimate relation with Israel's Washington to ambas- sador, Simcha Dinitz. In addition, Kissinger cultivated channels to the Egyptian and Syrian sides. His method was to simply misrep- resent to each party the critical elements of the other, ensuring the war and its subsequent Arab oil embargo. Kissinger, who was by then Nixon's intelligence \"czar\", consis- tently suppressed U.S. intelligence reports, including intercepted communications from Arab officials confirming the buildup for war. Washington scripted the war and its aftermath, including Kissinger's infamous \"shuttle diplomacy, along the precise lines of the Bilderberg deliberations of the previous May in Saltsjoebaden, some six months before outbreak of the war. Arab oil-producing nations were to be the scapegoat for the coming rage of the world, while the Anglo-American interests responsible stood quietly in the background. 3 In mid-October 1973, the German Government of Chancellor 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS? 151 Willy Brandt told the U.S. Ambassador to Bonn that Germany was neutral in the Middle East conflict, and would not permit the U.S. to resupply Israel from German military bases. With an ominous foreboding of similar exchanges which would occur some 17 years later, on October 30,1973 Nixon sent Chancellor Brandt a sharply worded protest note, most probably drafted by Kissinger: \"We recognize that the Europeans are more dependent upon Arab oil than we, but we disagree that your vulnerability is de- creased by disassociating yourselves from us on a matter of this importance...You note that this crisis was not a case of common re- sponsibility for the Alliance, and that military supplies for Israel were for purposes which are not part of alliance responsibility. I do not believe we can draw such a fine line...\" 4 Washington would not permit Germany to declare its neutrality in the Mideast conflict. But, significantly, Britain was allowed to clearly state its neutrality, thus avoiding the impact of the Arab oil embargo. Once again, London skillfully maneuvered itself around an international crisis which it had been instrumental in precipi- tating. One consequence of the ensuing 400% rise in OPEC oil prices was that investments of hundreds of millions of dollars by B.P., Royal Dutch Shell, and other Anglo-American petroleum concerns in the risky North Sea could produce oil at a profit. It is a curious fact of the time, that the profitability of these new North Sea oil fields was not at all secure until after Kissinger's oil shock. By October 16, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun- tries, following a meeting on oil prices in Vienna, raised their price by a then-staggering 70%, from $3.01/barrel to $5.11. That same day, the members of the Arab OPEC countries, citing the U.S. sup- port for Israel in the Mideast war, declared an embargo on all oil sales to the United States and Netherlands—the major oil port of Western Europe. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Libya, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Alge- ria announced on October 17,1973 that they would cut their pro- duction below the September level by 5% for October and an ad- ditional 5% per month, \"until Israeli withdrawal is completed from the whole Arab territories occupied in June 1967 and the legal rights of the Palestinian people are restored.\" The world's first \"oil shock,\" or as the Japanese termed it, \"Oil Shokku\" was underway. Significantly, the oil crisis hit full force just as the President of the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"152 A CENTURY OF WAR United States was becoming personally embroiled in what came to be called the \"Watergate affair/' leaving Henry Kissinger as de facto President, running U.S. policy during the crisis in late 1973. When the Nixon White House sent a senior official to the U.S. Treasury in 1974 to devise a strategem to force OPEC into lower- ing the oil price, he was bluntly turned away. In a memo the offi- cial stated, \"It was the banking leaders who swept aside this ad- vice and pressed for a 'recycling' program to accommodate to higher oil prices. This was the fatal decision...\" The U.S. Treasury, under Jack Bennett, the man who helped steer Nixon's fateful August 1971 dollar policy, had established a secret accord with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, SAMA, final- ized in a February 1975 memo from U.S. Assistant Treasury Secre- tary Jack F. Bennett to Secretary of State Kissinger. Under the terms of the agreement, a sizeable share of the huge new Saudi oil reve- nue windfall was to be invested in financing the U.S. government deficits. A young Wall Street investment banker with the leading Eurobond firm of White Weld & Co. based in London, David Mul- ford, was sent to Saudi Arabia to become the principal \"invest- ment adviser\" to SAMA; he was to guide the Saudi petrodollar in- vestments to the correct banks, naturally in London and New York. The Bilderberg scheme was operating as planned. 5 Kissinger, already firmly in control of all U.S. intelligence esti- mates as Nixon's all-powerful National Security Adviser, secured control of U.S. foreign policy as well, persuading Nixon to name him Secretary of State in the weeks just prior to outbreak of the Oc- tober Yom Kippur war. Indicative of his central role in events, Kis- singer retained both titles as head of the White House National Se- curity Council and as Secretary of State, something no individual had done before or after him. During the last months of the Nixon presidency, no other single person wielded as much absolute power as Henry Kissinger did. Adding insult to injury, Kissinger was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize. Following a meeting in Teheran on January 1,1974, yet a second price increase of more than 100% was added, bringing OPEC benchmark oil prices to $11.65. This was done on the surprising demand by the Shah of Iran, who had been secretly told to do so by Henry Kissinger. Only months earlier, the Shah had opposed the OPEC increase to $3.01 for fear this would force Western exporters to charge more 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  153  for the industrial equipment the Shah sought to import for Iran's ambitious industrialization. Washington and Western support for Israel in the October war fed OPEC's anger at the meetings. Kis- singer's own State Department was not informed of Kissinger's secret machinations with the Shah. 6 From 1949 until the end of 1970, Middle East crude oil prices had averaged approximately $1.90/barrel. They rose to $3.01 in early 1973, the time of the fateful Saltsjoebaden meeting of the Bilderberg group which discussed an imminent 400% future rise in OPEC's price. By January 1974 that 400% increase was a fait accompli. The economic impact of the oil shock The social impact of the oil embargo on the United States in late 1973 could be described as panic. Throughout 1972 and early 1973, the large multinational oil companies, led by Exxon, pursued a cu- rious policy of creating short domestic supply of crude oil. They were allowed to do so under a series of decisions made by President Nixon on advice of his aides. When the embargo hit in November 1973, therefore, the impact could not have been more dramatic. At the time, the White House was responsible for controlling U.S. oil imports under provisions of a 1959 U.S. Trade Agreements Act. In January 1973, Nixon appointed Treasury Secretary George Shultz to be the Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs as well. In this post, Shultz oversaw White House oil import policy. His Deputy Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, a former Wall Street bond trader, was made chairman of the important Oil Pol- icy Committee which determined U.S. oil import supply in the critical months leading up to the October embargo. In February 1973, Nixon was persuaded to set up a special \"en- ergy triumvirate\" which included Shultz, White House aide John Ehrlichman, and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, to be known as the White House Special Energy Committee. The scene was quietly being set for the Bilderberg plan, although almost no one in Washington or elsewhere realized the fact. By October 1973, domestic U.S. stocks of crude oil were already at alarmingly low levels. The OPEC embargo triggered the public into panic pur- chases of gasoline, calls for rationing, endless gas lines, and a sharp economic recession. 7"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"154 A CENTURY OF WAR The most severe impact of the oil crisis hit the United States' largest city, New York. In December 1974, nine of the world's most powerful bankers, led by David Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan, Citibank, and the London-New York investment bank, Lazard Freres, told the Mayor of New York, Abraham Beame, an old-line machine politician, that unless he turned over control of the city's huge pension funds to a committee of the banks, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the banks and their influential friends in the media would ensure the financial ruin of the city. Not surpris- ingly, the overpowered Mayor capitulated, and New York City was forced to slash spending for roadways, bridges, hospitals and schools in order to service its bank debt, and lay off tens of thou- sands of city workers. The nation's greatest city had begun its de- scent into a scrap heap. Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres became head of the new bankers' collection agency, dubbed \"Big MAC\" by the press. In Western Europe, the shock of the oil price rise and the em- bargo on supplies was equally dramatic. From Britain to the Con- tinent, country after country felt the effects of the worst economic crisis since the 1930's. Bankruptcies and unemployment rose to alarming levels across Europe. Germany's government imposed an emergency ban on Sunday driving in a desperate effort to save imported oil costs. By June 1974, the effects of the oil crisis contributed to the dramatic col- lapse of Germany's Herstatt-Bank and a crisis in the D-mark as a result. Germany's imported oil costs increased by a staggering 17 billion D-marks in 1974, with a half million people reckoned to be unemployed because of the oil shock. Inflation levels reached an alarming 8%. The shock effects of a sudden 400% increase in the price of Germany's basic energy feedstock were devastating to in- dustry, transport, and agriculture. Keystone industries such as steel, shipbuilding, and chemicals all went into a deep crisis at this time as a result of the oil shock. Willy Brandt's government was effectively defeated by the do- mestic impact of the oil crisis, as much as by the Stasi-spy affair revelations about his close adviser, Gunther Guillaume. By May 1974, Brandt offered his resignation to Federal President Heine- mann, who then appointed Helmut Schmidt Chancellor. Most governments across Europe fell in this period, victim to the conse- quences of the oil shock on their economies. 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  155  But the economic impact on the developing economies of the world—for at this time they still could be rightly called develop- ing, rather than the fatalistic term \"Third World\" which is so much in vogue today—the impact of an overnight price increase of 400% in their primary energy source was staggering. The vast majority of the world's less-developed economies, without significant do- mestic oil resources, were suddenly confronted with an unex- pected and unpayable 400% increase in costs of energy imports, to say nothing of costs of chemicals and fertilizers for agriculture de- rived from petroleum. During this time, commentators began speaking of \"triage,\" the wartime idea of survival of the fittest, and introduced the vocabulary of \"Third World\" and \"Fourth World\" (the non-OPEC countries). In 1973, India had a positive balance of trade, a healthy situation for a developing economy. By 1974, India had total foreign ex- change reserves of $629 millions with which to pay—in dollars— an annual oil import bill of almost double that or $1,241 million. In 1974, Sudan, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Africa and Latin America, country after country was faced with gaping deficits in its balance of payments. As a whole, over 1974 developing coun- tries incurred a total trade deficit of $35 billion according to the IMF, a colossal sum in that day, and, not surprisingly, a deficit pre- cisely 4 times as large as in 1973, or just in proportion to the oil price increase. Following the several years of strong industrial and trade growth of the early 1970's, the severe drop in industrial activity throughout the world economy in 1974-75 was greater than any such decline since the war. But, while Kissinger's 1973-74 oil shock had a devastating impact on world industrial growth, it was an enormous benefit for certain established interests—the major New York and London banks, and the Seven Sister oil multinationals in the U.S. and Britain. Exxon replaced General Motors as the largest American corporation in gross revenues by 1974. Her sisters were not far behind, including Mobil, Texaco, Chevron and Gulf. The bulk of OPEC dollar revenues, Kissinger's \"recycled petro- dollars,\" was deposited with the leading banks of London and New York, the banks which dealt in dollars as well as international oil trade. Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, Bank of America, Barclays, Lloyds, Midland Bank, all enjoyed the windfall profits of the oil shock. We shall later see how they recy-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"156   A CENTURY OF WAR cled their \"petro-dollars\" during the 1970's, and how it set the stage for the great debt crisis of the 1980's. 8 Taking the bloom off the \"nuclear rose\" One principal concern of the authors of the 400% oil price in- crease was how to ensure that their drastic action would not drive the world to accelerate an already strong trend towards construc- tion of a far more efficient and ultimately less expensive alterna- tive energy source—nuclear electricity generation. Kissinger's former dean at Harvard University, and his boss when Kissinger briefly served as a consultant to John Kennedy's National Security Council, was McGeorge Bundy. Bundy left the White House in 1966 in order to play a crucial role in shaping the domestic policy of the United States as president of the largest pri- vate foundation, the Ford Foundation. By December 1971, Bundy had established a major new project for the foundation, the Energy Policy Project under the direction of S. David Freeman, with an im- pressive $4 million checkbook and a three year time limit. Bundy's Ford Foundation study, titled, \"A Time to Choose: America's En- ergy Future,\" was released precisely in the midst of debate during the 1974 oil shock. It was to shape the public debate in the critical time of the oil crisis. For the first time in American establishment circles, the fraudu- lent thesis was proclaimed that, \"Energy growth and economic growth can be uncoupled; they are not Siamese twins.\" Freeman's study advocated bizarre and demonstrably inefficient \"alterna- tive\" energy sources such as windpower, solar reflectors and burn- ing recycled waste. The Ford Foundation report made a scurillous attack on nuclear energy, arguing that the technologies involved could theoretically be used to make nuclear bombs. \"The fuel it- self or one of the byproducts, plutonium, can be used directly or processed into the material for nuclear bombs or explosive de- vices,\" they asserted. The Ford Foundation study correctly noted that the principal competitor to the hegemony of petroleum in the future was nu- clear energy, warning against the \"very rapidity with which nu- clear power is spreading in all parts of the world and by develop- 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  157  rnent of new nuclear technologies, most notably the fast breeder reactors and the centrifuge method of enriching uranium.\" The framework of the U.S. financial establishment's anti-nuclear \"green\" assault was defined by Bundy's project. 9 By the early 1970's, nuclear technology had clearly established itself as the preferred future choice for efficient electric generation, vastly more efficient (and environmentally friendly) than either oil or coal. At the time of the oil shock, the European Community was already well into a major nuclear development program. As of 1975, the plans of member governments called for completion of between 160 and 200 new nuclear plants across Continental Eu- rope by 1985. The Schmidt government in Germany, reacting rationally to the implications of the 1974 oil shock, passed a program in 1975 which called for an added 42 gigawatts of German nuclear plant capac- ity, for a total of approximately 45% of the total German electricity requirement by 1985, a program exceeded in the EC only by France, which projected 45 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 1985. In the fall of 1975, Italy's Industry Minister, Carlo Donat Cat- tin, instructed Italy's nuclear companies, ENEL and CNEN, to draw up plans for construction of some 20 nuclear plants for com- pletion by the early 1980's. Even Spain, just then emerging from four decades of Franco's rule, had a program calling for construc- tion of 20 nuclear plants by 1983. A typical 1 gigawatt nuclear fa- cility is generally sufficient to supply all electricity requirements for a modern industrial city of one million people. For the first time, the rapidly growing nuclear industries of Eu- rope, especially France and Germany, were beginning to emerge as competent rivals to American domination of the nuclear export market by the time of the 1974 oil shock. France had secured a Let- ter of Intent from the Shah of Iran, as had Germany's KWU, to build a total of four nuclear reactors in Iran, while France had signed with Pakistan's Bhutto government to create a modern nu- clear infrastructure in that country. Negotiations between the Ger- man government and Brazil also reached a successful conclusion in February 1976, for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which included German construction of eight nuclear re- actors as well as facilities for reprocessing and enrichment of ura- nium reactor fuel. With full support of their governments, German and French nuclear companies entered into negotiations with se-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"158 A CENTURY OF WAR lect developing sector countries, very much in the spirit of Eisenhower's 1953 Atoms for Peace declaration. Clearly, the Anglo-American energy grip, based on their tight control of the world's major energy source, petroleum, was threat- ened if these quite feasible programs went ahead. In the postwar period, nuclear energy was the equivalent im- provement of technology which oil had represented over coal when Lord Fisher and Winston Churchill argued that Britain's navy had to convert to oil from coal at the end of the last century. The major difference in the 1970's was that Britain and her cousins in the United States held the grip on world oil supplies. World nu- clear technology threatened to open relatively unlimited energy possibilities, especially if plans for commercial nuclear fast breed- ers were realized, as well as thermonuclear fusion. Two nuclear-industry organizations were established in the im- mediate aftermath of the 1974 oil shock, both based in London. In early 1975, an informal and semi-secret group was established, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, or \"London Club\" as it was known. This group included Britain, the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the USSR. It was an initial Anglo-American effort to impose self-restraint on nuclear export. It was complemented in May 1975 by formation of another secretive organization, which grouped the world's major suppliers of nuclear uranium fuel, the London \"Uranium Institute,\" dominated by traditional British regions in- cluding Canada, Australia, South Africa and the UK. These \"in- sider\" organizations were necessary but by no means sufficient for the Anglo-American interests to contain the nuclear \"threat\" in the early 1970's. As one prominent anti-nuclear American from the Aspen Insti- tute expressed their problem, \"We must take the bloom off the 'nu- clear rose.'\" And they did. Developing the Anglo-American green agenda It was no accident that a growing part of the population in West- ern Europe, especially in Germany/following the oil shock reces- sion of 1974-75, began talking for the first time in the postwar pe- riod about \"limits to growth,\" or threats to the environment, and 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  159  began to question their faith in the principle of industrial growth and technological progress. Very few people realized the extent to which their new \"opinions\" were being carefully manipulated from the top by a network established by the same Anglo-Ameri- can finance and industry circles behind the Saltsjoebaden oil shock strategy. Beginning the 1970's, an awesome propaganda offensive was launched from select Anglo-American think-tanks and journals, intended to shape a new \"limits to growth\" agenda, which would ensure the \"success\" of the dramatic oil shock strategy. The Amer- ican oilman present at the May 1973 Saltsjoebaden meeting of the Bilderberg group, Robert O. Anderson, was a central figure in the implementation of the ensuing Anglo-American ecology agenda. It was to become one of the most successful frauds in history. Anderson and his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. funneled millions of dollars through their Atlantic Richfield Foundation into select or- ganizations to target nuclear energy. One of the prime beneficiar- ies of Anderson's largesse was a group called Friends of the Earth, established in this time with a $200,000 grant from Anderson. One of the earliest actions of Anderson's Friends of the Earth was to fi- nance an assault on the German nuclear industry through such anti-nuclear actions as the anti-Brockdorf demonstrations in 1976, which were led by Friends of the Earth leader Holger Strohm. The director of Friends of the Earth in France one Brice LaLonde, was a partner of the Rockefeller family law firm in Paris, Coudert Brothers, and became Mitterrand's Environment Minister in 1989. It was Friends of the Earth which was used to block a major Japan-Australia uranium supply agreement. In November 1974 Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka came to Canberra to meet Austra- lian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. The two made a commitment potentially worth billions of dollars, for Australia to supply Japan's needs for future uranium ore and enter a joint project to develop uranium enrichment technology. The British uranium mining giant, Rio Tinto Zinc, secretly deployed Friends of the Earth in Australia to mobilize opposition to the pending Japanese agreement, resulting some months later in the fall of Whitlam's government. Friends of the Earth had \"friends\" in very high places in London and Washington. Robert O. Anderson's major vehicle to spread the new \"limits to"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"160 A CENTURY OF WAR growth\" ideology among American and European establishment circles, was his Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. With An- derson as Chairman, and Atlantic Richfield head Thornton Brad- shaw as vice-chairman, the Aspen Institute was a major financial conduit for creation of the establishment's new anti-nuclear agenda in the early 1970's. Among the better-known trustees of Aspen at this time was world Bank President and the man who ran the Vietnam war, Ro- bert S. McNamara. Lord Bullock of Oxford University, Richard Gardner, an anglophile American economist who later became U.S. Ambassador to Italy, and Wall Street banker, Russell Peterson of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., were among the carefully se- lected trustees of Aspen at this time, as were EXXON board mem- ber Jack G. Clarke, Gulf Oil's Jerry McAfee, Mobil Oil director George C. McGhee, the former State Department official who was present in 1954 at the founding meeting of the Bilderberg group. Also involved with Anderson's Aspen in this early period was Marion Countess Donhoff, publisher of Die Zeit in Hamburg, as well as former Chase Manhattan Bank chairman and High Com- missioner to Germany, John J. McCloy Robert O. Anderson brought in Joseph Slater from McGeorge Bundy's Ford Foundation to serve as Aspen's president. It was, in- deed, a close-knit family in the Anglo-American establishment of the early 1970's. The initial project Slater launched at Aspen was the preparation of an international organizational offensive against industrial growth and especially nuclear energy, using the auspices (and the money) of the United Nations. Slater secured support of Sweden's UN Ambassador Sverker Aastrom, who steered a proposal for an international conference on the environ- ment through the UN over strenuous objections from developing countries. From the outset, the June 1972 Stockholm United Nations' Con- ference on the Environment was run by operatives of Anderson's Aspen Institute. Aspen board member, Maurice Strong, a Cana- dian oilman from Petro-Canada, chaired the Stockholm confer- ence. Aspen also provided financing to create an international zero-growth network under UN auspices called the International Institute for Environment and Development, whose board in- cluded Robert O. Anderson, Robert McNamara, Strong, and Brit- ish Labour Party's Roy Jenkins. The new organization immedi- 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  161  ately produced a book, \"Only One Earth,\" by Rockefeller Univer- sity associate Rene Dubos and British malthusian Barbara Ward (Lady Jackson). The International Chambers of Commerce were also persuaded at this time as well to sponsor Maurice Strong and other Aspen figures in seminars targetting international business- men on the emerging new environmentalist ideology. The Stockholm 1972 conference created the necessary interna- tional organizational and publicity infrastructure, so that by the time of the Kissinger oil shock of 1973-74, a massive anti-nuclear propaganda offensive could be launched, with the added assis- tance of millions of dollars readily available from oil-linked chan- nels of the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Rockefeller Brothers' Fund and other such elite Anglo-American establishment circles. Among the groups which were funded by these people at this time were organizations including the ultra-elitist World Wildlife Fund, then chaired by the Bilderberg's Prince Bernhard, and later by Royal Dutch Shell's John Loudon. 10 It is indicative of this financial establishment's overwhelming influence in the American and British media that, during this pe- riod, no public outcry was launched to investigate the probable conflict of interest involved in Robert O. Anderson's well-financed anti-nuclear offensive, and the fact that his Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. was one of the major beneficiaries from the 1974 price increase for oil. Anderson's ARCO had invested tens of millions of dollars in high-risk oil infrastructure in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Britain's North Sea, together with Exxon, British Petroleum, Shell and the other Seven Sisters. Had the 1974 oil shock not raised the market price of oil to $11.65/barrel or thereabouts, Anderson's, as well as British Petro- leum's, Exxon's, and the others' investments in the North Sea and Alaska would have brought financial ruin. To ensure a friendly press in Britain, Anderson purchased ownership of the London Observer at this time. Virtually no one asked whether Anderson and his influential friends might have known in advance that Kis- singer would create the conditions for a 400% oil price rise.\" Not to leave any zero growth stone unturned, Robert O. Ander- son also contributed significant funds to a project initiated by the Rockefeller family, together with Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King, at the Rockefeller's estate at Bellagio, Italy. In 1972, this Club of Rome and the U.S. Association of the Club of Rome gave wide-"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"162 A CENTURY OF WAR spread publicity to their publication of a scientifically fraudulent computer-simulation prepared by Dennis Meadows and Jay For- rester, the notorious \"Limits to Growth.\" Meadows and Forrester embellished the discredited essay of Thomas Parson Malthus with modern computer graphics, and insisted that the world would soon perish for lack of adequate energy, food, and other resources. As Malthus did, they chose to ignore the impact of technological progress on improving the human condition. Their message was one of unmitigated gloom and cultural pessimism. Germany was one of the countries most targetted for this new Anglo-American anti-nuclear offensive. While France's nuclear program was equally if not more ambitious, Germany was deemed a country where Anglo-American intelligence assets had greater likelihood of success on account of their history in the post- war occupation of the Federal Republic. Almost as soon as the ink had dried on the Schmidt government's 1975 nuclear develop- ment program, the offensive was launched. A young woman whose mother was German and stepfather American, and who had lived in the U.S. until 1970, working for U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey, among other things, was a key operative in this new project. Petra K. Kelly had close ties, from her years in the U.S., to one of the principal new Anglo-American anti- nuclear organizations created by McGeorge Bundy's Ford Foun- dation, the Natural Resources Defense Council. The Natural Re- sources Defense Council included Barbara Ward (Lady Jackson) and Laurance Rockefeller among its board members at the time. In Germany, Kelly began organizing legal assaults against construc- tion of the German nuclear program during the mid-1970's, result- ing in costly delays and eventual large cuts in the entire German nuclear plan. Population control becomes U.S. \"national security\" In 1798, an obscure English clergyman, Thomas Parson Malthus, professor of political economy in the employ of the British East India Company's East India College at Haileybury, was promoted to instant fame by his English sponsors for his \"Essay on the Prin- 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS? 163 ciple of Population.\" The essay itself was a blatant scientific fraud, plagiarized largely from a Venetian attack on the positive popula- tion theory of Benjamin Franklin. The Venetian attack on Franklin's essay was authored by Gian- maria Ortes in 1774. Malthus' adaptation of Ortes' \"theory\" was re- fined with a facade of mathematical formulas, which he called the \"law of geometric progression.\" According to this socalled \"law,\" human populations invariably expanded geometrically, while the means of subsistence were arithmetically limited, or linear. Malthus made quite clear how his \"ideal\" balance between pop- ulation and food resources could be achieved. \"All children born beyond what would be required to keep up the population to the desired level, [would] necessarily perish unless room be made for them by the death of grown persons.\" Malthus, furthermore, left no doubt that this must be active pol- icy on the part of governments: \"We should facilitate instead of foolishly and vainly attempting to im- pede, the operations of nature in producing this mortality. And if we dread the too frequent visitation of the horid form of famine, we should seditiously encourage other forms of destruction which we compel nature to use. Instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we should en- courage contrary habits. In our towns, we should make the streets more narrow, crowd more people into houses and court the return of the plague. In the country we should build our villages near stagnant pools and par- ticularly encourage settlements in all marshy and unwholesome situa- tions. But above all, we should reprobate specific remedies for ravaging dieseases and those benevolent but much mistaken men who have thought they were doing a service to mankind by projecting schemes for the total extirpation of particular disease.\" n The flaw in Malthus' argument, as demonstrated irrefutably by the spectacular growth of civilization, technology, and agricul- tural productivity since 1798, was Malthus' ploy to ignore the con- tribution of advances in science and technology to dramatically improve such factors as crop yields, labor productivity and the like. By the mid-1970's, indicative of the effectiveness of the new propaganda onslaught from the Anglo-American establishment, American government officials were openly boasting in public press conferences that they were committed \"neo-Malthusians,\" something for which they would have been laughed out of office"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"164 A CENTURY OF WAR a mere decade or so earlier. But nowhere did the new embrace of British malthusian economics in the United States show itself more brutally than in Kissinger's National Security Council. On April 24,1974, in the midst of the oil crisis, White House Na- tional Security adviser Henry Alfred Kissinger issued National Security Council Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200), on the subject of \"Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests.\" It was directed to all cabinet sec- retaries, the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the CIA and other key agencies. On October 16, 1975, at Kissinger's urging, President Gerald Ford issued a memorandum confirming the need for \"U.S. leadership in world population matters,\" based on the contents of the classified NSSM 200 document. For the first time in American history, the document espoused malthusianism as an explicitly desirable aim of the security policy of the govern- ment of the United States. More bitterly ironic was the fact that it was initiated by a German-born Jew. Even during the years of the Nazi regime in Germany, government officials had greater inhibi- tions against officially espousing such policies. NSSM 200 argued that population expansion in select develop- ing countries which also contain key strategic resources necessary to the U.S. economy posed potential U.S. \"national security threats.\" The study warned that under pressure from an expand- ing domestic population, countries with needed raw materials will tend to demand better prices and higher terms of trade for their exports to the United States. In this context, the NSSM 200 identified a target list of 13 countries, singled out as \"strategic tar- gets\" for U.S. efforts at population control. The list was drawn up in 1974. There is no doubt that the selection of countries intended to be victims of this policy was made, as was the case in all other major decisions in which Kissinger played a role, following close consultation with the British Foreign Office. Kissinger explicitly stated in the memorandum, \"how much more efficient expenditures for population control might be than [funds for] raising production through direct investments in addi- tional irrigation and power projects and factories.\" British 19th Century Imperialism could have expressed it no better. With this secret policy declaration, the government of the United States had committed itself to an agenda which would contribute to its own economic demise as well as untold famine, misery, and unneces- 9 - WHO REALLY MADE THE 1970'S OIL SHOCKS?  165  sary death throughout the developing sector. The 13 target coun- tries named in Kissinger's study were Brazil, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, Philippines, Thai- land, Turkey, Ethiopia, and Colombia.

In June 1973, on the personal initiative of Chase Manhattan Bank chairman David Rockefeller, an influential new international organization, largely built on the foundation of the Bilderberg group, was established. It was called the Tri- lateral Commission, and its first executive director was Bilderberg attendee Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Trilateral Commission attempted for the first time in postwar Anglo-American history to draw Japanese finance and business elites into the Anglo-American policy consensus formation. In 1976, Henry Kissinger changed places with Brzezinski as Trilateral director, while Brzezinski assumed Kissinger's job as National Security Adviser to the new President Jimmy Carter, himself a member of the semi-secret Trilateral Commission group as were many of his key cabinet secretaries. 11.

CHAPTER TEN: Europe, Japan and the Developing Sector Respond to the Oil Shock \"Petrodollar Monetary Order\" devastates the developing world D ESPITE THE ENORMOUS economic and financial shocks ensuing from the 1974 oil price inflation on the world economy, by late 1975 certain parts of the world had begun to resume industrial development, as though it had sus- tained a stunning blow, recovered, and continued on its path. Kissinger's 1974 oil shock had secured certain objectives for the Anglo-American Bilderberg group, but by no means had the glo- bal parameters of industrial development yet been decisively al- tered to their satisfaction. Their continuing strategic domination was still mortally threatened. If we examine the world's output of steel, as well as the total of ton-miles of world shipping trade, we notice a striking measure of the health of the world's economic progress. Beginning in the early 1950's when the world started to rebuild from the destruction of the Second World War, world crude steel production made a steady upward climb, as measured in metric tons of crude steel produced. Steel, to this day, is one of the best single measures against which to judge overall industrial progress for a nation's economy. Unlike the ail-too fashionable calculation of Gross Na- tional Product (GNP) which measures price levels regardless of whether an activity is productive or non-productive, whether it in- volves construction of infrastructure or spending on a gambling casino in Las Vegas, output of steel, measured in ton-weight, can- not be manipulated. It is a firm measure. Steel, moreover, is"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"168 A CENTURY OF WAR essential for transport, for building, for infrastructure of all kinds. The Western world, including the developing sector, steadily in- creased its steel output from less than 175 million metric tons in 1950 up to an all-time historic peak of just under 500 million tons by the time Kissinger's 1974-75 oil shock impacted. Steel is also one of the most energy-intensive industries. For two to three years after the first oil shock, world steel output reflected the economic shock and plummeted almost 15% from its peak of 1974-5. But by 1976, steel output resumed a steady upward climb. A similar pattern occurred in world sea-borne trade, with a sharp decline in total ton-miles carried by ocean ships in response to the 1974 oil shock and the severe world economic downturn, followed by a similar slow but steady recovery up to 1977-8. The year 1975 witnessed the first major decline of world trade since the end of the war in 1945, a significant drop of 6%, with a slow re- sumption afterward. 1 But one sector which did not recover from the greatest financial and inflation shock of the postwar period were the fragile coun- tries south of the Equator, most especially those which had no sig- nificant indigenous oil supplies. For the vast majority of the devel- oping sector, the oil shock spelled an end to development, inabil- ity to finance industrial and agriculture improvement, and a rever- sal of hopes for a better life which had emerged during the 1960's. As though some perverse fate had struck, this oil shock coin- cided, during the years 1974-75, with onset of the worst global drought seen in decades, leading to severe harvest shortfalls, es- pecially in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia, just as the ec- onomic impact of the oil shock was greatest. With the desperate need to import record volumes of grain and other food from the United States and Western Europe, most under-developed coun- tries found themselves faced with famine, unable to finance in- creased food imports, to say nothing of financing the oil shock. The dynamic created from the Anglo-American decoupling of the dollar from gold in August 1971, followed by the 400% forced inflation of the price of oil, created a catastrophe for the majority of the world's population living in the developing sector. Bank of Italy chairman Guido Carli noted at the time that the \"banking community has increasingly come to be regarded with hostility...The feeling of mistrust derives from a conviction that the commercial banks have appropriated too large a share of mone- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK   169   tary sovereignty.\" Carli described the effects of the oil shock on world financial flows in an address to fellow bankers during early 1976. In the context of the 1971 dollar-gold decoupling and float- ing exchange rates, the new oil price shock had created a world- wide shortage of liquidity. \"The shortage of international liquid- ity was made up by the banks,\" Carli noted, \"and in large meas- ure by American banks through their overseas branches.\" Carli remarked that some saw this process as \"corroboration of the evil intentions\" of those who were behind the push for crea- tion of the new gold-free dollar monetary order, \"maintaining that the eradication of gold from the system and the failure to replace it with official instruments confirm a malicious design to streng- then the dominant position of the American banks\". 2 Indeed, some did see it as malicious. While industrial countries experienced a certain slow recovery from the initial oil shock by 1975, the overall position of developing economies deteriorated as a result of the quadrupling of primary oil prices. Total current-ac- count deficits of all developing countries rose from an average of some $6 billion per year during the early 1970's, to more than $26 billion in 1974 (again, a quadrupling in parallel with the price of oil), and an unbearable seven-fold increase, to $42 billion by 1976, with the vast majority of this deficit in countries of the developing sector whose per capita income levels were the lowest in the world. Under the threat of losing access to further borrowings from the World Bank and private industrial-nation banks, less-developed countries were forced to divert precious funds from industrial and agricultural development into simply reducing this \"balance of payment\" deficit. Their oil imports had to be paid, and paid in dol- lars, while the cost of their raw materials exports fell sharply in the global recession of 1974-5. The countries were forced to borrow short-term, to pay the huge oil import payments, and the only major lenders ready to lend were the U.S. and British \"Eurodollar\" banks, recycling their huge new Petrodollar windfall. The entire Indian subcontinent, most of Africa, and entire regions of Latin America were plunged into severe economic and political crisis as a result. Private U.S. and European banks stepped in to the breach, under the Bilderberg \"petrodollar recycling\" strategy, to lend to these countries, but only to \"balance\" the accounts which had been left"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"170 A CENTURY OF WAR in shambles by the Anglo-American oil shock, not to finance crea- tion of necessary production infrastructure or technology deve- lopment. These private petrodollar loans came from the London \"Eurodollar\" banks of the United States and Britain. OPEC oil re- venues, paid to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other countries, were paid in dollars and those dollars were channeled and \"guided\" into offshore London Eurodollar banks for re-lending to the vic- tims of the new oil shock in the developing sector. Dr. Kissinger and friends left nothing to chance in the process. A senior partner of an American investment bank at the center of the Eurodollar markets, David Mulford, at the time the head of White Weld & Company's London Eurodollar operations, was ap- pointed a director and principal investment adviser of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the central bank of Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC oil producer and the country dominated by Ameri- can Big Oil. Little publicity was given to this rather unusual ap- pointment of a national of the country against which Saudi Arabia had only months earlier enjoined an oil embargo. Along with White Weld, SAMA enjoyed the confidential investment advice of the elite London merchant bank, Baring Brothers. As director of the SAMA, David Mulford was in a critical posi- tion to ensure Saudi authorities made \"wise\" use of their new fi- nancial windfall. To make Mr. Mulford's task easier, Citibank, closely tied to Exxon and the American oil companies involved in Saudi Arabia's ARAMCO, was curiously enough able to operate in this period as the only wholly-owned foreign bank with opera- tions in Saudi Arabia. Not surprisingly, in 1974, a full 70% of OPEC oil surplus revenues were invested abroad in stocks, bonds, real estate and the like. Of this enormous sum of $57 billion, no less than 60% went directly to financial institutions of the United States and Britain. 3 Already on June 8,1974, in his capacity as U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger signed an agreement establishing a little-noted U.S.-Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation, whose official mandate included, among other projects, \"cooper- ation in the field of finance.\" (Kissinger retained the unprece- dented dual posts of National Security Adviser to the President and Secretary of State well into Gerald Ford's Presidency). By December 1974, the nature of this cooperation was defined more clearly, always kept in strict secrecy by both Saudi and Wash- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK   171   ington governments. The U.S. Treasury signed an agreement in Ri- yadh with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, whose mission was, \"to establish a new relationship through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the (U.S.) Treasury borrowing operation. Under this arrangement, SAMA will purchase new U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of at least one year,\" explained Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Jack F. Bennett, later to become a di- rector of Exxon. Bennett's memo was addressed to Secretary of State Kissinger, dated February 1975, explaining the arrangements agreed two months before. 4 No less astonishing than these U.S.-Saudi \"arrangements\" to one ignorant of the actual history of Anglo-American interests in the Persian Gulf, was the exclusive policy decision by the OPEC oil states to accept only U.S. dollars for their oil, not German Marks despite their clear value, not Japanese Yen, French Francs, nor even Swiss Francs, but only American dollars. Dollar oil pricing was initially a practice encouraged after the Second World War by the American oil majors and by their bank- ers in New York. But when, following the oil shock of early 1974, leading European governments began to enter into serious nego- tiations with Arab oil suppliers to secure long-term oil purchase contracts to cover their import needs, to be paid in their own na- tional currency—an eminently sensible move, which would have enormously lessened the impact of the oil shock on Europe— something extraordinary occurred within OPEC. Germany or France would have had far less difficulty securing domestic funds for payment of oil imports in Deutschmarks or Francs than to buy dollars for the same oil. This makes it all the more curious that OPEC ministers, in a meeting in 1975, agreed to accept no other currency than the U.S. dollar in payment for deliveries of its oil, not even British Pound Sterling. This arrangement, needless to say, proved enormously valuable for the United States dollar, and for the financial institutions of New York and the London Eurodollar markets. The world was forced to buy immense amounts of dollars more or less continu- ously, in order to purchase essential energy supplies. Even more extraordinary, this OPEC dollar-pricing agreement remained in force, despite the subsequent enormous losses to OPEC as the dollar gyrated up and down through the next decade and more."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"172 A CENTURY OF WAR One consequence of the directed recycling of these petrodollars into London and New York was the emergence of American banks as the giants of world banking, paralleling the emergence of their clients, the Seven Sister oil multinationals, as the giants of world industry. The Anglo-American oil and banking combination so overwhelmed the scale of ordinary enterprise, that their power and influence seemed invincible. In effect, through such secret arrangements as the U.S.-Saudi Joint Agreement with the Treasury, the activities of David Mul- ford, as well as OPEC's strange dollar-pricing mandate, Washing- ton and the New York banks had exchanged their flawed postwar Bretton Woods Gold Exchange system for a new, highly unstable petroleum-based dollar exchange system, which, they reckoned, they could control, unlike the old Gold Exchange System. Kissinger and the financial establishment of London and New York replaced, in effect, the old Gold Exchange Standard of the postwar world with their own \"Petro-dollar Standard.\" After all, who really controlled OPEC? Only the politically naive could believe Arab countries would suddenly be allowed to exer- cise independence on issues of such importance to British and American interests. If they really thought the oil shock was a life- threatening matter, Washington had numerous ways to restore a reasonable OPEC oil price. They wanted the high oil price, and they wanted OPEC to take the blame for it. The two reserve currencies of Bretton Woods, Pound Sterling and the U.S. dollar, remained at center stage in the new petrodol- lar order of the 1970's. Sterling gained from the vast exploitation of North Sea oil, which came on line just in time to benefit from the 400% oil price inflation, as noted earlier. The British Pound became known as a \"petrocurrency.\" The dollar gained for the reasons just mentioned. Clearly, the Bilderberg deliberations that May 1973, in Saltsjoebaden, had cal- culated the winners and losers. To them, it did not matter that their artificial oil price inflation created a manipulation of the world economy of such hideous dimensions that it created an unprece- dented transfer of the wealth of the entire world into the hands of a tiny minority. Was this not, after all, what Adam Smith meant by the \"magic\" of the market? If the methods reminded us of a perverse variation of the old mafia \"protection racket\" game, it is understandable. The same 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 173 Anglo-American interests which manipulated political events to create a 400% increase in oil prices, then turned to the countries which were the victim of their assault, and \"offered\" to lend them petrodollars to finance the purchase of costly oil and other vital imports, at vastly inflated interest cost, of course. For the vast majority of the world living in less-developed re- gions, real industrial and agricultural development suffered the consequences of the Anglo-American oil policy. Petrodollars went to simply refinance deficits, rather than to finance creation of new infrastructure, agriculture, or to improve the living standards of the world's population. During 1975, the policy organ of the Anglo-American liberal es- tablishment, the New York Council on Foreign Relations, under the direction of New York attorney Cyrus Vance, drafted a series of policy blueprints for the 1980's, much as they had done at the critical turning point in the late 1950's recession. In their account of the future of the global monetary order, the Council stated, \"A degree of 'controlled dis-integration' in the world economy is a le- gitimate objective for the 1980's.\" What was disintegrating, how- ever, was the entire fabric of traditional industrial and agricultu- ral development, most clearly in the developing sector. 5 An unusual press conference in Bonn Little wonder that a new mood arose in this time of desperation. There was talk of making common cause against what most in the developing countries saw, rightly, as a form of usury against their economies, indeed, threatening their very survival. Against this background, a hitherto little-known American economist, returning from a series of meetings in the Middle East, including Baghdad, convened a press conference on April 24, 1975, in Bonn. Lyndon LaRouche outlined a bold new proposal for reordering of the bankrupt Bretton Woods monetary order to a gathering of journalists and diplomatic representatives present in Bonn that day. The center-piece of LaRouche's proposal was the creation of an \"International Development Bank\" which, he stated, should be in"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"174 A CENTURY OF WAR the form of a \"three-sided agreement between the three essential sectors—the industrial capitalist sector, the so-called developing sector and the socialist states.\" This new international bank, La- Rouche proposed, \"should discount letters of credit and bills of ex- change as authorized in trade between nations and serve as a re- discount bank for the same.\" The idea that a significant portion of world capital investment be redirected towards specific productive wealth-creating infra- structure, agricultural and industrial uses in the developing re- gions, in the form of long-term (10-15 year) low-interest credit was at the center of LaRouche's proposal. Then, addressing the urgent deficit of sufficient agricultural pro- duction at affordable prices in developing nations as first lending priority, LaRouche outlined three Great Projects with the immedi- ate potential to make a marked contribution to increase of the world's food supply. The first such Great Project was the creation of an agro-industrial region in the Rio de la Plata basin of South America; the second, development of the Sahel Zone irrigation and agriculture potentials and third/transformation of the India- Bangladesh-Pakistan region into the \"bread-basket\" of Asia. Bonds would be issued by the new international bank, much as from the World Bank, for financing the envisioned 10-15 year con- struction of these three great enterprises, backed by the member governments. Finally, addressing the then-crushing burden on developing countries, which had doubled since 1973 to almost $200 billion of external debt, imposed by the 1973-74 oil shock (a debt burden which was soon to appear small in contrast with what was to come during the end of the 1970's), LaRouche called for a de facto freez- ing of this debt service outflow, through orderly debt moratoria for a period of some years in order to allow real development to take hold in the developing economies of the South. With fore- sight, he declared that rather than threatening the existing OECD industrial economies, such a moratorium in the context of enor- mous targetted credits for such Great Infrastructure investment would have a healthy effect on the unstable state of the monetary system and industrial growth generally. And if such policy redi- rection were not acted on with urgency by the leading industrial nations, they would in any case, he predicted, \"without a morator- ium, nonetheless disintegrate into chaos.\" 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK   175   The LaRouche International Development Bank proposal was circulated in the ensuing months widely throughout Europe, Asia, and the developing countries generally. In August, 1975, at a meet- ing of foreign ministers of the Group of Non-Aligned Nations held in Lima Peru, LaRouche's International Development Bank pro- posal was also circulated and discussed. Some months later, its in- fluence was to reappear in a forum least expected by the vested fi- nancial interests of London and New York . 6 During the following August 1976 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, heads of state and senior cabinet officials of 85 nations, members of the Group of Non-Aligned Nations met under the host government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Among the leaders present were India's Indira Gandhi, and numerous heads of state or officials of African, Asian, and Latin American governments, Algeria, and Iraq. From Colombo comes a political earthquake The Colombo gathering began with little fanfare. It hardly seemed any different from one of the endless rounds of bickering and rhetoric among the numerous former colonial states. But Prime Minister Bandaranaike, a veteran of earlier struggles against British and American interests, having expropriated Brit- ish and U.S. oil companies in the early 1960's, had decided to make the August Summit an intervention into the deteriorating eco- nomic state of the developing countries in the aftermath of Kissinger's oil crisis. The Final Declaration of the Colombo Non-Aligned meeting on August 20 was a document unlike any seen from developing country heads of state in the postwar period. The central theme of the 85 developing non-aligned states was publicly declared to be a fair and just economic development. The resolution declared, that \"economic problems have become the most difficult aspect of international relations...The developing countries have become the victim of this worldwide crisis,\" a crisis which was preventing attempts of these countries to eliminate hunger, sickness, and illit- eracy."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"176 A CENTURY OF WAR In this context, noting the nearly doubled foreign debt burdens since the onset of the 1973 oil shock and the catastrophic worsen- ing of terms of trade for raw materials export, the Declaration pro- posed several concrete steps toward creation of a New Interna- tional Economic Order. The existing order, it noted correctly, had collapsed, and was leading to restrictive protectionist policies, recession, inflation, un- employment. Therefore, it called for a \"fundamental reorganiza- tion of the international trade system in order to improve terms of trade...a worldwide reorganization of industrial production which would incorporate improved access by the developing na- tions to industrial products and technology transfer.\" Addressing the chaos of the existing Bretton Woods system, with its \"anarchy of floating exchange rates,\" the declaration called for a radical overhaul of the international monetary system in order, among other things, to guarantee an adequate transfer of investment cap- ital to developing nations. But the most alarming aspect of the Colombo declaration, from the standpoint of the New York and London financial establish- ment, was a call for a \"satisfactory resolution of the problem of the public indebtedness, especially for the least developed and most severely affected countries.\" The explosive issue of the foreign debt had been placed on the negotiating table for the first time, not by a single government, but by 85 governments acting collec- tively. Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka, a former British colony, and India under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had care- fully prepared the agenda for debate among the 85 heads of state, in concert with the government of another former British colony on the northeast coast of South America, Guyana. The crucial ne- gotiator for Guyana was its representative to Colombo, Minister of Foreign Affairs Frederick Wills. Thus, newly independent gov- ernments of three former British colonies led the Colombo initia- tive to create a powerful new alignment of forces which would po- tentially redirect the priorities towards industrialization and de- velopment. The important next step for the non-aligned initiative was de- cided. The Annual meeting of the United Nations General Assem- bly in New York the following month would be the forum to present their proposal to the world community of nations. At the 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 177 end of September 1976, Guyana's Foreign Minister Frederick Wills was designated to present the position of the Colombo group. Carefully declaring their \"non-alignment\" from either major superpower bloc of the postwar era, Wills then proceeded to present to the assembled delegates the results of the just-passed Colombo Declaration. Citing repeated past attempts from developing countries over the past years to reach a satisfactory resolution of their economic future, which also was in the interests of the economic security of the industrial nations, Wills then dropped his political bombshell: \"The International Monetary Fund and the monetary system of Bretton Woods must provide a place for alternative structures such as International Development Banks, which have as their goal, not the recovery and reconstruction of Europe or preferential agreements for development of a market economy, but rather, the just division of the gains from an unequal global economic system.\" Wills concluded his remarks, \"The burning problem of the debt and debt service has taken on a special importance. Developing countries are not able to manage their basic requirements, as noted in Colombo, without resort to some form of debt restructuring or moratoria. We must make every effort to oppose attempts to di- vide us through 'case-by-case' techniques. We cannot allow our- selves to mortgage future unborn generations to the burdensome debt repayment and destructive debt service. The time for a Debt Moratium has arrived.\" The impact of the combined Colombo and UNO declarations was immediately felt. On Wall Street, traders spoke of a \"crisis of confidence\". Share prices for U.S. banks, especially those most in- volved in the Eurodollar lending to the developing countries, Cit- icorp, Morgan Guaranty, Bankers Trust and Chase Manhattan stock prices began falling. The Federal Reserve bank was forced to intervene to support the falling dollar as well. The implications of a concerted action by developing states on the dollar debt sent shock waves through the financial system. The Colombo resolution of the 85 non-aligned states which Wills presented at the United Nations that autumn was only one part of what was rapidly becoming a potential alliance of key oil- produc- ing states and European industrial nations, and possibly Japan. This was a potential constellation which would have decisively chal-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"178 A CENTURY OF WAR lenged the Anglo-American Bretton Woods order as never before. Some years later, Wills reviewed what had taken place back in 1976. He told this author, \"In what became known as the Third World, approximately 80% of mankind lived on the flanks of super-power rivalry, supplying raw materials for the processing economies of the First and Second Worlds, and striving to become market extensions of the market economies of the First World. \"Third world politicians at that time had a different view about their international role, however,\" he recalled. \"They regarded po- litical independence as merely one essential step in the path of growth and development. They sought generalized technological advance, which should be coterminous with diversification of ag- riculture and the insertion of such infrastructure as would lead to the industrialization, and thereby closing of the huge gaps that separated the different worlds. \"But how should all this be paid for?\" he added. \"Led by Britain and France, the economic theorists of the First World determined that the export receipts of the Third World should decide the pace and quality of development and, when these fell below expectations, resort should be had to the Bretton Woods system whose machinery had been set up in the late 1940's. Above all, this meant the requirement of the stamp-of-approval of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and submission to the bar- barous conditionalities which were the underpinning of IMF inter- vention. \"This was the context,\" Wills explained, \"within which the Sum- mit of the Non-Aligned Nations was held at Colombo in Sri Lanka in 1976. There was a call for a new funding institution—an inter- national resources bank—to replace the iniquitous neo-colonial- ism of the IMF. There was also a call for diminution of the vertical and structural economic dependence of the Third World on Brit- ain, France and the U.S.A, and an increase in horizontal linkages between Third World countries. There were calls for regional Zoll- vereine to protect Third World industries, and for technology trans- fers in order to remove the harshness of underdevelopment. \"The United Nations was chosen as the arena where it was hoped that a new era of global co-operation would emerge. These hopes were never realized. One by one, the outstanding advocates of Third World development were removed from the seats of do- mestic power, and their solidarity was defeated in detail by the 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK   179   age-old principle of 'divide and conquer.' Export receipts and im- port prices were manipulated to create enormous gaps in balances of payments, and Third World countries were told that they must get the seal of approval of the IMF before any government or pri- vate institution would advance further loans. The IMF insisted on austere programs based on currency devaluations which in- creased misery in the Third World, was directly responsible for the spread of disease and was also successful in encouraging drug- cultivation, as those unfortunate countries sought the chimera of a quick cash-crop as a panacea for their fiscal difficulties.\" On the role of the petroleum-exporting countries of the Third World, Wills added, \"The only Third World raw material that did well in the economic arena was oil, but the large oil reserves were centered in the Middle East, and manipulation of inter-Arab and Arab-Israeli conflicts, together with inculcation of a penchant for prestige projects meant that Third World oil reserves could not be used as factors in Third World development. One by one Third World countries were gripped by inflation and starvation, by low life-expectancy and high infant mortality. The Old Order of Can- ning and Castlereagh, Pitt and Disraeli remains.\" The reference to the methods of British 19th century Foreign Minister, Castlereagh, the master artisan of British balance-of- power diplomacy at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, is appropriate. The principal active opponent who deployed the full power and force of the U.S. government, intelligence services and economic clout to destroy the dynamic set off at Colombo in 1976 was Sec- retary of State Henry Kissinger, a devout student of Castlereagh. When the foreign ministers of the European Community met in December 1976 to take up a possible cooperation with the call of the Non-Aligned, Kissinger sent a telegram to the delegates warn- ing, \"The United States believes it would be dangerous for the in- dustrial countries to strengthen the ties between the CIEC [Confer- ence for International Economic Cooperation—the North-South Conference] and OPEC. A number of OPEC spokesmen have pub- licly sought to make clear that the final decision about the oil price in a great degree will depend on concessions from the industrial nations toward the CIEC. This would create the opposite of our de- sired link [to OPEC countries- w.e.] and strengthen instead the links between OPEC and other underdeveloped countries.\" Kissinger's veiled threat succeeded in breaking any alliance or"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"180 A CENTURY OF WAR active support from the nations of Europe towards the potential OPEC and Non-Aligned grouping. Diplomats personally in- volved in these talks at the time report that the two governments most open and responsive to such a call for co-operation with the Non-Aligned were Italy and West Germany. On December 12 of that same year, Italian papers reported a meeting of leading repre- sentatives of government and industry and trade unions con- vened by the German and Italian governments, on the subject of creation of a European defense against the damaging impact of the unstable oil-linked U.S. dollar. The Bonn government of Helmut Schmidt was reportedly told privately at this time by Washington, that it risked a pull-out of U.S. troops should Bonn dare to pursue the Non-Aligned offer in any serious way. Andreotti's Italy was isolated ^tnd unable to act alone. The Kissinger tactic of \"divide and conquer\" prevailed again, at least for the moment. As for the key strategists of the bold Colombo Non-Aligned dec- laration, within months each of them had been forced out of office, as Kissinger would term it, \"case-by-case.\" In India, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was forced into elections in February 1977, and in the midst of this, several key members of her Congress Party staged a public party defection, led by Jagjivan Ram, to form an opposition coalition with the radical Janata. The key issue was the imposition of IMF-dictated domestic austerity. Gandhi was out of government by that March, less than six months after the UN declaration of the Non-Aligned. In Sri Lanka, Mrs. Bandaranaike's ruling Freedom Party and the entire country were paralyzed by a wave of strikes in early January led by a \"Trotskyite\" party linked to the trade unions, which reportedly en- joyed intimate ties with Anglo-American intelligence services. Bandaranaike charged foreign interference, in a futile effort to re- store order. By May 1977, she was out of government. And in Guyana, after repeated external pressures on the government of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1978, Frederick Wills, the third key strategist of the Non-Aligned initiative on economic development, was forced to resign. According to diplomatic sources familiar with the situation, the heavy hand of Henry Kissinger was present in each case. \"But this was done in close coordination with the British,\" according to these observers. \"The British, you know, were very clever. They were willing to let the Americans do the public dirty work and 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 181 take the blame, while they worked very effectively on a more dis- creet level. It wasn't people like Jim Callaghan (the Prime Minis- ter of the British Labour government) who did this. It was the peo- ple of [Royal Institute for International Affairs'] Chatham House, people such as the Michael Howards, and families such as Lord Cecil's, and the MI-5 intelligence circles, who went into action against the Colombo initiative.\" 7 The Third World threat to the Anglo-American order and their regime of global taxation through petrodollars, had apparently been beaten back. The leading Eurodollar banks of London and New York opened the flood gates to lend ever greater sums to se- lect states of the Third World who agreed to the draconian IMF terms, to refinance their oil-related deficits. Atoms for Peace becomes a Casus Belli There were growing signs in too many parts of the world that a potential still existed for stronger and potentially decisive initia- tives in technology transfer from key European industrial nations, as well as from Japan, to select developing countries. While the broad front presented at Colombo had been apparently defeated, the idea of specific North-South economic co-operation was still taking hold in dramatic new ways. The Government of Brazil entered into a major agreement with the German government of Helmut Schmidt for construction of a complex of nuclear power reactors combined with fuel enrich- ment and other related technologies during late 1975. The German nuclear reactor manufacturer, KWU, signed what was the largest single nuclear contract in the world up to that time. Germany was to provide \"turnkey\" construction of eight nuclear power reactors and facilities for the entire nuclear fuel cycle including enrich- ment. Valued at $5 billion, the entire project was to be completed by 1990. The European uranium enrichment consortium, Urenco, was to supply initial uranium fuel. That same year, 1975, Brazil signed a $2.5 billion co-operation agreement with France for con- struction of an experimental fast breeder reactor as well. Washing- ton responded with heavy-handed efforts to force Germany as well as Brazil to cancel the program. Brazil threatened to become"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"182   A CENTURY OF WAR an economic power of independence from Anglo-American con- trol and, significantly, independent of their oil blackmail. Mexico, during the early 1970's not yet a significant exporter of oil, decided, for sound economic reasons, to develop nuclear power for electricity to aid its plan for rapid industrialization while conserving the oil \"patrimony\" for other uses such as earn- ing export dollars. Mexico entered into contracts with Mitsubishi of Japan and Siemens of Germany as an initial part of its nuclear program. In 1975, in the aftermath of the first oil shock, Mexico's National Energy Commission decided , that it was wasteful and inefficient to burn hydrocarbons to produce electricity. They an- nounced plans to build 15 new nuclear power reactors over a 20 year time. Pakistan, under the government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, responded to the oil shock in 1974 by accelerating work on an earlier small-scale nuclear energy program. Bhutto had with- drawn Pakistan from the British Commonwealth of Nations in order to pursue an independent national development policy. The Bhutto government entered negotiations with France on construction of a nuclear fuel enrichment plant for Pakistan, which was finalized in March 1976, and Pakistan was developing into an effective lobby throughout the Middle East on the impor- tance of developing nuclear energy in addition to oil resources. By August 1976, the U.S. State Department and Henry Kissinger per- sonally launched a major pressure campaign on both France and Pakistan to abort the nuclear deal, claiming it was related to nu- clear weapons ambitions, despite approval from the International Atomic Energy Agency that Pakistan had sufficient safeguards to ensure such would not be the case. According to Pakistani ac- counts, earlier that year in Lahore, Kissinger delivered a direct threat \"that he would make a horrible example of Pakistan\" if Bhutto did not abandon the nuclear reprocessing project negotia- tions with France. In 1977, Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup led by Gen- eral Zia ul-Haq. Before his death by hanging, Bhutto accused U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of being behind his overthrow because of Bhutto's insistence on developing Pakistan's indepen- dent nuclear program. Writing his defense from his prison cell be- fore his execution, Bhutto declared, \"Dr. Henry Kissinger, the Sec- retary of State for the United States, has a brilliant mind. He told 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 183 mc that I should not insult the intelligence of the United States by saying that Pakistan needed the Reprocessing Plant for her energy needs. In reply, I told him that I will not insult the intelligence of the United States by discussing the energy needs of Pakistan, but in the same token, he should not insult the sovereignty and self- respect of Pakistan by discussing the plant at all...I got the death sentence\". 8 General Zia reversed Bhutto's independent foreign policy and quickly embraced Washington. Abundant U.S. military assistance followed. But by all measure, the most impressive developing sector coun- try committment to nuclear energy in the wake of the 1974 oil shock came from the Shah of Iran. The Shah, who owed his posi- tion to the coup staged by British and American intelligence in 1953 to overthrow the nationalist Mossadegh regime and reinstate a \"pro-American\" monarchy, seemed to be a grateful recipient of American military supplies and other support over more than 20 years. He even agreed to initiate Henry Kissinger's call for an in- crease in the OPEC benchmark oil price to $11.65 per barrel at the January 1974 OPEC meeting. But, with the new oil revenues flowing in to the state treasury, the Shah saw the possibility to realize an old dream. Iran was to use its oil wealth to create one of the world's most modern energy infrastructures, built upon nuclear power generation, which could transform the electricity and other power needs of the entire Near East. In 1978, Iran had the fourth largest nuclear power program in the world, and the largest by far among Third World nations. The Shah's plan called for installation of 20 nuclear power reactors by 1995 to provide some 23,000 Mega Watts electricity. The Shah saw nuclear electricity as the rational means to diversify Iran's depen- dence on petroleum, and as a means to counter the enormous pres- sure from Washington and London to recycle his petrodollars to New York and London banks. France and Germany were the major negotiating partners with which the Shah negotiated his nuclear program. Already in 1974 Iran signed a provisional agreement with France to construct five nuclear power reactors and a nuclear research center. This was ex- panded in 1975 to eight reactors for a total cost of $8.6 billion. In addition, Iran purchased a 10% share in the French uranium en-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"184 A CENTURY OF WAR richment facility under construction at Tricastin, and lent $1 bil- lion for its construction. In 1976, Iran signed another contract with the German nuclear firm, KWU, for DM 7.8 billion for two reactors and infrastructure, followed in 1977 with a contract to supply four more reactors for an added DM 19 billion. Under the Shah, Iran invested in other key European industrial companies including a 25% stake in the Ger- man Krupp, and in French nuclear enrichment facilities. The eco- nomic bonds between Iran and Continental Europe were growing in importance. During this time, under the strict anti-nuclear pol- icy of U.S. President Carter, the U.S. did not participate in backing export of U.S. nuclear reactor technology, and Washington strenu- ously tried to block the German and French deals, to no avail. In country after country in both Western Europe and the devel- oping sector, nuclear technology was threatening to become the most rapid growing source for non-oil energy infrastructure. Gold, dollar crises and dangerous new potentials from Europe At a private, closed-door gathering convened in Tokyo in April 1975, a group of hand-picked policy spokesmen organized by Chase Manhattan Bank chairman David Rockefeller, and Bilder- berg founder George W. Ball, met to discuss a special project. Lord Roll of Ipsden, chairman of S.G. Warburg bank, and a director of the Bank of England was present. David Ormsby Gore, Lord Har- lech, London's Ambassador to Washington during the fateful Kennedy years of the early 1960's, also attended. Barclays Bank chairman, Sir Anthony Tuke, was also present in the secretive Tokyo discussions that April, together with the Earl of Cromer, George Baring, a man closely tied to Morgan Guaranty Trust in New York and to Royal Dutch Shell, who had been Ambassador to Washington during the time of Kissinger's oil shock, when the U.S. Secretary of State acknowledged his unusually close policy coordination with the British Foreign Ministry. Also present in the fateful Tokyo talks was John Loudon, chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, who also sat on the Advisory Committee of David Rocke- feller's Chase Manhattan Bank. 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK   185   What concerned the hundred or so influential policy-makers at the April meeting of Rockefeller's newly-formed Trilateral Commis- sion, was the dangerous risk to the Anglo-American establishment of continuing the offensive U.S. foreign policy stance against the rest of the world associated with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Republican administration. Kissinger's hard-line \"divide and rule\" tactics had been adopted to isolate one country after another, whether European, developing sector or OPEC, portraying OPEC as the villain to developing countries whose economic growth had been destroyed by Kissinger's 1973 oil shock policy. By 1975, his thinly-veiled \"thug\" approach to international di- plomacy risked creating an enormous international backlash. A 'hew \"image\" was needed to sell the world on the need for conti- nued American hegemony. Therefore, at the Trilateral Commis- sion Tokyo gathering of that April, little more than a year-and-a- half from the 1976 American presidential elections, David Rocke- feller introduced a man to his influential international friends as the next president of the United States. Few Americans, not to mention foreigners, had ever heard of the small-town Georgia peanut farmer who preferred to be called, \"Jimmy\" Carter. 9 : Following his initiation at the 1975 Tokyo meeting, Carter re- ceived an extraordinary public relations media buildup from es- tablishment media such as the liberal New York Times. That news- paper hailed Carter as a dynamic exponent of America's \"New South.\" In November 1976, despite allegations of large-scale vot- ing irregularities, Carter did become President. Carter brought with him such a large number of policy advisers who were members of the Trilateral Commission, that his presi- dency was dubbed the \"Trilateral Presidency.\" Not only was Vice President Walter Mondale, like Carter, a member of the elite secret Trilateral organization—Carter's National Security Adviser Zbig- niew Brzezinski, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Treasury Secre- tary Michael Blumenthal, Defense Secretary Harold Brown, United Nations' Ambassador Andrew Young, State Department senior officials Richard Cooper and Warren Christopher were all part of the exclusive Trilateral club. The public profile of Carter's presidency was \"human rights\" for the Third World, \"negotiation, not confrontation.\" He por- trayed himself as an \"outsider\" to the Washington power estab- lishment, but the content of U.S. policy under Carter, with his pre-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"186 A CENTURY OF WAR selected crew of establishment advisers, was to maintain the American Century at all costs. Under the rhetorical facade of \"re- forming the old order\" of U.S. foreign policy, the Carter Adminis- tration continued the basic Anglo-American neo-malthusian strat- egy initiated by Kissinger at the National Security Council under National Security Study Memorandum 200. Third World develop- ment was to be blocked, and a \"limits to growth\" post-industrial policy was to be imposed in order to maintain the hegemony of the dollar imperium. Carter's \"human rights\" would soon become a bludgeon to justify unprecedented U.S. intervention into the inter- nal affairs of targetted Third World nations. The strategy failed miserably. A significant problem arose in the immediate wake of the oil shock, which threatened to undo the edifice of the new Anglo- American \"Petro-dollar Monetary System.\" Already in 1974, the Commission of the European Community proposed to the mem- ber country central banks a system for settling intra-EEC trade bal- ances with gold, priced at a market price then at around $150 per fine ounce. The European proposal would have greatly eased the oil payment burden for a number of European countries, and re- duced the influence of the dollar. The U.S. Treasury, for the obvi- ous political reasons of dollar hegemony, insisted ever more ada- mantly that central banks value gold at the artificially low price of $42.22 per fine ounce gold. A valuation of gold at the higher price within the EEC could have opened the door to significant trade possibilities with two leading gold producing countries, South Af- rica and the Soviet Union. U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Paul Volcker went to London in the autumn of 1974 to deliver a blunt warning against any such European moves to bring gold back to the monetary system. But the idea, naturally, did not die. Rather the opposite. At the time, the South African government of John Vorster was strug- gling to maintain economic stability in the wake of the severe oil price increase, dependent on imported oil. At the same time, it was extending tentative feelers to neighboring black African states for some form of economic development cooperation, despite the rigid regime of Apartheid at home. Angola was rich in oil, South Africa had industrial technology and infrastructure needed by Angola and other African states. The region required financial investment and secure foreign trade out- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 187 lets for it to work. In late 1974, South African Finance Minister Ni- colaas Diederichs publicly called for a revaluation of the interna- tional central bank gold price to a market level, echoing the debate in Europe. \"I have consistently pressed for monetary authorities to be allowed to sell gold among themselves at a market-related price...gold in official vaults of central banks would be revalued; and there would be much more money to pay the Arabs; secondly, the dollar would lose value,\" he noted. At the same time, Germany and Italy entered a bilateral agree- ment under, which gold was used as collateral for a German loan with gold valued at 80% of the then-market price of $150. European discussions around some effective use of gold as an alternative to the tyranny of the dollar standard were clearly gaining momentum. But these possibilities of closer trade and economic linkage between Continental Europe and South Africa received a devas- tating blow. Soviet and Cuban support to the MPLA in Angola put that country under the control of a regime hostile to Pretoria. In addition, repeated unannounced large dumping-sales of official U.S. gold reserves onto the market severely depressed the world gold price and brought growing economic difficulties for the South African mining industry. Then, in May 1976, riots erupted in the South African township of Soweto. The riots, curiously enough, coincided with a visit of U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger to South Africa. The international political backlash from a brutal South African police repression at Soweto against the rioters made effective economic linkage between South Africa and European governments more difficult. But the talks were continuing, as the situation somewhat stabilized the following months, and the im- portance of the world's largest gold producing country to any at- tempt to stabilize world monetary relations was absolutely crucial. In July 1977, a South African business monthly, 7b the Point Inter- national, published an interview with a leading West German banker, Dresdner bank chairman Juergen Ponto. In the interview, Ponto outlined his vision of a solution to the economic and racial crises then enveloping all Southern Africa. Speaking of the vital role which Europe had to play in resolving the crisis of Africa, Ponto stressed, first, that Europe must restore order in its econo- mies following the oil and related economic crises. In order to do this, Ponto stated, \"priority must be given to the creation of a stable monetary system; when a smaller but economically impor-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"188 A CENTURY OF WAR tant region of the world such as the European Community starts the stone rolling, by eliminating its own monetary chaos, then we will be on the way to realize this.\" Ponto further elaborated a concept for European economic de- velopment initiatives to the entire Southern African region, in- cluding wealthy African states, such as South Africa, Ivory Coast, and Algeria, which would enable those countries to develop the poorest states: \"They can produce sufficient food, employment and education possibilities for the entire Continent, provided that the restrictions can be removed in the course of developments.\" Ponto was a close personal friend of South African Finance Minis- ter Nicolaas Diederichs, and Diederichs' designated successor, Robert Smit. There were clearly advanced discussions between in- fluential European banking and industry and the resources-rich governments of Southern Africa. A potential combination was emerging which could have changed the geo-political map of the entire Anglo-American world, to the clear disadvantage of Lon- don and New York. On July 31 in Frankfurt Juergen Ponto was assassinated by ter- rorists claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof. Some weeks later, the chairman of the German Employers' fed- eration, Hanns-Martin Schleyer, was kidnapped and later mur- dered by the same organization in Cologne. While the assassins' trail led back to the East, there was good reason to believe that cer- tain powerful western intelligence services had had a role in both assassinations. In any event, West Germany was plunged into po- litical chaos and gripped by fear as never before in the postwar pe- riod. The possibility of any significant development initiative to- wards South Africa had been killed along with Ponto and Schleyer. The initiative to break with the dollar imperium had been stalled for the moment. The \"Crash of 1979\": Iran, Volcker and Harrisburg One major aspect of what Ponto alluded to in his last interview did come to pass. In June 1978, in response to growing frictions and outright policy clashes with the Carter Administration on nu- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 189 clear energy policy, international monetary policy, around the free-fall of the dollar, and just about every foreign policy issue of importance to Continental Europe, the member governments of the European Community, on the initiative of France and Ger- many, took steps to create the first phase of what was seen as a Eu- ropean currency zone. It was a first attempt to insulate Continen- tal Europe from the shocks of the dollar regime. German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and France's President Giscard d'Estaing proposed to establish what became Phase I of the European Monetary System. The central banks of nine Euro- pean Community member countries agreed to stabilize their cur- rencies in relation to one another. With growing trade flows con- centrated inside the community, the EMS, as it became known, provided a minimal basis for defending intra-European trade and monetary relations. In early 1979, the EMS became operational and its effect in sta- bilizing European currencies was notable. But the future possibil- ities of the EMS were what worried certain circles in London and Washington. It had ominous overtones of becoming a seed-crys- tal of an alternative world monetary order which could threaten the existing hegemony of the \"Petro-dollar Monetary System.\" One German official at the time referred privately to the new Eu- ropean Monetary System as the \"seed-crystal for the replacement of the International Monetary Fund.\" The French Government openly said as much. The EMS had established a European Mo- netary Fund with initial capitalization consisting of 20% of each member country's gold and dollar reserves, valued at some $35 billion. Furthermore, Switzerland de facto also linked its currency to the new EMS parities. As early as 1977, the governments of France and Germany began to explore the possibility of an agreement with select oil-produc- ing OPEC states, under which Western Europe would supply high-technology exports to OPEC in return for long-term oil sup- ply agreements at a stable price. In turn, under this arrangement, OPEC would deposit their financial surpluses into Continental European banks and ultimately, into the new EMS, to build a fund which could be used for long-term industrial credits to other de- veloping countries. London opposed the new French-German EMS concept at every step. Unable to stop its implementation, London refused to join"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"190 A CENTURY OF WAR the new stabilization arrangement. The City of London establish- ment had other ideas. At a September 1978 Aachen Summit between Giscard d'Estaing and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, the two countries agreed on plans for joint scientific and technical education, as well as joint nuclear energy cooperation. The UDF party in France proposed a $100 billion five-year development program for Continental Eu- rope and the developing sector. A State visit by President Carter in July of 1978 to Bonn and West Berlin only reinforced French and German resolve to pursue an independent policy. Carter had unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Schmidt gov- ernment, under the Carter Administration's new \"Nuclear Non- Proliferation Act,\" to abandon export of virtually all nuclear tech- nology to the developing sector. The sophistical argument, as usual, was that peaceful nuclear plant technology threatened to proliferate nuclear weapons, an argument which uniquely stood to enhance the strategic position of the Anglo-American petro- leum-based financial establishment. Thus, despite all efforts since the early 1970's, the \"danger\" of in- dependent industrial and trade growth which undercut the prized domination of the dollar imperium, was clearly becoming real in the minds of policy-shapers in Washington and London. Even more drastic shocks were required to stop the insistence of nations to pursue scientific and industrial development. Drastic shocks they were. In November 1978, President Carter named the Bilderberg group's George Ball, also a member of the Trilateral Commission, to head a special White House Iran Task Force under the National Security Council's Brzezinski. Ball recommended that Washing- ton drop support of the Shah of Iran and support the fundamen- talist Islamic opposition of Ayatollah Khomeini. Robert Bowie, from the CIA, was one of the lead \"case officers\" in the new CIA- led coup against the man their covert actions had placed into power only 25 years earlier. Their scheme was based on detailed study of the phenomenon of Islamic Fundamentalism as presented by British Islamic ex- pertDr. Bernard Lewis, then on assignment at Princeton Univer- sity in the United States. Lewis' scheme, unveiled in the May 1979 Bilderberg meeting in Austria, endorsed the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind Khomeini, to promote balkaniza- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 191 tion of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. Lewis argued that the West should encourage autonomous groups such as the Kurds, Armenians, Lebanese Maronites, Ethiopian Copts, Azerbaijani Turks, and so forth. The chaos would spread in what he termed an \"Arc of Crisis,\" which would spill over into the Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. The coup against the Shah, as that against Mossadegh in 1953, was run by British and American intelligence, characteristically, with the bombastic American, Brzezinski, taking public \"credit\" for getting rid of the \"corrupt\" Shah. The British remained safely in the background. During 1978, negotiations between the Shah's government and British Petroleum were underway for renewal of the 25-year oil ex- traction agreement. By October 1978, talks collapsed over a British \"offer\", which was actually a demand for exclusive rights on Iran's future oil output, while refusing to guarantee purchase of the oil. With their dependence on British-controlled export appar- ently at an end, Iran appeared on the verge of independence in its oil sales policy. For the first time since 1953, Iran had eager pros- pective buyers in Germany, France, Japan and elsewhere. In its lead editorial that September, Iran's Kayhan International wrote, \"In retrospect, the 25-year partnership with the [British Petro- leum] consortium and the 50-year relationship with British Petro- leum which preceded it, have not been satisfactory ones for Iran...Looking to the future, NIOC [National Iranian Oil Com- pany] should plan to handle all operations by itself.\" London was blackmailing and putting enormous economic pressure on the Shah's regime by refusing to buy Iranian oil pro- duction, taking only 3 million or so barrels daily of an agreed minimum of 5 million barrels/day. This imposed dramatic reve- nue pressures on Iran. That was the context in which religious dis- content against the Shah could be fanned by trained agitators de- ployed by British and U.S. intelligence services. In addition, strikes among oil workers at this critical juncture crippled Iranian oil production. As domestic economic troubles grew, American \"security\" ad- visers to the Shah's secret police, Savak, implemented a policy of ever-more brutal repression, in a manner calculated to maximize popular antipathy to the Shah. At the same time, the Carter"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"192 A CENTURY OF WAR Administration cynically began protesting abuses of \"human rights\" under the Shah. British Petroleum reportedly began to organize flight capital out of Iran through its strong influence in Iran's financial and banking community. Echoing its role in the 1941 downfall of the Shah's fa- ther, Reza Shah, the British Broadcasting Corporation sent dozens of Persian-speaking BBC \"correspondents\" into even the smallest villages to drum up hysteria against the regime with exaggerated reports of incidents of protest against the Shah. BBC gave Ayatol- lah Khomeini the propaganda platform inside Iran during this time, while refusing to give the Shah's government the chance to reply. Repeated personal appeals from the Shah to BBC yielded no result. Anglo-American intelligence was committed to toppling the Shah. He fled in January and by February 1979, Khomeini was flown into Teheran to proclaim establishment of his repressive theocratic state to replace the Shah's government. Reflecting on his downfall months later, shortly before his death, the Shah noted from exile, \"I did not know it then— perhaps I did not want to know—but it is clear to me now that the Americans wanted me out. Clearly this is what the human rights advocates in the State Department wanted...What was I to make of the Administration's sudden decision to call former Under Secretary of State George Ball to the White House as an adviser on Iran?...Ball was among those Americans who wanted to abandon me and ultimately my country.\" 10 The fall of the Shah and the coming to power of the fanatical Khomeini adherents unleashed chaos in Iran. By May 1979, the new Khomeini regime had singled out the country's nuclear power development plans and Khomeini announced cancellation of the entire program for French and German nuclear reactor con- struction. Iran oil exports to the world were suddenly cut off, some 3 mil- lion barrels per day. Curiously, Saudi Arabian production in the critical days of January 1979 was also cut by some 2 million bar- rels/day. To add to the pressures on world oil supply, British Pe- troleum declared \"force majeure\" and cancelled major contracts for oil supply. Prices on the Rotterdam spot market, heavily influ- enced by BP and Royal Dutch Shell as the largest oil traders, soared in early 1979 as a result. The \"Second Oil Shock\" of the 1970's was underway. 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 193 Indications are that the actual planners of the Iranian Khomeini coup in London and within the senior ranks of the U.S. liberal es- tablishment decided to keep President Carter largely ignorant of the policy and its ultimate objectives. The ensuing energy crisis in the U.S. was a major factor which brought about Carter's defeat a year later. There was never a real shortage of world petroleum supply. Saudi and Kuwaiti existing production capacities could have met the 5-6 million barrel/day temporary shortfall at any time, as U.S. Congressional investigation by the General Accounting Office months later confirmed. Unusually low reserve stocks of oil held by the Seven Sister oil multinationals contributed to create a devastating world oil price shock. Prices for crude oil soared from a level of some $14/barrel in 1978 towards the astronomical heights of $40/barrel for some grades of crude on the spot market. Long gasoline lines across America contributed to a general sense of panic, and Carter En- ergy Secretary and former CIA director, James R. Schlesinger, did not help calm matters when he told Congress and the media in February 1979 that the Iranian oil shortfall was \"prospectively more serious\" that the 1973 Arab oil embargo. 11 The Carter administration's Trilateral Commission foreign po- licy further insured that any European effort from Germany and France to develop more cooperative trade, economic and diplo- matic relations with their Soviet neighbor under the umbrella of detente and various Soviet-West European energy agreements was also thrown into disarray. Carter's Security Adviser, Brzezinski, and Secretary of State Vance, implemented their \"Arc of Crisis\" policy, spreading the in- stability of the Iranian revolution along the southern boundary of the Soviet Union. From Pakistan across Iran, U.S. initiatives created instability or worse. Then came Brzezinski's \"China card\" policy tilt. The U.S. diplo- matically recognized Communist China in December 1978, and abrogated recognition of the Nationalist Chinese regime on Tai- wan, thereby giving Communist China UN Security Council veto power and access to U.S. technology and military aid. At a sum- mit meeting in January 1979, German Chancellor Schmidt deliv- ered a strong protest to President Carter that his new \"China Card\" policy was proving extremely destabilizing for fragile Ger-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"194 A CENTURY OF WAR man-Soviet relations, by creating the impression in Moscow that NATO was aggressively encircling the USSR in an arc of chaos and military hostility. Then, in October 1979, the Anglo-American financial shock of the century was unleashed on top of the second oil shock of that year. That August, on the advice of David Rockefeller and other influentialvoices of the Wall Street banking establishment, Presi- dent Carter appointed Paul Volcker, the man to head the Federal Reserve [the man who back in August 1971 was a key architect of the policy of taking the dollar off the gold standard]. Paul A. Volcker, a former official at Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank, and of course a member of David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commis- sion, was President of the New York Federal Reserve at the time of his nomination to the post as head of the world's most powerful central bank. Despite the fact that oil at $40 dollars per barrel was a dramatic price increase in dollar terms, the size of the oil shock, combined with the growing international alarm over the incompetent Carter Administration, led to a further weakening of the dollar. Already since early 1978, the dollar had dropped more than 15% against the German Mark and other major currencies. The price of gold was ris- ing rapidly in September 1979, and was at the record high then of almost $400 per ounce. Arab and other investors preferred to invest in gold rather than dollars. Already in September 1978, the dollar fell in a near panic collapse when it became known that in Saudi Arabia the Monetary Agency had begun liquidating billions of dol- lars of U.S. Treasury bonds. It appeared that Mr. Carter's presidency was proving too much even for these staunch U.S. allies. The policy strategists in the City of London and New York then resolved to impose a malthusian monetary shock on top of the oil shock, to tilt the balance of world development decisively to their relative advantage. In October 1979, Volcker unveiled a radical new Federal Reserve monetary policy. He deliberately lied to a shocked Congress and a desperate White House by insisting that his radical monetarist \"cure\" was aimed at \"squeezing inflation out of the system.\" It was, in fact, aimed at making the U.S. dollar the most eagerly sought currency in the world, and, to stop industrial growth dead in its tracks, in order that political and financial power flow back to the dollar imperium. Volcker's cold rationalization to Congress 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 195 was that \"restraint on growth in money and credit, maintained over a considerable period of time, must be an essential part of any program to deal with entrenched inflation and inflationary expec- tations.\" The fraud in Volcker's monetary shock therapy was that he never addressed the fundamental origins of the soaring infla- tion—two oil price shocks since 1973 which had raised the price of the world's basic energy and transportation by 1,300% in six years. And Volcker's insistence on restricting the U.S. money supply by cutting credit to banks, consumers, and the economy, was also a calculated fraud. Volcker knew full well, as did every major banker in New York and London, that control of America's domes- tic dollar supply was a minor part of a far larger problem. Volcker knew that his actions had little control on the estimated $500 bil- lion outside the United States, circulating in the so-called Euro- dollar markets of London and the Cayman Islands and other off- shore hot-money havens. At the time of the October 1979 Volcker monetary shock therapy, Morgan Guaranty Trust calculated the gross size of dollars in the Euro-dollar offshore markets at 57% of the entire domestic U.S. money supply! The American citizen was supposed to pay the cost of this rampant offshore money pool, as though it never existed. In both his objectives, Volcker succeeded. U.S. interest rates on the Eurodollar market soared from 10% to 16%, on their way up to levels of 20% in a matter of weeks. The world looked on in stunned disbelief. Inflation was, indeed, being \"squeezed\" as the world economy was plunged into the deepest depression since the 1930's. The dollar began what was to be an extraordinary five year long ascent. The oil shock and the Volcker shock were also combined with a decision by the leading circles of the establishment to \"take the bloom off the nuclear rose\" once and for all, in order to ensure that the alarming trend of developing worldwide nuclear energy re- sources to replace reliance on Anglo-American oil was decisively ended. Unprecedented diplomatic and legal pressures from the Carter White House since 1977, had not succeeded in significantly blunt- ing the attraction of nuclear power. But on March 28, 1979, in a town in the center of Pennsylvania, a bizarre event occurred, one which was portrayed to the world press in fictitious terms, as"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"196 A CENTURY OF WAR though it were a Hollywood movie script, or a remake of Orson Wells' 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast. Unit-2 of the Three-Mile Island nuclear power reactor complex in Harrisburg underwent an improbable sequence of \"accidents.\" Later investigation revealed that critical valves had been illegally and manually closed before the event, preventing emergency cool- ing water from entering the reactor's steam generator system. Within 15 seconds, emergency back-up systems had brought the nuclear fission process to a stop. But then, a plant operator vio- lated all procedure, and intervened to shut off cooling water into the reactor core. The details of what then happened have been do- cumented elsewhere extensively. On August 3,1979, in its official report on the event, the U.S. Nu- clear Regulatory Commission posed sabotage or criminal negli- gence as one of six possible causes for the Three-Mile Island event. But even after eliminating the other five possible causes, the gov- ernment refused to seriously consider the possibility of sabotage. News to the world's media during the entire Harrisburg drama was strictly controlled by the newly-established White House Fed- eral Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). No government or nuclear plant official was allowed to speak to press except when screened by FEMA censors. FEMA was created by Presidential Executive Order based on the blueprint of Trilateral Commission White House adviser Samuel Huntington. Curiously, FEMA went into operation March 27, five days before its scheduled date of operation, and one day before the Three-Mile Island incident. Under direction of National Security Adviser Brzezinski, FEMA controlled all news at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. FEMA ordered evacuations of the surrounding population, although there were no indications of radiation danger, and refused to brief media for days, permitting panic stories of fictitious items such as \"gigantic radioactive hydrogen bubble into atmosphere\" and worse, to fill headlines. Also curiously, that same month, a spectacular Holly- wood movie, \"The China Syndrome,\" starring Jane Fonda, por- trayed a fictional account almostly exactly paralleling the Harris- burg events, further fueling public hysteria over dangers of nu- clear energy. 12 By the end of 1979, the hegemony of the Anglo-American finan- cial establishment over the world's economic and industrial po- 10 - RESPONSE TO THE OIL SHOCK 197 tentials had been reasserted in a manner never before imagined. Their control of world oil flows had again been a central weapon of their peculiar brand of malthusian policy. Out of the chaos of Khomeini's Iran and Volcker's dollar shocks, these influential pol- icy arbiters saw themselves as virtual gods of Mt. Olympus. Within a short decade their lofty mount, however, began to feel the rumblings of an underlying volcano. Footnotes 1. Sources: International Iron and Steel Institute.

A fascinating echo of LaRouche's International Development bank concept emerged two years later in a proposal released in early 1977 by Masaki Nakaj- ima, chairman of japan's Mitsubishi Research Institute. The Nakajima proposal called for the creation of what he termed a Global Infrastructure Fund. He mo- tivated it thus: \"Under the prolonged worldwide recession in the post-oil crisis years, every country around the world is groping for ways to get out of it. What is being proposed herein as a Global Infrastructure Fund is a concept that Japan"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"198 A CENTURY OF WAR should consider as one of its international responsibilities...The proposition is to generate effective demand within this country amounting to more than $500 bil- lion...under the assumption that all leading advanced industrialized countries and oil-producing countries co-ooperate to do so...It aims at developing new- sources of energy and increasing food production for the world...Implementa- tion of the various 'super projects' proposed herein would lead to development of peaceful demand in the manufacturing industry..technological incentives in the advanced countries in lieu of arms production...Now is the time for man- kind to positively assert a bold and long-range vision.\" Nakajima's list of Great Projects proposed included greening the Sahara for agriculture, a Himalayan hydroelectric project, creation of a central African lake in Chad and the Congo, and development of a series of hydroelectric dams across South America. Nakajima's proposal was revived in 1990 in Davos, Switzerland at a meeting of the World Economic Forum, with support of the Japanese industrial federation, Keidanren. 7.

This institution broadened the initial influence-base of the Bilder- berg, which explicitly was founded as a vehicle to promote Anglo-American policy in Western Europe. The Trilateral Commission was an attempt to address the changing geopolitical reality in which Japan was emerging as an economic giant. The triad consisted of North America, Europe, and Japan. In Europe, it incorporated a motley group, among them Germany's Graf Lambsdorff. Many European members of the Trilateral Commission were drawn from long-time friends of Rockefeller and old members of the wartime European \"synarchist\" networks. That there were no fundamental policy disagreements between Henry Kissinger and the Democratic Party candidacy of David Rockefeller's protege Carter, was evident from Rockefeller's naming of Kissinger to the Ad- visory Board of his Chase Manhattan Bank after the latter left government, as well as making Kissinger Executive Director of his Trilateral group to replace Brzezinski, while the latter was running U.S. foreign policy for Carter. 10.

CHAPTER ELEVEN: Imposing The New World Order: The Gotterdammerung Paul Volcker borrows a British model W ELL BEFORE KARL MARX ever conceived of his notion of class warfare, British Liberalism had evolved a con- cept of a society polarised between what was termed the \"upper classes\" and the \"lower classes.\" The essence of the 19th century liberal free trade policies of Adam Smith and David Ri- cardo, which led to the abolition of the protective Corn Laws in England after 1846 and which opened the flood gates to ruinous cheap grain imports, led as noted earlier, to the predictable impov- erishment of the greater majority of British citizens, and to the con- centration of the wealth of the society into the hands of a small mi- nority, the so-called \"upper classes.\" The political philosophy of what was called British Liberalism was the justification for this ec- onomically inequitable process. As the most influential American publicist of 19th century Brit- ish Liberalism, the aristocratic Walter Lippmann defined this class society in a modern framework for an American audience. Society should, Lippmann argued, be divided into the great vulgar masses of a largely ignorant \"public,\" which is then steered by an elite or a \"special class,\" which Lippmann termed the \"responsible men,\" who would decide the terms of what would be called \"the national interest.\" This elite would become the dedicated bureau- cracy, to serve the interests of private power and private wealth, but the truth of their relationship to the power of private wealth should never be revealed to the broader ignorant public. \"They wouldn't understand.\" The general population must have the illusion, Lippmann"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"200 A CENTURY OF WAR argued, that it is actually exerting \"democratic\" power. This illu- sion must be shaped by the elite body of \"responsible men\" in what was termed the \"manufacture of consent.\" This was de- scribed by Lippmann several decades before Paul Volcker ever set foot in Washington, as the \"political philosophy for liberal democ- racy.\" In its concept of an elite specialized few, ruling on behalf of the greater masses, modern Anglo-American liberalism bore a cu- rious similarity to the Leninist concept of \"vanguard party,\" which imposed a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" in the name of some fu- ture ideal of society. Both models were based on deception of the broader populace. 1 More and more, following the turning point of the 1957 U.S. economic recession, the enormous power of a small number of international banks and related petroleum multination- als concentrated in New York defined the contents of an American \"liberalism\" based on adaptation of the 19th Century British Im- perial model. The American version of this enlightened liberal model would be shaped by an aristocracy of money, rather than blue-blood aristocracy of birth. But increasingly, as a consequence of the economic policy decisions of the American East Coast libe- ral establishment—so called because its center of power was built around the New York finance and oil conglomerates—the United States became transformed. America, once the ideal of freedom for much of the world, was transformed, step-by-step, into the opposite, and at a quickening pace during the 1970's and 1980's, while she retained a rhetorical facade of \"freedom and liberty.\" The combined impact of the two staggering oil shocks of the 1970's and the resulting hyperinflation this set into motion, created, in effect, a new American \"landed aristocracy\" in which those who owned property suddenly saw themselves become mil- lionaires overnight as a consequence not of enterprise or success- ful manufacturing or scientific invention, but merely as the conse- quence of possession of land—real estate, dead dirt. But if the oil shocks set off this polarization of society into a mi- nority of increasingly wealthy against a vast majority whose liv- ing standards were slowly sinking, the monetary shock therapy imposed by Paul Volcker after October 1979, helped the task to its ultimate conclusion. It would be mistaken to think that the monetary shock therapy which Paul Volcker imposed on the United States beginning Octo- 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER  201  ber 6,1979, was Volcker's own invention. The policy had been de- veloped, and already implemented months before, in Britain. Volcker and his close circle of New York banking friends, includ- ing Lewis Preston of the anglophile Wall Street firm, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, merely imposed the Thatcher government's monetary shock model under U.S. conditions. In early May 1979 Margaret Thatcher won the election against her Labour party opponent, James Callaghan. She campaigned on a platform of \"squeezing inflation out of the economy.\" But Thatcher, and the inner circle of modern-day Adam Smith \"free market\" ideologues who surrounded her, promoted a consumer fraud, insisting that government deficit spending, and not the 140% increase in the price of oil since the fall of Iran's Shah, was the chief \"cause\" of Britain's 18% rate of price inflation. According to the Thatcher government's claim, inflated prices could again be lowered simply by cutting the supply of money to the economy, and since the major source of \"surplus money\", as argued, was from chronic government budget deficits, govern- ment expenditure must be savagely cut in order to reduce \"mon- etary inflation.\" The Bank of England simultaneously restricted credit to the economy by a policy of high interest rates, as their part of the remedy. The effect was predictably depression, but it was called instead the \"Thatcher revolution.\" Thatcher cut and squeezed. In June, 1979, only one month after taking office, Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Geoffrey Howe, began a process of raising Base Rates for the banking system a staggering five percentage points, from 12% up to 17%, in a matter of twelve weeks. This amounted to an unprecedented 42% increase in the cost of borrowing for industry and homeown- ers, in a matter of weeks. Never in modern history had an indus- trialized nation undergone such a shock in such a brief period, with the exception of a wartime economic emergency. The Bank of England simultaneously began to cut the money supply to insure that interest rates remained high. Businesses went bankrupt, unable to pay borrowing costs; families were un- able to buy new homes; long-term investment into power plants, subways, railroads, and other infrastructure ground to a virtual halt as a consequence of Thatcher's monetarist revolution. But the principal problem with the British economy at the end of the 1970's was not government ownership of companies such as"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"202 A CENTURY OF WAR the British Leyland car group, Rolls Royce, or the many other en- terprises which have since been auctioned off to private investors. The main problem was lack of investment by the government in upgrading public infrastructure, in the education of its skilled labor force, and in scientific research and development. It was not \"government,\" but rather wrong government policy in response to the economic shocks of the previous ten or more years, which was at fault. Thatcher's \"economic revolution\" applied the wrong medicine to \"cure\" the wrong disease. But the international financial inter- ests of the City of London and the powerful petroleum companies grouped around Shell, British Petroleum and their allies, were the intended real beneficiaries, as was the perceived strategic British \"balance-of-power\" calculus. Thatcher was a simple grocer's daughter groomed by her cynical patrons to act out a role for their greater geopolitical designs. As Thatcher imposed the policies which earned her the name \"The Iron Lady,\" unemployment in Britain doubled, rising from 1.5 million when she came into office to a level of 3 million by the end of her first eighteen months in office. Labor unions were tar- getted under Thatcher as obstacles to the success of the monetar- ist \"revolution,\" a prime cause of the \"enemy,\" inflation. All the time, with British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell exploiting the astronomical prices of $36 or more per barrel for their North Sea oil, never a word was uttered against big oil or the City of London banks which were amassing huge sums of capital in the situation. Thatcher also moved to accommodate the big City banks by re- moving exchange controls, so that instead of capital being in- vested in rebuilding Britain's rotted industrial base, funds flowed out to speculate in real estate in Hong Kong or lucrative loans to Latin America. 2 Beginning in Britain, then in the United States, and from there radiating outward from the Anglo-American world, the radical monetarism of Thatcher and Volcker spread like a cancer, with its insistent demands to cut government spending, lower taxes, de- regulate industry and break the power of organized labor. Interest rates rose around the world to levels never before imagined pos- sible. In the United States, by early 1980 Volcker's monetary shock policy had driven U.S. interest rates up to British levels, and some 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 203 months later, beyond, to an astonishing 20% level for select inter- est rates. The economics of this interest rate austerity were soon obvious to all. For any industrial investment to be \"profitable\" at 20% or even 17% interest rate levels, would mean that any normal investment which required more than four to five years to com- plete, was simply not possible. Interest charges on the construc- tion alone prohibited this. With regulatory changes in nuclear power plant construction in the United States after the Three Mile Island anti-nuclear hysteria resulting in years of added new delay in completion of existing power plants, nuclear energy became prohibitively costly as an in- vestment for America's electric utility companies under the Volcker interest rate regime. After that year, 1979, not one new nu- clear reactor was ordered in the United States, and scores of half- built or planned nuclear projects were cancelled mid-stream be- cause of prohibitive financing costs. One of the most advanced sectors of the productive economy was allowed to die. Volcker's shock medicine was imposed on a desperate and ig- norant President Carter, who willingly signed an extraordinary piece of legislation in March 1980, the \"Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980.\" This law em- powered Volcker's Federal Reserve to impose reserve require- ments on banks, even if not in the Federal reserve system, includ- ing Savings & Loan banks, ensuring that Volcker's credit choke succeeded in cutting the flow of credit sufficiently. In addition, the new law phased out all legal ceilings on interest rates which banks could charge customers under what the Federal Reserve called \"Regulation Q,\" as well as repealing all state laws which had set interest rate limits, the so-called anti-usury laws. The sky was the interest rate limit under the religious dogma of the new Anglo-American monetarism: money, or at least, the du- tiful payer of usurious interest rates to the banks of London and New York, was King, and the world, its dutiful servant. Long-term government-funded infrastructure and capital in- vestment, such as railroad, highway, bridge, sewer, and electricity plant construction, was devastated by this Thatcher-Volcker po- licy offensive in the early 1980's. From the time of the first oil shock in 1975 until 1985, the International Iron and Steel Institute calcu- lated that the total share of all government expenditure in major industrial nations devoted to construction of public infrastructure"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"204 A CENTURY OF WAR had fallen to one half its level of the mid-1970's. World production of steel, shipping ton-miles and other indicators of real physical economic flows reflected the catastrophic Anglo-American mone- tary shock policy. The world steel industry was forced deeper into its worst depression since the 1930's. 3 Paul Volcker's monetary shock and the ensuing U.S. economic downturn were major factors in the November 1980 election de- feat of Jimmy Carter. The new \"conservative\" Republican presi- dent, a former Hollywood movie actor named Ronald Reagan, had little difficulty backing the Volcker shock treatment. Reagan had been tutored while Governor of California by the guru of monetarism, Mont Pelerin economist Milton Friedman. Britain's Margaret Thatcher deliberately cultivated what she called a \"spe- cial relationship\" with Reagan. She encouraged his support of the shock therapy of Volcker and government austerity, as well as Reagan's propensity to anti-union policies. To ensure a unified Anglo-American offensive on policy in this period, Reagan and Thatcher also shared some of the same eco- nomic advisors, including a circle of dogmatic Mont Pelerin econ- omists which uncluded Karl Brunner, Milton Friedman, Sir Alan Walters and others. One of Reagan's first acts as President in early 1981 was to use his powers to dissolve the trade union of the airline traffic control- lers, PATCO. This served to signal other unions not to attempt to seek relief from the soaring interest rates. Reagan was mesmerized by the same ideological zeal to \"squeeze out inflation\", as was his conservative British counterpart, Thatcher. Some informed people in the City of London suggested that in fact, a major reason for the Thatcher government's existence in the first place was to influence the monetary policy of the world's largest industrial nation, the United States, and with that to shift economic policy throughout most of the industrial world, away from the direction of long-term nuclear and other industrial development. If that was, in fact, the plan, it succeeded. Six months after Thatcher took office, Ronald Reagan was elected. As president, Reagan reportedly enjoyed repeating to his Cabinet at every op- portunity the refrain, \"inflation is like radioactivity. Once it starts, it spreads and grows.\" Reagan kept Milton Friedman as an unof- ficial adviser on economic policy. His administration was filled with disciples of Friedman's radical monetarism, much as Carter's 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 205 had been with exponents of David Rockefeller's Trilateral Com- mission. 4 This entire radical monetarist construct, advanced in the early 1980's first by the British regime of Thatcher, and soon after by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reagan Administration, was one of the most cruel economic frauds ever perpretrated. But its aim was far different from what its ideological \"supply-side\" economics advocates claimed. The powerful liberal establishment circles of the City of London and New York were determined to use the same radical measures earlier imposed by Friedman to break the economy of Chile under Pinochet's military dictatorship, this time in order to inflict a de- vastating second blow against long-term industrial and infrastruc- ture investment in the entire world economy. The relative power of Anglo-American finance was thus to become hegemonic again, they reasoned. What followed in the decade of the 1980's would have appeared inconceivable to a world which had not already been stunned and disoriented by the shocks of the 1970's. Gunboat diplomacy, and a Mexican initiative It would be no exaggeration to say that there would not have been a Third World debt crisis during the past decade had there not been Margaret Thatcher's and Paul Volcker's radical monetary shock policies. As the average cost of their petroleum imports, denominated in U.S. dollars, rose some 140% after the Iran oil shock in early 1979, developing countries this time around found that the dollar itself, in terms of their local currency, was rising like an Apollo rocket at the same time, because of the high U.S. interest rates caused by Volcker's policy. Not only could most struggling developing countries barely manage the borrowings to finance the oil deficits built up from the 1974 oil shock; by 1980 an entirely new element faced them—floating interest rates on their Eurodollar borrow- ings. As noted earlier, as early as 1973, the Anglo-American financial insiders of the Bilderberg group had discussed using the major"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"206   A CENTURY OF WAR private commercial banks of New York and London, in the Lon- don-centered Eurodollar market, to recycle what Henry Kissinger and others referred to as the new OPEC petro-dollar surpluses. The sudden glut of new OPEC oil funds, which was steered into the London Eurodollar banks during the oil shocks of the 1970's, was to be the source of the greatest unregulated lending spree since the 1920's. London had evolved as the geographical center for this Eurodol- lar \"offshore\" market, because the Bank of England had made clear over a period since the 1960's that it would not attempt to regulate or control the flows of foreign currencies in the London Eurodollar banking market. It was part of their strategy of recon- structing the City of London as the center of world finance. This meant, despite vague public utterings by various bankers to the contrary about the safety of the Eurodollar loans, that the billion of dollars flowing out of London-based Eurodollar banks to the ac- counts of developing country borrowers during the 1970's had no \"lender of last resort\" in event of a default. No single sovereign government was legally bound to make good on the losses in event of a major default on the bank loans. No one seemed concerned so long as this Eurodollar roulette wheel kept turning. Foreign debts incurred by developing coun- tries expanded some five-fold, rising from $130 billion in the \"hal- cyon\" days of 1973, before the first oil shock, to some $550 billions by 1981, and to over $612 billion by the decisive year 1982, accord- ing to International Monetary Fund calculations. Even this omit- ted significant short-term lending of less than one year. The lead- ing banker of New York at the time, Citicorp's Walter Wriston, jus- tified the private bank lending to countries such as Mexico and Brazil by arguing, \"governments have assets that are in excess of their liabilities, and this is, shorthand, governments don't go bank- rupt...\" A crucial feature of these private Eurodollar loans to developing countries was ignored in the aftermath of the first oil shock. Manu- facturers Hanover Trust of New York, a major Eurodollar bank, had pioneered the petrodollar recycling of huge sums to develop- ing countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, even Poland and Yugoslavia. While developing countries were able to borrow on far more favorable terms than if had they submitted their econo- mies to conditionalities of the International Monetary Fund, the 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 207 Anglo-American bank syndicates extracted a little-noticed conces- sion, pioneered by Manufacturers Hanover. All Eurodollar loans to these countries were fixed at a specified premium over what- ever the given London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was. This LIBOR rate was a \"floating\" rate, which would fall or rise as de- termined by short-term interest rate levels in New York and Lon- don. Before summer of 1979, this seemed anlnnocuous precondi- tion to borrow needed funds to finance oil deficits. But with the application of the Thatcher government's interest rate monetary shock beginning June 1979, followed that October by the same policy from Paul Volcker's Federal Reserve, the inter- est rate burdens of Third World debt compounded overnight, as London interest rates climbed from an average of 7% in early 1978, to almost 20% on the London Eurodollar market by early 1980. With this one factor alone, Third World debtor countries would have collapsed into default as the altered debt service conditions imposed on them by the creditor banks added an unpayable new amount to their previously onerous debt burden. But most unset- tling were the uncanny parallels of policy then imposed by the leading London and New York bankers, virtually letter-by-letter a rerun of the same banks' Versailles war reparations debt recycling folly of the 1920's, which collapsed into chaos in October 1929 with the crash of the New York Stock Market. As interest rate burdens on their foreign debt obligations soared to the stratosphere after 1980, the market for Third World debtor country commodity exports to the industrial countries, which were critical to repay those debt burdens, collapsed, as the indus- trial economies were plunged into the deepest economic down- turn since the world depression of the 1930's, a result of the impact of the Thatcher-Volcker monetary shock \"cure.\" Third World debtor countries began to be squeezed in the blades of a vicious scissors of deteriorating terms of trade for their com- modity exports, falling export earnings, and a soaring debt service ratio. This in short, was what Washington and London preferred to call the \"Third World debt crisis.\" But the crisis was made in London, New York and in Washington, not in Mexico City, Bra- silia, Buenos Aires, Lagos, or Warsaw. Events came to a predictable head during the summer of 1982. When it became obvious that the Latin American debtor coun- tries would soon explode under the onerous new debt repayment"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"208 A CENTURY OF WAR burdens, influential circles around Margaret Thatcher and the Reagan Administration, notably Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Vice President George Bush and CIA Director William Casey, began to prepare an \"example\" to deter debtor countries from considering non-payment of their debts to the major U.S. and UK banks. In Aprilof 1982, Prime Minister Thatcher told the British House of Commons, \"Britain won't flinch from using force,\" to retake the disputed Malvinas Islands in the desolate waters of the South At- lantic off Argentina's coast, known as the Falklands in Britain. The issue was not that Argentina's Galtieri government had justifiably claimed sovereignty over the islands, and retaken them on April 1, after years of unsuccessful attempts at negotiation of the issue. Nor was the real issue that the surrounding area was believed by some to contain rich untapped petroleum reserves. The real issue of Thatcher's military confrontation with Argen- tina was to enforce the principle of collection of Third World debts by a new form of 19th century \"gunboat diplomacy.\" Two-thirds of Britain's Naval fleet was dispatched to the South Atlantic dur- ing April 1982, for a shooting war with Argentina which Britain nearly lost to Argentine deployment of French Exocet missiles. The British intent was to trigger a crisis in order to attempt to place the military might of all NATO behind policing of Third World debt repayment, under the changed terms of sky-high float- ing interest rates. Argentina was the third largest debtor nation at the time, with $38 billion in foreign debts, and the country which appeared clos- est to default. Thatcher had been advised to make a test case of Ar- gentina. The staged Malvinas conflict, details of which were to emerge almost ten years later, was merely the pretext to persuade other NATO members to back what was termed \"out of area\" NATO military deployment. A tentative step in that direction came at a May 7 NATO Nuclear Planning Group meeting that spring in Brussels, but aside from American backing, Britain largely stood alone in its demand to expand the purview of NATO beyond defense of Western Europe. What did result from the British military action against Argen- tina in the spring of 1982, was the severe worsening of Washington's relations with its Latin American neighbors. The Reagan administration had been persuaded, after much internal 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 209 wrangling, to come out on the side of British gunboat diplomacy against Argentina, in de facto violation of the United States' own Monroe Doctrine. Perhaps unknown to President Reagan, Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Enders travelled to Buenos Aires in March that year, to privately assure the Galtieri government that the dispute between Argentina and Britain over the Malvinas would not draw U.S. participation. In Buenos Aires, this assurance was considered the \"green light\" from Washington to proceed. It bore remarkable parallels to similar \"assurances\" which a U.S. Ambassador was to give to Iraq's Saddam Hussein in July, 1990, some days before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Certain circles in the Washington estab- lishment were in full accord with the London Foreign Office pol- icy. Argentina had to be maneuvered into giving the pretext for military action by Britain. One country which did not appreciate Washington's support for Thatcher's replay of 19th century British colonialism was Mexico, which shared its border with the United States. Under the presi- dency of Jose Lopez Portillo, beginning late 1976, Mexico had undertaken an impressive modernization and industrialization program. Lopez Portillo's government was determined to use its \"oil patrimony\" to industrialize the country into a modern nation. Ports, roads, petrochemical plants, modern irrigated agriculture complexes, and even a nuclear power program were undertaken. Significant and nationally-controlled oil resources were to be the means to modernize Mexico. By 1981, after the Volcker interest rate shock, certain Washington and New York policy circles determined that the prospect of a strong industrial Mexico, a \"Japan on our southern border,\" as one American establishment person derisively called it, would \"not be tolerated.\" As with Iran earlier, a modern independent Mexico was considered by certain powerful Anglo- American interests to be intolerable. The decision was made to intervene to sabotage Mexico's industrialization ambitions, in favor of securing rigid re- payment of usurious foreign debt levels. A well-prepared run on the Mexican peso was orchestrated be- ginning the fall of 1981, signalled by a New York Times interview with former CIA chief William Colby, then a consultant to multi- national corporations on \"political risk.\" Colby stated that he was advising his clients regarding investment in Mexico, \"expect a de-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"210 A CENTURY OF WAR valuation of Mexico's currency before next year's general elec- tion.\" Colby's theme was echoed by articles throughout the U.S. media, including the Wall Street Journal. Colby was connected with a \"private\" international consultancy, known as Probe International, on whose board sat Lord Caradon (Hugh Foot), a British Foreign Office intelligence specialist in Mid- dle East and American affairs, and a leading advocate of malthu- sian population reduction policies in the developing sector. Probe's president, a former U.S. State Department senior official named Benjamin Weiner, planted a series of articles in U.S. papers during the early weeks of 1982, fostering the idea that knowledge- able Mexican businessmen were rushing to smuggle their funds, converted into dollars, out of Mexico into Texas and California real estate before the country exploded. The articles were dutifully re- ported in major Mexican dailies, further fuelling capital flight. President Lopez Portillo in a nationwide speech on February 5 that year, attacked what he termed \"hidden foreign interests\" who were trying to destabilize the country through panic rumors and flight of capital out of the country, and force a devaluation of the peso against the U.S. dollar. Three years earlier, the same Probe International played an instrumental role in fueling the capital flight which helped to weaken the Shah of Iran, preparing the way for the Khomeini revolution. By February 19,1982, the Mexican government was forced to im- pose a draconian austerity program, in desperate hopes of stabi- lizing the flight capital flood out of Mexico into the U.S. Powerful vested financial interests exerted strong pressure on Lopez Por- tillo to prevent him from taking what would have been a neces- sary defense measure of reimposing Mexican foreign exchange controls. The flight capital accelerated. That February 19, the Portillo government cracked under the pressure. The Mexican peso was immediately devalued by an 30%, to try to stem the capital outflow and stabilize the situation. Private Mexican industry which had borrowed dollars to finance investment in the previous years was bankrupted overnight, led by the once-powerful Alfa Group of Monterrey. Its earnings were in pesos, and its debt service in vastly more costly dollars. Only to maintain their previous debt service position, a company would have to increase peso prices by 30%, or cut costs by reducing its workforce. The devaluation also forced reduction in Mexico's in- 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 211 dustrial program, cuts in living standards, and increased domes- tic inflation. Mexico, only months earlier the most rapidly grow- ing economy in the developing world, plunged into chaos by the spring of 1982. A Mexican case officer with the International Mon- etary Fund declared after the severe measures, \"This was just the right thing to do. 5 Mexico was now put firmly under the international spotlight as a \"problem borrower,\" and a \"high risk country.\" Leading Euro- dollar banks in London and New York, Zurich and Frankfurt as well as Tokyo, quickly cut back their lending plans. By August, Mexico, under the combined pressures of peso devaluation, loss of billions of dollars in needed capital through capital flight, and the decision by major international banks not to roll over the old debt, faced a debt payments crisis of titanic dimensions. On August 20 that summer, at the headquarters of the New York Federal Reserve, more than 100 of the United States' leading bank- ers were summoned to a secret closed-door meeting, to hear a re- port from Jesus Silva Herzog, the Mexican Finance Minister, on Mexico's prospects for repaying its $82 billion foreign debt. Silva Herzog told the assembled gentlemen of international finance that his country could not even meet the next installment on its foreign debt coming due. Its foreign exchange reserves were gone. During the last days of that May, however, Mexico's President Lopez Portillo, invited American economist Lyndon LaRouche to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, to discuss the nature of the growing international economic crisis and Mexico's options, as well as the implications of Britain's Falklands war on national sov- ereignty in Latin America and elsewhere. LaRouche, founder of an increasingly influential international political and economic affairs weekly journal, EIR (Executive In- telligence Review), had been in New Delhi only some weeks ear- lier to meet with leading parliamentarians and India's Prime Min- ister Indira Ghandi, who was then back in power. On both occasions, LaRouche elaborated proposals for a solu- tion which would tilt the direction of world economic develop- ments away from the abyss it then faced, and back towards indus- trial development. In New Delhi, he outlined to the Indian Coun- cil of World Affairs, a \"grand design\" for a new international eco- nomic order based on a three-way agreement linking \"North- South\" and \"East-West,\" which would combine Japanese, U.S.,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"212 A CENTURY OF WAR and West European technological capacities, in the form of vastly expanded export of capital goods trade flows to the developing re- gions of the south and to Eastern Europe. In his discussions with leading government and private sector figures in Mexico, LaRouche was asked to draw up a concrete pro- posal for Mexico to avert the looming financial disaster. On Au- gust 2,1982, only some days before the Mexican Finance Minister came to New York to meet the bankers, LaRouche issued his pol- icy paper, Operation Juarez, and presented it to Lopez Portillo and leading members of the Parliament of Mexico. LaRouche's propo- sal was aimed as much at the White House in Washington, where a heated internal fight was ongoing over policy towards Mex- icoand other debtor nations. LaRouche's Operation Juarez called upon President Reagan to institute emergency measures to halt the monetary strangulation measures of the Federal Reserve, by putting the dollar back onto a gold reserve basis at $500/fine ounce; it included a comprehen- sive U.S. banking reform, particularly the nationalization of the privately-controlled Federal Reserve Bank, in order to faciliate a two-tier credit policy in the U.S. banking system which would \"re- ward\" lending for long-term industrial and infrastructural pro- ductive purposes, while penalizing speculation in areas such as real estate. For the nations of Latin America, LaRouche's white paper out- lined a concept for creation of an Ibero-American Monetary Order. \"The republics of Ibero-America must each and collectively effect reforms of their credit, currency and banking institutions,\" he stated. Government loans must be directed towards productive purposes, prioritizing public rail, road and communications infra- structure, industry and agriculture. Exchange controls must be im- posed by relevant governments, as necessary. In this context, La- Rouche proposed an Ibero-American Common Market, modelled on certain healthy features of the European Common Market, to facilitate sufficient continent-wide credit for investment, to create common defense, and create preferred trade among the nations of Latin America in order to stabilize their economies in the crisis. In Mexico, President Lopez Portillo faced growing economic chaos; he decided to embrace important, if not the most crucial, programmatic aspects of LaRouche's Operation Juarez proposal. In a belated defensive attempt to stem capital flight, then at crisis 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 213 proportions, Lopez Portillo announced to the Mexican nation on September 1, that the country's private banks were being nation- alized, with compensation, along with the then-private central bank, the Bank of Mexico, as part of a series of emergency meas- ures to restore financial order and stop the outflow of flight capi- tal which threated to collapse the nation's entire economy. In his nationally televised three hour speech that day, Portillo at- tacked the private banks as being \"speculative and parasitical\", and he detailed the capital flight which they had tunneled out of Mexico's industrialization effort into dollars and U.S. real estate speculation in the U.S. The total was $76 billion, equivalent to the entire total of foreign debt contracted in the previous ten years for the country's industrialization. Lopez Portillo had established a friendly rapport of sorts with Ronald Reagan, and informed Reagan personally of his dramatic action to make clear that it was an issue of national emergency, not irresponsible radicalism against the United States. Then President Lopez Portillo appeared before the New York annual General Assembly of the United Nations, on October 1. He called on the nations of the world to act in concert to prevent a \"re- gression into the Dark Ages.\" He effectively identified the cause of the crisis of the financial system as a result of policies of unbear- ably high interest rates and collapsing prices of raw materials. These were, \"two blades of a pair of scissors that threatens to slash the momentum achieved in some countries, and to cut off the possibilities for progress in the rest,\" the Mexican president as- serted. He then bluntly warned of the possibility of unilateral sus- pension of Third World debt payments, if a commonly beneficial solution were blocked. \"Payment suspension is to no one's advan- tage and no one wants it. But whether or not this will happen is beyond the responsibility of the debtors. Common situations pro- duce common positions, with no need for conspiracies or in- trigue.\" Lopez Portillo attacked the arbitrary imposition of the new terms of debt under Thatcher and Volcker. \"Mexico and many other countries of the Third World are unable to comply with the period of payment agreed upon under conditions quite different from those that now prevail...We developing countries do not want to become vassals. We cannot paralyze our economies or plunge our peoples into greater misery in order to pay a debt on"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"214 A CENTURY OF WAR which servicing has tripled without our participation or respon- sibility, and on terms that are imposed on us...Our efforts to grow in order to conquer hunger, disease, ignorance and dependency have not caused the international crisis,\" he insisted. Lopez Portillo addressed the self-interest of the United States and other industrial creditor nations in working together for solu- tions which allowed countries such as Mexico to grow their way out of the crisis. Lopez Portillo's comments were echoed by the head of state of the largest debtor nation, Brazil's Joao Baptista Fig- ueiredo, who then spoke of \"symptoms dramatically reminiscent of the 1930's\" in which \"production investment is being asphyxi- ated on a global scale under the impact of high interest rates.\" Throughout the summer months of 1982, there was a behind- the-scenes White House policy debate over what to do about the explosive debt crisis. Although no general publicity was given to the existence of the LaRouche proposal in Washington, it was studied by senior White House advisers, including National Security Council senior econ- omist Norman Bailey and Judge William Clark, a trusted member of a California circle which had accompanied Reagan to Washing- ton in 1981. The U.S. economy was falling deeper into decline under the weight of the severe Federal Reserve interest rate levels; a group around Ronald Reagan lobbied for a resolution of the impending Mexico and Latin American debt crisis which would simultane- ously spark increased U.S. industrial investment and export flows. They studied and discussed the features of the LaRouche propo- sal, and found it both brilliant and clearly workable. Unfortunately, the voices of Wall Street and Henry Kissinger's friends at the British Foreign Office and the City of London were more influential over the vacillating Reagan. As part of his pre- election \"deal\" to win the backing of the powerful Wall Street es- tablishment, Reagan had agreed to name former Merrill Lynch Wall Street chairman, Don Regan, as his Treasury Secretary, along with a number of other key appointments, not least former Trilat- eral Commission member, George Bush, as Vice President, and Bush's close friend, James Baker, as White House Chief of Staff. They argued, \"we must save the New York banks at all costs.\" By October 1982, their approach to the exploding Mexico and other debt crises had become Reagan Administration policy. 6 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 215 The day before Lopez Portillo addressed the UN General As- sembly, the newly-named U.S. Secretary of State delivered the American response. George Shultz, a former University of Chi- cago economist and friend of Milton Friedman, and one of the fi- gures behind Nixon's fateful August 15,1971, decoupling of the dollar from gold, announced the final Reagan Administration re- sponse to the assembled United Nations delegates. Shultz un- veiled Wall Street's simple \"solution\" to the debt crisis. Following Mexico's declaration of insolvency in early August, Paul Volcker met with senior Reagan Administration officials and worked out a plan to gradually ease the strains on the major New York banks. Shultz announced this as the \"Reagan economic re- covery.\" Rather than addressing the root causes of the crisis in ei- ther the United States, or the nations of the South, Shultz offered International Monetary Fund policing of debtor country debt re- payment, combined with stimulation of U.S. consumer purchases. This, it was argued, would then draw in increased Third World commodity exports as part of the planned \"recovery.\" It was the most costly \"recovery\" in world history. Wall Street replays the 1920's, IMF-style Shultz's UN announcement was a carefully-staged counter to the anticipated UN address of Lopez Portillo and other Latin American heads of state. What then followed was almost beyond belief to anyone not directly familiar with negotiations between creditor bankers and debtor countries at that time. Jose Lopez Portillo's summons to Latin American unity failed following his UN speech. He was seen as a lame duck president, who left office two months later. In the meantime, Brazil and Ar- gentina were visited by a virtual army of U.S. officials and others, who exerted extraordinary blackmail and other pressure to dis- suade these from joining Mexico in demanding a common solu- tion to the debt crisis. Henry Kissinger had formed a high-powered new consultancy firm, Kissinger Associates Inc., which numbered Aspen Institute chairman and oil magnate Robert O. Anderson, Thatcher's former foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, together with Bank of England"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"216 A CENTURY OF WAR and S.G. Warburg director, Lord Roll of Ipsden, on its select board. Kissinger Associates worked together with the New York banks and circles of the Washington administration to impose, \"case-by- case,\" the most onerous debt collection terms since the Versailles reparations process of the early 1920's. Following Secretary of State Shultz's September 30 UN speech, the private banking interests of New York and London overruled any voices of reason. Instead of saving themselves, as LaRouche and Portillo had proposed, they managed to bring in the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, but most important, the powers of the International Monetary Fund, to act as the international \"po- liceman,\" in what became the most concerted organized looting operation in modern history, far exceeding anything achieved during the 1920's. Contrary to the carefully cultivated impression in Western Eu- rope or the U.S. media, debtor countries paid many times over, lit- erally with blood and the proverbial \"pound of flesh\" to the mod- ern-day Shylocks of New York and London. It was not the case that after August 1982, large Third World debtor nations refused to pay. They had a \"pistol to the head,\" under IMF pressure, to sign what the banks euphemistically termed \"debt work-outs\" with the leading private banks, most often led by Citicorp or Chase Manhattan of New York. After October 1982, the onslaught against debtor nations of the developing sector took several identifiable stages. The first crucial step came when the private banks of New York and London moved to \"socialize\" their debt crisis. By publishing numerous interviews in the world media warning of dire consequences to the international banking system of a widespread debt moratorium, the banks secured international support for the debt collection strategy elaborated by Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Manufac- turers' Hanover, Lloyds Bank and others. These private interests used the crisis to turn the power of major public institutions to enforce the minority interests of that private elite, the creditor banks. The banks banded together following a closed-door meeting in England's Ditchley Park in the fall, to create a de facto creditors' cartel of leading banks, headed by the New York and London banks, later called the Institute for Interna- tional Finance or, informally, the Ditchley Group. They proceeded to impose what one observer characterized as a peculiar form of 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 217 \"bankers' socialism\"— the private banks socialized their lending risks to the majority of the taxpaying public, while privatizing to themselves all the gains. And the gains were considerable, despite the appearance of crisis. Once the bankers and their allies in the Reagan Administration, such as Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, sufficiently terrorized Ronald Reagan about the situation, the White House called on Paul Volcker, the banks, and the IMF to impose a program of strict \"conditionalities\" on each debtor country. The idea to place the IMF and its strict conditionalities into the middle of the debt negotiating process, was an American idea. In substance, it was almost an exact copy of what the New York bank- ers did after 1919 against Germany and the rest of Europe under the ill-fated Dawes Plan, and later attempted under the Young Plan. IMF conditionalities and a country's agreement to sign with the IMF were part of a program developed by an American official then at the IMF, Irving Friedman, later rewarded for his work with a senior post at Citicorp. In late 1988, Friedman told an interviewer about his thinking at the onset of the debt crisis: \"My thought was that we would sort of hold out the use of the Fund resources as a kind of carrot to countries. You first have a very serious review of the country's economic situation. You identify the source of the difficulties, you point out what things have to be changed.\" The IMF prescription, or \"conditionalities\", was invariably the same. The victim debtor country was told that if it ever wanted to i' see a penny of foreign bank lending again, it must slash domestic imports to the bone, cut the national budget savagely, most often state subsidies for food and other necessities, devalue the national currency in order to make its exports \"attractive\" to industrial countries, while simultaneously making the costs of importing ad- vanced industrial goods prohibitive. All of this, it was argued, would earn hard currency to service the debt. Parson Malthus no doubt smiled from his grave at the process. This IMF Structural Adjustment Program was \"Step One\" to make the \"candidate\" eligible for consideration of Step Two—an agreement with its creditor banks for \"re-structuring\" of the re- payment schedule of their foreign debt, or a major portion of it. In this second stage, the banks contracted for huge future rights over debtor countries, as they added defaulted interest arrears onto the face amount of total debt owed."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"218   A CENTURY OF WAR The end result of the countless debtor restructurings since 1982 was an enormous increase in the amount of debt owed creditor banks, despite the fact that not one penny of new money had come into Latin America from those banks. According to data from a leading Swiss insurance firm, Swiss Re, total foreign debt of all de- veloping countries, long-term and short, rose steadily after 1982 from just over $839 billion to almost $1,300 billion by 1987. Virtu- ally all of this increase is accounted for in the added burden of \"re- financing\" the unpayable old debt. Mexico, under this IMF regimen, was forced to slash subsidies on vital medicines, foodstuffs, fuels, and other necessities for its population. People, often infants, died needlessly, for lack of the most basic medicine imports. The IMF then dictated a series of Mexican peso devaluations to \"spur exports.\" In early 1982, before the first 30% devaluation, the peso stood at 12 pesos to one U.S. dollar. By 1986, an incredible 862 Mexican pesos were needed to buy one dollar, and by 1989 the sum had climbed to 2,300 pesos per dollar. But Mexico's foreign debt, almost all of it \"taken over\" by the na- tional government from the Mexican private sector under de- mands from the New York banks and their Washington allies, grew from some $82 billion to just under $100 billion by the end of 1985. Mexico was rapidly going in the direction of Germany in the early 1920's. The same process was repeated in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Vene- zuela, and most of black Africa, including Zambia, Zaire, Egypt, and large parts of Asia. The IMF was the global \"policeman\" to enforce payment of usu- rious debts through imposition of the most draconian austerity in history. With the crucial voting bloc of the IMF firmly controlled by an American-British axis, the institution became the global en- forcer of Anglo-American monetary and economic interests in a manner never before seen. It was hardly surprising that victim countries shuddered when told that they were to receive an IMF inspection visit. In effect, the Anglo-American banks, by far the largest group involved in lending to Latin America, blackmailed their bank counterparts in Western Europe and Japan to \"solidar- ize\" or face prospect of collapse of the international banking system. 11-IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER  219  In 1982 and the years following, the threat was indeed credible. No one dared challenge; all countries of the creditor banks closed ranks behind the New York banks, and backed the Kissinger \"hard line\" approach to the debt. This allowed Washington, the New York banks, and their friends in London, to promote the useful rhetoric that the debt was solely the \"fault\" of corrupt, irrespon- sible Third World governments. The banking interests of New York and London were so confi- dent that they refused to even increase their emergency loan-loss reserves against default on their Third World debts. Citicorp and Chase Manhattan paid impressive dividends to their shareholders during the early 1980's, publicly declaring \"record profits,\" as though nothing extraordinary were occuring. They had won the full weight of the authority of the United States government and the IMF to police their debt collection. What could be more secure? As debtor after debtor was coerced to come to terms with the IMF and the creditor banks of the Ditchley Group, a reversal in capital flows of titanic dimensions set in. According to the World Bank, between 1980 and 1986, for a group of 109 debtor countries, payment of interest alone to the creditors on foreign debts totalled $326 billion. Repayment of principal on the same debts totalled an- other $332 billion, for a combined debt service payment of $658 billions on an original a debt of $430 billion. But despite this effort, these 109 countries still owed the creditors a sum of $882 billion in 1986. It was an impossible debt vortex. Thus worked the wonders of compounded interest and floating rates. An even more astonishing aspect of the entire \"debt crisis\" of the 1980's, was the fact that much of the money never even left New York or London banks. According to a direct participant in the pro- cedures, former Peruvian Energy Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczinski, who took a lucrative post with the New York-Swiss bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, \"Most of the money never came into Latin America. Out of $270 billion taken by Latin America between 1976 and 1981, we found only 8.4% actually were cashed by Latin America—money which could have been used for productive in- vestment. All the rest remained in the banks, never came to Latin America, only changed books.\" The debtor countries were caught in a trap, from which the only escape offered by the creditor banks of New York and London was to surrender national sovereign control over their economy, espe-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"220 A CENTURY OF WAR caily valuable resources such as the Mexican state oil monopoly. This the bankers called swapping the old \"debt for equity,\" which was aimed at securing control of attractive resources of the debtor country. A study by a Danish economist commissioned by the Danish UNICEF Committee, illustrated the process. \"In 1979 a net sum of $40 billion flowed from the rich North to the poorer South. That flow was reversed in 1983, when the under-developed countries sent $6 billion to the industrialized countries. Since then the amount has risen dramatically, according to UN estimates, ap- proximately $30 billion a year. But,\" he adds, \"if the transfer of re- sources due to falling raw material prices throughout the 1980's is taken into account, we are talking about a transfer of capital from the under-developed countries to the industrial countries of at least $60 billion a year. To this sum one should then add the capi- tal flight of black money...\" The study, by Hans K. Rasmussen, pointed out that there has been a wealth transfer from the capital-starved Third World since the early 1980's, primarily devoted to financing deficits in the United States, and to a lesser degree Britain. Rasmussen estimated that, during the 1980's, the combined nations of the developing sector transferred a total of $400 billion into the United States alone. This allowed the Reagan Administration to finance the larg- est peacetime deficits in world history, while falsely claiming credit for \"the world's longest peacetime recovery.\" With high U.S. interest rates, a rising dollar, and the security of American government backing, 43% of the record high U.S. bud- get deficits during the 1980's were \"financed\" by this de facto loot- ing of capital from the debtor countries of the once-developing sector. As with the Anglo-American bankers in the post World War I Versailles reparations debt process, the debt was merely a vehi- cle to establish de facto economic control over entire sovereign countries. The jaded New York bankers reasoned they had little to fear from powerless Latin American or African countries. After all, business is business. 7 In May 1986, a Staff Study prepared for the Joint Economic Com- mittee of the U.S. Congress on the \"Impact of the Latin American Debt Crisis on the U.S. Economy\" took note of some of these alarming aspects of how the problem was being handled by the Reagan Administration. The report documented the devastating 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 221 losses of U.S. jobs and exports as the IMF austerity measures forced Latin America to virtually halt industrial and other imports in order to service the debt. The authors noted, \"it is now becom- ing clear that Administration policies have gone above and be- yond what was needed for protecting the money center banks from insolvency...the Reagan Administration's management of the debt crisis has in effect, rewarded the institutions that played a major role in precipitating the crisis and penalized those sectors of the U.S. economy that had played no role in causing the debt crisis.\" The study was promptly buried. According to calculations by New York's Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, capital flight from Third World countries into the \"safe haven\" of U.S. and other creditor countries, was at least an- other $123 billion in the decade up to 1985. More than one major New York bank and investment firm set up offices in cities such as Bogota, Medellin, and other places in Latin America to profit from assisting black dollars to leave these countries. The rise of cocaine addiction in the industrial cities of the United States and Western Europe, which grew in parallel with the explosion of the Third World debt crisis beginning the early 1980's, bore a striking con- gruence to the rise in illegal dollars being \"laundered\" out of South America through discreet transfers by firms like Donald Regan's old Merrill Lynch. The clients were given the more taste- ful name, \"high net worth individuals.\" , In a study of the \"flight capital\" out of Latin America, Professor Joe Foweraker from the University of California at San Diego, noted that facilitating \"flight capital\" flows for such clients had be- come one of the most profitable parts of the \"debt crisis\" for the large U.S. banks during the 1980's. He noted that, in addition to some $50 billion annual interest payments from the hard-pressed debtor governments, these large banks, such as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty, and Bank of America, were bring- ing in flight-capital assets of some $100-120 billion from the very countries against whom they demanded brutal domestic austerity to \"stabilize\" the currency. It was more than a bit hypocritical, and more than a bit lucrative for the banks. The annual return for the banks on their Latin American flight- capital business, kept in strictest secrecy, was reliably reported to average 70%. As one such private banker stated about the New York and London banks' Latin American flight capital business,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"222 A CENTURY OF WAR \"some banks would kill to get a piece of this business.\" That was putting it mildly. In 1983, the London Financial Times reported that Brazil was far and away the most profitable banking part of Citicorp's worldwide operations. If anything, Africa fared worse as a result of the Anglo-Ameri- can debt strategy. Since 19th century colonial times, when Britain and France dominated the continent along with Portugal, Africa was kept largely as a primitive undeveloped source of cheap raw materials, with the stubborn exception of South Africa. The wave of independence during the \"decolonialization\" of the 1960's and 1970's produced little substantial improvement in the economic prospects of black Africa. The oil shocks, the ensuing shocks of 20% interest rates, and col- lapsing world industrial growth in the 1980's, dealt the literal death blow to almost the entire Continent. Until the 1980's, Black Africa remained 90% dependent on raw materials export'for fi- nancing its development. Beginning in the early 1980's, the world dollar price of such raw materials—everything from cotton, cof- fee, copper, iron ore and sugar, began an almost uninterrupted fall. By 1987, such raw materials prices fell to the lowest levels since World War II, as low as their level of 1932, a year of deep world ec- onomic depression. If their prices for such raw material exports had been stable at merely the price levels of the 1980 period, Black Africa would have earned an additional 150 billion U.S. dollars during the decade of the 1980's. In 1982, at the beginning of the \"debt crisis\" these coun- tries of Africa owed creditor banks in the United States, Europe, and Japan, some $73 billion. By the end of the decade, this sum, through debt \"reschedulings\" and various IMF interventions into their economies, had more than doubled to $160 billion: in short, almost exactly the sum which these countries would have earned at a stable export price level. It begins to appear that there was a very different process occur- ring, than what the average citizen in a West European or Ameri- can city was reading in his daily newspaper regarding the reality of this debt. During the 1980's, powerful multinationals in Britain and the U.S. followed the banks to set up child labor sweat-shops in places along the Mexican border with the United States, and other such places. These \"Maquiladores\", as the low-skill assem- bly plants are called, employed 14-15 year-old desperate Mexican In 1954 influential US and British political and financial figures estab- lished the \"very private\" Bilderberg group, under the nominal chair- manship of Holland's Prince Bernhard, in order to further relevant Anglo-American policy interests in postwar Europe. The first meeting, pictured here, was held at the Hotel Bilderberg in Oosterbeek Holland, hence the name of the group. Iranian nationalist leader Mohammed Mossadegh was toppled in 1953 by British Intelligence, with the assistance of Allen Dulles' CIA, in re- sponse to Mossadegh's previous nationalization of British Petroleum interests in Iran.

They were allowed by the Mexican government, because they \"earned\" dollars needed to service the debt. Reagan's chickens come home to roost One of the most destructive consequences of World War I and the Versailles war reparations aftermath, with its German Dawes Plan from London and New York banks in the 1920's, was the rel- ative collapse of global long-term investment. Increasingly, owing to the absolute decline of world trade in the 1920's, compared with pre-war levels, and owing to the general economic and political in- stability which prevailed in Europe, money could be borrowed generally for only a short term, typically less than one year. This produced a situation in which shortest-term speculative gains became the central criterion of all investment. This fuelled the great frenzy of the 1920's stock market boom in New York, a boom fuelled by inflows of foreign funds from London and the Conti- nent, seeking to make unprecedented gains on the ever-rising New York bourse. This all came crashing down in October of 1929. The aftermath of the oil shocks and the high interest rate mone- tary shocks of the 1970's, sometimes referred to as the Great Infla- tion, was all too similar to the 1920's. In place of the Versailles rep- arations burden on world productive investment, the world had the onerous burden of the IMF Third World debt \"restructuring\" process. The incredible rates of inflation during the early part of the 1980's, typically 12-17%, dictated the conditions of investment returns. A fast and huge gain was needed. Then the Reagan Administration's bizarre collection of \"free market\" economic conundrums were introduced, called \"Supply- Side economics\" by their advocates. The idea was a thin cover for unleashing some of the highest rates of short-term personal pro- fiteering in history, at the expense of the greater good of the country's long-term economic health. While policies imposed after October 1982 to collect billions from Third World countries brought a huge windfall of financial liquidity to the American banking system, the ideology of Wall"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"224 A CENTURY OF WAR Street, and Treasury Secretary Donald Regan's zeal for lifting the government \"shackles\" off financial markets, resulted in the great- est extravaganza in world financial history When the dust settled by the end of that decade, some began to realize that Reagan's \"free market\" had destroyed an entire national economy. It hap- pened to be the world's largest economy, and the base of world monetary stability as well. Based on the simple-minded, and quite mistaken, argument that removing the tax burden on the individual or company would allow them to release \"stifled creative energies\" and other entre- preneurial talents, President Ronald Reagan signed the largest tax reduction bill in postwar history in August, 1981. The bill con- tained provisions which also gave generous tax relief for certain speculative forms of real estate investment, especially commercial real estate. Government restrictions on corporate takeovers were also removed, and Washington gave the clear signal that \"any- thing goes,\" as long as it stimulated the Dow Jones Industrials stock index. By summer 1982, as the White House secured consent from Paul Volcker and the Federal Reserve for interest rate levels to begin a steady downward turn, the speculative bonanza was ready to go. The bankruptcy of a small oil and real estate bank, Penn Square Bank, in Oklahoma that spring, combined with the Mexico crisis to convince Volcker that it was time to ease up on his strangulation of the money supply. Between summer and December, the U.S. Fed- eral Reserve Discount Rate was lowered an extraordinary seven times, to a level 40% lower. The financial markets began to go wild. The reality of Reagan's \"economic recovery\" was that it did nothing to encourage investment in improving the technology and productivity of industry, with the small exception of a hand- ful of military aerospace firms, which got record government de- fense contracts. Instead, money went into speculation in real es- tate, into speculation in stocks, into oil wells in Texas or Colorado, all so-called \"tax shelters.\" As Volcker's interest rates went lower, the fever grew hotter. Debt was the new fashion. People reasoned it was \"cheaper\" to borrow today and repay tomorrow at lower interest levels. It didn't quite work. American cities continued their 20-year long decline, bridges fell in, roads cracked for lack of maintenance, new glass-enclosed shopping centers grew up, often sitting empty be- ll - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 225 cause some real estate developer could earn enough through ge- nerous tax writeoffs. A central feature of the Reagan Supply Side credo, echoing again Margaret Thatcher in Britain, was to identify trade unions as \"part of the problem.\" A British-style class confrontation was orches- trated, and the result was the cracking of the organized labor movement. Deregulation of government control over transportation was a central weapon of the policy. Trucking and airline transportation were \"set free.\" Non-union \"cut-rate\" airlines and trucking com- panies proliferated, often with low or no safety standards. Acci- dent rates climbed, wage-levels of union workers plunged. The Reagan \"recovery\" was turning young stock traders into multi- millionaires, apparently only by pushing a computer key. It was also reducing the skilled blue-collar workforce of the population into lower standards of living. No one in Washington paid much attention. After all, conservative Reagan Republicans argued, trade unions were, \"almost like communists.\" A 19th century Brit- ish-style \"cheap labor\" policy dominated official Washington as never before. By 1982, the once-powerful International Brotherhood of Team- sters was humbled into accepting a contract for three years with a virtual wage freeze, in a climate of economic gloom and truck- ing deregulation which encouraged non-union trucking. The United Auto Workers union, once one of the most advanced con- centrations of skilled American labor, accepted wage cuts in their negotiations with Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors in 1982. Steel unions and others followed with concessions, in a desperate attempt to secure benefits for older workers about to be pen- sioned, or to hold workplaces. Real living standards for the major- ity of Americans steadily decreased. Incomes of a minority rose as never before. Society was becoming polarized around income dif- ferentials. The new dogma of \"post-industrial society\" was preached from Washington to New York to California. No longer was America's economic prosperity linked to investment into the most modern industrial capacities. Steel was declared a \"rust- belt\" industry Steel plants were allowed to rust and blast furnaces were actually dynamited. Shopping centers, glittery new Atlantic City gambling casinos, and luxury resort hotels were \"where the money\" was."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"226 A CENTURY OF WAR During the speculative boom of most of the Reagan years, the money also flowed in from abroad to finance this wild spree. No one seemed to mind that, in the process, within five short years, by the mid-1980's, the United States had passed from being the world's largest creditor, to becoming a net debtor nation for the first time since 1914. Debt was \"cheap,\" and it grew geometrically. Families incurred record levels of debt for buying houses, cars, video recorders. Government incurred debt to finance the huge loss of tax revenue and the expanded Reagan defense buildup. Budget deficits under the Reagan \"recovery\" revealed the true underlying health of the U.S. economy. It was sick. By 1983, annual, Government deficits began to climb to the un- heard of level of $200 billion. The national debt expanded along with the record deficits, all paying Wall Street bond dealers and their clients record sums in interest income. Interest payments on the total debt of the U.S. government doubled in six years, from $52 billions in 1980 when Reagan was elected, to more than $142 billion by 1986, a sum equal to one-fifth of all government reve- nue. But despite such warning signs, money flowed in from Ger- many, Britain, Holland, and Japan, to take advantage of the high dollar and the speculative gains in real estate and stocks. To anyone with a sense of history, or a long memory, it was all too familiar. It had all happened during the \"Roaring '20's—until the 1929 market crash brought the roulette wheel to an abrupt halt. When storm clouds began to gather during 1985 on the U.S. eco- nomic horizon, threatening the future presidential ambitions of Vice President George Bush, once again it was oil which came to the rescue. But this time, in a very different way from the Anglo- American oil shocks of the 1970's. Washington apparently rea- soned, \"if we can run the price up, why can't we run it down when it's convenient to our priorities.\" Saudi Arabia was convinced to run a \"reverse oil shock\" and flood the depressed world oil market with its abundant oil. The price of OPEC oil dropped like a stone, to below $10 per barrel by spring of 1986, from an average of near $26 only some months ear- lier. Magically, Wall Street economists proclaimed the final \"vic- tory\" over inflation, while conveniently ignoring the role of oil in creating the inflation of the 1970's or in reducing it in the 1980's. Then, when the further fall in oil prices threatened to destabilize vital interests of the large British and American oil majors them- 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 227 selves, not merely small independent rival producers, George Bush made a quiet trip to Riyadh in March 1986, where he report- edly told King Fahd that he should stop the price war. Saudi Oil Minister Sheikh Zaki Yamani became the convenient scapegoat for a policy authored in Washington, and oil prices stabilized at a low level of around $14-16 per barrel. Texas and other oil-producing states were plunged into depression, but speculation took off in real estate elsewhere in the United States at a record pace. The stock market began a renewed climb to record highs. This 1986 oil price collapse unleashed what was comparable to the 1927-29 phase in the U.S. speculative bubble. Interest rates dropped even more dramatically. Money flowed in to make a \"kill- ing\" on the New York stock markets. A new financial perversion became fashionable on Wall Street, the Leveraged Buy-Out. With money costs falling and stock prices apparently ever- rising, and a Reagan Administration which promoted the religion of the \"free market,\" anything was allowed. A sound 100-year old industrial company which had been conservatively managed, producing tires, or machines or textiles, became a target for the new corporate \"raiders,\" as the Wall Street scavengers were called. Colorful per- sonalities such as T. Boone Pickens, Mike Milken, or Ivan Boesky, became billionaires on paper, as front men in the Leveraged Buy- outs. A new corporate management philosophy was proclaimed from august institutions such the Harvard Business School, to ra- tionalize this madness in the name of market \"efficiency.\" In a typical corporate Leveraged Buy-Out raid, a raider such as Boone Pickens would line up a promise of borrowed money to buy control of stock in a company many times his worth, such as Union Oil of California, or even Gulf Oil. His purchase of stock in the vic- tim company drove prices up. If he succeeded, he took over a huge company, almost entirely with borrowed money, which debt was then repaid, if all went well, by \"below investment grade\" bonds issued by the new debt-loaded company, appropriately known as \"junk bonds.\" If the company became bankrupt, the bonds were just so much \"junk\" paper. But in the 1980's, the stock market and real estate prices were climbing, so no one paid much attention to this risk. The Reagan tax reforms made it more \"profitable\" for a company to be saddled with huge debts than to issue stock equity. Interest rates paid by these \"junk bonds\" were very high to at- tract buyers. The \"sharks\", as these raiders were called, moved"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"228 A CENTURY OF WAR quickly to \"strip\" the assets of the new company, sell off the pieces for a quick profit, and run to the next victim corporation, like so many piranha fish. During the last half of the 1980's, such actions consumed Wall Street, pushed the Dow upwards, and driving cor- porations into the highest levels of debt since the 1930's depres- sion. But this debt was not undertaken to invest in modern tech- nology or new plant and equipment. It was a cancerous result of the financial speculation process permitted during the free market years of the Reagan and Bush administrations. Over the decade of the Reagan years, almost $1 trillion flowed into speculative real estate investment, a record sum, almost dou- ble the sums of previous years. Banks, desiring to secure their bal- ance sheets against troubles in Latin America, went directly into real estate lending for the first time, rather than traditional corpo- rate lending. Savings & Loan banks, established as separately regulated banks during the depression years to provide a secure source of long-term mortgage credit to family home-buyers, were \"deregu- lated\" in the early 1980's as part of Treasury Secretary Donald Regan's Wall Street \"free market\" push. They were allowed to \"bid\" for wholesale deposits, termed \"brokered deposits\" at a high cost. The Reagan Administration removed all regulatory re- straints in October 1982, with passage of the Garn-St. Germain Act. This Act allowed S&L banks to invest in any scheme they de- sired, with full U.S. Government insurance of $100,000 per ac- count guaranteeing the risk in case of failure. Prophetically, as he signed the new Garn-St. Germain Act into law, President Reagan enthusiastically told an audience of invited S&L bankers, \"I think we've hit the jackpot,\" using a Las Vegas gambling metaphor. This \"jackpot\" was the beginning of the col- lapse of the $ 1.3 trillion Savings & Loan banking system. The new law opened the doors of the S&L's to wholesale finan- cial abuses and wild speculative risks as never before. It also made S&L's an ideal vehicle for organized crime to launder billions of dollars from the growing business of cocaine and narcotics during the 1980's in America. Few noticed that it was tDonald Regan's former firm, Merrill Lynch, whose Lugano office was implicated in laundering billions of dollars of heroin mafia profits in the so- called \"Pizza Connection.\" 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 229 The wild and woolly climate of deregulation created an environ- ment in which normal, well-run savings banks were surpassed by fast-track banks which catered to dubious monies with no ques- tions asked. Banks laundered funds for covert operations of the CIA, as well as covert operations of the Bonano or other organized crime families—it was all the same thing. The son of the Vice President, Neil Bush, was a director of the Silverado Savings and Loan in Colorado, later indicted by the gov- ernment for illegal practices. Son Neil had the good taste to \"re- sign\" the week his father received the Republican nomination for president in 1988. 9 In order to compete with the newly deregulated banks and S&L's, the most conservative of all financial sectors, life insurance companies, began to go into speculative real estate in a major way during the 1980's. But unlike banks and S&L's, insurance compa- nies, perhaps because they had been so conservative in the past, had never been placed under national supervision. There was no national government insurance fund to protect policy holders of insurance companies, as there was for banks. By 1989, insurance companies were holding an estimated $260 billion of real estate on their books, an increase from some $100 billion in 1980. But by then, real estate was collapsing in the worst depression since the 1930's, forcing failures of insurance companies for the first time in postwar history, as panicked policy-holders demanded their money. The simple reality was that New York financial power had so overwhelmed all other national interests since the oil shocks of the 1970's, that almost no other voice was heard in Washington after the Mexico crisis of 1982. Debt grew by astonishing amounts. When Reagan won his election in late 1980, total private and pub- lic debt of the United States stood at $3,873 billion. By the end of the decade, it touched $10 trillions, or $10,000 billion. This meant an increased debt burden of more than $6,000 billion during this brief time span. 10 With the debt burden carried by the productive economy rising, and U.S. industrial plant and labor force deteriorating, the cumu- lative effects of two decades of neglect began to become manifest in wholesale collapse of vital public infrastructure of the nation. Highways cracked for lack of regular maintenance; bridges be- came structurally unsound and in many cases collapsed; in de- pressed areas, such as Pittsburgh, water systems were allowed to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"230 A CENTURY OF WAR become contaminated; hospitals in major cities fell into disrepair; housing stock for the less wealthy decayed dramatically. By 1989, the association for the construction industry, Associated General Contractors of America, estimated that a net investment of $3.3 trillion was urgently needed merely to rebuild America's crum- bling public infrastructure up to modern standards. No one in Washington listened. By 1990, the Bush Administration proposed \"free market\" private initiative to solve the problem. Washington was in a budget crisis. The unequal distribution of the benefits from the Reagan \"recovery\" was indicated by U.S. government figures on the number of Americans living \"below the poverty level.\" In 1979, when Paul Volcker began his monetary shock in the midst of the second oil crisis, the government recorded 24 million Americans under the poverty level, defined as $6,000 per year. By 1988, the figure had grown by more than 30%, to 32 million Amer- icans. Reagan-Bush tax policies concentrated wealth into a tiny elite, as never before in U.S. history. Since 1980, according to a study carried out by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee of Congress, real income for the top 20% increased a full 32%. Costs of American health care, a reflection of the strange combi- nation of \"free enterprise\" and government subsidy, rose to the highest levels ever, and, as a share of GNP, double that of the UK, yet 37 million Americans had no health insurance whatever. Health levels in large American cities, with impoverished ghettoes of black and hispanic unemployed, resembled that of a Third World country. This was supposed to be the world's most ad- vanced industrial nation. Thatcher's eleven-year rule in Britain produced equally disas- trous results. Real estate speculation and a vastly increased finan- cial services \"industry\" in the City of London, obscured the fact that Thatcher's economic policy severely discriminated against in- dustrial investment, and against modernization of the nation's de- teriorating public infrastructure such as railways and highways. The financial deregulation of the City of London in 1986, appro- priately termed, \"Big Bang,\" was among Thatcher's proudest \"ac- complishments.\" But by the end of the 1980's, everything was un- ravelling. Interest rates again climbed to double digits, industry went into a deep slump and later a depression worse than any since the war, while inflation rose to the level it had been at when Thatcher took office in 1979. 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 231 On its own terms, Thatcher economics had failed, as had its twin sister, Reagan economics. But the powerful oil and finance inter- ests of London and New York were not the least deterred. Their domain in this \"post-industrial\" imperium was global, not paro- chial. They demanded financial deregulation everywhere— Frankfurt, Tokyo, Mexico City, Paris, Milan, Sao Paolo. \"We'll get by with a little help from our friends...\" On October 19,1987, the bubble burst. On that day the prices on the Dow Jones Index traded at the New York Stock Exchange col- lapsed more than in any single day in history, by 508 points. The bottom had fallen out of the Reagan \"recovery.\" But the strategy of the Thatcher-Bush wing of the Anglo-Amer- ican establishment was still intact, and determined to insure that sufficient funds kept the bubble afloat until the new Bush presi- dency could impose the grand strategy for the century's end. While many comments have since been made about how the Oc- tober 1987 crash proved that a repeat of the 1930's depression was a thing of the past, it indeed signalled the beginning of the end of the deregulated financial speculation which had kept the Anglo- American Century afloat since the early 1970's. George Bush, facing a presidential election campaign the follow- ing November 1988, enlisted the efforts of his former campaign manager and close friend, Treasury Secretary James Baker, along with a powerful faction of the American establishment, to guaran- tee that, despite the implications of the October 1987 crash, foreign capital would continue to flow into U.S. bond and stock markets to keep the illusion of a Reagan-Bush economic recovery alive in the minds of a sufficient number of voters. Direct Washington appeals to the Japanese government of Prime Minister Nakasone, arguing that a Democratic Party president such as Gephardt would damage Japanese trade to the U.S., were successful. Nakasone pressed the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance to be accommodating. After October 1987, Japanese interest rates declined, making U.S. stocks and bonds as well as real estate appear more attractive. Billions of dollars flowed out of"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"232 A CENTURY OF WAR Tokyo into the United States. During 1988, the dollar remained strong, and Bush was able to secure his election against his Dem- ocratic opponent, Dukakis. To secure this support, Bush gave pri- vate assurances to senior Japanese figures that a Bush presidency would improve U.S.-Japanese relations. The Bush presidency was intended to be the first direct rule by an insider of the monied East Coast establishment since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the early 1940's. Bush's task was to steer the Amer- ican Century through its most dangerous waters since 1919. In his first weeks in office, he gave the appearance of decisiveness in tackling some of the nation's most urgent problems. Bush pro- posed a drastic reorganization of the nation's collapsing Savings & Loan system, and he used the popular outcry following a bi- zarre accident of the Exxon \"Valdez\" oil tanker to win approval for a radical series of punitive new laws which would make envi- ronmentalism a priority of the Presidency for the first time since Jimmy Carter. Both initiatives later turned out to be catastrophes, but the all-important appearance in the early months was that, un- like the aging Reagan, in George Bush, America finally had a pres- ident who was personally on top of world events. The actual plan of the new Bush Administration was to direct pressures on select U.S. allies for increased \"burden sharing\" to manage the huge U.S. debt burdens. The argument was put forth that the Soviet Union was collapsing and that, as a result, only one superpower remained with overpowering military might and size—the United States. In this situation, the argument was of- fered that Germany, Japan and other major economic and military allies of America should increase their financial support to main- tain this superpower. It was a thinly veiled rationale for blackmail. It soon became clear that Bush's appeal for a \"kinder and gen- tler America\" was little more than rhetorical appeal to an aging voting population. The Bush who occupied the White House moved quickly to establish his \"tough guy\" policies, creating a major media pretext for a military invasion of a tiny Central Amer- ican republic, Panama, during the Christmas days of his first year as President, in December 1989. According to eye-witness ac- counts, upwards of 6,000 Panamanians, mostly poor civilians, were killed when U.S. Special Forces and U.S. bombers invaded the small country on the pretext of arresting General Manuel No- reiga on charges of being a drug cartel kingpin. 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 233 Bush's Attorney General, Richard Thornburgh, who played such a controversial role as Governor of Pennsylvania during the events of the Three Mile Island nuclear incident, had formulated an incredible new U.S. doctrine. The Thornburgh Doctrine stipu- lated that the American FBI and Justice Department had authority to act on foreign territory, if deemed necessary, \"in the course of extraterritorial law enforcement.\" Translated, this meant that the U.S. government, by executive fiat, by claiming the pretext of tracking international narcotics or terrorist criminals, had de- clared its unilateral right to come into Germany, France, Panama or any other place it claimed necessary, without concern for the laws of the sovereign country involved. The invasion of Panama, as incredible as it was, produced a stony silence from the moral conscience of the civilized world. It was considered an American \"affair.\" By September 1989, CIA Director William Webster publicly un- veiled a bold new intelligence mandate for U.S. intelligence ser- vices. Pointing to the increasing signs that Gorbachev's Soviet Union was eager to reach mutual disarmament agreement with NATO and especially the United States, Webster told an elite gath- ering of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council on September 19 that year, that his CIA was re-tooling itself for new tasks in the post-Cold War era. Webster told his audience, \"economic issues I mentioned—trade imbalances and technological development— illustrate a point that is becoming increasingly clear: our political and military allies are also our economic competitors.\" The new mission of U.S. intelligence worldwide was economic espionage and other acts against key industrial \"allied\" nations, rather than hunting communist operations and subversion. The fall of a wall panics some circles Then, in November 1989, events in Eastern Europe took a most dramatic, and, to many in Washington and London, wholly unex- pected turn. Mikhail Gorbachev met privately with the old-guard Honecker communist leadership in East Germany, and more or less ordered them to give way to the enormous popular movement for freedom sweeping East Germany since that spring. Within"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"234 A CENTURY OF WAR weeks, the old order in the DDR was swept aside, in a genuine popular revolution. Moscow apparently realized that its efforts to maintain a costly and inefficient empire through force were doomed to backfire and cause its own destruction. The collapse of the world oil price in 1986 was perhaps the final fatal blow to Moscow's illusions that reform within the rotted communist bureaucracy could work. Soviet export earnings from its oil sales to the West, the major source of its hard currency earn- ings since the early 1970's, collapsed after 1986, just when popular demand for change prompted Gorbachev to promise far more than he was able to deliver. The economic chaos which ensued was the major factor motivating the Moscow leadership to cut ties with its Eastern Europe satellites of the Warsaw pact. Moscow hoped that a united Germany, under the strong economic direction of West Germany, could provide a suitable partner to help rebuild the collapsing Soviet system. While official Washington put on a face of public approval for the dramatic end to forty years of communist domination in East- ern Europe, privately, Bush, himself a former CIA director, whose view of world politics was shaped by the clandestine world of U.S. intelligence, was dead set against success of the revolution in East- ern Europe. In Britain, Margaret Thatcher's wing of the Tory party was equally alarmed at the prospect of what some there even called a \"German Fourth Reich.\" A well-placed British establishment voice, Peregrine Wors- thorne, editor of the influential London Sunday Telegraph, articu- lated the thoughts of the Thatcher fraction of conservative Tories towards the emerging new Germany. Worsthorne is the stepson of former Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman. Norman maintained personal ties with Hitler's Finance Minister, Hjalmar Schacht, during the war, and worked intimately with J.P. Morgan Bank in New York after 1919 to impose the Dawes reparations atrocities on defeated Germany. In his lead editorial titled, \"The Good German Problem\" on July 22, 1990, Worsthorne cynically recalled Montagu Norman. \"My stepfather, Montagu Norman, who as Governor of the Bank of England had done so much to help the German economy after the First World War, lived just long enough to see the earliest begin- nings of the German economic miracle.\" Worsthorne recalled Norman's comment shortly before his death: \"I always knew we 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 235 would beat the bad Germans; but I wish we could be so sure that we will do as well against the good Germans.\" Then Worsthorne came to his point. \"Let us assume that a united Germany is going to be a good giant, what then? Let us assume a united Germany teaches Russia to become a good giant, what then?...In truth, the threat could be more dangerous, rather than less. For how on earth can any effective defense be put up against a united Germany that intends to win by obeying the rules? Ger- many is going to be very powerful and, as Lord Acton taught us, power corrupts...Germany is marvellously well placed, at long last, to be the principle agent to bring Slavdom back into the com- munity of nations.\" It is worth noting that Worsthorne's Sunday Telegraph is owned by an Anglo-American holding, the Hollinger Corporation, on whose board are Dr. Henry Kissinger and former British Foreign Secretary Rupert Lord Carrington, also a business partner in Kissinger's New York consultancy firm, Kissinger Associates Referencing controversial comparisons by Thatcher govern- ment Trade Minister Nicholas Ridley, who was forced to resign for publicly comparing the Kohl government to Hitler's Reich, Worst- horne concluded his telling diatribe against the implications of a reunified Germany: \"Mr. Ridley was talking nonsense, but per- haps there was more method in his nonsense than is dreamt of...Perhaps Britain's role should be to preserve enough indepen- dence to be free, at the right moment, to make use of these grie- vances. In the course of doing good, Germany will make just as many enemies as ever it did in doing harm, and America may well be one of the enemies...Sooner or later it is going to be balance of power politics all over again. This could be an opportunity for Britain which, knows about the balance of power...\" That summer, according to London reports, the Thatcher gov- ernment formed a new unit of British intelligence to significantly upgrade its activities in Germany. Moreover, the Bush Adminis- tration moved to improve its ability to control developments in Germany. In a select Washington meeting in the spring of 1990 of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, former senior CIA official Theodore Shackley, the man previously involved in the de- stabilization of the Shah of Iran and the illegal Iran-Contra guns- for-drugs operations, told fellow American intelligence profes- sionals they should begin to recruit from disaffected former East"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"236 A CENTURY OF WAR German Stasi and related ranks and to build up U.S. intelligence assets in Berlin. The long-term implications of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the potential to modernize the under-developed economic potentials of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union around the emerging uni- fied Germany were alarmingly clear for policy strategists in Lon- don and New York. In a weekly report to investor clients, as well as the general financial community, David Hale, a U.S. economist with reported close ties to the Bush Treasury Department, warned in January 1990 of the strategic \"dangers\" for the U.S. financial markets if German unity were to succeed: \"One of the most ex- traordinary features of Wall Street economic research during re- cent weeks is its complacency about the potential consequences of eastern European economic developments for the global financial equilibrium which permitted America to borrow over a trillion dollars externally during the 1980's.\" Hale then noted, \"Indeed, when the financial history of the 1990's is written, analysts may look upon the fall of the Berlin Wall as a financial shock comparable to the long-feared Tokyo earth- quake. The destruction of the Wall symbolized an upheaval which could ultimately divert hundreds of billions of dollars in capital towards a region which had only been a minor factor in the world credit markets for six decades. Nor,\" concluded Hale, in a message he was reportedly asked to circulate by influential Washington cir- cles, \"should Americans take comfort from the fact that Germany itself has been only a modest investor in the U.S. during recent years. The biggest investor in the U.S. since 1987 has been Britain (over $100 billion of takeover bids) and the British could not have undertaken such large investments without access to surplus Ger- man savings.\" u On November 29,1989, days after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, highly professional assassins blew up the protected car of Deut- sche Bank head Alfred Herrhausen, a key adviser of the Kohl gov- ernment who had told the Wall Street Journal only days before of his plans for reconstruction of East Germany into Europe's most modern economic region within a decade. The assassination of Herrhausen was seen by knowledgeable Germans as a direct echo of the assassination more than sixty years earlier of Walther Rathenau, architect of the Rapallo plan to indus- trialize Russia with German industrial technology. But the Bonn 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 237 government proceeded with plans to unify Germany, and with discussions to assist the economic rebuilding of the collapsing So- viet economy as part of the terms for Moscow's agreeing to Ger- man unification. The German Chancellor addressed the nation that late Novem- ber about his dream of constructing a modern rail link connecting Paris, Hanover, and Berlin, on to Warsaw and finally to Moscow, as the foundation for the infrastructure of the emerging new Eu- rope. The old de Gaulle concept of a Europe economically cooper- ating from the \"Atlantic to the Urals,\" was suddenly a real pro- bability for the first time since 1948. In this climate, observers in the City of London noted a dramatic increase of French and British informal contacts, on the level of senior business and diplomatic persons. British strategy was to play on latent French fears of a strong Germany. Mitterrand, the Socialist French President with a life-long personal anglophile in- clination, was a ready listener. Britain began quietly to rebuild the old Dual Alliance of the pre-1914 era, and to set the stage for a new \"Entente Cordiale\" against the \"German threat.\" But the actual strategic battle was waged far from Central Europe. Sometime during 1989, the decision was made to make a bold offensive, using the Middle East and its vast oil reserves as the staging ground. Again, as during the 1970's, U.S. and British stra- tegists determined that the serious threat of an economically ex- panding Continental Europe must be countered through using the Anglo-American \"oil weapon.\" The form this would take was soon to astonish the entire world. Saddam: instrument for creation of The New World Order Senior circles of the Thatcher and Bush governments had deter- mined to create a pretext which would allow the U.S. and Britain to establish a direct military presence at the choke point of the world's, and especially Continental European petroleum supplies. The domestic economic and financial plight, both in Britain and the United States, added a special note of desperation to the plan during early 1990. Thatcher's economic \"revolution\" was rapidly"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"238 A CENTURY OF WAR collapsing after the October 1987 stock market debacle, and rising British interest rates forced the worst real estate, industrial, and banking crisis of the postwar period. In the United States, George Bush faced an out-of-control federal budget deficit, collapsing banks, soaring unemployment and an overall depression being privately likened by some inside the White House to the 1930's Great Depression. Iraq, a nation of 16 million people, emerged from eight years of a fruitless war against Iran which had accomplished little more than provide western arms manufacturers a vast dumping ground to maintain enormous arms sales to the Middle East. Washington had secretely encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Iran in 1980, falsely feeding him intelligence data indicating early success. By 1989, the economy of Iraq was a shambles and investment in in- dustry and agriculture was largely halted during the costly war, which cost an estimated one million or more lives on both sides. But Iraq, unlike Khomeini's Iran, emerged from the war with an enormous foreign debt burden. In 1988, she owed an estimated $65 billion to various creditors. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were owed a large part of this debt, as were the Soviet Union and coun- tries of Eastern Europe, which expected to be repaid in Iraqi oil. The remainder was owed largely to French, British, and American banks. France was Iraq's second largest supplier of arms after the USSR. The Anglo-American gameplan was to lure Iraq's Saddam Hussein into a trap he could not resist, in order to provide a pre- text for military intervention from the United States and Britain, professedly to secure world oil supplies. In June 1989, a top level delegation from an organization known as the United States-Iraq Business Forum, which included Alan Stoga from Kissinger Asso- ciates, senior executives of Bankers' Trust, Mobil Oil, Occidental Petroleum, and other large U.S. multinationals, came to Baghdad on the request of Saddam Hussein. He wanted to discuss an Iraqi postwar plan to develop his country's agriculture and industrial potential, Iraq had a five-year $40 billion plan to complete the large Ba- dush Dam irrigation project, which would have enabled Iraq to become self-sufficient in food production; at that time, Iraq de- pended on U.S. government Commodity Credit Corporation grain imports for as much as $1 billion worth of grain in 1989. In 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER  239  addition, Iraq proposed to the U.S. group major investments in building up its petrochemicals industry, agriculture fertilizer plants, an iron and steel plant, and an auto assembly plant as part of an effort to develop the country. The American businessmen told Saddam he must first restructure his foreign debts, and in re- turn agree to privatize Iraq's national oil resources, or a major por- tion of it. According to best British and American geophysical cal- culations, Iraq was perhaps the largest unexplored oil region in the world, with the possible exception of the Soviet Union. 12 Predictably, Saddam refused the American \"offer\" to surrender sovereignty over Iraqi petroleum in exchange for vague assu- rances on future loans. By late 1989, some $2.3 billion in Bush Ad- ministration-authorized credits for Iraq, which had been deliber- ately channeled through the Atlanta, Georgia subsidiary of the Italian Banco Nationale del Lavoro, were abruptly cut. The cutoff of credit followed a series of sensational allegations in the London Financial Times, which claimed that the monies were secretly being used by Iraq to build its war machine. The combined effect of the talks with the Stoga group and the BNL exposes was a total western bank credit cutoff to Iraq by early 1990. Into this critical situation, the Emir of Kuwait, an ally of Her Majesty's Foreign Office ever since the end of the last century, en- tered the picture. London and Washington had previously in- structed the Emir to funnel credits from Kuwait's vast oil revenues in order to keep Iraq from suing for peace during the Iran-Iraq eight year war. At that time, the cynical Anglo-American aim was to keep the Iran-Iraq war boiling at a stalemate, and to maintain a sufficient \"strategy of tensions\" to absorb large western arms de- liveries to both Iran and Iraq, as later scandals were to reveal. But, in early .spring of 1990, Kuwait's \"mission\" had changed. The Emirate was told to flood OPEC markets with oil, in violation of agreed OPEC production ceilings which had been agreed in order to stabilize world oil prices following the debacle of 1986-87. By the summer of 1990, Kuwait succeeded in drawing oil prices from their precarious level of some $19 per barrel down to little more than $13 per barrel. Repeated Iraqi diplomatic efforts and those of other OPEC members to persuade the Emir, Sheikh Al- Sabah, and the Oil Minister Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah to stop the delib- erate economic pressure on Iraq and other economically hard- pressed OPEC producers, fell on deaf ears. By that July, oil traders"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"240 A CENTURY OF WAR were predicting a repeat of 1986. Price levels below $10 per barrel were in sight. Iraq was not even able to service its old debt or fi- nance needed food imports. Already the previous February, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told fellow members of the Arab Cooperation Council in Amman Jordan, which included the presidents of those two countries plus Egypt and North Yemen, that the strategic implications of the col- lapse of the old communist order in Eastern Europe and the ap- parent emergence of the United States as the only military \"super- power,\" presented the Arab world with special dangers. With strong anxiety, Saddam pointed to the fact that, despite the clear end to the Iran-Iraq war one year earlier, U.S. military forces and warships in the Gulf had not shown any signs of pulling back. Instead, he noted with foreboding, \"the United States makes many statements that it is staying.\" He noted the increasing preoccupa- tion of the Soviet Union with its internal problems. \"When the So- viet Union is involved with its own internal affairs, the [Iran-Iraq] war has ended, no direct threat exists, and the United States espe- cially at this time is still repeating that it will stay, then this is some- thing that warrants attention.\" Saddam's conclusion in his remarks that February, was that Arab oil-wealthy countries should join forces and make use of their \"possession of an energy source unparalleled in the world...I think we should forge relationships with Europe, Japan, and the Soviet Union in a manner that will make us benefit from this ele- ment as soon as possible.\" 13 If any statement had stiffened the resolve in leading Anglo- American establishment circles to go ahead with plans for a dra- matic new Middle East military action, this speech of Saddam's was the one. On July 27,1990, when tensions between Iraq and Ku- wait over oil prices were at a peak, the U.S. Ambassador to Bagh- dad, April Glaspie, asked for a meeting with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to discuss the tense situation. According to official Iraqi transcripts of the exchange, later released by the Baghdad govern- ment and confirmed by U.S. Congress almost a year later, Glaspie told Saddam that Washington would not take a position on the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait. Less than one week later, Iraqi forces occupied Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti Al-Sabah Royal family fled well in advance, able to escape with their Rolls Royces, their gold, and other valuables, because, according to one bitter former 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 241 Kuwaiti government official in exile in Europe, \"the CIA informed the Royal family in good time to get out, but the Al-Sabah's 'conveniently' forgot to inform the country's military of their in- formation that Kuwait was about to be invaded.\" Within hours of the Kuwait occupation, the Bank of England and the U.S. Government acted to freeze all Kuwaiti assets held in what is believed to be the world's single largest investment fund, the Kuwait Investment Office, based in London. Its total asset portfolio is kept secret, but was reliably reported well beyond $100-150 billion in value. What followed during the ensuing six months was one of the most cynical, calculated acts of recent history. Despite initial claims backed by Thatcher's British government, that the United States, would merely send military forces to defend Saudi Arabia against alleged Iraqi invasion threat (threats later revealed to have been fabricated in Washington), President Bush, who was together with Thatcher during the initial hours of decision in early August (appropriately at Aspen, Colorado), proclaimed what he soon re- ferred to as his \"New World Order.\" On September 11, Bush declared, \"Out of these troubled times a New World Order can emerge, under a United Nations that per- forms as envisioned by its founders. We stand at a unique and ex- traordinary moment. This crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers us a rare opportunity to move toward an historic pe- riod of cooperation. Today that New World Order is struggling to be born. A world quite different from the one we've known.\" Further evidence that George Bush and Margaret Thatcher never intended anything other than a military \"solution\" to the Iraq-Ku- wait crisis was given in the personal account of Soviet Special Mid- dle East Envoy,, Yevgeni Primakov, some months later. In an exten- sive personal interview published in Time magazine March 4,1991, some days after the end of the devastating bombardment of Iraq, Primakov, personal envoy of Soviet President Gorbachev, re- counted his meeting in Baghdad in the early days of October, 1990, with Saddam Hussein and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. Primakov was convinced that war \"could have been averted.\" Primakov re- counted for Time his subsequent mediation mission to Washington, where he met with George Bush, Secretary Baker and other top of- ficials at the White House October 19. The Moscow envoy reported that Bush listened with apparent interest, but that some hours later"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"242 A CENTURY OF WAR he sent the clear message to Primakov that Washington was not interested in exploring the new opening further. As he was about to leave Washington, Primakov received in- structions to stop over in London to deliver the same report to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Primakov's account was re- vealing. \"The Prime Minister received us at her country residence, Chequers. She listened attentively to the information I presented her, without interrupting. But then, for a good hour, she allowed no one to interrupt her monologue, in which she outlined in a most condensed way a position that was gaining greater momentum: not to limit things to a withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait but to inflict a devastating blow at Iraq, 'to break the back' of Saddam and destroy the entire military, and perhaps industrial potential of that country.\" After months of careful bribing and pressuring of key member nations of the United Nations Security Council, Arab states, Tur- key and other nations, to impose not only total economic embargo against Iraq, but to authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait, Bush told the U.S. Congress on January 29,1991, in his State of the Union address, \"The world can therefore seize the opportunity of the present Persian Gulf crisis to fulfill the long-held promise of a New World Order...\" But, as the largest military buildup since the Vietnam War con- tinued in Saudi Arabia, preparing for offensive saturation bomb- ing of Iraq in the early days of January 1991, more than a few in- formed voices inside the Washington establishment began to voice grave doubts as to the ultimate wisdom of Bush's clear military in- tent. In a November 12,1990, television interview, former Reagan Administration Navy Secretary, James H. Webb, declared, \"The purpose of our presence in the Persian Gulf is to further the Bush Administration's New World Order, and I don't like it.\" Webb again took the occasion of a January 31 Wall Street Journal commentary some ten weeks later to state, \"The Bush Administra- tion aided by editorial onslaughts from many sides...has relent- lessly maneuvered our nation into a war. One must reach back to William Randolph Hearst urging us into the Spanish-American War to find a parallel to the editorial pressure that preceded our present conflict. One must go even further, perhaps to the Mexi- can War, to find a president so avidly desirous of putting the na- tion at risk when it has not been attacked.\" 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER  243   Former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, James Akins, a re- spected Washington expert on Middle East affairs, also came out publicly against the Bush war plan against Iraq. Akins pointed out, in a signed article published in the Los Angeles Times of Sep- tember 12, only days after Bush's decision to send U.S. troops to \"defend\" Saudi Arabia against threatened Iraqi invasion, that the White House had an \"ulterior motive.\" Akins charged that U.S. Defense Secretary Cheney had deliberately misled Saudi King Fahd on the danger of such invasion in order to be allowed to sta- tion U.S. troops on Saudi soil, something fiercely resisted by the Saudis for decades. In 1975 Akins related, plans to find a pretext to send U.S. troops to occupy vital Mideast oil fields were encour- aged by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He noted that Kis- singer, then Akins' superior, had opposed Akins adamant attacks on such ideas. \"Henry Kissinger, then U.S. Secretary, had another view, and my career in the Foreign Service did not extend much beyond that point...There are those in the Bush Administration who will point out that conditions are more propitious now than in 1975...\" Notably, in 1990, Lawrence Eagleburger, former President at Kis- singer Associates, was Deputy Secretary of State under James Baker, and former Kissinger employee Brent Scowcroft, was Bush's White House National Security Adviser during this period. The Kissinger view was dominant in formulation of U.S. foreign policy during the Gulf war buildup. Furthermore, Kissinger edi- torially called for war against Iraq in this period. The domestic voices of opposition were effectively drowned out by the President's war mobilization in the media. The real target: an independent Europe and Japan Within a brief period, it became clear to thinking people in Eu- rope and elsewhere that George Bush, indeed, had quite another objective than merely defending U.S. or even Western oil interests in Saudi Arabia. Bush's incredibly vulgar public pronouncements, taunting Saddam Hussein, and comparing Iraq's President to \"a modern-day Adolf Hitler,\" were made quite deliberately."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"244 A CENTURY OF WAR Washington and London unleashed an unprecedented propa- ganda and pressure offensive against Iraq's Western supporters during the war and its six month long buildup, but not against the Soviet Union or France, which were the major suppliers of Iraq's armaments. The target was Germany more precisely, German high-technology industry vital for the reconstruction of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. France and the USSR, which, to- gether with China, the U.S. and Britain, comprised the five Perma- nent Members of the UN Security Council, had agreed to vote with Washington and Britain for going to war after the ultimatum dead- line of January 17. Their role in Iraq was discreetly ignored by var- ious Washington-linked exposes. Instead, through channels directly linked to British and Ameri- can intelligence, Hamburg's Der Spiegel and influential Republi- can Senators such as Jesse Helms, began an all-out offensive against Germany, alleging that German technology exports of what were dubbed \"dual use\" technologies had enabled Saddam's military to fire Soviet Scud missiles on Israeli targets. In one of many tragic footnotes to the history of the war, the Lon- don Times reported on February 6, some three weeks into the Op- eration Desert Storm bombings of Iraq, that the \"Berlin-Baghdad railway, once a thriving network has been devastated in the Gulf war. The relentless allied bombing of Iraqi bridges, junctions and marshalling yards leaves in ruins one of the few extensive railway networks in the Middle East,\" they noted, adding, with under- statement, \"The old Berlin-Baghdad railway was a focus of strate- gic rivalry between Britain and Germany.\" A stunned Bonn Government, itself in the midst of the complex- ities of dealing with reunification of the former East Germany, was forced do divert precious time, attention, and financial resources from that pressing task, to focus on George Bush's and Thatcher's New World Order. In late January, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker went on one of the most high-pressure financial fund-rais- ing missions in history, extracting pledges from Germany, Japan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to guarantee a total of $54.5 billion to pay the costs of what was called Operation Desert Storm. After the conclusion of fighting, a former U.S. Assistant Secre- tary of Defense in the Reagan administration, Lawrence J. Korb, revealed, in an early April press conference in Washington, that the U.S. Government deliberately hid actual Gulf war costs in 11 - IMPOSING THE NEW WORLD ORDER 245 order to offset domestic budget cuts, by using Allied contributions in an \"off-budget\" fund. Informed estimates were that the United States had come out of the entire Gulf war affair with a net \"profit\" of perhaps $19 billion, when all allied war contributions were counted. The huge inflows of foreign money during the first months of 1991, with $6.6 billion paid in cash by Germany, created a strong upward pressure on the U.S. dollar, which only weeks be- fore had fallen to an all-time postwar low of D-Mark 1.44. Also, aggressive U.S. arms contracts with Mideast countries began to be signed before the war had ended, much to the anger of European arms makers. The Bush administration triumphantly proclaimed that America had proven itself the strongest power in the world. His boast rang hollow to those at home standing in ever longer unemployment lines, or those in Eastern Europe denied the prospect of needed bil- lions of western capital to rebuild infrastructure and modernize their economies. Eastern European economies were devastated by the combined impact of the Gulf Operation Desert Storm, and the immense in- crease of world oil prices during late 1990 to above $30 per barrel, caused by the disruption of agreed oil deliveries from Iraq. For- merly, before January 1991, the countries of Eastern Europe, through their trade ties with the Soviet Union, paid their needed oil import bills in a form of barter trade of industrial and agricultural goods to Moscow. January 1, that system came to an end and west- ern dollars were needed to buy Russian oil. Iraq had over $1 billion in oil committments to Bulgaria, Hungary, and other countries of the east which became unpayable as a result of the Gulf war. In March 1990, the Italian magazine, 30 Days interviewed an Ital- ian professor, with ties to Washington, Gianfranco Miglio. Miglio told the journal, \"The U.S. saw that to avoid falling into a decline similar to that of the Soviet Union, it had to keep pace with poten- tial adversaries of the future. They include Japan and the Conti- nent of Europe united around German economic power...The United States could not accept the idea of Europe as it is today, a Continent that not only can manage quite happily without Amer- ica, but one which is economically and technologically more pow- erful.\" For this reason, Miglio declared, \"The Americans turned their attention on the Middle East, on gaining control of the Arab oil tap on which Japan and Germany depend.\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"246   A CENTURY OF WAR From France, Charles de Gaulle's former Minister of Agricul- ture, Edgar Pisani, head of the \"Institut du Monde Arabe\" in Paris, told a German interviewer in die Tageszeitung on February 18, dur- ing the height of the bombing by U.S. British and French planes of Iraq: \"I wish it were not so. I am deeply shocked over the fact, that a nation is powerful only because it has the weapons. The U.S.A, which in its economic affairs has extreme difficulties, has managed to silence Japan and Europe, because they are militarily weak. How long will the world accept that various countries must pay one Gendarme to enforce their own World Order. Japan, Germany and the oil-rich states finance this Gendarme...\" In a clear, if veiled reference to the tragic follies of these British- led balance of power politics, German President Richard von Weizsacker told the Berlin daily, Der Tagesspiegel shortly after the Gulf war, \"We have earlier had the policy of balance of power of European nations, which ended in the perversion of National So- cialism and resulted in two world wars. Then came the time of dominance by the two Superpowers.\" Von Weizsacker made an appeal for Europe to take advantage of the unique chance to fi- nally end such balance of power follies, through realizing the \"un- fulfilled vision of de Gaulle, for a Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.\" Operation Desert Storm and the Bush-Thatcher Gulf war did in- calculable damage to Iraq and its people, to Kuwait, and to the world economy, but there were signs that it had not accomplished its prime objective of reimposing Continental Europe back into George Bush's and Margaret Thatcher's New World Order.

As a consequence of the unprecedented actions by the Bush Administration in the Persian Gulf, Washing- ton has proclaimed the emergence of what it terms a \"unipolar\" world, in which it is claimed that the United States has decisively demonstrated its awesome military might. But behind the clearing smoke of the Gulf war, certain very significant changes in the world had begun to suggest themselves. Already by 1992, George Bush was in many respects alone. One major casualty of the Gulf war was his close ally, British Prime Minister Thatcher. A consensus of the British establishment, in- cluding the most powerful elements in the financial houses of the City of London and the Foreign Office establishment, determined that Thatcher must go, and, at the end of November, when it was clear that George Bush was determined to execute a military reso- lution of the Iraqi situation, her Tory colleagues voted her out and voted in a man, said in London's more elite circles to be the new choice simply because he was \"all things to all men.\" A smiling John Major did all the appropriate diplomatic things, uttered all the words of support for Bush's war effort, but, as time passed, some pointed to subtle shifts in the British relation to America. Other changes had occured as well. The economies of the Eng- lish-speaking world were sinking deeper into the worst economic depression since the 1930's. Thatcher's \"revolution\" had proven itself a horrible failure, and Britain was again \"the sick man of Eu- rope\" as unemployment passed 2,300,000, on the way to the level of a decade earlier, when Thatcher took office. While President Bush groomed himself for his self-appointed role as the world's maximum leader, his own domestic economic base was dramatically deteriorating. Private economists began to POSTSCRIPTUM 249 document clear instances of political manipulation of U.S. govern- ment economic data, to hide the real extent of the crisis, perhaps a desperate bid by Bush and his administration to get past the all- important November 1992 presidential elections. By the early summer, however, even the White House was forced to release es- timates, required by law, which showed an expected deficit in the federal U.S. budget for the coming fiscal year of at least $348 bil- lions. In 1989, Bush's first year in office, it was less than half that, or $153 billion. Two factors were cited for this alarming rise—the catastrophic costs of the de facto nationalization of the nation's Savings & Loan system, and the collapse of government tax reve- nues from the weakening economy. More alarming to informed insiders in the White House and on Wall Street, was the grim prospect for further drawing in of the world's savings and flight capital, to finance such enormous lev- els of debt. The bilateral relations with Japan, which seemed to have worked so well during the 1980's, dramatically changed by the summer of 1991. Japan itself was in the throes of a deep inter- nal battle to clean their financial system of what Japanese referred to as \"Wall Street financial methods.\" Japan was no longer willing nor able to continue the generous levels of investment into U.S. debt. Moreover, Germany, a second major source of U.S finance, was absorbed in the significant costs of internal reconstruction of its new eastern half. And increasingly, London banks, under the depression and growing fears of the disastrous risks in U.S. mar- kets, began to turn from the United States. The time-bomb on the world's largest debtor nation was ticking loudly. Politically, Washington had made much in respective interna- tional gatherings of its vaunted military might, but more than one seasoned European diplomat privately thought the boast more than hollow. U.S. military forces indeed, controlled the region con- taining some 60% of total world untapped petroleum reserves. The Persian Gulf had become, for the moment, an \"American lake.\" But in the Middle East itself, as Mideast veteran diplomats had warned again and again, Washington had unleashed untold chaos and instability, the ultimate consequences of which will not be clear for months or perhaps years. For its part, Western Europe was also a vastly changed place, in many ways dramatically worse. More than a full year of precious lime had been lost from the urgent necessity of transforming the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"250 A CENTURY OF WAR economies of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The Gulf war, as was its purpose, had shifted the agenda to the one defined by the Anglo-Americans, and away from the rebuilding of Europe. Contrary to the ominous warnings of David Hale that billions would flow out of the U.S. into Eastern Europe, the reality was that lack of sufficient clarity from governments of western Europe on the central role of public infrastructure—modern rail, energy, tele- communications, highways, ports—and the intervention of the Gulf war demands of Washington and London, had helped plunge the unstable economies of all Eastern Europe including the USSR, into their worst economic crisis in perhaps the entire post- war period. During 1990, western private banks began to cut their exposure to eastern Europe. In the aftermath of the Gulf war, France found herself in a posi- tion hauntingly reminiscent of the early 1920's after Versailles. Once again she had allowed her irrational antipathies for her Ger- man neighbor to override French national interest Anglo-Ameri- can circles skillfully maniputated the weaknesses of Francois Mit- terrand's regime, offering behind-the-scene support for French ob- jectives in reducing German influence in Europe, in exchange for French ceding of major strategic assets and relations in Africa and the Middle East. Had this strategy not succeeded in securing French adherence to the support Bush's New World Order and the UN Security Council, the war could most likely have been pre- vented. French relations with Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, and other areas of the Muslim world were seriously undermined, as she came to resemple the former 19th century colonial France of Fa- shoda more than the France of General de Gaulle. In the Middle East itself, the countries which had joined to sup- port Washington's military action in Operation Desert Storm found themselves far worse off. An estimated five million persons had been displaced in vast forced migrations of Kurds, Syrians, Jordanians, Iranians, Pakistanis, Indians and Yemenis as a direct result of the Gulf war. Egypt, which was offered generous Ameri- can debt forgiveness in return for its support of the alliance against Iraq, found, instead of economic improvement, that Washington's debt forgiveness for past debts was conditional on Egypt's agree- ing to severe IMF-imposed domestic austerity. The Gulf War and Operation Desert Storm succeeded in creating enormous difficulties for Europe, both Western Europe and, most POSTSCRIPTUM 251 especially, the emerging economies of Eastern Europe. A second event however, brought to detonation in June 1991, added enor- mously to the difficulties of creating an orderly transformation of the economies of Central Europe. In late June, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker arrived in Belgrade on what was misleadingly labelled a \"mediation mission\" to prevent dissolution of the Yugo- slav state into various federal republics. Baker refused to meet with leaders of Croatia and Slovenia. He publicly declared that Washington would never recognize the in- dependence or sovereignty of any part of Yugoslavia. Predictably, the Baker mission lit the fuse to the smoldering Yugoslav conflict, and provided the Serbian forces of Slobodan Milosevic needed international backing to launch their brutal march towards an im- perial \"Greater Serbia.\" The effect of the tragic and bloody war in Croatia was to further weaken confidence in the prospects for Eastern European eco- nomic transformation among western investors, and to bring the German economy and German Mark under pressure. The net short-term beneficiary was, of course, Washington and the U.S. dollar, portrayed by leading London and New York investment houses such as Morgan Stanley as a \"safe haven\" against the grow- ing turmoil in Eastern Europe. Again, as some eight decades ear- lier when England cultivated its relations with Serbia to ignite the destructive series of Balkan Wars in 1910-14, Serbia was used by leading Anglo-American policy circles as the pivot-point to desta- bilize Central Europe and, most especially, German economic de- velopments. However, experienced European, military experts insist that the devastation that has occuured in the Balkans since the summer 1991 would riot have been possible had these Anglo-Americans not had the active or at least passive complicity of Russian intelli- gence networks. It seemed, democratic rhetoric aside, that certain people in Moscow were unwilling to break with their imperial past. While the scale of the difficulties, particularly for the reconstruc- tion of eastern Europe, had increased dramatically as a result by the end of 1991, the possibilities of significant change, however, were not entirely gone. A strong attack began to emerge from Austrian and German circles who explicitly denounced the madness of the economic \"shock therapy\" model of Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"252 A CENTURY OF WAR the International Monetary Fund, applied against the struggling economies of eastern Europe. Some who knew what Western Eu- rope had done to create one of the most successful economic recon- structions in history after World War II, began to contrast the Anglo-American \"free market\" problems of England and the U. S. to what was actually required in Eastern Europe. The almost for- gotten name of Friedrich List began to be mentioned again. One encouraging sign of a serious response to the task of econom- ically rebuilding the Soviet economy came from a series of meetings held over the spring and summer including a gathering in Brussels in July to discuss a proposal put forth by the Dutch Prime Minister for an East-West \"European Energy Charter.\" The private view of Continental European policy circles in the wake of the American Gulf \"shock,\" was that they must develop significant alternative to energy supplies from the American-controlled Gulf petroleum fields, or face ultimate political and economic blackmail well into the next century. The vast unexplored Soviet oil and gas reserves, and the available west European industrial technology, were the seeds of an obvious solution for both parties. Bush himself, projecting ever the image of an \"in control\" Pres- ident, was showing the strains by the summer. Revelation of an acute thyroid problem, which had demonstrable psychological overtones, undercut Bush's stature at the moment of \"victory.\" A seemingly continuous series of small \"scandals\" began to come to the surface, one so serious as to warrant a formal U.S. Congres- sional inquiry into allegations that Bush had personally dealt with top Iranian government representatives in an illegal deal just be- fore the 1980 elections to \"buy\" a delayed release of U.S. embassy hostages until after that year's presidential elections. The hostage issue was credited as one major factor in the defeat of Carter by the Reagan-Bush candidacy that year. Other allegations began to sur- face as well, including hints that the Bush administration had blocked full investigation into the fraud-ridden BCCI bank, be- cause U.S. secret intelligence operations were using the bank as a major financing vehicle. The brothers of the president, Jonathan and Prescott, as well as his son, Neil, began to come under public scrutiny. Slowly, almost drop-by-drop, it seemed that certain pow- erful establishment circles had decided that Bush, like Thatcher, had outlived his usefulness. In Britain, since Thatcher's ignominious defeat, the political cli- POSTSCRIPTUM 253 mate had begun to alter in profound, if little-appreciated ways. In- formed City of London insiders noted that the majority of the Brit- ish establishment, the same combination of forces which had en- gineered the ultimate downfall of Margaret Thatcher, had come to the conclusion that the strategic \"interest\" of British power no longer lay in its long-standing American \"special relationship,\" but rather in a Continental European alliance strategy. They apparently calculated that their alliance partner, America, was beyond salvation, and would not be the reliable foundation of future British balance of power policies as it had been since 1914. As one commentator noted the cynical view prevailing in this Brit- ish political and financial establishment, \"a successful parasite must always think of where he can find the next healthy host.\" By 1990, a growing majority of the British establishment had appar- ently decided to throw their energies into alliances in Continental Europe, not to support, but rather, to shape and dominate the emerging policy. For this, Germany was seen to be the key target. On January 20, 1993, George Bush too left Washington, and America's first Democratic President since 1976, Gov. Bill Clinton, had taken the oath of office. Even before his inauguration, Presi- dent-elect Clinton had been forced by pressures from powerful Wall Street financial interests largely to abandon his campaign promises of an industrial and infrastructure renaissance for Ame- rica's collapsing economy. His selection of a key member of the Wall Street establishment to head a new White House Office of Na- tional Economic Security was an ominous indication of who would set priorities in the new Washington administration.

First it was acid rain, then the ozone hole. Now, C0 2 in the air is sup- posed to bring on a climate catastrophe. Is global warming a threat, are the polar ice caps in danger of melting, and are coastal areas of habitation under threat of a deluge? Do we therefore need an energy- CO z tax? The author explains in straight-forward language what climatologi- cal research indicates about the following questions: • What is and how does the greenhouse effect work? What does that mean for life on earth? • Why is a rise in temperature feared? • How and for what reasons has climate changed over the centuries and what role was played by the greenhouse effect? • What do we really know about the effect of a growing concentra- tion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and what do current com- puter programs make out of that? • How do plants and algae cope with increased CO z and temperature through photosynthesis? Gerd Weber was born in 1952. He studied meteorology and climato- logy at the Free University of Berlin, Germany, received an M.S. at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in Meteorology and did his doctorate thesis at Max Planck Institute for Aeronomics in 1985. Since then he has worked as a consultant and climatologist at the Hard Coal Association in Essen, Germany. His interest in nature goes back to his boyhood when he helped out on the family orchard, where he continues to assist in his spare time in the care of two hundred sta- tely old apple trees. orders/payments/customer service Paul & Company c/o PCS Data Processing, Inc. 360 West 31st St., New York, NY 10001 Tel.
