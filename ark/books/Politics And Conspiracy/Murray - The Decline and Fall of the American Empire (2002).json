This book, however, is a serious attempt to show the parallels of the two empires: Rome and United States of America. Gibbon 1 did not cover the rise of the empire in his book. I also will not dwell on the rise of the empire. I will concentrate on its decline. A coincidence however, does seem to exist with Gibbon’s epic. Gibbon began writing his Decline in 1776, the same year America was born. Gibbon had the hindsight of a millennium and a half of history with which to ga uge his book. I, on the other hand, have merely the record of contemporaneous history in which to make my observations. I hesitate to compare this book with Gibbon’s epic work for fear of being branded an egoist. I am however, an unaba shed egoist and must suffer my fate. Gibbon’s work is nevertheless a masterpiece of re- search and diligence, whereas this book is a collection of observations and extrapolations ... Hardly the gender of the master. Gibbon relied heavily on the written works of the noble Romans, and was justly rewarded. The volumes he searched were liberally sprinkl ed with, what is now termed, propaganda. Those nobles were loath to soil their memories with the truth. Gibbon, however, was able to sift the wheat from the chaff. He used post contemporaneous accounts written by counter-historians.   1 If you are unacquainted with Gibbons seven volume The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , let me save you a bit of time. I have kept a set in my library since 1955. It is a great sleep inducement. Historically correct, completely literate, and failing to stir the casual reader’s juices. I hope my own work will not be footnoted in a like manner."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Page ii Gibbon attacked his work as an historian adding few comments. This work examines sociological, psychologi- cal, anthropological, political a nd economical bases for the fall with numerous comments and footnotes. America’s contemporaneous history is rife with fic- tional tales of America’s greatne ss and its patriots. Let us also attempt to separate the wh eat from the chaff. A point toward this effort: Benedict Arnold. Americans widely be- lieve Benedict was a traitor. However, at the time, he was a subject of King George III. Would he not be a traitor to the (legitimate) government by becoming a rebel? What if the rebels (now renamed: revolutionaries) lost? Would not George Washington be branded as the traitor? The winning side writes history. It is not up to us to find which history is correct. Some historian, one or two thousand years, in the future will do it for us. In 1973, if you were to believe history, Nixon was an honorable man. In the short intervening years, history has been revised. This is a remarkable example of short time historical revision. This is due to the ease of modern communication. I will return to this theme: modern com- munication. Not all history is so eas ily reversed. Still, there are thousands of recent examples such as this. This book will not become a platform for political diatribe, endlessly repeating what is already know n or sensed. This book in- tends to dwell on the scenario of the fall not the personali- ties behind it. There're too many to notice nevertheless re- port. To be sure, personalities will emerge. They will be illustrative of a situation not a reproach of an individual. After all, even great leaders are individuals. And individu- als are fallible."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Page iii As the Romans were fond of telling their heroes : “Sic transit gloria mundi.” This (worldly) glory passes. Roman history proves it. Rome is not alone, ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Persia, all have found: Gloria transit . Rome had its come- uppance. So did Egypt, Greece, Persia and the rest. Some say America is due for a comeuppance. Are we witnessing it today? Unless you are totally blind or live on a desert is- land, the answer is clearly: yes. Unwilling as I am to come to terms with the come- uppance, I find it as inevitable as the next sunset. Babylon lasted four thousand years, ancient Egypt lasted three thousand, and Rome lasted about a thousand. America has lasted, so far, tw o hundred and twenty. It can be concluded that an empire’s lifetime is inversely propor- tional to the date the empire began. The earlier the empire, the longer it lasts."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Page iv -3500 -3000 0 1600 1800 1937 S1 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Duration in Years Start of Empire, 0=CCE Length of Empire v.

A person can calculate where England falls in this system. Aside from a little piece of Ireland, England is no longer an empire. Using England as an example and a little extrapola- tion, it is easy to calculate when America will implode. But, that is not the object of this book. This book uses intrinsic and empirical evidence to show the decline of America, not a simple time line algorithm. An empire generally evolves from a country or a federation of states, goes through an expansion, becomes an empire and then ... the inevitable decline and fall. The re- sulting mess left from a fall usually leaves a period of de- cay. Such was the dark ages after the fall of Rome. The recent fall of the Soviet Empire is just now resulting in a bleak period in the Russias. The people of the country left behind after a fall do not resemble the original imperial citi- zenry. Just as the Italians bear no resemblance to the Ro- mans, nor the modern Egyptians to the ancient Egyptians, the remnant American will bear no similarity to the found- ing fathers of America. If you doubt this, look around America. Today. What does this mean? Statistically speaking, em- pires are dead. Empirically 4 speaking, America is dying, perhaps dead. The mess is yet to come. Gibbon, perhaps without realizing it, predicted the fall of England. Had he dared to write about England’s de- cline during King George’s re ign, there would be little men-   3 The Third Reich does not fit the mold because it never went through a period of expansion following a successful war, but it does fit the datum. 4 Pun intended."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Page vi tion of his epic work about Ro me or Gibbon either.

No, he was purely an historian. I will not use Swiftian metaphors in this book. I will speak from first hand authoritative knowledge. I will tell what everyone knows, and nobody says. I will speak politi- cally incorrect(ly). It is interesting to note how often an idea gains rec- ognition once it is publicly aired.

The title of this chapter is not a question. It is a statement. Without doubt, Rome was glorious during all of its stages. And Rome went th rough all of the stages of the generation of empire. The early times are called the Republic; the latter times are the days of Empire. Let us concentrate on the lat- ter days and the cause of the decline and fall. Let us draw a parallel between those days of Roman decline and the times surrounding us in America today. Gibbon took seven volumes to detail the decline and fall. I propose to summarize that episode in one chapter. I will skip six or so centuries of Roman history from the founding of Rome by the twins, Romulus and Remus 5 , until just after the ascension of the dictators 6 . No, the dicta-   5 An historical coincidence: Romulus was a co-founder of Rome in 753 B.C . (traditional date) and another Romulus (Augustulus) was the last Western Roman Emperor 475-476 A.D. (historical date). The empire splits into two pieces East and West in 395 A.D. If a firm date must be affixed, the actual date of the end of the Roman Empire is 476, when Odoacer, a German warlord deposed Ro mulus, the last of the Western Roman Emperors. Thus began the dark ages. 6 Hitler and Mussolini were not the first dictators. The dictators of Rome included many famous textbook names: the Caesars. Julius, Au- gustus, Tiberius, Nero, Caligula, Cladius ... beyond the fall of Rome itself and into the Holy Roman Empire. See appendix A for a complete list."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Page 2 tors did not cause the fall of Rome. They, if anything, forged a greater Empire. However, in their rush to extend the Empire, they took shortcuts. Every empire before and after the dictators has taken these shortcuts. The stirrings of decline begi n at the close of the first century anno domine . The dictators gained and maintained power by force of arms. However, Roman law forbade the encampment of an army in the city of Rome. The dictator made use of a palace guard called the Praetorian Guard. In contravention of the law, the dictator used the Praetorian Guard as his private army. To fit the law, it wasn’t called an army, it was called a guard. On many occasions the Praetorians chose the emperor without regard to process of law. The old emperor, quite often, was assassinated by the Praetorians and the new empero r was selected by the Prae- torians. Needless to say, the Praetorians were suitably re- warded by the newly chosen successor 7 . I don’t necessarily propose that these dictators are analogous to any of America’s elected officials. But I do mean to show that a Praetorian Guard of sorts exists today in America. This thinly disguised guard is euphemistically dubbed with letters of the alphabet. I refer to those groups who serve at the convenience of their masters. I submit that large numbers of these personal lackeys are used to insulate America’s elected officials from their electorate. It was po- litely disregarded when Secret Service Agents acted as pro- curers for President Kennedy’s bedroom. It was also disre- garded when IRS Agents acted as Nixon’s Praetorians to get even with those on his enemy's list. It wasn’t until one of   7 except for one injudicious emperor who forgot to pay off the troops and was promptly assassinated by them."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 3 Nixon’s own Praetorians marked him for oblivion that this episode even became public knowledge. The further we go into the twentieth century, the more blatant are the Praetorians. In the last months of 1996 the Praetorians were in full bloom, skirmishing for the valu- able appointments to be had after the inauguration of 1977. There was a gang of Praetorians bailing out before shit hits the fan next term. Even in the face of disaster, wannabe Praetorians lined up for the chance at bat. As I have said, the dictat ors did not cause the fall. The dictators took shortcuts. The Praetorians were the tools to shape the shortcuts. What are these so-called shortcuts taken by the dic- tators? An example is in order. Before the dictators, there was a Republic. The laws of the Republic forbade certain practices. One law forbade the execution of a roman citizen except for the crime of traitor. This law held over even into dictatorship. In order to circumvent the law, the dictator (one or another of the Caesar s) would merely wish that a certain patrician would no longer bother him 8 . This wish was gratuitously taken as an order by the Praetorian. The patrician would be found dead soon after, mysteriously. There was much competition for the honor of accommodat- ing the dictator. A rise in rank (an honorarium) was be- stowed on the successful Praetorian.   8 Shakespeare makes use of this syllogism in his play, Henry II , where Henry muses out loud: “Will nobody free me of this meddlesome priest.” He is of course referring to Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry’s own maverick Praetorian, appointed by Henry himself. Henry was “accommodated” by his Lords (Praetorians)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Page 4 A modern parallel exists when an elected official takes a shortcut to re-election by siccing the alphabet soup cops (Praetorians) on opponents. We see a brief expose of this tactic with Clinton’s FB I background check of previous White House employees' personnel files. These checks were thinly disguised muck raking to find dirt on private individual’s personal lives. Apparently there are no limits on bottom feeding and muck raking, then or now. It has not yet been revealed how Clint on made his wish known to his Praetorians to have these private lives snooped upon. Nev- ertheless, the Praetorians, bei ng what they are, gleaned his wishes. How he transmitted his wishes will eventually sur- face. The press, ever eager to expose and/or create news, will promptly publish the affair. Sooner, or later, we mere taxpayers will find out. Intere stingly enough, if the elected official retains some power, his spin-doctors will circum- vent the issue and show that contrary to the facts, the offi- cial really did a good thing. Who are the Praetorians? We don’t elect them. We don’t control them. They are appointed. You might think the officials that we elect ar e the Praetorian’s masters. Nothing could be further from the truth. A prime example of a Praetorian with no master is J. Edgar Hoover. No elected official dared cross him, never- theless thwart him. Much ne w evidence shows him to be a transvestite and more. This is the same man who used his power to suppress and impris on would be communists, mi- norities and homosexuals that fa iled to recognize his author- ity.

Imagin e the head of the FBI living a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 5 double life and his boss afraid to challenge him! This is the power of a Praetorian. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Hoover’s titular boss, was power less to act against Hoover’s wishes. Sorrowful to say: R obert was also a Praetorian. Infighting among Praetorians protecting their turf has al- ways been a fascinating subject. Machiavelli 9 wrote a fa- mous book on the subject, “ The Prince. ” Much is written about Machiavellian politics. This book is not a review of the art, but a status report on the re- sults of the art. Lately, the press has been allowed to examine this subject, but only in the shallowe st depth. Even in the shal- lows, what stories have come out! We are owed the release of these stories to our declin ing empire. A somewhat re- deeming feature of a declining empire is that the party in power leaps to expose the foible s of the party out of power. This in itself is a certain si gn of decay. The noble Romans were sullied in much the same way. More than one Praeto- rian fell on his sword, as did mo re than one dictator, when their shenanigans were expose d, usually as the result of a backfired blackmail attempt. That is not to say the shenani- gans stopped. It was rare to advertise these escapades. A good Praetorian is also good at sweeping dirt under the car- pet. Not every Praetorian has power over the President. The President is the foremost visible power head in Amer- ica. There are invisible power heads as well. We’ll talk about these invisibles later.   9 Much confusion exists about this author. He was not a conniver or a duplicitor. He merely reported on duplicity. Some historians mistak- enly equate his name with the acts he reported."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Page 6 There are countless power heads in government. Most of them are appointed, not elected. Let's call the ap- pointed ones “ throne masters ”. The American President is but one member of a three-prong multi-tiered throne. His is a powerful throne, but one among many thrones. Although these throne masters call themselves “ public servants ” they are in fact “ public masters ”. These public masters have the power of the throne. Most Pr aetorians stay in the back- ground and work behind the throne. The Praetorians have a shaky symbiotic relationship w ith the titular power heads of state. Such symbiotic relationships turn predatory if the Praetorian’s position is imper iled. If a high ranking Praeto- rian is threatened by a power head, you can bet that power head will soon be dethroned. He will be dethroned by an unrelated source or in an unrel ated situation. But surely a Praetorian will be responsible. At the risk of confusing the subject, recognize this: throne masters may be Praetorians. Throne masters may also be prey for the Praetorians 10 . Power Heads such as Presidents, Senators and the ilk, may at one time have been a Praetorian. Seems confusing? Look at it this way. When you look at a ball of snakes, it is difficult to tell one from another. There is one alpha snake. There is also a batch of beta snakes ready to bite him and take over. The alpha snake wasn’t born an alpha snake. He grew into the job. He bit and was bitten. He is the survivor snake. It takes an expert non-snake to spot the alpha snake. Only other snakes can really tell who is on top. Woe to a snake who doesn’t mind his place in the queue.   10 An interesting chance turn of words Praetorian’s Prey ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 7 This leads to a common question. Who organizes the Praetorians? Actually they are quite like fungus. They spring up in the most unlikely and the most unfrequented places. Rarely do they grow in the light of day or on foot- paths. They lack formal orga nization. Like a virus, they spread on contact. But like a bacillus they often accommo- date their host by performing a beneficial function. I don’t mean to say the beneficial function is for the good of soci- ety. The benefit is to the pow er head. The throne-owner rarely spreads this largesse to the citizenry. The mere lack of formal organization does not make them disorganized. Just as a swarm of army ants appear disorganized, they work with a common goal: protection of the hive. Occa- sionally, in nature, a deviant group springs up and then self- destructs. Fire ants and killer bees are a good example. Na- ture predicts the end of deviants. Nature rewards the end of eccentricity. The same is true of empires. It is classically predictable that all empires fail. The Praetorian’s hive is euphemistically called a ca- reer. A power head can break a Praetorian. A Praetorian can break a power head. Thus springs the deadly dance of the scorpions. Neither trusts the other. Neither turns its back on the other. This mutual distrust generally engenders a healthy turnover of the throne and its Praetorian hench- men. This is but a symptom of empire decline. Mere throne reversals are not a decline of empire but a foretaste of it. Am I too vague? Do you wish for familiar names to place with this analogy? Ho w about un-indicted persons such as Edwin Meese? How did he go from campaign man- ager to Chief Counsel to the Pr esident to Attorney General? Surely he was promoted from citizen to Campaign Manager."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Page 8 Surely he was promoted from Campaign Manager to Chief Counsel, and again to Attorney General. When did he be- come a Praetorian? When did he become a power head? Need more names? How about Janet Reno? What service does she perform that enab led her to stay in office as Attorney General, in spite of the fact that Clinton wished her out. Is she a power head or a Praetorian. Look at the ball of snakes. You figure he r out. The actual answer ap- pears to be that she was transitional. She wielded the power to appoint special counsel to investigate or not to investigate the president. This is a snake th at really bites. She is never- theless a beta snake. Pretty soon she will be history, neither a power head nor a Praetorian. This is a situation where a rank amateur overplayed her hand. With any luck she will continue on without being indi cted, just as Meese did. Without luck, someone may muse aloud “will nobody rid me of this meddlesome Reno person?” There are examples of Praetorians who didn’t get out in time. As long as we are on the subject of Attorney Gen- erals 11 , let’s take the example of John Mitchell. He was not only indicted, but also convicted and sent to prison. A stan- dard example to which we will give the phrase: falling on one's sword. Falling on one’s sword is e xpected of Praetorians. However there is an occasional reluctant Praetorian. Where the reluctant Praetorian falters, a fellow officer may give him a gentle shove from behind. Maybe an occasional out- sider is hired to give him a shove.   11 Its amazing how may Attorney Generals have been killed in office or been indicted or resigned under fire. Its not so amazing if you consider that the Attorney General is the also the Praetorian General."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 9 Praetorians are not the only ones to fall on their swords or be forced onto them. Power heads, stirring the snake ball, earn the same reward. Too much is said about the assassination of John Kennedy to be disregarded. Did a Praetorian, or a usurper, hire the Mafioso to end his intran- sigence? If the Mafia did th e job, they had to have help from the Praetorians. Seems likely. It is highly unlikely that Oswald, was at the right place at the right time and put th ree bullets in a four inch circle at three hundred yards with a cheap World War II bolt action rifle, a nine dollar scope , and in three seconds with- out outside help. If you be lieve Oswald was that good, there is land waiting for your purchase in the Florida Ever- glades. See Appendix C . Robert Kennedy was cutting a mighty swath through the Mafia at the time.

Every public servant in America has an amazing amount of power over the governed. Sound contradictory? Yes it does. However it is true. Public servant is an illu- sory term. The term is a euphemism which, although not coined by the spin-masters, is perpetuated by them to keep citizens in the belief that they, not the servants, are in con- trol. Things were not always this way. In the early days of the republic (both America and Rome) a public servant was just that: a servant. Today, in America, nothi ng could be further from the truth. The public servant is subservient to no one except his praetorian bosses. The ordinary citizen has absolutely no power to con- trol his public servant 12 anymore than the lab rat has power to control the psychology student conducting the lab ex- periment. The rat, pressing a le ver, is rewarded with food. The rat is in control, right? Well you get the drift. The citi- zen pulling a lever in a voting booth is rewarded with the idea that his vote counts for something, somewhere. Both rat and citizen have been led to a state of belief, which leaves them under the impression all's right with the world, they get what they want. The rat gets what the psych-   12 Bureaucrats as the French termed them."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Page 12 student wants, and the citizen gets what the praetorians want. What's wrong with this scenario? Nothing. After all, the rat gets fed and the citizen gets benefits. However, the benefits the citizen receive s come from his own pocket. Now if those benefits are need ed or required by the citizen and the return is proportional to the tax layout, equilibrium exists. No harm done. The ra t and citizen are happy. What happens when the citizen pays fa r more into the system than he receives back? What happens when the rat receives a nasty shock for whatever reason the psych-students desires? What if the lab experiment is out of control because the psych-student is lacking in th e fundamentals of his training. What happens when the rat receives the nasty shock for sometimes performing well and sometimes performing poorly? Well, sad to say, the rat nuts up and doesn't per- form or crawls into his rat-fetal position and dies. Do people react the same wa y? Most certainly, yes. To illustrate the point: Not l ong ago thirty-nine Heaven's Gates subscribers curled up and went to a more understand- able region. I don't think they did this because they were comfortable with life in their societal rat's maze. Let's take an example for the citizen. Let's use a small example of one rat maze in our daily lives. The in- comprehensible income tax system. Let us examine just a teeny portion that has mediocratic spin attached to it. The praetorians tell us th at if we check a box on our income tax forms, a dollar or two will be taken from our tax and applied to campaign funds, which will be allocated to throne masters striving to keep their jobs. They tell us that the money they take from us will not have an effect on the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 13 amount of tax we pay. Millions and millions of us check this box each year. What a blat ant rip off. Of course the amount you check will effect the tax you and everybody else pays. The most chuckle headed accountant in the world must realize that when you remove money from the tax base and use it for no tax based pur poses, the deficit must be made up. How is the deficit ma de up? By increasing next years tax bite. If a private c itizen tried this trick, he would be jailed instantly. Of course , there are no real world ana- logs to this scheme, only the United States Government can play this game. Hasn't anybody in the General Accounting Office ever heard of double entry book keeping? All citizens cringe at the thought of income tax preparation. We don't cringe at the thought of paying; we cringe at the thought of deci phering the ridiculous forms that must be filled out to re port our earnings. Even the EZ forms are outrageous. The praetorians know every cent you make, every cent you spend and every cent you have squir- reled away under the bed. Why do they insist that you now turn your life upside down to recover every scrap of paper that proves to them what th ey already know. And when you have finally filled out your mea culpa docket of infamy, why do they blithely tell you your contribution to campaign funds won't cost you anything? Control! You are under control.

The head of that sovereign nation. Yes, I'm talking about Panama. The very same country that we split off from Columbia at the turn of the century in order to build the Panama Canal. The man we imprisoned is the same man we pro- moted to be president. What's wrong with this pic- ture?

Does this mean we have more criminals than anywhere else? Or does it mean we are getting unpleasant and unexpected shocks from the praetori- ans to keep us under control. This type of impris- onment is liberally sprinkled throughout history. Out of control imprisonment always comes before the fall. Hitler locked up an alarming number of his own citizens, almost as many per capita as America today. Stalin did the same. But, it should be noted they did not match our numbers today. America makes great noise about the Chinese prison slave la- bor. The praetorians are famous for forgetting that all Federal Prisoners are forced to work. If any pay is given to these prison workers, it is taken away to pay enormous fines and restitution. A federal cor poration, UNICOR, is charged with working these slaves. Th e output of these slaves com- pete with American industry for clothing, furniture and mili- tary products, produced right here in the good old USA (prisons). Actually compete is a poor word. You can not compete with slave labor. How come we call Chinese pris- oners slaves, and American pris oners are not categorized the same way? A classic case of spin-doctoring the situation. When the Germans and Japanese claimed the same thing in WWII, we labeled it propaganda. The Nazis propagandized their slave labor with the phrase \" Arbeit macht Frei .\" Work makes you free.

The banana wars are a good example of over-reaching ambition employ- ing political methods. Throne masters were then created not born. They filled the vacuum created by an expanding economy that had money in its pocket. Power was merely the method employed to enjoy the wealth.

The notion that \"the public interest\" supersedes private interests and rights means: that the interests and rights of some in- dividuals are less than the interests and rights of oth- ers, by fiat. That person who places the interests of “society” above his own rights as an individual has a very low self-esteem. However, those wretches, whose societal reward comes from sharing in the forced redistribu- tion and/or spoliation of other peoples’ work product, have an even lower, depraved collective sense of self- esteem. This collective lack of self-esteem can only be assuaged by more spoliation.\" “ The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. To be your own man is a hard business. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself .” Rudyard Kipling Societies are merely collections of individuals.

Let us say that one of these three is industrious and hard working a nd the other two are lazy and"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Page 22 indolent. Let us say that this little society decides to be- come democratic and vote on a distribution of work. Does it not make sense that the lazy two will vote that the indus- trious one should bear the great est burden of work? Does it not also make sense that they would also vote that the one should also give up his rightfu l ownership of the food and resources he has produced for the benefit of the two? Is this not enslavement by majority rule? Now expand this little society into the size of America. Is it not a fact that the ma- jority enslaves small enclaves of the minority? Is it not a fact that there are many such minorities that are enslaved in different fashions? As it appears, each small faction aligns with other small factions to obtain a majority, which now usurps the wealth of another small minorit y. That small minority binds with even more diverse small minorities to form a different majority, which then taxes (steals) a different minority’s wealth. Recognize this: every individual eventually is in a minority. In order for such an arcan e system to function there has to be a perceived common-good . Politically Correct Thought Control, formerly know as propaganda, foists this common-good fable on the targeted minority , (see Chapter Four and Nine). The targeted minority changes as apathetic or weak minorities are discovered and exploited for the common-good . How we got here. Almost all mammals are born pre-programmed for certain functions. Human mammals are no exception. The"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 23 very basic pre-programmed functions materialize at birth. These simple but essential functions include suckling and, an even more rudimentary program, elimination. These functions are controlled within a very deep layer of the baby’s dome called the reptilian brain. According to researchers and scientists of systemic evolution this brain part evolved long before the higher centers of the brain, millions of years ago. This happened even before we walked upright. Today we have multiple layers of brain, which control our actions, be havior and thinking. The reptilian brain still functions. It functions on a level we never see or feel within ourselves. These pre-programmed actions, or predispositions if you will, are termed by Psychologists and recently Sociologists: patterns . Let us differentiate between patterns and urges. An urge is sometimes the manifestation of a pattern. Recognize this: All urges are not the result of a pat- tern. Many, if not most, urges are learned or acquired. Thus we are unable to blame all of our lusts and urges on patterning. This subject is dealt with in my treatise: “The White Picket Fence Syndrome .” This treatise is a highly volatile subject and as Dr. Will Shockley would advise, it is published on the web and available only to the initiate. If you conjugate the verb “to be” in every day speech, you are probably among the initiate. If this confuses you, you must have turned to this page at random: skip the rest of this book. If you have read this far, and the prior statement con- fuses you, you have self-selected to be in this academy and should read on anyway.

Whether or not you agree, you are among the initiate."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Page 24 Prison guards are able to see the manifestations of the reptilian brain when they observe a prisoner locked in solitary confinement for months and years at end. The outer layers of the brain, designed for communication and social function, have withered and atrophied. The only functional remaining portion is the reptilian brain, now much stronger than normal because of the incr eased use with which it must cope. Not all prisoners are aggressive and anti-social when placed in prison. Psychologists note the return to the fetal position when communication is cut off for a prolonged time. This is the reptilian brai n re-emerging. That brain is very selfish. Yes, we all have a selfish nature. We all have a reptilian brain. This nature is normally submerged by the higher brain functions in order to survive in society. But what happens if society breaks down or fails the individual? We take up this subject later. Patterns are essential to life for a newborn. Some mammals are born with a whole gamut of patterns. They are able to stand up, walk, r un and perform very advanced functions as compared to the very helpless human baby. The human baby has a compensatory pattern to accomplish the same tasks. It can cry. Crying alerts the mother to tasks needed to be accomplished by the baby. To borrow a com- puter systems analogy: Nature endows the human baby (the client system) with a software interrupt (the cry), which al- lows all the other missing sub-routines (primitive patterns) to be accomplished by the mother, (the host system). Higher patterns are found in mammals. These pat- terns develop later in life. An example: The mother does not find her baby’s cry to be nerve wracking. However, the father finds the cry extremely irritating. What a wonderful"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 25 system. The mother, in primitive times the only member of the group to be able to feed the infant, responds kindly. The father removes himself from the irritation and hunts for food for mom and the rest of his kin. What happens in post- primitive times under the same circumstances? We will get to that. Why do I bring this up? Patterns (primitive as they may be) are responsible for many of our reactions to events in later life. The lemmings are good examples of later life patterning. Periodically, lemmi ngs band together and throw themselves off a cliff to their death, by the hundreds and thousands. Now then, lemmings don’t go to school to be taught that on a certain day at a certain time they must get together with their brothers, sisters, cousins and aunts and throw themselves off a cliff, do they? Certainly not, they are patterned to do it. Is ther e a reason for this pattern? Na- ture hardly does anything without a grand plan. Call this evolution, survival of the fitte st or God’s will; it is some sort of a plan. Browsing the literature, there are several published reasons for this behavior, each at odds with the other. Scientists are not, after all, omniscient. We are smart and we are clever, but omnisc ient? Not yet, by several millenniums, if we manage to hang in there that long. Granted that patterns exert some subtle influence on our later lives, let’s examine one . Now just because I talked about reptilian brains, this doesn ’t mean that part of the brain is responsible for all patterns. Higher portions of the brain produce higher patterns.

I am talking about our mass urge to form societies and produce leaders. You knew th at! This is a pattern not a learned trait. Certain Sociol ogists will argue this point, oth- ers will agree. The lack of ag reement allows weight to my hypothesis. It is a pattern. In the formation of the human species, it is pretty obvious that the family unit was the central unit. The Ger- man phrase kith, kirch, und kinder applies to this unit. First kinder or family, then kirth or home , and finally kirch Church, or in this case, God. As an autonomous group, they were a self-sufficient unit. A pattern evolved to be im- planted: hang together and help one another. This happened even before we learned to walk upright. We are living proof of this theorem. Without family adhesion, no evolution to Homo Sapiens for us. Family is the adhesive of evolution. Do we still need it? Our power heads don’t think so. They replace it with the politically co rrect bee hive mentality of leadership knows best In the process of evolving to upright bipedal mam- mals (not humans ... yet), we evolved new patterns.

The fam- ily unit remained prominent but a new form of association began: the society . In order to coordinate and regulate the individuals of society into speci alties, a leader was chosen. Perhaps the leader wasn’t so much chosen as appeared. Certainly the leader wasn’t el ected. These ancestral rela- tions hadn’t developed language communication, neverthe- less the concept of democracy. The leader, chosen, or self- appointed, was necessarily the strongest physical and men- tal specimen available. Let us call this specimen the alpha individual. 15 The alpha would of c ourse have to defend his position against all comers. Certain privileges were wrested from society by the alpha: Th e pick of the food, housing, sex, and jobs. Talking about sex: That remarkable pattern develops during and creates maturity. How did the pattern evolve? No more basic instinct exists except for food. Sex is enjoy- able, 16 if it weren’t who would do it? If nobody did it, there   15 I choose individual as neuter inspecific out of deference to the ladies. However I personally believe the alpha was a male.

No big loss in the great scheme of things, but an interesting diver- sion nonetheless. How sex got to be a pattern begins long before the reptilian brain. B acilli do it. Surely they don’t have an urge. Therefore Bacilli have a pattern. Perhaps this pattern is at the DNA level. Many generations of societal advancement by the leadership method have selected into a high level pattern. We all have it. The pattern fo llows a form. Advance to the head of the pack and be the l eader. Failing in this endeavor, become a follower. Let’s call this pattern alpha seeking . We can sub classify alpha seekers as leaders or strivers . Alpha seeking is not a primal urge, if we don’t be- come alpha’s we don’t die as when we don’t feed ourselves. Alpha seeking is however, a strong undercurrent to our life’s progression. It is more pronounced in some than oth- ers. Psychologists have identif ied this trait, and strong al- pha seekers are called type “A” individuals. Since we all have the alpha-seeking pattern, and not all can be alphas, the less strongly patterned sublimate to type “B” individu- als. All types are somewhat frustrated with their lot in life and so strive for either conformity or strive for exceptional- ity. The alpha, and there are various degrees of alphas, is frustrated in another way. The alpha strives for the unob- tainable, absolute power. It is the mark of the beast.

Both soldiers were sublimated alphas. A historical turn of events allows the alpha-seeking pattern to take hold and by a succession of events, driven by these alpha pa tterns, allow them extremely high alpha status. One become s Emperor, the other Dicta- tor. These terms are synonymous as to force and effect. Are these alphas content to be the big cheese? No! Either of them could have stopped and begun a dynasty. 17 Were they happy? No! They self-destructed. The same is true of all previous empires. Perhaps the brief span of Napoleon and Hitler dramatizes this fact. Remember: the life of an empire is inversely proportional to the date it begins . Herein begins the battle of the patterns: The higher pattern of family versus the still higher pattern of society. We are patterned, predisposed, to follow the leader but to also lead and protect the fam ily. What happens when the leader usurps the family role and demands that individuals let him make decisions for individual families? Often these decisions have no societal basi s, such as what censorship society will place on the individual family's media viewing, family planning, and whether an ailing individual may end his own life?

Not communities, but individualists. Individuals are the ones who recognize problems. Individuals are the ones who solve them. Giant corporations and governments cannot recog- nize problems nevertheless resolve or fix them.

That’s what makes him so funny. We are looking in a mirror. Dilbert is us.

What happens when he is left no avenue to create, or escape? Perhap s we should ask Theodore Kac- zynzki or Timothy McVeigh. Whether or not they are the culprits, they certainly are indivi duals at odds with the state. What avenue is left to those who neither lead or are led? These are not rhetorical questions.

While away learning the job, a competitor may undercut him and take his job. Bad choice. Choice 2. Means that a competent subordinate may know more than he does and arrange to make away with his job. The worst possible choice. Choice 3. Means that he doesn’t have to learn the job, the incompetent yes-men always make him look good because they can’t challenge him on expertise. Obvious best choice. A book outlining the graduation to incompetence has been published with great acclaim, The Peter Principle . 27 Every reader, reviewer and ed itor acclaimed it for its truth.

Totalitarianism is most of ten replaced with an egali- tarian society. The egalitarians are often so empowered with their ability to rule that they often become more tyran- nical than their former master s. The Communist revolt and the French revolution are tw o good examples of this propo- sition. The individual is the we llspring of innovation. In- novation is the lifeblood of soci ety. Humans are patterned to be individuals with a family basis. Humans are also pat- terned to be leaders or to be led. In prehistoric times these patterns were mutually reinforcing. The good of the family was based on the good of the trib e. In modern times these two patterns are diametrically opposed. The tribe has grown to clan, to state, to na tion to empire. The good of the empire is no longer the good of the family, much less the individual. Humans, therefore, suffer from a schism of patterns. Conform to society or indulge the individuals. Empires seem not to be able to perfor m this balancing act. Empires therefore are not counted as human. Empires are large so- ciopathic societies 30 . Societies protect their group at the expense of the individual. So ciety's creed is: Society must be protected even at the expe nse of the individual.

This joining assimilates and subjugates the individual until the unique ideas brought into the group are dissipated in the throng. In earlier times, an individual had only his own hands and weapons in which to struggle against an unjust or unwieldy society. To make a dent in society he had to ei- ther join society or form his own society and by force of arms, subdue. The revolt by Spartacus 31 is a good example.

Romans rarely granted freedom to slaves, just as Imperial- ists do not grant freedom to individuals. They believe there are no individuals, just pieces of society. Because societies always are governed by alphas, leadership exempts itself from the rules they make to regulate society 34 . When an individual recognizes there is no place in society for him and no place to r un, a certain bile rises in his brain, which creates a disquiet ude.

The death of Perti- nax, and the disgraceful elevation by his murderers of the senator Didius Julianus, aroused such a furor in the prov- inces that three rival emperors were almost simultaneously proclaimed in widely separated areas of the Empire. One of these avengers of Pertinax, Septimius Severus, ultimately triumphed over his rivals, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. But the state had to pay a heavy price for this bloody episode of civil war. Severus (A.D. 193-211), the founder of a new dynasty, owed everything to his loyal ( praetorian ) troops, and showed his thanks by pampering the army, increasing their pay and granting them many addi- tional privileges. His elder son and ultimate successor, Ca- racalla, followed the same principles thus sowing the seeds of future military anarchy which, ironically, was to bring about the downfall of the Severan dynasty itself in A.D. 235. The heavy cost of the civil wars, and of his liberality towards his soldiers, obliged Severus to debase the purity of the silver coinage, an evil expedient in which he was imi- tated by many of his successors, with catastrophic results. But the Severan coinage is, nevertheless, generally well struck from neatly engraved dies, and the types are full of interest. Strong emphasis is placed on the dynastic principle, to which end many precious metal types were produced combining the portraits of various members of the Imperial family. Of special architectural interest is a denarius issued in A.D. 206 depicting the famous triumphal arch of Severus, which still stands to this day in the Roman Forum. Not all of the earlier Severan precious metal coinage was produced in Rome. One result of the civil wars following the murder of Pertinax was the establishment of a mint, or mints, in the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 53 East which remained active for many years after the defeat and death of Pescennius Niger. Laodicea in Syria was probably the principal eastern mint for the earlier Severan coinage. Its products are not difficult to differentiate from those of Rome, purely on stylistic grounds. One major inno- vation in the currency system, made by Caracalla in A.D. 215, was the introduction of a silver double-denarius, usu- ally termed an antoninianus after the emperor's official name of Antoninus. The Severan dynasty was briefly interrupted, in A.D. 217-218, by the usurpation of Macrinus and his young son Diadumenian. Macrinus continued the issue of antoniniani initiated by his predecessor, though they were produced in much smaller numbers than the traditional denarii. Under the last two emperors of the Severan dynasty, Elagabalus (A.D. 218-222) and Severus Alexander (A.D. 222-235), coin production remained at a high level in Rome, espe- cially of the debased silver denarii, though sestertii were also struck in quantity under Alexander. Antoniniani were produced by Elagabalus, but their issue ceased after a short time, and sixteen years were to elapse before the denomina- tion was reintroduced. A Syrian mint, probably Antioch, was operative for precious metal denominations under Ela- gabalus and for the early years of Alexander's reign. The latter was very much under the influence of his domineering mother, Julia Mamaea, whose issues of silver denarii and brass sestertii were on a large scale. Severus Alexander and Julia Mamaea were mur- dered by mutinous soldiers in A.D. 235. With the downfall of the Severan dynasty the Roman Imperial coinage went into a rapid decline, a crisis which was only partially allevi-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Page 54 ated by Aurelian's currency reform in the early 270s. One of the first signs of impending trouble was a drastic reduction in the volume of gold issues. Production of the double- denarius (antoninianus), discontinued at or before the acces- sion of Alexander, was resumed by the joint Emperors Bal- binus and Pupienus in A.D. 238. Within a short space of time the antoninianus had driven the denarius out of circula- tion, thus bringing to an end four and a half centuries of continuous production of the most famous denomination of Roman coinage. The new standard denomination, the an- toninianus, was issued in ever increasing quantities, from the reign of Gordian III (A.D. 238-244) through to Dio- cletian's great reform of the coinage in the final decade of the 3rd century. The weights of individual gold coins show a marked decline at this time, though the purity of the metal remains high. The aes , though still produced in some num- bers, exhibit a tendency to be struck on small and irregular flans. Although he reigned only briefly in the mid-3rd cen- tury, Trajan Decius (A.D 249-251) bravely attempted to make a stand against the rapid decline in the political and economic situation in the Roman state. By adopting the name of Trajan at the outset of his reign he clearly showed his intention to restore the old Roman virtues. Emphasis to this policy was given by the issue of a remarkable series of antoniniani honoring eleven of Decius' Imperial predeces- sors, from Augustus to Severus Alexander. These gave a fascinating insight into which past rulers were highly re- garded in mid-3rd century Rome, and which were not. No- table by their absence were such names as Julius Caesar, Claudius and Pertinax, whilst surprising inclusions were"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 55 Commodus and Severus Alexander, especially as the latter had never even been deified. A further innovation by Trajan Decius was the introduction of a handsome new aes de- nomination, the double sestertius, a coin of truly medallic appearance. Following the death of the heroic Decius on the field of bat- tle, fighting the Empire's dangerous new enemies the Goths (summer 251), there was a further rapid deterioration in the state of affairs, both military and economic. Trebonianus Gallus (A.D. 251-253) attempted to halt the decline in the weight of the gold coinage by the introduction of a double aureus (binio) closely resembling the antoninianus. The brief reign of Aemilian (A.D. 253) saw the issue of a num- ber of interesting types, including extremely rare an- toniniani in the name of his wife, Cornelia Supera. These troubled times also witnessed the usurpation at Emisa (Syria) of a certain Uranius Antoninus, about whom very little is known. His remarkable coinage consists of gold aurei, with highly distinctive reverse types, and provincial style billon tetradrachms and bronzes. Disintegration Of The Roman Monetary System With the accession in A.D. 253 of Valerian and his son Gallienus the final chapter in the dissolution of the Au- gustan monetary system is opened. Following Valerian's capture by the Persians in 260 the Romans temporarily lost effective control of much of the East, the initiative ulti- mately passing to the rulers of the desert kingdom of Pal- myra. Just prior to this catastrophe the western provinces of Gaul, Britain and Spain had been detached from the author- ity of the central government by the rebellion of Postumus,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Page 56 commander of the Rhine legions. He and his successors maintained an independent state for about fourteen years. In the midst of this chaos, with the Empire showing every sign of total and permanent disintegration, the Imperial coinage was suffering a disastrous decline. The silver antoniniani, already seriously debased by the early 250s, sank rapidly to the level of small bronze coins, seldom showing any trace of silver content. The state was virtually bankrupt, and with the collapse of the silver coinage the issue of aes denominations came to an almost complete stop. The extensive provincial bronze coinage in the East suffered a similar fate, and many Greek Imperial mints made their final issues in the names of Gallienus and his wife, the Empress Salonina. Although the purity of the gold was maintained, the weights of individual specimens vary widely, and there appears to have been little attempt to adhere to any particular standard. In the Gallic Empire of Postumus the monetary crisis was less severe. His attractive gold coinage was struck on a heavy weight stan- dard whilst his antoniniani, though very debased, generally present an appearance far superior to those issued by Gal- lienus. Postumus even managed to produce a substantial output of aes coinage, including some unusually large pieces which probably circulated as double sestertii. His main mint establishment seems to have been situated at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), only one of many new mint- ing centers, the proliferation of which was a feature of the later 3rd century coinage. Rome was beginning to lose its pre-eminence, not just as the center of coin production but as the political and strategic heart of the Empire. The dark days of the 260s were followed by a period of partial recovery, intitiated by Claudius II Gothicus (A.D."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 57 268-270). The improvement was maintained and given fur- ther impetus by the vigorous action of Aurelian (A.D. 270- 275). This elderly but energetic ruler not only recovered the lost western provinces from the successors of Postumus, but also defeated the forces of the remarkable Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. Zenobia and her son Vabalathus had been issuing billon tetradrachms from the mint of Alexandria in Egypt, and antoniniani from Syrian Antioch. They adorned Aurelian's great triumph through the streets of Rome, to- gether with the Tetrici, father and son, who were the last rulers of the Gallic Empire. Aurelian also found time to un- dertake a partial reform of the Imperial coinage, which had sunk to such a low level. It appears to have been beyond the resources of the state to reintroduce a pure silver coinage at this time, but the size and weight of the antoninianus were increased, and its silver content fixed at about 5%. Aes de- nominations reappeared but were produced only on a lim- ited scale, and were issued even more sparingly by Aurelian's successors. Gold was now coined on a more regular basis and included some double aurei. The monetary system as restored by Aurelian lasted for about two decades, until Diocletian (A.D. 284-305) introduced his sweeping reforms commencing about 294. The intervening years saw many changes in government, for these were dangerous times, and even emperors of the valor and ability of Aurelian and Probus were not safe from the assassin's sword. With Diocletian's currency reform the Imperial coin- age takes on a whole new aspect. Silver coins of high qual- ity, and corresponding in weight to the Neronian denarius, were reintroduced for the first time in many generations."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" Page 58 The name usually given to this new denomination is ar- genteus. The debased antoninianus was gradually phased out and replaced by a new bronze coin usually referred to as the follis. This piece was of about the same size as the old copper as, but its value in circulation was considerably en- hanced by its 5% silver content. Diocletian's arrangements had to be modified in the light of the realities of the eco- nomic situation: the silver argenteus did not long remain in circulation and its issue quickly ceased, the result of a seri- ous official miscalculation of its relative value in circula- tion; whilst the follis underwent a rapid series of reductions in size and weight, a process which continued for almost half a century until the time of Constantius II and Constans. A few years after Diocletian's abdication in A.D. 305, Con- stantine the Great made a fundamental change in the gold coinage, abandoning the traditional aureus denomination, struck at the rate of 60 to the pound, in favor of a somewhat lighter coin, the solidus, weighing 1/72 of a pound.

Simple enough. Just take back all the gold and silver coins and melt them down and mix them with base metal then re-min t them as the new official money. Who would be so stupid to accept this outright fraud? The answer is simple. Look into a mirror. Franklin Roosevelt the 32 nd President of United States did just ex- actly that. Roosevelt made it illegal for Americans to own gold. All gold was called in a nd replaced with silver certifi- cates. That is: where it took only $20.67 to buy an ounce, Roosevelt said it now would take $35. But that’s not the big hitch. Only foreign governme nts could buy our (actually your) gold. Private Americans would be jailed for owning even a single ounce of gold. So who benefited? Well to start with, paper replaced gold. It is much easier to produce paper wealth than to find gold. This disappearing trick worked so well that later on, in 1964, even silver was removed as a monetary metal. Any silver certificates had to be redeemed within one year or their silver value became worthless.

This may be the model for homeopathic medicine where an infinite dilution is possible because water has a memory of the source ingredients. Not so with metal, which has been replaced with paper. Inflation runs amok when real value disappears. Witness the past forty years where bread has risen from ten cents a loaf to about two dollars a loaf.

While th e witch-hunt at Enron goes on, there doesn’t seem to be a corresponding witch-hunt at the diffuse praetorian headquarters. A huge clamor arises because the poor suffering mil- lionaires at Enron have been cheated out of their bloated 401k plans, but no corresponding outrage surfaces about the crumbling of the social security umbrella which is stolen at a regular rate by the praetorians to pay for idiotic social programs (comparable to bread, wine and circuses) to per- sons who have never paid into this giant Ponzi scheme.

They melted it down, mixed it with cheaper me tal (base metal) and re- issued it. The scam was they issued it as being worth the same value as before the debasement.

A rough and conservative estimate, including loan guar- antees, pension plans, military and veterans benefits, social security payouts, Medicare payouts and foreign subsidies is approximately seventy trillion dollars. Certainly some of this can be offset by future revenue through taxation, but the number increases each year even as revenue increases. So projections allowing for additional revenue are even bleaker than those shown for today. In terms of actual physical size; how big is seventy trillion dollars?

This study focuses on the impact of the welfare state on the American family, including its ef- fects on family structure, family income, children, and the social institutions supporting family life. As in the previous studi es in this series, the excessive size of the federal government is found to be counterproduc- tive, and associated with a va riety of negative economic and social consequences. As the size and scope of government has grown, it has undermined the strength of the family and the social institutions that support it. Though well intended, in many cases this excessive expansion of the federal gov- ernment has produced results the opposite of those intended. According to this study, a level of federal government spending above about 18 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) undermines economic and income growth; federal spending above this level has depressed family income growth in the period since 1973. The drag on the economy imposed by additional federal taxes and spending has con- tributed to slowing the productivity gains on which any sus- tained growth in family income depend. Moreover, the evidence suggests that younger families are especially vulnerable to the economic costs imposed by"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Page 80 excessive government activity. Families headed by adults between 25 and 34 years old su ffer disproportionately heavy income losses from counterproductive federal spending. For example, federal spending increases of $100 billion would reduce these families' incomes by an average of $1,418, compared to $397 for a family with adults in the 55-64 age bracket. Unfortunately, the level of federal government spending is projected to remain at counterproductive levels for the foreseeable future. However, restraint of federal spending and taxes would stimulate additional economic and income growth. According to this study, $100 billion in federal spending restraint would increase real median family in- come by $895, or by 2.3 percent. The bottom line is that federal spending restraint w ould not only improve the fed- eral budget outlook, but would improve the outlook for the family budget as well. America is now engaged in a national debate over whether more of the resources earned by American families should be used as they see fit, or used in Washington to fi- nance excessive federal taxes and spending.

Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congressmen do not pay into Social Security and, of c ourse, they do not collect from it. Social Security benefits we re not suitable for persons of their rare elevation in our “classless” society. They felt they should have a special plan for them- selves. Many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. In more recent years, no congressperson has felt the need to change it. After all, it is a great plan. For all practical purposes their plan works like this: When they retire, they conti nue to draw the same pay until they die, except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. For example, former Senator Byrd and Congressman White & their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000.00 (that's Seven Million, Eight-Hundred Thousand), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during th e last years of their lives. This is calculated on an average life span for each. Their cost for this excellent plan is $00.00. Nada. Zilch. This little perk they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Funds-our tax dollars at work!

From our own Social Secu rity Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into—every payday until we retire (which amount is matched by your employer, which actu- ally comes out of your pocket anyway)—we can expect to get an average $1,000 per month after retirement. Or, in other words, we would end up collecting about $120,000 for which we were forced to pay about $175,000 into the sys- tem (remember the interest on the money we paid in for the last fifty years that we neve r get?) Let an insurance com- pany try that Ponzi scheme a nd see how long they stay out of jail! Social Security could be very good if only one small change were made. And that change would be to jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us and then watch how fast they would fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve.

The praetorians gleefully cooperate with all these agencies. It’s sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The praetorians accuse you, fine you and then collect the money you put in their trust fo r your retirement and for your welfare for the time when you are least able to provide for yourself. How did it happen? The praetorians took advantage of a depression era problem where there was a perceived need. They put a tiny wedge in to the system and created the myth that social control was in our best interest. Just like any good Ponzi scheme there were unjust rewards for the first folks in the door. It di dn’t take long for this fandango to become unglued. The social security myth has been de- bunked for at least twenty years now. The solution: Indi- vidual Retirement Plans. This is a fabulous scheme where it looks like no harm can come to anyone. Oh yeah? Then how come your plan hasn’t gained any momentum since you started it ten years ago? How come you can’t yank your money out? It’s a clever scheme when the target doesn’t even know when he has been skewered. It must be the fault of the greedy stock market manipulators. Right? You certainly can’t blame the faceless, nameless praetori- ans, can you? Tricky accounting Congress, the President, th e Secretary of the Treas- ury and all of their praetorians have condemned the accounting crimes at Enron, WorldCom , Qwest and other companies, which produced financial reports for 2001 that used slippery accounting tricks. Not only that but they fired"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Page 86 off a propaganda machine that blamed every one from Mar- tha Stewart to the smallest middle manager at Enron for slippery dealing. Those tricks disguised millions or billions of dollars. And why shouldn’t they try thes e tricks? After all where have these tricks been openly practiced before? None other than in the government’s own accounting system. The prae- torians disguised trillions in extra costs and missing reve- nue. The official budget figures for the fiscal 2002-year ended on Sept. 30. On Oct. 25, the Treasury Secretary said that the government ran a deficit of $159 billion. That was a disappointment after the $127 billion sur- plus the government claimed in earlier in fiscal 2001. But it wasn’t really surprising. According to the government the responsibility lies with drops in income tax and capital- gains-tax revenue because of the recession and the decline in the stock market. These are the exact same accounting tricks that the praetorians blamed on Enron et. al. These tricks are called “off-balance-sheet financing”. Or as Washington calls it, “off-budget.” In fiscal 2002, the federal government report- edly collected $1.8 trillion in total receipts. But $515 billion of that was off-budget. Huh? Play that one again. You mean to say the government collected money from sources it shouldn’t have.

But it is then actually lent to the Treasury and used to pay other social engineering bills. T he federal government only releases an income statement and doesn’t produce a detailed balance sheet; the liability created by this borrowing is never visible. Now how about “related-party transactions” or even “below-market-rate loans” 53 ? When the government calcu- lates the net interest it pays on its debt, it doesn’t include any interest paid on non-marketable government securities held by Social Security and ot her trust funds. Wow, even Ponzi didn’t try this. Or how about “inflated re venue projections”? To understand this one, switch from the government’s annual report to the long-term projections produced by the Con- gressional Budget Office and the White House Office of Management and Budget. These are akin to the guidance on revenue and earnings that corporations produce for creative accounting analysts. In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion for the years 2002-2011. In August 2002, that surplus had slipped to $336 billion, a 94% drop. Now about 15% of that s lippage, or $800 billion, re- sulted from changes in the budget office’s economic fore- cast. The economy over the next decade won’t grow as fast as the government projected in January 2001. If your little   52 Not into a real trust fund as they claim but in interest free loans to itself.

This is the same way that corporations turned their pension plans into profit centers by assuming 10% annual returns. The government looked askance at this accounting procedure when it was 10% but turned a blind eye to its own 94% accounting cheat. About 28% of all slippage , or $1.5 trillion, is a result of the budget office simply overestimating how much in taxes the government would co llect at any level of eco- nomic growth, according to an analysis of the government’s accounting by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. These are the same revenue projection lies of Lucent Technologies and Enron at the same period. But even that’s not the big lie in the government’s accounting. The entire $336 billion surplus is an illusion created by excluding costs th at everyone in Washington knows are coming. Of course, this error isn’t anyone’s fault, and don’t expect to see any federal budget officials doing a perp walk as in corporate life. The govern ment is simply producing the numbers the way that it said it would when it set up its latest accounting guidelines in the Balanced Budget and Emer- gency Deficit Control Act. In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office es- timated that Washington would be able to eliminate the fed- eral public debt by 2011. That would leave the SS trust-fund debt, of course, but it would have reduced the interest bill for the 10-year period to just $600 billion.

Consider this scenario: Y our child gets into a scuff at the schoolyard. Words are exchanged and a teacher (ac- tually a yard warden nowaday s) breaks it up. A mini-trial takes place ad hoc. The questioning goes thusly: Question (to a third party): Who started the fight? Now examine three possible answers and determine the three possible outcomes.

At the same time that liquor was the current political cause ( The Volstead Act ), drugs were commonly dispensed at the local pharmacy as unre gulated medication. It was quite common for a mother to send her child to the pharma- cist to get a bottle of paregoric or turpinhydrate. Paregoric and turpinhydrate are mixtures of alcohol and opium. If you brought your own bottle with a cork stopper, the pharmacist filled it from of a large ceramic container with a spigot on the bottom for about a dime. The stuff tasted terrible. Just as today, there was no cure fo r the flu (grippe as it was called then), however a dose of turpinhydrate stopped the pain and diarrhea, put you to sleep and generally you felt better afterward. Naturally this put a serious dent in the physician's income, but it didn't bother him. The doctor was a respected member of the community, making house calls, and carrying his little black bag full of medication. He dis- pensed the medicine on the spot and his fee was paid in cash, sometimes even in chickens. There were no third party payers. There was no Medicare collection from your salary. This doctor wasn't raised to the Godhood until the AMA flexed its muscles in the ni neteen fifties, with the help of federal enforcement. The dispensing of medicine by the doctor continued until the AMA agitated to stop this uncon- scionable practice. There is, after all, a fee missing from the equation. Just as there were alcoholics in those days there were drug addicts. Both we re uncommon sights in society, but the sore was there and it must be picked-at and scratched. Because drunkenness was more common and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 107 there was more public support against it, the Volstead Act resulted. Drug laws were passed at the same time but there wasn't enough public arousal for real enforcement. I can remember my mother sending me for turpinhydrate in the forties without a prescription. But the sore was still there and astute politicians re- alized if they picked at the scab it would bleed. And bleed it did. The bleeding is now a hemorrhage. Using the premise that declaring a product illegal increases the price, the profit went up along with the price. Human nature being what it is, no profit vacuum goes un- filled. Normal honest citizens w ill be sucked in to fill the void. Prohibition (liquor and drug) is one form of social control. Except in the contex t that the population is a slave of the state, the government has no responsibility to control the morality of the people where no harm is done to another individual. If someone wishes to drink himself to death, let him commit suicide without state sponsorship. If persons wish to have their spouses remain sober, let them make the individual effort to dissuade them or leave them. Often the drinking is a by-product of marital pressures in the first place. The state is not the whip of the aggrieved. Private matters must be settled privately. I'm not talking about crime against the individual such as rape, robbery or assault. These crimes of the person ar e fit subjects for society to consider. Crimes against one's own self are another matter altogether. There are two basic types of laws that are to be considered here. The legal profession calls them:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" Page 108 • Malo in se . The thing is bad in itself. Robbery, murder, rape etc. • Malo in prohibido . The thing is bad because it is prohibited. Drunkenness, Drug use, Suicide. Malo in Prohibido is the means by which society is controlled. There is often no public benefit in locking up a drunk. He doesn't become a model citizen. A goodly sum is wasted in prosecuting him and then storing him while his somewhat usefulness to the community is totally curtailed during this evolvement. He doesn’t come out a changed man he comes out with a burning hatred and a desire to get even. Laws against public drunkenness, notice I didn't say drunk driving, a different matter entirely, are at the bottom level of politically correct th inking. The higher levels of politically correct thinking are more nebulous and more dif- ficult to avoid. The penalties for breaking these high order politically correct laws are harsher and the laws are more difficult to discern. Aside from malo in se , the state has no place in interfering with family matters. However, worse yet, the state interferes with individua l thought. In furtherance of this proposition I submit the following: On a macro scale we examined the prohibition law, the law (actually worse than a law, an amendment to the constitution) led to a gigantic social upheaval, which in turn created an overthrow of a po litical party and election of a president pledged to the removal of prohibition. Yes, a ma- jor factor in Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election was his campaign promise to repeal prohibition."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 109 Roosevelt was a master politician and Praetorian puppet master. His social reform, meant to be beneficent, treated the citizenry like addled cousins. He took the role of beneficent father, carefully taking his child's play money away and storing it in a piggy bank for the child's eventual use. This money would be kept for the far distant day when it would be needed. If this scheme were to be proposed by a private individual he would be arrested as a pyramid schemer. There is no interest a ttached to that investment. A significant portion is subtracted as a cost of administration. The money isn’t kept in a sequestered account. The money is dumped in the general fund where it is spent for any pur- pose the Praetorians wish. The only way the system can continue is if more and more people come into the system each year. Ten times as many must enter the system each year as those who exit it. Th is is a Ponzi scheme of the worst sort. You don’t have a choice with social security. You are forced to pay and pr ay that you end up with some- thing in return. You are never allowed to stop paying. At least with a Ponzi scheme you aren’t forced to enter and you can leave when you realize your investment is worthless. Every year the Praetorians concerned about the imminent failure of social secu rity or Medicare raise a great commotion. Every year they raise the tax on your salary in order to “keep the system afloat.” They don’t just raise the tax on your salary; they raise the tax on your employer who must match your contributi on. Who do you suppose pays the employers share. Not the employer I can assure you. Eventually you pay it, through a higher cost of the products he sells or a reduction in the wages he pays you."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" Page 110 Although these are admirable motives in a father, they are abominable in a statesman. No careful plan was made by this self-appointed father for the storage, use or return of his children's money. Although a trust fund was announced for the storage and accumulation of this money, none was ever enacted. The money was merely put in a general fund and spent on other social programs and wars. What does this have to do with Politically Correct thought? When it appears that a mediocrat can create a problem and provide a solution, and have the financial abil- ity to do it, it becomes a real problem. The mediocrat knows from prior experience that constitutional amend- ments to assuage constituent's problems bring political sui- cide. Therefore a new method of arousing public sentiment is required in order to garner a piece of the political spot- light. First , identify the problem, Second , place a spin on the problem. Third , have your constituents identify with the problem. Last , cure the problem and have your constituents identify you with the cure. As so many medical patients have discovered, the cure is often worse than the di sease. In the process of cur- ing a political problem the public must be made to demand a cure. The politician must be made to appear to be reacting to the newly discovered situati on, not to be causing it. In the deep concern that he shows to the problem, money is thrown at the problem.

The new war? A Wa r on Poverty. This was an extremely successful strategy. In the sixties, there was much anti-war sentiment. Witness the Berkeley movement. They, rightly, felt that our national resources (men and ma- terial) were being squandered on an un-winable war. The war on poverty was an idealistic endeavor that the protesters could adjust to. Sure enough the heat came off Viet Nam, and the seventies came into bloom. Nobody seemed to no- tice, or care, that a war on poverty was less winnable than any other kind of war. The seventies brought more than a war on poverty. It brought a war on in-equality. No longer was the premise of an equal start in the race the accepted creed. A new and better creed was exposited: An equal finish. The ideal that a prior injustice must be corrected with today's resources became the law of the land. The civil rights act was unfolded which allowed the Praetorians to interfere with local custom and law when the whim struck. This law allows any person who chooses to fit him- self into a minority an allo wance in competition. Competi- tion is the method that societies use to survive and flourish. History is rife with examples of societies that have vanished due to failure to compete. Sometimes the competition is economic sometimes it is military. The Phoenicians are a good example. Hannibal (Phoenician) came within an ele- phant hair's breadth of conquering Rome. Phoenicia (Car- thage) was the breadbasket of Rome, but later fell into com- placency and Rome destroyed it.

Because you can't have empire without lackeys, that’s why. These lackeys who accept aid, are slaves to their Praetorians. Who are their Praetorians? It's difficult to tell them from the masses.

No kidding, read the science abstracts. The law is not repealed. Why give up the power to tax? What appears to be a beni gn law really has a trick to it. A pound of R12 CFC coul d be bought for eighty-nine cents in 1990 at any auto suppl y store, unregulated. Now a days that same pound is only 12 ounces and costs as much as forty five dollars. The di fference is a federal tax and scarcity. R12 is no longer made in the United States, by law . To purchase the stuff you now must have a federal li- cense. That law has a few kicker s in it too. It provides that any person who so much as removes the cap from the Schrader valve (like a tire valve stem cap) on an air- conditioning system is a criminal and the punishment is a federal matter. I didn't say you had to release any CFC from the system, you merely have to remove the cap. You're in trouble even if you replace the cap, no damage done to the system. You must be fede rally licensed to buy a 12 ounce can of R12. Try to buy it w ithout a license, bam you're a criminal. Strangely enough, a fifty-pound container can be bought without the license. What's wrong with this picture? This ridiculous law seems to encourage a person to buy much more than is needed rather than husband the commod- ity. It is politically correct to save the environment, it is politically correct to punish the environmental scofflaws who remove the caps from their equipment. But look at all the tax revenue from collecting CFC tax. But where does the R12 come from if it is illegal to manufacture it? Simple. It is manufactured in Mexico for far less than the eighty-nine cents it used to sell for here."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" Page 114 That eighty-nine cents used to put a profit in the manufac- turer's pocket and tax in the Treasury.

I doubt that Al Capone made a hundred thousand dollars per truckload during pro- hibition even accounting for inflation, and this is the tip of the iceberg. What does an average person do when he gets hot in the summer and his air conditioner needs charging? Does he grin and bear it and think of the ozone? No, he zooms into his local mechanic and has it fixed. I do know a person who drives with his air conditioner broken, but not because of the ozone. As a matter of f act his first thought was to add CFC, which didn't fix it. He is just too cheap to fix the compressor. By being politically correct a new class of criminal has been created. The new criminals start from the smug- glers and end up with the mechanics all the way down to the auto owners. Cannot the politicians learn from history? When you make a product illegal, the price merely goes up. The supply does not go down. Sure, more people go to jail, but that also hurts the economy.

Kangaroo rats are cute little devils and that's why they must have a higher priority over humans. Kangaroo rats are a Federally Protected Species. American farmers are not. The weight of the government came down on Chan. Chan was charged with violating an endangered spe- cies' habitat. Now mind you, he wasn't charged with killing the rodents, he didn’t do that. He was charged with plowing up the field they lived in. God help him if he had killed one of the little critters. No, we're not talking about getting a ticket and going to traffic court to plead guilty with an ex- planation. We're talking arrest, confinement and the seizure and forfeiture of all his tract ors, equipment and land. The case made local news in Fres no, California on page thirteen right before the obituaries, ho hum, how boring.

Anxieties 74 and suspicions occur inevitably in com- munities and these give rise to accumulating resentment, like steam in a pressure cooker, until word or deed releases them. Which produces the greater hurt, words or deeds? Telling jokes is akin to mounting a verbal attack upon the source of concern, which releases the tension for both the speaker and a sympathetic audience. This may up- set the target of the joke but it is much better that a minority be the target of jokes rather than pogroms. It is better that feminists are lampooned rather than lynched.

The Gestapo were a very small minority of the German population but highly effective. They were effec- tive because they were able to inoculate the people from the effects of their own acti on. If you had an enemy, you merely dropped a note to the Gestapo. Your enemy soon was transported to a concentration camp where (s)he could no longer bother you.

The trouble is in trying to outlaw some drugs, most prominently cocaine and marijuana, while regulating oth- ers equally or more dangerous, mainly alcohol and to- bacco. This \"outlaw\" policy includes public information cam- paigns against using the proscribed drugs and treatment programs for addicts, but its main thrust is enforcing pro- hibition by putting people in jail. This has resulted in the construction of more prisons, but it has not done much about drugs. Those who defend this policy use the same logic heard so tiresomely about Vietnam during the Johnson administra- tion: What we are doing is not working, so we ought to do more of it. As if to underline the point, McCaffrey has recommended an additional $1 billion in antidrug aid for Colombia and nearby Andean and Caribbean nations. Greater harm is done by the drug trade than by the drugs themselves. Because the trade is illegal, dealers charge a premium to cover the risk of going to jail if they're caught. This is generating billions of dollars, all in cash and all beyond the effective control of governments. It is corrupting our society. It is the driving force of many of the gang wars and murders in our cities. It is the motivation for a disproportionate percentage of income-generating crimes such as robbery, burglary, and theft committed by addicts l ooking for money to pay high drug prices. In contrast, violent crimes - murder and as-"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" Page 126 sault among others - are more likely to be committed by people under the influence of alcohol than of other drugs. Drug money has made Colombia ungovernable and Mex- ico nearly so. It is responsible for much of the corruption of police and other public officials in drug-plagued coun- tries. This will surely spread to the United States if it is not stopped. Without the money provided by the drug trade, both the violence and the corr uption will necessarily be greatly reduced. The way to remove the money is to make the trade legal so that it can be regulated. Alcohol provides a useful guidepost. Used in excess, it is so disruptive of societies, families, and personal lives that we once tried to prohibit it - \"a noble experiment\" (Her- bert Hoover's description) that gave its name to an era. The people this saved from the corner tavern did not off- set the social harm that came with the rise of bootlegging and gangsterism - precisely what is happening today with respect to cocaine and marijuana. So we abandoned pro- hibition and turned to regulation. We have, for example, made it illegal for teenagers to drink and for anybody to drive a car while drunk. People still flout the law to do these things. Six times more teen- agers die from alcohol than from all illegal drugs com- bined, Mr. Lautenberg says - all the more reason to mount a vigorous campaign to deter them from drinking. Consider the example of t obacco. When medical studies suggested a link between cigarettes and cancer, we did not react by outlawing cigare ttes. Instead we began a steady, relentless campaign to persuade people to stop or not start smoking. This has dramatically reduced smok- ing. What would the black market be like if we'd taken the other route and tried to outlaw tobacco products?"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 127 Alcohol and tobacco are great er threats to the public health than cocaine and mariju ana. We meet these threats with a little coercion (controlling the circumstances in which people drink and the pl aces they smoke) and a lot of persuasion.

And now we come to the basic tenant of this book: The classless society. Contrary to the ideological concept of America, the classless society: Aside from the ruling class who are the modern lords and ladies of Am erican society there are two great classes in American society 78 . • The first class and seemingly the most populous class is the lower class let me call them “the consumers” as op- posed to the “producers”. The power seekers and their minions cater to this class, it being the most populous. In the past two hundred years of American history it was rare and even scandalous for a person to actually starve   78 Actually there is another class altogether: The Praetorians them- selves. However this class doesn’t lend itself to definition."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" Page 128 to death. Today, however, the news abounds with sto- ries of the starving poor. Propaganda? Certainly. How did these starving folks come to be among us? There are many reasons and all of them involve Politically Correctness. 9 The first story involves an ill-conceived war in South Asia where our praetorian minions re- cruited an indigenous population to fight our war, ostensibly for their 79 own benefit. Many of these recruited cadre were nefarious war and drug lords reviled in their own country. As it turns out, we were ignominiously defeated in that war but we wished to reward the “soldiers of fortune” that we employed. Never mind they were paid 80 , we also decided to give them the use of America to continue their endevors. These are the very same mercenaries who escaped the wrath of the countrymen whom they had be- trayed, and are now unleashed on America. 9 Another story involves the “ feel good ” scenario of “ you are my brothers keeper ”. This scenario involves finding a large voting block and endow- ing them with undeserved benefits. This sce- nario is propagated by the praetorians and   79 You tell me who their refers to and you can write the sequel to this book. 80 Paid by many nefarious means such as helping with their drug trade and illicit arms smuggling, if not outright cash grants."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 129 adopted by the misguided folks who want to do something nice but don’t want to pay for it per- sonally. Thus they adopt the “Politically Cor- rect” mentality. As long as “they” don’t have to personally become involved by supplying jobs, supervision and resources, everything will be fine. And so multi-generation welfare is established. Needless to say: the more ch ildren a welfare recipient has the greater the booty. It also helps to restrict the father from the family so as to make th e mother the family head and more easily controlled. This skews the “ survival of the fittest ” law because the least educated becomes the most prolific in terms of child bearing, while the most pr oductive, in an offset to re- tain income, bear the fewest children because there is an artificially induced inverse ratio of reward to productivity. All of a sudden there is a denouement among the producers and they instigate reform. The praetorians now fear the masses and the back- lash to come and they seemingly institute change. There are no longer endless generations of welfare. They must get jobs. Now who do you suppose supplies the jobs. You? Me? Industry? No, no, we are not so undisciplined as to hire the person who has never he ld a job in their life. But the praetorians don’t mind supplying a government job. What the hell, it’s a phony job in the first place and the pro- ducers will pay anyway. Strange ly all the new jobs created to fill the workfare rolls are de signed to process paper in the workfare system. The new workfare recipients are called: “social workers”."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" Page 130 The more things change the more they stay the same. • The second great class is the class of the producers. Among them are the believers in the great myth of “ Po- litically correctness .” They toil their lives away going to college and striving for a better life for themselves and their family, they trust their government and they have small families in order to pay their tax and provide for a retirement. They never mutter a complaint and they mouth the teachings of the praetorians without dis- cussion. They are the true believers of “ Politically Cor- rect” thinking. Another group within the producer class are those who bridle at the stupidity of it all. They are loath to com- plain because they see what happens to those who do not harness up to the yoke of “ Politically Correctness ”. However they bide their time. Nothing lasts forever. They are opportunists and will jump upon the first bandwagon offering a solution. A story to catch your attention revolves around a restaurant chain originally called Li’l Black Sambo’s . This chain was very popular in the sixties particularly in the Northwest. The chain used the fable of an Indian boy named Sambo and his encounter with a man-eating tiger in India. Sambo wins the encounter and the chain placed mu- rals of the victorious Sambo on its walls. As it appears this seemed to be the casus belli 81 for the “black” population as they called themselves in those days before roots converted them into “African Americans.” And so down came the Lil   81 An act or event that provokes or is used to justify war."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 131 Black Sambo’s sign, which was replaced by a sign named simply: Sambo’s.

It disappeared from my neighbor- hood to be replaced by a greasy spoon with bland fare, high prices and a politically correct name along with an SBA guaranteed loan. Each new incarnation quickly folds as well. Many years pass during which time the monthly “Un- der New Management” sign app eared as new and more am- bitious SBA recipients sprung up and disappear. It was fi- nally torn down and a Seven-Eleven type store appeared with a true Indian Sambo comp lete with a real turban now the proprietor. • A third group are those who have quietly revolted against the tyranny of “Politically Correctness”. They have gone underground. Some have assumed new iden- tities 82 . Some are escaping absurd laws, some are escap- ing punishing child support arrearages, some are escap- ing taxes, some just want to be let alone. This class would have, in 1937, escaped Germany. OK, so what? The fact of the matter is that these two great classes are the substance of the leisure class in America. The first class, the consumers, have all the time in the world to enjoy themselves but are restricted in wealth to engage in enjoyment of their leisure time.   82 You didn’t really think all that ne ws about stolen identities is about credit card cheats, did you?

Dolan said he was personally unaware of the types of abuses alleged by the IRS agents. The IRS witnesses blamed upper manage- ment for a prevailing culture where morale was near bottom and numbers were key. “Seizures are looked at as all-important,” witness number five said. “We have prema- ture seizures” to secure a statistic despite a taxpayer’s intent to pay in a short time, the witness added.

Why is this still so even in th e face of these hearings? It’s all about control. Read on to find about how this control works. There are many books written on the ridiculous American tax system. I will outline some taxes that you pay without even realizing it. No, I'm not talking about the local sales tax on the Federal tax on gasoline at the fuel pump. This is a tax on the tax. Most of us pay this triple tax with- out complaint. Who has time to bother with a few cents per gallon that we pay as tax on tax? Then just what are these hidden taxes that nobody knows about or recognizes? These are the taxes on your leisure time. What, the government taxes my leisure time? Yes, everybody pays this tax. Let's take a really small example. Each and everyone of us goes in to a tail spin after the first of the year gathering receipts and planning on doing the in- come tax. This preparation lasts from January 1 st till April 15 th every year. On January first the employer starts send- ing out W4 and 1099 forms for every penny he paid out. All during the year he meticul ously fed every penny to an accountant just for one purpose: to report to the government how much you made.

It is estimated (laughably by the government) that the average American spends approximately 25 hours per"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" Page 138 year keeping track of his expe nses purely for tax purposes. Just think, if there was a simp ler system you could have an extra three-day (at least) vacation each year. Worse yet is the small businessman who must keep track of every single law that is passed (about 535 per day) that impacts his business. An example of this: New York state had a grand plan to help the garment workers. Not re- alizing that the garment work ers actually worked in Korea and other countries they decide to have a sales tax-free week for anybody buying clothing. Naturally enough they couldn't just make all clothes tax-free, they kept the tax on ballet slippers, kidskin gloves a nd a raft of other clothing. Sounds nice doesn’t it? How about the mom & pop stores all over the state that had to now figure out how to deduct the tax from sales of some but not all clothing for just a sin- gle week in the year. How about the penalties for under or over reporting those sales? Four months after the enactment the bankruptcy rate for employers of ten employees or fewer hit an all time high in New York. An average small businessman cannot do the ac- counting the government requires by himself. He must have help. If he does it himself it takes twenty percent of his time to fill out the forms just for himself. The break-even point is ten employees. At ten employ ees, he can afford to hire a person to do the book keeping. Under ten employees and he will use much of his productive time doing bookkeeping and report writing for no purpos e devoted to his own busi- ness. This is theft of time, pure and simple ... read on.

There was once a diamond cutter who was a very good person. Everybody looked up to the diamond cutter and his admired his skill. One of the things he was particularly good at was selecting good quality rough diamonds for cutting and pol- ishing. The poorer quality rough diamonds he would dis- card or use to make emery dust for polishing the fine dia- monds. One day a man named George came into his estab- lishment and saw him breaking up the reject diamonds. \"This is unfair,\" said the customer: \"These gems in the rough should have the same chance to be really beauti- ful. You should cut and polish them as well as the perfect stones so that every stone will have a fair chance.\" The customer stirred up public opinion against the diamond cutter until they got t ogether and said: \"If you do not give every stone a fair chance by cutting and polishing all of them regardless of the flaws we will no longer buy your gems.\" The diamond cutter was forced by public opinion to cut and polish every stone regardless of character. Since he no longer was able to use th e poor stones to produce emery he was forced to buy emery from a nearby country that did- n't force their cutters to polish every stone. This increased the cost of his product due to the additional labor to cut and polish all stones and the cost of emery. As his customers came to buy his stones, they al- ways selected the brightest, clear est stones of the first water. The poorer quality stones remained on display, unsold, until all he had to sell were poor quality stones."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 141 At last he was forced out of business because his customers bought their diamonds over seas where there was a better supply of high quality stones. The public (i.e. the government) demanded his time. Ostensibly the demand was for a worthwhile purpose. Often as not, the real worth- while purpose was for the good of a select party. Lobbyists usually represent these parties. The lobbyist in this case is George. As it turns out, Geor ge had a brother in another district that was a diamond cu tter. He was a lousy diamond cutter and could not sell his wa res because of his poor qual- ity. What does this silly little story have to do with lei- sure time? Let's first sink this metaphor in.

For five thousand years or so certain childhood dis- abilities went unnoticed. For instance Beethoven was con- genitally defective. One of hi s disabilities left him deaf in his prime years. As a matte r of fact Beethoven was stone deaf when he composed and presented his Ninth Symphony. There being no special education in those days he was left to fend for himself, with wh ich you will agree he did right well. A case in point: any handy adult, usually a teacher, countenanced childhood misbehavior in times past with swift and sure punishment. Th at teacher had the parent's approval for whatever form of punishment that seemed ap- propriate to the circumstances. The occasional tyrannical teacher was eventually brought up short, but by and large was allowed a great amount of discretion in his administra- tion of corporal punishment on his charges. Today we have discovered Attention Deficit Disor- der (ADD). You guessed it. ADD is now treated as an af- fliction and the parents of an afflicted child can collect SSI (social security payments) for this unfortunate child. The child is placed in special training classes administered by teachers who are paid a higher salary for having to put up with this child’s misadventures.

Think of yourself as the diamond cutter who spent his time cutting worthless stones as an appeasement to the public who wanted to “feel good” about George’s hidden agenda. “Who is the public? What does the public uphold as its good? “There was a time when men believed that 'the good' was a concept to be defined by a code of moral values and that no man had the right to seek his good through the violation of the rights of another.

Added to th is staggering figure are those who are no longer locked up or on supervision. These folks are no longer able to compete in society because they have a criminal record. They lost their professional credentials and are forced to work at a skill level below their competence. This added cost is incalculable. What am I talking about here? Am I sticking up for criminals? No, I am sticking up for prisoners. Not all pris- oners are criminals.

At end of 1999, prisons and jails held 1,890,800 inmates with the bulk of them held by state authorities, according to a Bureau of Justice Sta- tistics report. An additional 135,800 people were held in juvenile, military, immigration and other facilities, including those in U.S. territories and common- wealths. Previous estimates had focused on the combined populations of local jails and state and federal prisons, which are still likely to hit 2 million on their own by the end of 2001, said statistician Allen J. Beck, author of the report. ”There are some indicators of stability that suggest a longer term slowing of growth,” Beck said. “I suspect that barring additional sentencing re- forms increasing punishment we may well soon reach a plateau.” Prisons usually hold convicted criminals sentenced to terms longer than one year, while jails generally keep inmates awaiting trial or serving shorter sentences. The growth rate of state and federal prison popula- tions slowed to 3.4 percent in 1999, down from 4.7 percent the year before a nd the lowest since the 2.3 percent growth in 1979. Much of the decline was at the state level, since the growth rate for federal pris- ons actually increased to 9.9 percent last year from 8.9 percent in 1998. Longer sentences, particularly for drug offenders, have contributed to the growth in the federal system, Beck said. The U.S. prison population has grown steadily for more than a quarter-century, helped by increased drug prosecutions and tougher"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 151 policies against all offenders. Since 1990 the prison population has increased by nearly 600,000 inmates or 77 percent. Crime rates have been declining since 1993, but longer sentences, especially for drug crimes during the 1980s and for violent crimes in the 1990s, have driven prisoner populations. More mandatory minimum sentences and declining release rates have also contributed to the increase. The prisoner popula- tion last declined in 1972. Viewing the latest figures in light of the current U.S. population, one of every 110 men and of every 1,695 women was incarcerated at the end of last year. The U.S. rate of incarceration is more than six times that of Canada and Australia and five times that of any European Union nation, acco rding to The Sentencing Project, a private group that advocates alternatives to prison. The largest state increase of prisoner popula- tion occurred in Idaho (up 12.9 percent) followed by Wisconsin (up 10.9 percent) and Colorado (up 9.5 percent). Eight states and the District of Columbia had declining numbers of prisoners, led by Rhode Island (down 12.8 percent), the District (down 12 percent) and Massachusetts (down 3.8 percent). Beck noted the decline in the District refl ected transfers of prisoners to from local to federal authorities. California law enforcement officials reported last month that their prison population had declined slightly since the middle of last year, the first decrease after two decades of spira ling growth. The Justice De- partment report also found that at the end of last year: About one in every 11 black males in their late 20s was serving a sentence of a year or more in a state or federal prison. Privately operated facilities held 71,200 prisoners. Texas operated the largest prison system with more than 163,000 inmates, followed closely by California.

SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) Nearly 1.5 million American children have a mother or father in federal or state prison a figure that has grown in step with the swell- ing of the nation’s prison population, the Justice De- partment reported Wednesday. The department’s Bu- reau of Justice Statistics said that at the end of last year 1,498,800 children under age 18 had a parent in prison in this country. That was a 60 percent increase since 1991 up 562,300 from the 936,500 children in that category then. During th e same interval, the na- tion’s prison population grew by an almost identical 62 percent, to 1,284,894 prisoners in 1999. The 1999 prison population contained 721,500 in- mates who were parents of a minor child. The per- centage of prisoners with children was essentially un- changed 57 percent in 1991 and 56 percent in 1999. A majority of the children with imprisoned parents, 58 percent, was younger than 10 years old, and the aver- age age was 8 years old. As of Dec. 31, 1999, they represented 2.1 percent of the nation’s 72 million mi- nor children.

Among state in- mates, 40 percent of the imprisoned fathers and 60 percent of the mothers reported weekly or more fre- quent contact with their children by phone, mail or visit. At federal prisons, 60 percent of fathers and 70 percent of mothers had such contact weekly or more often. But a majority of state inmates 57 percent of fathers and 54 percent of mothers reported never hav- ing had a personal visit with their children since being locked up. Among federal inmates, 44 percent of fa- thers and 42 percent of mothers reported no visits with children after incarceration. As of 1997, a majority of all inmates 62 percent of state prisoners and 84 percent of federal ones were held more than 100 miles from their last place of resi- dence. But far more state inmates, 17 percent, than federal prisoners, 7 percent, were housed within 50 miles of their last home. Like the overall inmate population, imprisoned par- ents were overwhelmingly male, 93 percent, and pre- dominantly held in state prisons, 89 percent, rather than in federal ones, 11 percent. More than 80 percent of all inmate parents reported having a child now liv- ing with the child’s other parent; about 20 percent said grandparents or other relatives were caring for a child of theirs and 2 percent had a child in a foster home or institution.

Prior to imprisonment, fewer than half, 46 percent, of all inmate parents reported living with any of their minor children.

Straight away there is a problem with a society that locks up one in twelve of its wo rkers. Can it be true that there is a criminal in every family group in America? The facts show that you have a rela tive or friend that has had a serious encounter with the law, if in fact it wasn’t you, your- self. Is it hard to break the law? The first thing to re- member is “ignorance of the law is no excuse.” However the law is a mass of paper. All the laws put together in books take up a full building th e size of the New York Met- ropolitan Museum. Then each law is interpreted by the court and put into volumes. The California 90 interpretations alone take 250 feet of shelf sp ace. These laws are revised and interpreted on a daily basis. A person is expected to know and understand these laws. Then there are the admin- istrative codes, which are not made by your elected repre- sentatives but are passed into law by administrators (Praeto- rian’s lackeys) without your approval or even knowledge. These administrative sections are often more voluminous than the enabling laws themselves. You are expected to know these laws as well. Then there are the civil laws that   90 Called Cal. 1 from 1849 thru Cal. IV as of 2001,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 155 can put you in jail. These laws are often insidious and fatal. Let us examine just one minor aspect of civil law called “The Family Code.” The Family Code You would almost expect a group of laws with this heading to be something that binds families together wouldn’t you. Just the opposite, the Family Code is the mechanism from destroying marriages and separating spouses from each other and children from one or both of their parents. In California there are one hundred and ninety five official Judicial Council law forms for separating fami- lies and not a single official Judicial Council law form for maintaining the marital contract. The Family Code is now enforced by the Federal Government 91 . A typical scenario runs like this: • Mama is unhappy with a perceived slight by Papa. (This scene is reversible, just replace Papa with Mama) • Mama’s jealous friends tell her she doesn’t have to put up with this abuse, get a divorce. • Mama gets a lawyer whose real interest is in pursu- ing a fee and not remedying a problem. • The longer the case takes the more money Mr. Law- yer makes. It doesn’t make sense to settle. • The marriage contract and/or marriage vows are completely ignored and not even dealt with.   91 see OMB 0979-0154 Order/Notice to withhold income for child sup- port http://www.lawca. com/family.html"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" Page 156 • The first thing the lawyer does is ask for a protective order to keep Papa away. The court routinely grants this. The protective order keeps Papa away from the family so that reconciliation is impossible it also or- ders Papa to turn in his guns to the local police 92 . If he ignores this order he is immediately a felon in possession of a firearm. • The court in the thinly disguised reason to protect the children now orders th e split up (a no fault di- vorce). • The court orders Papa to get and maintain a job commensurate with his best potential to earn money. Now Papa can’t even sl ow down and give up his high-pressure job and become the artist he always wanted to be. He must continue to do the two hour commute that put him in the high tax bracket which gives the high child support payments in the first place. • Papa is ordered to pay child support (often com- pletely out of reason). • Mama now holds the children hostage against pay- ment of child support. • Mama, on advice of her girlfriends, now uses child support to continue her battle with Papa. • Papa, who is now an unconvinced (as of yet) felon for failing to turn in his gun, misses a child support payment because he can’t keep up the pace and doesn’t have the incentive to continue.   92 In California this order is automatically given without even asking. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 157 • The court jails Papa for failure to pay support. • The court pulls all of Papa’s professional licenses and his driving license to boot. • The court demands Papa pay even though he is in jail. Papa can’t do it. And the court turns the non- payment into a felony and threatens Papa with seri- ous prison time. • While Papa is in jail, Mama snitches that Papa still has a gun. • New charges are filed against Papa. • Papa flees the state. • The Feds catch up with Papa 93 . • Papa becomes one of over six million people in the prison system. • When Papa gets out one of three things happen: 1. Papa becomes a wino dead beat and goes in and out of prison for the rest of his life. 2. Papa “ takes up arms against a sea of repression ” and shoots it out with whoever is handy. 3. Papa goes totally underground and makes his money in cash-only transactions thus depriving society of his best input. Is this an unlikely scenario ? Not at all, it happens all the time with this twist. B ecause the Praetorians are al- lowed to put their spin on the story, Papa is now a violent offender because a gun is involve d and Papa is now a three- strike loser. Slavery. Officially.

The law of reversal as enunciated by Philip Atkinson was predicted nicely by Aynn Rand in the 1930's. When a civilization declines it is not getting stronger and cleverer but sillier and weaker; it has gone into reverse. This overall effect is the result of a reversal in every aspect of the community: the worst pe ople get rewarded while the best get penalized. Promotion will regularly be awarded to the least competent, while the most competent will be ig- nored or disgraced. Governments will misgovern, courts must promote injustice, the education system can only spread delusion, etc. The society is no longer engaged in creating a hu- man heaven on earth, but is earnestly constructing the very opposite, however this can never be acknowledged because lies replace truth. What makes people poor? What makes people rich? Actually Darwin has the answer.

However an"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" Page 160 outside event 94 occurred that knocked him off the high perch and put him and his brethren into extinction. What has this to do with the current situation? At the risk of being dubbed callous I must make this observa- tion. The human species 95 scientifically is just another band of critters here on this plan et making its way through evolu- tion. Except for the extremely brief time in existence, hu- manity is a very successful breed. It goes without further proof that humanity is at the very top of the food chain. Now what could possibly annihilate this powerful species? Another comet? Possibly. But closer in time is the interruption of the survival of the species by an outside event. What is that event: None other than humanity itself. Humanity has endowed itself with a disingenuous 96 hubris 97 that declares that it is not natural selection that makes peo- ple poor it is luck that makes them poor and it is not natural selection that makes people rich it is luck that makes them rich. True enough there is a certain amount of chance that enters the picture just as T-Rex was a chance mutation that took advantage of his luck. So despite the lessons of paleontology and the wis- dom of the scientific method and the obvious lessons gleaned from Darwin, we buck the trend of survival. The Praetorians cajole us into believing that it is for the benefit   94 Some say a comet that smacked into the Gulf of Mexico others say methane hydrate.

A no- ble sentiment for the short term at best. It is a foolish endeavor to denigrate the abilities of the poor, and there are many obvious exceptions to this rule, but I maintain that: “Genera lly people are poor through their own ineptitude.” And the coro llary “Generally people are rich because of their ability and aptitude.” There are obvi- ous exceptions 98 to these rules where some rich inherit wealth and some poor are destitute because of infirmities and I therefore insert the word “generally” to cover such situations. By and large incompetence or ineptitude appears to be rewarded at the expense of the able and competent 99 . It doesn’t take much extrapolation to realize that the encour- agement of poorness at the expe nse of richness will in short   98 I do not except people who gain w ealth by craft and guile because these are predatory in nature and ar e covered by Darwin’s principle. There is another corollary to this axiom. There are those poor people who by craft and guile sustain themselves at the public trough, and these persons are also predatory in nature and are also covered by Darwin’s principle. Unfortunately neither of these exceptional classes contributes to the survival of the species and ma y in fact hasten the inevitable col- lapse. 99 The U.S. is ranked number one among the seventeen leading indus- trial nations with the largest percentage of their populations in poverty: (United Nations Human Development Report 1998, N.Y.C.)

We now examine an interesting subject: technology. Technology like the steam locomotive is slow getting start- ing but once it is up to speed and on the downgrade it is al- most unstoppable. Society has gone from not one single airplane in 1902 to the condition nowadays, just one hundred years later, to the unthinkable proposition of doing without them. The same is true for personal computers. Prior to 1975 no- body could conceive of a possi ble use for them. The only use for computers in those days was to do payrolls and com- pute weapons analysis. And so we arrive at toda y’s societal impact. Many people would rather you took aw ay their spouse than their personal computer. The axiom of this proposition is com- paring the divorce rate to the e-mail rate. They are roughly proportional. The higher the e-mail the higher the divorce rate. However even this analogy is poor. E-mail is out- stripping all comparisons to any other event in human his- tory just as divorce previously has. Going back to the analog of comparing Rome to America. In ancient Rome the Roman citizen was basically concerned with three things. Farming, politics and war. The lower class of Roman soci ety was a welfare recipient who received his ration of bread, wine and circus which roughly translates to today’s welfare (workfare to the politi-"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" Page 172 cally correct), and free TV encompassing sensational news stories and reality shows. Reality my ass. There is absolutely no reality for a couch potato whose muscles and reflexes have been atro- phying since childhood. All of hi s experiences are gained from video games and TV soaps and reality shows. His re- ality is merely the vicarious second hand re-creation of other people’s lives or more of ten a made for TV scenario with unreal portrayals of unlikely events. He watches football and his muscles twitch in syn- chrony to the action. This raises his adrenaline level with- out the compensating physical exertion and leads to an early heart attack. The wife is glad to be ri d of him, now she can watch the soaps without interruption by the remote changer. The average Roman did his twenty years in the Le- gion and then retired to farming. Meanwhile the folks back home did their usual politicking and circus attendance, ate their free bread and drank their free wine. Technology, advanced as it were for the times, con- tinued at a linear pace until th e dark ages where it lan- guished in the backwaters of history until the renaissance. It emerged from the renaissance with exponential growth where we now sit at the current peak with no end in sight. This growth is due to the current ease of communi- cating knowledge. Religion tried to put the brakes on this locomotive ala Galielo et al and it resulted in a reformation beyond their most horrible expectations. The Romans had their slaves to do their work just as we have our technology to do our s. They had slaves, some"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 173 trained for cooking, some trained for child care, some trained for household chores.

Is happiness derived from technology? Is technol- ogy a tool in which to e voke envy in your neighbor? Should you envy your neighbor’s new Lexus? Or is tech- nology the means to reap bountiful harvests from nature and quell the hunger in our bellies and satiate the need for un- derstanding and education? I submit that happiness is radiated from the com- munion of your family, the respect, the adoration of your mate and children as you introduce them to your unique view of the world. Add the newfound joys of learning your mates unique perspective on life and the assimilation of knowledge and care adapted to your own private and family consequences. This is happiness. Not the unending travail to keep up and avoid the whip. Where is the solution? Technology. You can be its master or you can be its slave. Fritz Lang recites this dichotomy beautifully in his 1927 movie “Metropolis”. This world of Metropolis con- sists of two divisions; one is the bright upper level with sky- scrapers and fabulous technology. These inhabitants are the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" Page 174 masters of technology. The ot her division are the drudges and the under-class. They inhabit the other world, the dark nether world of slavery. They engage in slavish endeavors for the benefit of the upper world in a continuum of abject poverty. They are the slaves of technology. Pushing and pulling levers and buttons in mindless disarray of actions that are observed by none but the machine. The story shows that neith er class is aware of the other class. Maria of the upper class discovers the under class, the nether world, and attempts to organize them into resistance. Just as in today’s society she is defeated when a robotic mannequin of Maria is released to lull the workers into subservience. Who are the upper class and who are the under-class today? Assuming you are not currently dropped out or underground the answer is simple. If you have spent the weeks before April 15 of every year in peace and content- ment you are in the upper class regardless of what you do for a living. If, on the other hand you have fretful sleep and nagging recriminations the weeks before April 15, you are the under-class. Generally speaking praetorians do not worry about paying tax, they worry about collecting it. Everybody else has the opposite concern. Praetorians, however are not the creators of technol- ogy. They are the usurpers of technology. They subvert technology to their own devices and tax the creativity and efforts of the technologists. The technologists are not nec- essarily in the upper-class.

Does it matter? An astronomy professor was giving an introductory lecture to a group of several hundred freshmen at a promi- nent university. In the course of a long winded dissertation he said in passing: “... and so in three billion years, our sun will become a super nova and vaporize this very planet and everything else within a radius of ten light years, to atoms.” From the rear of the hall a terrified voice cried out; “Oh no! What did you say?” Nonplused, the professor repeated: “In three billion years , our sun will burn everything to atoms.” “Oh, Thank God,” came the relieved sob from the rear: “I thought you said three million years.” This anecdote brings into focus the ridiculous as- sumption that the Federal Government and its Praetorian Legion can make any progress against our fateful deadline by passing and enforcing laws for or against ecology. Laws deemed by our beneficent government good for human ecology may be harmful to othe r life forms, and our own for that matter. Nature 102 has foreordained our planet, nay our uni- verse’s, fate. We are merely passing spectators. The cock- roaches were here before us and will be here after us. But, they too will be crispy critters three billion years hence.   102 Call it God if you wish."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" Page 178 If the pundits have it right, in 25 billion years and long after our sun goes super nova 103 , the universe will end in a Big Crunch anyway. W ho can hang around to find out? I don't have the patience. In the great scheme of things does ozone depletion, global warming, deforestation and complacency matter? Actually, yes, it does. It is man's nature to provide for his offspring, and this is the underlying cause of the quandary: • Why do we concern ourselves with global warm- ing, ozone depletion and deforestation 104 , which will not affect anybody for many generations? • Why are we unconcerned with the fate of our next generation, and our very own survival, things that happen as we watch and can be changed right this moment? The answer is quite simple. The Praetorians do not wish immediate problems to be solved. The real solution to most immediate problems invol ves getting rid of the Praeto- rians. How does a praetorian avoid the axe? Simple, find a problem, or better yet; create a problem, that can only be solved centuries or millenium from now. Focus all of the countries creative resources on attempting to solve that problem. Then, sit back and continue to gather power, or avoid blame. Ancient Greece had some fabulous myths. America has our own myths.

The more things change the more they stay the same."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 179 Ozone Depletion Ozone depletion is dealt with in a previous chapter and although chlorofluorocarbons may in fact contribute somewhat to the depletion they are not the true problem. Interestingly enough, ozone production seems to be a prob- lem to the ecological elitists. Ozone is one of the pollutants that environmentalists are concerned about. Seemingly the same stuff that is worried a bout as missing in the upper at- mosphere is considered an environmental hazard down here on the ground. Now ozone seem s to be both good and bad depending on where it is found. Bu t, ozone is created in the upper atmosphere by ultraviolet light striking an oxygen molecule. This very same ozone molecule prevents ultravio- let radiation from getting through to the ground where it will give us sunburn. OK, what ’s the big deal? Reportedly CFC’s (the stuff used for auto air conditioners 105 ) gets up in the atmosphere where ultraviolet radiation supposedly hits it and it breaks off a chlorine atom . This chlorine atom com- bines with the oxygen atom and becomes resistant to separa- tion by ultraviolet light. What? You mean to te ll me the small amount of CFC’s released by earth’s population is causing a problem? Actually there is a group of scie ntists that say this is not true. They claim other naturally occurring processes, be- yond our means to control, are depleting the ozone layer and it part of a natural cycle.

Many persons suspect that the tax on CFC (the price went from .89/lb to $20.00/lb in eight years, the difference due to taxes) is the real reason for the ozone layer concern. There are many reasons for ozone depletion chief among them are sun spot activity. The accompanying chart shows that sunspot activity has increased at about the same rate as the ozone hole over Antarctica for the comparable dates. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 181 Global Warming The same may be true for global warming. The car- bon dioxide in our atmosphere comes from many sources chief among them has been exhaust gas from the animal kingdom. Much of this carbon has been stored in the ground for millions of years as plant and animal matter and was covered over by sediment over millions of years. Stud- ies of glaciers show that th e carbon dioxide in our atmos- phere has risen and fallen over the past glacial life spans. Much to everyone’s surprise the temperature was not related to the carbon dioxide percentage. For whatever reason a spin has been put on this cy- cle to show that a need exists to control greenhouse gasses. Studies have shown that methane hydrate produces more greenhouse gasses per year than a ll of our fuel oil and coal burning combined. In fact about 10,000 years ago a single methane hydrate eruption in Norway released more green- house gas into the atmosphere than all the fossil fuel burned during the history of man. A nother matter of fact — Doro- thy Pak, a researcher at the Un iversity of California, Santa Barbara reports that this phenomenon repeats at odd inter- vals over millions of years. It also appears that the most recent eruption (other than Norway’s eruption) may have been the cause of bipedals to appear in the Paleocene era. Far from methane hydrate being a culprit, Japan has recently undertaken to drill the ocean bed to extract methane hydrate as a source of fossil fuel for their own energy needs.

It was easy enough to slam the brakes on the cheap- est form of energy mankind has ever achieved, atomic power. There are more deaths per year in coal mining acci- dents than all deaths combined in the history of production of electricity by atomic power. Surely a way to tax fuel to its extreme limit can be found. Wonderful inroads have been made under the guise of th e Mid-Eastern Cartel taxes. Nobody revolted then. Why not pull out all the stops and go for the brass ring? Tax fuel to its asymptotic limit. This is the limit at which you, your wife, and your children work constantly to be able to pay the tax to barely sustain life. You think you are near that limit now? Guess what? You have a ways to go the way the praetorians calculate. The Christian Science Monitor reports: WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2001 Ed Hunt “Between 1996 and 2000, British Petroleum - which controls a big chunk of Alaska's oil resources - shipped oil to Asia as a way to systematically reduce the supply of oil going to refiners in the US. They cre- ated a domestic oil shortage - thus artificially inflating gas and oil prices here on the West Coast. Hard to believe? It has been done before.

This in spite of the over dramatized nove l of Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” where life continued on in America without gov- ernment intervention. Life seemed to go along in America without much need for the parental superv ision of the government. Con- trast this with the authoritarian supervision of the govern- ment in the Soviet Union during the same period. Was the Soviet model successful? Although the goals of Communism were ideal “ From each according to his means, to each according to his needs .” It turned out there were a few very nee dy praetorians and many, many proletariat with means. Often the means were meager to the point of starvation but from those meanfuls the needy took. Any time a political system is generated with euphemistic ideals it will be subverted. The Russian Revo- lution was subverted with slogans and purges. The slogans pass for what we today call Political Correctness. The purges started gradually and ended up in a full-scale terror campaign. What would bring on the terror? Nobody knew. A chance word, an impolite glance any of a hundred things would send you to the gulag or worse. Today just say the wrong thing in an airline waiting queue and guess what will happen next? Perhaps you won’t be shot outright but you will be inoculated in the terror ap- proach to societal control.

Soon you are seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist on a weekly basis that never seems to uncover the root of the problem. The reason your problem cannot be uncovere d is that you don’t wish to reveal that you are a potential politically correct noncon- formist. Here is the crux of the politically correct scenario. Nobody wants to be perceived as politically incorrect. So as a counteraction you learn to “ Love the Bomb 106 ” as it were. Everyone starts to use politically correct speech and do po- litically correct things. Soon you are donating one dollar from your income tax to political campaigns. Remember it won’t cost you any tax after all. I suppose those political contributions grow from th e ground or something. They certainly aren’t earned by anybody. It says so right on your 1040A tax form. Now you are coercing you neighbors to be politi- cally correct and recommending your favorite analyst for their newfound anxieties.

Well — Hitler came damn close to it in 1945. There are some interesting analogs of the limits to chaotic endeavor. One involve s the age-old fermentation of alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer. If yeast is set into either grape juice or grain and wa- ter it will begin to multiply in a seemingly chaotic manner. This is called fermentation. Just as every living organism produces waste so does the yeast. The wastes in fermenta- tion are carbon dioxide (the bubbl y component of beer and sparkling wine) and, of course , alcohol. These waste com- ponents are the very same components that make these bev- erages desirable to us. However these waste products are deadly to the yeast just as our own waste products would kill us if we wallowed in them . The yeast will grow in a limited environment such as a bottle or cask until they reach an asymptotic limit (that word again). That limit is reached when an equilibrium is reached wherein all the yeast has killed itself from the waste they just produced. What is left can no longer ferment and is essentially static. However if the mixture isn’t perfectly ster ile and there are certain bacte- ria present, another reaction takes place wherein the newly created wine or beer will be converted to vinegar (acetic acid). The acetic acid being a waste product of the bacilli also goes on to kill the bacilli themselves and the process eventually stops. At some poi nt the spoilt wine is discov- ered and is often thrown out as waste. This process is analogous to our present society. We, a microcosm of society (the grape juice analog), are infiltrated with platitudes and grants (the yeast analog) and slowly we convert our political environment into a seem-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 199 ingly favorable substance (the wine analog) which seems beneficial to the greater good. However left to chance (the chaos analog) the praetorians (the bacilli analog) enter the scene and devour the product of our labor (the alcohol ana- log) (and the carbon dioxide an alog they subvert to green- house propaganda) and convert all of us to waste (the acetic acid analog). Over time the waste is discovered due to the effects of chaos and a revoluti on throws out the waste or we enter a new dark ages. Thus history, as is wont to do, repeats itself.

Simple. From ancient to modern times, religion and rulers have gone hand in hand. In the very beginning of civilization, when men gathered together to gain the advantages of division of labor, a single person was (self?) selected to lead the pack. This person, slowly at first, used the mystic arts as his tools in trade. It didn’t hurt to have the appa rent support of the unknown in his quest to organize and maintain his flock. Before man- kind learned to write he learned to scheme . A little slight of hand went a long way toward control of his followers for their own good or for the leader’s good 118 . Following the path of civilization (western civiliza- tion anyway), historical record encompasses only five or six thousand years from then to now. Along this path every leader found an accommodation with the notion of God. From Ur in Mesopotamia to The Holy Roman Empire in Europe, leadership was passed directly from (the) God(s) to the ruler. The ancient Egyptians and then the Romans adopted the notion that the Phar aoh or Caesar was in fact a   118 Whichever was most beneficial to the controller."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" Page 202 God. This fit in neatly with the notion of an orderly uni- verse. How did this state of affairs come to be? Well, early on, it became necessary to use force to accomplish some of the less pleasant tasks. The laborers were forced to work in mines and various other unpleasant endeavors. Inducements gave way to force to get the work done. Soon (in historic times anyway) even force wasn’t enough to keep a slave toiling endlessly until death. The slave decided it was per- haps better to die earlier that later and just lay down to die and/or be beaten to death. The leader quickly recognized the intelligence of this and fretted over the loss of a valuable commodity, slave labor. What threat could he possibly make that would keep a person enduring the slow agonizing death of grinding slavery? A worse, and endless, existence to come, of course was the perfect answer to the slave-masters dream. Who could possible refute this noti on without fear of damnation for disbelief? Therein lies the pact. The government and religion makes a pact. Religion creates an afterlife where the results are determined on how faithfully you follow the rules. The rules are twofold: the secular and the religious. Both sides agree to enforce the rules. Break the King’s law and you break God’s law. Break God’ s law and you bring the wrath of the King. A near calamity happened in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh Akhenaten 119 decided to eliminate God’s middlemen, the priests, and start a new religion. The previous system had worked neatly for five or six thousand years. During th is time it was impossible for   119 Originally Amenhotep IV Died c. 1358 B.C"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 203 the vulgate 120 to make neither head nor tail out of the mumbo jumbo that was used by the priests. As long as no- body understood what was happening nobody could take refuge from the laws. Akhenaton threw a wrench into the gears of the old system. N eedless to say, Akhenaton didn’t last very long. His famous son Tutankhamen (a.k.a. King Tut) didn’t last long either. There is disputable evidence that Iye, his vizier, did the dirty deed and “removed this meddlesome” nuisance to the priesthood and the previously entrenched powers 121 . The first tiny crack in the system came when Guten- berg 122 invented movable type and started the communica- tion revolution. Now anybody could get a copy of a book and eventually figure out what it meant. It was a slow start but a significant one. Soon a reformation began. However the reformation maintained the basic precepts. Hell for any- one who broke the mold or the indecipherable rules. An occasional Galileo pokes his head up only to have it chopped off. It was hundreds of years be fore the first glimmering of free thought broke through si x millennia of fog and mis- direction. Onto the stage steps Charles Darwin 123 with his “ Origin of the Species” and the concept of survival of the fittest. We now come upon the anvil upon which this slav- ery of the past is broken. I use the word slavery in every   120 vulgate: Latin for common tongue or “the people” 121 Whatever they were called befo re the Romans came up with the word “praetorian.” 122 about 1550 123 1809-1882"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" Page 204 sense of the word. We are slaves to a system that takes every penny we earn each year from January to June to pay a tax that nobody can understand and nobody can predict how it is or will be spent or what the tax will be next year. We are slaves when laws are passed to prevent sui- cide. We are slaves when la ws are passed to prevent harm to ourselves by making it a crim e not to wear a seatbelt. The only reason the state would keep us from harming no- body but ourselves is in fact we are slaves to the state. Then, in fact, the state has a vested interest in maintaining it’s chattel in good condition to breed more slaves and in- creasing the state’s wealth through greater labor and more taxes. So how does the system falter? It falters by unlim- ited communication. The Internet. The evolution has had its starts and failures. Communism held sway as long as nobody could communicate. That state of affairs was de- molished in the early 1990’s when it was impossible to keep the subjugated under communicative restraint. When propaganda became universally recognized for what it was Pravda and Isvestia became open jokes and underground newspapers became widely circulated. The propaganda of the Nazis and the Communists were well oiled and insidious but fallible. The propaganda mechanism here in America is far more ambitious than any ever undertaken in history. It has the support of the un- knowing slaves themselves. This book itself is an indication of the wide spread extent of communication. You found this book on your own. I didn’t advertise it.

These secrets are to keep the taxpayer in the dark. Why is the price of a Montgomery Ward hammer secret? Because when the public finds out that General Dynamics charges the US Navy $750 for a hammer that can be bought locally for $7.50 there will be trouble. Actually General Dynamics doesn’t make at $642.50 profit. There are lobbyists, and many rows deep of praetorians and their minions to be paid.

Therefore the praetorians in deference to the under- lying principle of “keep quiet at all cost” label everything in sight secret . Not only do they make it secret but also they swear their minions and contractors to secrecy. I was a nuclear weapons specialist in nineteen fifty- three. Before they issued me a Top-Secret “Q” clearance I had to swear under the Espionage act of nineteen seventeen amended nineteen thirty-four and the Atomic Secrets act of nineteen forty-six never to rev eal any material marked clas- sified. So what was so secret? In addition to how to make an Atomic Bomb, there were thousands of inconsequential details like the pay rate for jan itors and gardeners. God help you if you ever discovered anything amiss, like incompe- tence or graft. It was classified and you would be castrated or worse if you breathed a word. Worse yet if you didn’t have a clearance but found out about an untoward event and let it into the daylight you were branded a “Whistle Blower.” What happens to “Whistle Blowers”? Are they re- warded? Negative, they are punished. However if a “whistle blower” can anonymously publish his information, eureka! There are thousands of such publications daily on the Internet. There are endless rumors and scandals. How did Clinton’s peccadilloes ever come to the surface? For y ears his type of shenanigans were commonplace in the White House with no repercus- sions.

Gosh, and I thought I had the inside track on the Internet in 1962 when I worked on the design of the Armed Services’ ComLogNet system which was the precursor to ARPANET the forerunner of the Internet. Soon no secret will be safe. That may be the reason for the crackdown on personal liber ties. Every air traveler has a personal anecdote about ai r travel since the 911 inci- dent. This is the praetorian’s basis for clamping down on personal liberties. Physicians have a saying about physical functions. “ Use it or lose it .” This is particularly true regarding per- sonal liberty. “ Use it or lose it .” Every tyrant and dictator in history used the same method. Curtail personal liberty under the guise of protec- tion against the enemy. Their motto regarding personal lib- erty is simply: “Abuse it.” Communication can be the savior if used properly. The other side of the coin is that your personal information is available for any prying eyes to view. These prying eyes are, of course, official prying eyes. They are only there to help you 125 . Properly used this may be good. But when was the last time “officials” did any good for you? Will communication be a savior? Yes but only if we will it to be.

What the praetorians will do to protect their turf against what they see is the decline of their power through communications? It’s not pretty. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 So how do the praetorians corral these digital dissi- dents? They do their thing, create a problem, agitate for a solution, respond to the demand and pass a law. That law is really designed to prosecute free speech on the Internet and not protect copyright holders rights. This law is so far encompassing that even noted universities are caught in its web.

Executive Summary Since they were enacted in 1998, the “anti-circumvention” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), codified in section 1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as Congress envisioned. Congress meant to stop copyright pirates from defeating anti-piracy protec- tions added to copyrighted works, and to ban “black box” devices intended for that purpose. 1 In practice, the anti-circumvention provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities, rather than to stop copyright piracy. As a result, the DMCA has developed into a serious threat to three important public pol- icy priorities: Section 1201 Chills Free Expression and Scien- tific Research . Experience with section 1201 demonstrates that it is being used to stifle free speech and scientific re- search. The lawsuit against 2600 magazine, threats against Princeton Professor Edward Felten’s team of researchers, and prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov have chilled the legitimate activi- ties of journalists, publishers, scientists, students, programmers, and members of the public."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" Page 210 Section 1201 Jeopardizes Fair Use . By banning all acts of circumvention, and all tech- nologies and tools that can be used for circumven- tion, section 1201 grants to copyright owners the power to unilaterally eliminate the public’s fair use rights. Already, the music industry has begun de- ploying “copy-protected CDs” that promise to cur- tail consumers’ ability to make legitimate, personal copies of music they have purchased. Section 1201 Impedes Competition and Innova- tion . Rather than focusing on pirates, many copyright owners have chosen to use the DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. For example, Sony has invoked section 1201 to protect their monopoly on Playstation video game consoles, as well as their “regionalization” system limiting users in one coun- try from playing games legitimately purchased in another. This document collects a number of reported cases where the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA have been invoked not against pirates, but against consumers, scien- tists, and legitimate competitors. It will be updated from time to time as additional cases come to light. The latest version can always be obtained at www.eff.org . For the complete white paper on this subject see Ap- pendix H.

The praetorians are not as stupid as it would appear from their ramshackle ap- proach to subversion of what is good and decent in Amer- ica. This law was instituted to stop those very persons who were able to bring down the USSR: The savior, com- munication. However, as usual, the praetorian elite is just one step behind technology. It is utterly simple for the commu- nicators to move their sites offshore and remain incommu- nicado from their pursuers. Th is is the one unintended con- sequence the praetorians hadn’ t counted on. The loss of revenue and prestige from the Internet traffic in America and the international ridicule brought on by their laughable efforts to curtail free speech. The Soviets tried it in a more open handed way. They have since learned: underground web sites are more harmful than censorship. Underground news, rumor or not, is given more credence that censored news ever was. China is the new big player on Internet censorship. They are now learning to rue th e day they forced their crit- ics underground. Who will win? Ask the ancient Egyptians, Romans, Babylonians and the other vanish ed empires.

In ancient, nay even medieval, times knowledge was passed on to offspring by word of mouth. If your father was a carpenter you were foreordained to be a carpenter also. It wasn’t until the age of printing and increasing lit- eracy that the acceleration of knowledge placed its plow- share to the soil of an underu tilized but highly fertile human mind. This increase of knowledge will reach, at its current rate of acceleration, its asympto tic (that word again) limit in the twenty second century wher e the redesign of the human brain will allow for the expansion, without limit, of human longevity and knowledge. Therein lies the quandary. Politically correct thought espouses the axiom “it is bad for us to try to create a better human being.” However I cannot foresee a problem wherein a healthier, longer lived, more robust population is any danger except to the system that requires, dull, thought- less, short lived people to carry out the praetorian’s man- dates.

Given: • Praetorians use the system to gain advantage for themselves or their paradigms 128 . • In turn they use the government as a tool to gain that advantage. • However government is merely a reflection of the public’s taste and morals (or so we would hope). • Whether or not that reflection is merely a recitation, through propaganda, of a deeply rooted conspiracy or merely the natural outgrowth of unlimited power remains to be told. • Almost everyone belongs to some kind of group that receives government grants. • These groups hire lobbyists to garner government largesse. • The government taxes all other groups to support these lobbying efforts.   128 I use this poor choice of words becau se the praetorians are so fond of it."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" Page 216 • The praetorians support these lobbyists in order to obtain the funds to remain in office. • These lobbyists require that the praetorians be sup- ported in order to receive their huge salaries to per- form their lobbying effort. • Everyone supports the fallacious theory of “support- ing the common good” out of fear of losing his or her own benefits. Some support it through a “feel good” approach to morality by using other peoples tax money to feel good. Either way produces an ac- celerating spiral into the black hole of “ultimate slave of the state.” To Find: • The solution to the decay of American civilization? Solution: • Not until the public comes to realize that there is no such thing as a free lunch will a solution be mani- fest. Unfortunately, there is no one willing to risk political suicide in order to proclaim this basic fact. Recognize this basic fact : • In any democracy - Fifty one percent of the popula- tion can enslave the other forty nine percent as long as they think they are exempt from the rules they en- courage to be imposed on the others. And recognize this as well: You are always going to be in the other forty nine percent in some major way or another even as you are in the fifty one percent in a minor way. Example :"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 217 • You may be a small farmer receiving a crop subsidy, while paying the hidden tax of an import tariff on steel and various and assorted special interest taxes.

In other words you must first become elected as a congressman, then a senator, then a vice-president and finally a president. No president may sit for more than one year or so. After which time, if he so wishes, he may sit on a panel of former presi- dents in an advisory capacity as a type of retirement for life. Every legislator must maintain a voting web site where he posts the current bills he is considering and he must request his constituent’s i nput. Any input that is 66% or more of the voting public’s attitude on a subject is bind- ing on him as to his vote on th e proposed legislation. Those persons who do not choose to vote on such items simply allow the other and more interested persons to have a greater voice in the matter.

His selection is hidden just as passwords are today to keep prying eyes blinded A slate of offices is presented for that particular voter’s local or national area. The voter never has to vote for all offices at the same time. The voter selects the office he/she wishes to vote for and a list of candidates pops up with a link to their political agenda and party affiliation if there is one. Clicking on the agenda give a synopsis and a detailed description if one is requested. The voter is given all the time in the world to proceed. The voter can examine the minutiae connected with any selected candidate. With the instant connectivity of th e web ... a candidate’s back- ground, prior voting record and va riances from his platform can be examined. (All this can be done today but not at the instant of voting or in the privacy of one’s own home or with the availability at one place and one time.) The system is encrypted (naturally) to protect your privacy and the vote is tallie d without any method to know who it was that voted.

This eliminates the need for absentee ballots and the attendant waste of time and resources. You can vote from anywhere in the world. Everyone of legal age is entitled to vote including prisoners. Inasmuch as they are a segment of the population who are directly impacted by the legal system their views should be heard. If there is fear that they may upset an elec- tion in their own favor shouldn’ t such a reaction be gauged by the political forces that pass laws affecting such persons? If their number numbers continue to grow, perhaps this is one way to replace some of our arcane laws that lock people up for unfathomable reasons. If lobbyists and special interest groups are to be tol- erated they should spend their money on public advertising aimed at the voter, not aimed at the politician. Will this ever be implemented? Perhaps it will, but not until after the inevitable fall or revolution.

Throughout most of the century prior to 1980, the incarceration rate, and the raw numbe r of people behind bars, has risen and fallen with wars, depressions, economic booms and busts, as well as with the rise and fall of the crime rate. But as the following charts illus- trate, the last thirty years, and pa rticularly, the last decade have wit- nessed the kind of huge jumps in prison commitments that bear no his- torical comparison. 1 As the doors to new cellblocks opened, the number of prisoners and jail inmates soared, in good times and bad times, inde- pendent of whether the crime rate rose or fell. As this analysis by the Washington, D.C.-based Justice Policy Institute (JPI) shows, some time in 2001 America will have two million adult citizens in prison and jail.   135 Average yearly wage of 1,881,379 locked up prisoners 136 http://www.census.gov/statab/www/part3.html#employ 137 http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/lbb/memb ers/reports/summary/INMATEC.ht m 138 http://www.cjcj.org/terms.html"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 249 1.

The Correlation Between Crime Rates and Imprisonment Policies The connection between incarceration and crime rates appears as elusive at the end of the 90s as it has been in previous dec- ades. There is little correlation between states with skyrocketing incarceration rates and the recent crime declines witnessed across the country. The \"New York Miracle\" - the sharp drops in homicides and violent crime rates experienced by America's larg- est city between 1992 and 1997 - have occurred at the same time that New York State had the se cond slowest growing prison sys- tem in the country, and at a time when the city's jail system down- sized. 9 New York's modest prison growth pr ovides a solid contrast to the explosive use of incarceration in other states. During the same 1992-97 period, California's prison population grew by 30%, or about 270 inmates per week, compared to New York State's more modest 30 inmates a week. Between 1992 and 1997, New York State's violent crime rate fell by 38.6%, and its murder rate by 54.5%. By contrast, California's violent crime rate fell by a more modest 23%, and its murder rate fell by 28%. 10 Put another way, New York experienced a percentage drop in homicides which was half again as great as the percentage drop in Califor- nia's homicide rate, despite the fact that California added 9 times as many inmates per week to its prisons as New York. 3. The Race to Incarcerate 11 "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" Page 252 As has been well documented by Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Washington, DC-based Sent encing Project, America's in- carceration policies have dispr oportionately impacted minorities, particularly African Americans. In 1997, even though African Americans made up only 13% of the population, half of the 1.2 million state and federal prisoners were African American (548,900). 12 African Americans are imprisoned at 6.6 times the rate of whites (3,253 vs. 491 per 100,000). The nation's impris- onment policies have had their greatest impact among young black men, resulting in alarming rates of incarceration and disen- franchisement: o One in three black men between the ages of 20 and 29 were under some form of criminal justice control (in prison, jail, pa- role or probation) in 1995. 13 Other studies have shown that half the young men in Washington, DC, and more than half of the young men in Baltimore are under criminal justice control; 14 o A black male born in 1991 stood a 29% chance of being im- prisoned at some point in his life, compared to 4 percent for a white male born that year; 15 o 1.4 million African American men, or 13 percent of the black adult male population have lost the right to vote due to their involvement in the criminal justice system. In the states with the most restrictive voting laws, 40 percent of African Ameri- can men are likely to be permanently disenfranchised. 16 4. The Cost of Corrections The human costs of incarceration are matched by the financial drain America's imprisonment policies are having on state and federal budgets. Based on the cons ervative estimate that the 1997 average annual cost continues to hold true, the Justice Pol- icy Institute estimates the follo wing expenditures associated with our incarceration policy: o The total cost of incarcerating Americans in state and federal prisons and jails in 1999 was $38.17 billion, 17 and will ap- proach $40 billion in the year 2000; 18 "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 253 o It will cost Americans $23.74 billion to imprison 1.2 million non-violent offenders in the year 2000. The Justice Policy Institute has previously reported and quantified the staggering costs of imprisoning millions of Americans. The more sig- nificant findings include: o America spends 50% more incarcerating 1.2 million non- violent offenders than the en tire $16.6 billion the federal gov- ernment is currently spending on welfare programs that serve 8.5 million people; 19 o The nation is spending 6 times more to incarcerate 1.2 million nonviolent offenders than the federal government spent on child care for 1.25 million children; 20 o States around the country spent more building prisons than col- leges in 1995 for the first time. There was nearly a dollar-for- dollar tradeoff between corrections and higher education, with university construction funds decreasing by $945 million (to $2.5 billion) while corrections funding increased by $926 mil- lion (to $2.6 billion). 21 During the 1990s, New York State's prison budget grew by $761 million, while its budget for higher education dr opped by $615 million. 22 From 1984 to 1994, California's prison system realized a 209% increase in funding, compared to a 15% increase in state university fund- ing. 23 5.

In sim- ple terms a closed loop system applies a signal to a system and then checks the effect. Th ere are two kinds of open loop systems. Positive feedback and negative feedback. Nega- tive feedback is often errone ously called a closed loop sys- tem. A brief explanation is in order. Consider the ex- tremely simple system of cont rolling the direction of an air- plane where the rudder controls direction and a servomotor turns the rudder. When a signal (perhaps from a compass) tells the rudder to turn right the servomotor pushes all the way to the right regardless of how slightly off course the air- plane is. When the airplane shoots past the intended heading the compass sends a correcting signal the servo slams the rudder in the opposite direction in order to compensate. This is called a bang-bank servo control system. These correc- tions, in addition to wearing out the moving parts rapidly, causes the airplane to dart wildly across the sky in increas- ingly wider angles. This almo st out-of-control approach to autopilot navigation was among the first tried in avionics. The system could not predict the error in advance and adjust the rudder in small increments proportional to the divergence from course. It could only react to an error introduced into the system. Later systems involved the use of high-speed oscillations in turning the rudder back and forth so as to con- tinue a roughly on compass cour se. The rudder was turned"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" Page 260 further and further towards an on course condition until the airplane turned way past the correct course and then a corre- sponding reverse rudder was applied. Because of the dy- namics of the airplane a certain time would lapse until the rudder effect was felt. This time effect was not calculated (nor could it be at the time) and serious over corrections oc- curred. This was called the positive feedback approach. Un- fortunately a serious off-course error caused an out of con- trol positive feedback which lo cked up the rudder in a far right or far left oscillation fr om which no recovery was pos- sible. Eventually the negative feedback system was devel- oped in which a counterbalancing signal was introduced in negative proportion to the off-c ourse positional error. A far off course signal produces a larger opposing motion of the rudder. A small off course signal produces a corresponding small opposing rudder movement. The closer the course came to the desired one the smaller the negative feedback was applied. Apparently the governing bodies of large corpora- tions and governments use the reactive or positive feedback approach. They are quite unable and/or unwilling to curb their natural tendencies to overcorrect a situation. Thus we have the “bang bang” method of regulation. You see this reaction in every day politics.

State of the Union speech: Bush declares war on the world By the Editorial Board 31 January 2002 The State of the Union speech given by George W. Bush Tuesday night was among the most menacing and bellig erent in American history. The US president outlined a program of limitless and perpetual warfare, on every continent, and against any regi me that stands in the way of the rapacious American ruling class. Bush threatened to attack Iran, Iraq and North Korea—mentioning the three countries by name. Despite his apocalyptic warnings about “thou- sands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes,” these countries had nothing to do with the September 11 terrorist attacks, a fact acknowledged even by the US gov- ernment. Instead Bush outlined a new rationale for military action, claiming that Iran, Iraq and North Korea were seeking to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. He declared, “By seeking weapons of mass de- struction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.” “States like these,” he said, “and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.” "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" Page 262 Despite Bush’s attempt to resurrect the rhetoric of World War II in his reference to the “axis of evil,” it is the US government and Bush himself who are following in the footsteps of the Nazis. One would have to go back to the diatribes of Adolph Hitler to find comparable bellicosity in the public declarations of a major world power, and comparable cyni- cism in the lies and provocations employed as justifications for military aggression. A program of world conquest The comparison is an apt one, because like Hitler and the Nazis, Ameri- can militarism has embarked on a cam paign of world c onquest and world domination. The State of the Union speech was a declaration of the un- bridled appetites of the military and of the most ruthless, corrupt and criminal sections of the American ruling elite, who find their direct rep- resentative in George W. Bush. Like Hitler, Bush presents an upside-down view of the world in which small and weak states are mortal thr eats to the most powerful and heavily armed. In 1938-39, Hitler demonized first Czechoslovakia and then Po- land as threats to the national security of Germany, before invading and laying waste to each. In 2002, Bush ta rgets North Korea, Iran and Iraq, declaring, “The United States of America will not permit the world’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world’s most destructive weapons.” In reality, these countries have onl y two things in common—desperate poverty, and longstanding victimization by US imperialism. As for the “world’s most dangerous regime,” its identity should be obvious: it is the government of the United States, a country whose military budget ex- ceeds that of the next nine powers co mbined, a country which has, in the course of the past 12 years, invaded, occupied or attacked a litany of smaller nations: Panama, Haiti, Yugos lavia, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan and now Afghanistan. There are specific reasons for the se lection of the three regimes which Bush named on Tuesday night. North Korea has long been a focus of obsessive hostility on the part of the extreme right elements that make up Bush’s political base, as one of the last remnants of the Cold War con- frontation with the Soviet bloc. Iraq, the most likely target among the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 263 Arab oil-producing countries, represents unfinished business from the regime of Bush’s father, whose failu re to conquer Baghdad and install an American-backed stooge regime has long rankled in Washington. Iran has been in conflict with the United States since the revolution of 1978- 79 that overthrew the US-backed dictatorship of the Shah. But there are two overriding strategic concerns which contribute to the targeting of these three countries fo r American military action—oil, and the preparations for a US war agai nst China, the power which Washing- ton views as its main competitor for influence in north and east Asia. The Middle East and Central Asia possess, between them, more than two thirds of the world’s reserves of oil and natural gas. The US attacked Afghanistan as the first step in a campaign to establish its military posi- tion in Central Asia. Iran has come into direct conflict with this drive by pursuing its own interests in the Persian-speaking regions of western Afghanistan. Iran and Iraq are themselves the second and third largest oil producers in the region, following only Saudi Arabia. From a military standpoint, the netw ork of bases and access rights which the US has established since September 11 resembles more and more a noose tightening around China: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, a nd now the saber-rattling on the Korean peninsula. As the British daily the Guardian noted Wednesday, “Every twist in the war on terrorism seems to leave a new Pentagon outpost in the Asia- Pacific region, from the former USSR to the Philippines. One of the last- ing consequences of the war could be what amounts to a military encir- clement of China.” The newspaper cited the Pentagon’s Quadrennial Defense Review which, without naming China, warned of the danger that “a military competitor with a formidable resource base will emerge in the region,” and called for a polic y that “places a premium on securing additional access and infrastructure agreements.” The scale of US military ambitions is demonstrated by the gargantuan increase in the Pentagon budget that Bush proposed, a staggering $48 billion, an increase larger than the total military budget of any other"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" Page 264 country. And his call for every American to sacrifice two years in public service clearly suggests the logic of this program of unbridled milita- rism—the restoration of compulsory military service for the new genera- tion of American youth. The crisis at home and the drive to war The policy of international brigandage on which the US has embarked is the expression, in the final analysis, of insoluble social conflicts within its own borders. How else to understand the frenzied urgency of the drive to war: as Bush told Congress Tuesday night, “time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer.” There are real dangers confronting American imperialism, but they do not arise from small bands of terrorists or the governments of weak and impoverished countries on the other side of the world. These dangers stem from the deepening crisis of world capitalism, and in the ever- intensifying contradictions within the United States between the ultra- wealthy elite, and the vast majority of working people. Bush admitted that the US economy ha s entered a recession, but he had no remedy for the growth of unemployment, poverty and social depriva- tion, only proposing an extension of his program of cutting taxes for the wealthy and big business. He made only passing reference in the State of the Union speech to social needs such as education and health care, and his budget to be released next week will funnel nearly all new spending to the military and “homeland security.” The State of the Union speech came in the shadow of the collapse of Enron, the seventh largest US company and one which has the closest political ties to Bush and the Republican Party, as well as a series of other corporate bankruptcies: Kmart, Global Crossing, Sunbeam, the entire steel industry. But Bush could propose nothing on the question of jobs and living standards except more government handouts to the cor- porations. Bush's domestic policy centers on internal repression, building up the police and military at home. While the “war on terrorism” is the pretext,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 265 the real purpose is to prepare to deal with massive social upheavals through the use of force. A government installed, not by a vote of the people, but by a 5-4 majority on the US Supreme Court, the Bush ad- ministration more and more rests on the army and the police and dis- penses with the trappings of democracy. Despite the glorification of Bush by a cowed and cynical media, and the prostration of the Democratic Party, this administration is isolated and deeply frightened of any genuine oppos ition. As for the polls and claims of pundits that Bush is wildly popular with the American people, these are merely instruments of political intimidation. In factories and offices, or working class neighborhoods, the gene ral reaction to Bush is one of indifference, suspicion or contempt. The war in Afghanistan is hardly talked about or felt among the broad masses of the American people. reprinted from World Socialist Web Site "},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 267 Appendix (F) A note on the big bang enthalpic limit of physics and philosophy and a comment on ecology.

There may be no r eason for the speed of light not to be an infinite number given that the mathematics of such a system are dependent on local conditions imposed at the instant of the local big bang. Therefore at the initiation of a big bang there may be many possible and different sets of physical laws yet to be initiated.

DMCA Legislative Background Congress enacted section 1201 in response to two pressures. First, Congress was responding to the perceived need to implement obliga- tions imposed on the U.S. by the 1996 World Intellectual Property Or- ganization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty. Section 1201, however, went fur- ther than the WIPO treaty required. 2 The details of section 1201, then, were a response not just to U.S. treaty obligations, but also to the con- cerns of copyright owners that their works would be widely pirated in the networked digital world. 3 Section 1201 contains two dis tinct prohibitions: a ban on acts of cir- cumvention, as well as a ban on the distribution of tools and technolo- gies used for circumvention. The first prohibition, set out in section 1201(a)(1), prohibits the act of circumventing a technological measure used by copyright owners to control access to their works (“access c ontrols”). So, for example, this provision makes it unlawful to defeat the encryption system used on DVD movies. This ban on acts of circ umvention applies even where the purpose for decrypting the movie would otherwise be legitimate. As a result, if a Disney DVD prevents you from fast-forwarding through the commercials that preface the feature pr esentation, efforts to circumvent this restriction would be unlawful. Second, sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) outlaw the manufacture, sale, distribution or trafficking of tools and technologies that make cir- cumvention possible. These provisions ban not only technologies that defeat access controls, but also technologies that defeat use restrictions imposed by copyright owners, such as copy controls. These provisions prevent technology vendors from taking steps to defeat the “copy- protection” now appearing on many music CDs, for example.   150 Perhaps not so unintended?"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" Page 272 Section 1201 also includes a number of exceptions for certain limited classes of activities, including security testing, reverse engineering of software, encryption research, and law enforcement. These exceptions have been extensively criticized as being too narrow to be of real use to the constituencies who they were intended to assist. 4 A violation of any of the “act” or “tools” prohibitions is subject to significant civil and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties. 3. Free Expression and Scientific Research Section 1201 is being used by a number of copyright owners to stifle free speech and legitimate scientific research. The lawsuit against 2600 magazine, threats against Princeton Pr ofessor Edward Felten’s team of researchers, and prosecution of the Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov have imposed a chill on a variety of legitimate activities. For example, online service providers and bulletin board operators have begun to censor discussions of copy-protection systems, program- mers have removed computer security programs from their websites, and students, scientists and secu rity experts have stopped publishing details of their research on existing security protocols. Foreign scientists are also increasingly uneasy about traveling to the United States out of fear of possible DMCA liability, and certain technical conferences have begun to relocate overseas. These developments will ultimately result in weakened security for all computer users (including, ironically, for copyright owners counting on technical measures to protect their works), as security researchers shy away from research that might run afoul of section 1201. 5 Professor Felten’s Research Team Threatened In September 2000, a multi-industry group known as the Secure Digi- tal Music Initiative (SDMI) issued a public challenge encouraging skilled technologists to try to defeat certain watermarking technologies intended to protect digital music. Princeton Professor Edward Felten and a team of researchers at Princeton, Rice, and Xerox took up the challenge and succeeded in removing the watermarks. When the team tried to present th eir results at an academic confer- ence, however, SDMI representatives threatened the re searchers with liability under the DMCA. The threat letter was also delivered to the researchers’ employers, as well as the conference organizers. After ex- tensive discussions with counsel, the researchers grudgingly withdrew their paper from the conference.

Prosecutors, prompted by software goliath Adobe Systems Inc., al- leged that Sklyarov had worked on a software program known as the Advanced e-Book Processor, which was distributed over the Internet by his Russian employer, ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. The software allowed owners of Adobe electronic books (“e-books”) to convert them from Adobe’s e- Book format into Adobe Portable Document Format (“pdf”) files, thereby removing restrictions embedded into the files by e-Book pub- lishers. Sklyarov was never accused of in fringing any copyri ghted e-Book, nor of assisting anyone else to infringe copyrights. His alleged crime was working on a software tool with many legitimate uses, simply be- cause third parties he has never met might use the tool to copy an e- Book without the publisher’s permission. In December 2001, under an agreement with the Department of Jus- tice, Sklyarov was allowed to return home. The Department of Justice, however, is continuing to prosecute his employer, ElcomSoft, under the criminal provisions of the DMCA. Lawrence Lessig, “Jail Time in the Digital Age,” N.Y.

In that case, eight major motion picture companies brought a DMCA suit against 2600 magazine seeking to block it from publishing the DeCSS software program, which de feats the encryption used on DVD movies. 2600 had made the program available on its web site in the course of ongoing coverage of th e controversy surrounding the DMCA. The magazine was not involved in the development of software, nor was it accused of having used the software for any copyright infringement. Notwithstanding the First Amendment’s guarantee of a free press, the district court permanently barred 2600 from publishing, or even linking to, the DeCSS software code. In November 2001, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision.

Microsoft Threatens Slashdot In spring 2000, Microsoft invoked the DMCA against the Internet publication forum Slashdot, demanding that forum moderators delete materials relating to Microsoft’s proprietary implementation of an open security standard known as Kerberos. In the Slashdot forum, several individuals alleged that Microsoft had changed the open, non-proprietary Kerberos specification in order to prevent non-Microsoft servers from interacting with Windows 2000. Many speculated that this move was intended to force users to purchase Microsoft server software. Although Microsoft responded to this criti- cism by publishing its Kerberos sp ecification, it conditioned access to the specification on agreement to a “c lick-wrap” license agreement that expressly forbade disclosure of the specification without Microsoft’s prior consent. Slashdot posters responded by republishing the Microsoft specifica- tion. Microsoft then invoked the DMCA, demanding that Slashdot re- move the republished specifications. In the words of Georgetown law professor Julie Cohen, “If Micro- soft's interpretation of the DMCA's ban on circumvention technologies is right, then it doesn't seem to matter much whether posting unauthor- ized copies of the Microsoft Kerberos specification would be a fair use.

Fair Use Under Siege “Fair use” is a crucial element in American copyright law—the prin- ciple that the public is entitled, wit hout having to ask permission, to use copyrighted works so long as these uses do not unduly interfere with the copyright owner’s market for a work. Fair uses include personal, non- commercial uses, such as using a VCR to record a television program for later viewing. Fair use also includes activities undertaken for pur- poses such as criticism, comment, ne ws reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. While stopping copyright infringement is an important policy objec- tive, Section 1201 throws out the baby of fair use with the bathwater of digital piracy. By employing technical protection measures to control access to and use of copyrighted works, and using section 1201 litiga- tion against anyone who tampers with those measures, copyright owners can unilaterally eliminate fair use, re-writing the copyright bargain de- veloped by Congress and the courts over more than a century. Copy-protected CDs The introduction of “copy-protected ” CDs into the marketplace illus- trates the collision between fair use and the DMCA. Record labels are aggressively incorporating “copy-p rotection” on new music releases. Over 10 million copy-protected discs are already in circulation, accord- ing to Midbar Technology Ltd, one of the vendors of copy-protection technology. Sony claims that it has released over 11 million copy- protected discs worldwide. Universal Music Group has stated that all of its music CDs will incorporate copy-protection by mid-2002. Whatever the impact that these copy protection technologies may have on online infringement, they are certain to interfere with the fair use expectations of consumers. For example, copy-protected discs will disappoint the hundreds of thousands of consumers who have purchased MP3 players, despite the fact that making an MP3 copy of a CD for personal use is a fair use. Making “mix CDs” or copies of CDs for the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 279 office or car are other examples of fa ir uses that are potentially impaired by copy-protection technologies. Companies that distribute tools to “repair” these dysfunctional CDs, restoring to consumers their fair use privileges, run the risk of lawsuits under section 1201’s ban on circumve ntion tools and technologies.

Whether scholars, researchers, commentators and the public will continue to be able to make legitimate fair uses of these works will de- pend upon the availability of tools to bypass these digital locks. The DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions, however, prohibit the creation or distribution of these tools, ev en if they are crucial to fair use. So, as copyright owners use technology to press into the 21st century, the public will see more and more fair uses whittled away by digital locks allegedly intended to “prevent piracy.” Perhaps more importantly, no future fair uses will be developed—after all, before the VCR, who could have imagined that fair use “time-shifting” of television would become common-place for the average consumer? Copyright owners argue that these tools, in the hands of copyright in- fringers, can result in “Internet piracy.” But the traditional answer for piracy under copyright law has been to seek out and prosecute the in-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" Page 280 fringers, not to ban the tools that enable fair use. After all, photocopiers, VCRs, and CD-R burners can also be misused, but no one would sug- gest that the public give them up simp ly because they might be used by others to break the law. DeCSS and DVD Copy Plus Fair use tools have already been yanked off the market. In the Univer- sal v. Reimerdes case, discussed above, the court held that section 1201 bans DeCSS software. This softwa re decrypts DVD movies, making it possible to copy them to a PC. In another case, a company has filed a declaratory judgment action in San Francisco after being threatened with DMCA liability by the MPAA for distributing DVD Copy Plus, which enables DVD owners to ma ke copies of DVD content. There are lots of legitimate reasons to copy DVDs. Once the video is on the PC, for example, lots of fair uses become possible—film scholars can digitally analyze the film, travelers can load the movie into their laptops, and parents can fast-forward through the commercials that open Disney films. Without the tools necessary to copy DVDs, however, these fair uses become impossible. Matthew Mirapaul, “They’ll Always Have Paris (and the Web),” N.Y. Times at E2, March 16, 2002.

According to the student: “I wrote embed in 1997, after discovering that all of my fonts disallowed embedding in documents. Since my fonts are free, this was silly—but I didn't want to take the time to... change the flag, and then reset all of the extended font properties with a sepa- rate program. What a bore! Instead, I wrote this program to convert all of my fonts at once. The program is very simple; it just requires setting a few bits to zero. Indeed, I noticed that other fonts that were licensed for unlimited distribution also disallowed embedding.... So, I put this program on the web in hopes that it would help other font developers as well.” Attorneys for Agfa Monotype nevertheless have threatened the stu- dent author with DMCA liability for distributing the program.

In each of these cases, the DMCA was used to deter a marketplace competitor, rather than to battle piracy.

In 1999, Sony sued Connectix Corporation, the manufacturer of the Virtual Game Station, an emulator program which allowed Sony Playstation games to be played on Apple Macintosh computers. Sony also sued Bleem, the leading vendor of Playstation emulator software for Windows PCs. In both cases, the Sony competitors had created their products by en- gaging in legitimate reverse engineer ing, which has been recognized as noninfringing fair use in a series of Ninth Circuit cases. Connectix, in fact, ultimately won a Ninth Circuit ruling that its reverse engineering was indeed fair use. 7 Both Connectix and Bleem, however, were unable to bear the high costs of litigation against Sony and ultimately were forced to pull their products off the market. Whatever the merits of Sony’s position may have been under copyright, trademark, patent, or other legal theories, the competitiv e efforts of Connectix and Bleem certainly were at a far remove from the “black box” piracy devices that Congress meant to target with section 1201.

Blizzard runs its own servers, known as “Battle.net,” whic h it makes available free of charge to allow its games to be played across the Internet. The group of volun- teer programmers decided to create bnetd to overcome difficulties that they had experienced in attempting to use Battle.net. The bnetd software is freely distributed, open source, and non-commercial. In February 2002, Blizzard invoked th e DMCA in an effort to have bnetd pulled off the Internet. Blizzar d sent a “cease and desist” letter to the ISP that hosts the bnetd website, claiming that the bnetd software violated section 1201. Blizzard contends that the bnetd soft ware has been used by some to permit networked play of pirated B lizzard games. Whether or not that contention is true, the developers are not using the software for that purpose, nor was the software designed for such a purpose. The soft- ware has numerous legitimate uses fo r owners of Blizzard games. As a result, whatever else may be said about the bnetd software, it is plainly not a “black box” piracy device. Ultimately, Blizzard filed suit in St. Louis to bar dist ribution of bnetd. Tellingly, however, Blizzard chose not to press a DMCA claim in the lawsuit, opting instead for traditional copyright and trademark claims. (EFF is representing the bnetd devel opers.) Blizzard’s willingness to use the DMCA in pre-litigation threats, however, demonstrates its chilling potential in the hands of copyright owners intent on hindering competi- tors, rather than stopping piracy."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 285 David Becker, “Group Backs ISP in Online Gaming Dispute”, Cnet News, March 12, 2002. http://news.com.com/2100-1040-858414.html Legal correspondence on bnetd website. http://www.bnetd.org/case_letters.php Sony’s Attack on Playstation “Mod Chips” Apart from using the DMCA against vendors of personal computer emulators of Sony’s Playstation, Sony has sued a number of manufac- turers of so-called “mod chips” for alleged circumvention under the DMCA. In doing so, Sony has been able to enforce a system of geo- graphical regional restrictions that raises significant anticompetitive issues. So-called “mod chips” are after-mar ket accessories that modify Play- station consoles to permit games legitimately purchased in one part of the world to be played on a games console from another geographical region. Sony has sued mod chip manufacturers in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. In the U.S., Sony sued Gamemasters, Inc., distributor of the Game Enhancer peripheral device, which allowed U.S. Playtstation users to play games purchased in Japan and other countries. Although there was no infringement of Sony’s copyright, the court granted an injunction under the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions, effec- tively banning the use of a technology that would permit users to use legitimately-purchased non-infri nging games from other regions. Recognizing the anti-competitive pot ential of the region playback control system, the Australian anti-trust authority, the Australian Com- petition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), has intervened in a law- suit that Sony is pursuing against an Australian mod chip manufacturer under the Australian equivalent of the DMCA’s anti-circumvention pro- visions. The ACCC argues that Aust ralian consumers should be permit- ted to use personally imported games discs not otherwise available in Australia, or available only at a significantly higher price. Sony has argued that mod chips can al so be used to enable the use of unauthorized copies of Playstation games. But most Playstation mod chips are not “black box” devices suitable only for piracy.

Conclusion Three years of experience with the “anti-circumvention” provisions of the DMCA demonstrate that the stat ute reaches too far, chilling a wide variety of legitimate activities in wa ys Congress did not intend. As an increasing number of copyright works are wrapped in technological protection measures, it is likely that the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions will be applied in further unforeseen contexts, hindering the legitimate activities of innovators, res earchers, the press, and the public at large. 1 For examples of Congress’ stated purpose in enacting the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions, see 144 Cong.

The answer to that question depends on the time period you are talking about. Measured by real median family income, the last few years have witnessed meaningful decline. See Figure 1. In 1994, this indicator of economic well-being is estimated to be 5.2 percent less than it was in 1989.[1] With the rather low December, 1994, to December, 1995, growth in Gross Domestic Product (only 1.3 percent), the 1995 data would be expected to reinforce this pattern. Significantly, the year 1995 is thought by many as being something of a business cycle peak, similar to 1989. At least, President Clinton's claim that the economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades would suggest this.[2] Six years of net decline in real median family income has dealt a significant setback to middle America. [3] However, if we consider a somewhat longer period of time, the picture is not so grim. In the seven years preceding 1989, real median fam ily income rose by 12.6 percent. Of course, it could be argued that this growth is something of a statisti- cal artifact since the initial year fo r this comparison is 1982, at the"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" Page 290 trough of a serious recession. Actually , the distortion from this is minor. If we substitute 1981, a year containi ng an official business cycle peak, for 1982, the growth in real median family income only falls to 11.0 percent. This might indicate that the years since 1989 are something of an aberration. However, if we look back beyond 1981, we see more of what has transpired since 1989. In the two years between the business cycle peaks of 1979 and 1981, real median family income fell by 7.4 percent. And before that, from the business cycle peak year of 1973 through 1979, it rose by only 3.7 percent. Over the entire period 1973- 1981, this measure fell by 2.7 percent. Thus, if anything, the period 1981-1989 is the aberration, an interval of rising income sandwiched between two substantial episodes of stagnant or declining family eco- nomic well-being. There is more to this story of the behavior of real median family income. While the income growth that characterized the period 1981- 1989 was a welcome relief from the stagnation or declines that sur- rounded it, an examination of the data for earlier years indicates that it pales in comparison. For example, in the six years from 1967 to 1973, real median family income rose by 16.8 percent, in contrast to the 11.0 percent rise in the eight years 1981-1989. On an annual basis, this is about twice the growth rate compared to the 1981-1989 period. Perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the changing nature of the patterns of growth in real median family income is to contrast the 21 years from 1973 through 1994 with the 26 years beginning in 1947 and ending in 1973. Between 1973 and 1994, real median family income rose by a mere 2.5 percent, despite the 1981-1989 growth surge. On the other hand, between 1947 and 1973, real median family income in- creased by 103.8 percent, slightly more than a doubling. See Figure 2. This is a remarkable difference, indicating a marked slowing in family income growth after 1973.[4] "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 291 I. Family Income and the Federal Government Not surprisingly, the pattern of real family income growth parallels that of real wages and the average productivity of labor.[5] This implies that our previous explanations of real wage and productivity behavior will be pertinent to the issue of why the rate of growth in real family income has slowed so precipitously since 1973. To confirm this, we have conducted the necessary regre ssion analysis, using real median family income as the dependent variable and Federal Government spending (as a percent of Gross Domestic Product), Federal spending squared, and the average productivity of labor as independent variables. Why do we include the average productivity of labor? There are two reasons. First, to the extent it explains the behavior of real median fam- ily income, we can calculate an indi rect impact of Federal spending on real median family income from the already known effect it has on labor productivity. Second, it enables us to determine whether Federal spend- ing has impacts above and beyond those associated with the labor pro- ductivity measure. For example, if the regression results show a signifi- cant relationship between real median family income and Federal spend- ing, after controlling for movements in labor productivity, this would indicate an additional impact. The regression results are reported in Table 1. They do show a sta- tistically significant effect of Federal spending beyond that produced by movements in the average productivity of labor. Recalling the analysis"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" Page 292 reported in the second of these reports,[6] we found that Federal Gov- ernment spending greater than 17.42 percent of GDP exerted a negative effect on the productivity of labor. According to the results reported here, that effect is reinforced wh enever Federal Government spending exceeds 17.97 percent of GDP. Thus, the impact of Federal spending on real median family income is something of a two-edged sword. When- ever Federal Government outlays rise above the 17 to 18 percent of GDP, the effect on real median family income is to depress it, both di- rectly and through its impact on the average productivity of labor. II. The Impact of Spending Restraint It has been standard practice in this series of reports to ask the ques- tion, \"What would be the impact of $100 billion of Federal spending restraint on the economic measures being discussed?\" In this case, the response to that query must come in two parts. First, we need to calcu- late the indirect effect produced through the impact of Federal spending on the average productivity of labor. We have already shown that $100 billion of Federal spending restrain t would augment the average produc- tivity of labor by 0.8 of one percent.[7] That translates into a $320.85 increase in real median family income, at 1994 levels. See Table 2. This is what we have called the indi rect effect on family income."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 293 On the direct side, $100 b illion of spending restraint would reduce Federal spending as a percentage of GDP by about 1.5 percentage points, assuming 1994 levels of spe nding. Making the necessary calcu- lations shows that such a change in Federal spending levels would lead to a $574.50 increment to real median family income. This gives a com- bined effect of $895.35. Such an increase in real median family income is nearly equal to the $944 total rise in real median family income over the years 1973-1994. It would also am ount to a 2.3 percent addition to the 1994 level of real income. III. Some Additional Detail More information is available than that for just real median family income in the aggregate. Specifically, the available data describe this statistic by age of the householder in the family. The age categories of interest are 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64. This makes it possi- ble to replicate the aggregate analys is with the age specific data. The results of doing this are shown in Table 3. They provide some very in- teresting insights into the impacts of Federal spending on different age groups in America. First, the statistical results all have one thing in common. Real median family income is significantly related to the economy-wide average productivity of labor, although the relationship differs quantitatively. As the age of the family householder increases, the sensitivity to productivity cha nges rises through the age group 45-54 and then declines in age category 55-64."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" Page 294 When it comes to the Federal spending variables in the regression results contained in Table 3, the pattern is much more disparate. Through the three age groups embracing the years 15-44, the Federal spending variables are statistically significant with signs consistent with the overall results shown in Table 2. However, in the age groups 45-54 and 55-64, the statistical significance disappears. How can these differences be summarized? We have done it by conducting the $100 billion in Federal spending restraint analysis for each of the six age groups. Again, th e effects are partitioned into an indirect one operating through the productivity variable and a direct additional impact created by variations in Federal spending levels. The detailed results are shown in Table 4 and their combined effect is illus- trated in Figure 3. Of course, the i ndirect effect mirrors the already dis- cussed pattern shown in the regression coefficients for the productivity variable. It starts small and then rises, peaking in the age group 45-54, before falling."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 295 Almost exactly the reverse is s hown with the direct effects. It starts large, declines through age group 35-44, is not significant for ages 45- 64. In combination, the two effects show a powerful pattern of system- atic decline as you move to older and older age groups. This implies that the effects of Federal Government spending beyond what we have called the \"optimal,\" or threshold leve l, is most strongly felt by families with young householders. If the impacts are expressed as percentages of 1944 levels of real median family in come, the disparities are even more pronounced. For those families with a householder aged 15-24, we es- timate that the typical percentage in crease in real income associated with $100 billion of Federal spending restraint would be 10.2 percent. Among those in the peak earnings years, ages 45-54, the relative in- crease is only 0.9 of one percent."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" Page 296 IV. What About the American Dream? The findings of the previous sections have some interesting implica- tions for the notion of the American Dream, the idea of persistent inter- generational economic progress, the hope that one's children will have a better life then their parents. If the incomes of families headed by younger householders are more negativel y affected by the expansion of the Federal Government beyond its optimal size, their economic status may be adversely affected on a permanent basis. To illustrate the poten- tial magnitude of these effects, consider a younger family, say with a householder in the 15-24 age category, with very young children in 1947. Perhaps 20 years later, in 1967, those children themselves may be householders in that same 15-24 age group. What do the data say about their relative economic status? Simply this; the real income (measured by real median family income) of the 1967 family was 66.1 percent greater than that for the householder's parents in 1947. The American Dream worked. Move on to 1974. Making the same assumptions, we can compare the 1974 family with one in 1994. The result? In 1994, real median fam- ily income where the householder is aged 15-24 is 27.6 percent less than the incomes of a comparable family in 1974. Rather than being better off than their parents, the 1994 family is decidedly worse off. The American Dream no longer exists. Toda y's families are starting off at a"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 297 much lower place on the economic ladde r than their parents did. See Figure 4. Perhaps the age group 15-24 is an unusual case, overly influenced by changing patterns of educational activity, for example. To deal with this possibility, we replicate our analysis, focusing on the 25-34 age group. Between 1947 and 1967, the real median family income of fami- lies in this age category rose by 83.7 percent, once more confirming the notion of intergenerational progress. However, this is not the case over the interval 1974-1994. Real median family income falls by 7.5 percent, less than the decline in the case of the age 15-24 group, but nevertheless a decline. We also have calculated the intertemporal changes in median family income assuming a 25 year generation to generation span for the age 25- 34 group. The increase in real income for the families with this charac- teristic was 107.6 percent between 1947 and 1972, compared to a de- crease of 4.3 percent between 1969 and 1994. Once more we find a lack of generational progress in the contemporary data. Perhaps, though, this is compensated for by more rapid increases in income through time. To explore this possibility, we have constructed a hypothetical income profile for thos e families with a householder aged 15-24 for the twenty year period 1994-2014. To do this, we used the percentage increases in income for a cohort of families for the most re- cent ten year period for which we have data. To illustrate, we compare"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" Page 298 the real median family income in 1984 for families with a householder aged 15-24 with the 1994 real income of families with a householder aged 25-34. Once a percentage increas e in real income has been deter- mined, we use it to estimate the real median family income in 2004 of a family in the age 15-24 group in 1994. Similarly, we calculate the per- centage increase in income as families moved from the age 25-34 to the age 35-44 classification between 1984 and 1994. That is then used to approximate an income level for our age 15-24 family in 2014. The re- sults are shown in Table 5. An even more dramatic comparison emerges if the 1994 cohort's hypothetical income history is extended to the year 2034 and is then contrasted with the income history of the 1947 cohort over a forty year period, which would take it through the year 1987. At that time, when the 1947 cohort is approaching retirement, the real median family in- come for their age group, 55-64, was $43,167. Ten years earlier, in 1977, when the 1947 cohort was in its peak earnings years, their real median family income stood at $48,950. Compare these numbers with our projections of the 1994 cohort's real median family income levels for 2034 (age 55-64) and 2024 (age 45-54). The 2034 estimate is $39,435 and that for 2024 is $44,403. Both are significantly less than the actual incomes of the 1947 cohort some 47 years earlier . These data suggest that approximately two generations of Americans have missed out on the American Dream. It appears that the 1994 cohort stands to have a lower level of real income during their peak earnings years than did their grandparents in the 1947 cohort."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 299 As we mentioned earlier, th ere may be problems associated with basing things on the 15-24 age group. Therefore, we have done a similar analysis in which the 1994 cohort is defined as consisting of those fami- lies in which the householder was aged 25-34 in that year. This takes us through the year 2024. The results are shown in Table 6, along with the actual income levels 20, 30, and 40 years earlier. These data tell a somewhat more muted story. The projected income history for the 1994 cohort very closely approximates that for the 1974 group. However, compared to earlier cohorts, those for 1964 and 1954, some income gains are shown. This indicates that perhaps only a single generation, the one currently in the early years of its income life cycle, will be de- nied the generational gains associated with the concept of the American Dream. Whether it be one or two genera tions who have been affected in this fashion, the question remains, \"Why?\" The earlier analysis suggests that a major explanatory factor is an oversized Federal Government. To con- firm the impact of Federal Government spending in this regard, we have attempted to explain statistically the rate of growth in real median fam- ily income as various cohorts move through their income history. Figure 5 shows the history through time (1961 to the present) of the ten-year percentage change in the real medi an family income as people age. Five-year moving averages have been used in order to smooth the data series and minimize the impact of single-year variations.[8]"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" Page 300 Data are provided for four different categories, movements between age groups 15-24 and 25-34; 25-34 and 35-44; 35-44 and 45-54; and 45-54 and 55-64.[9] When these data are used as dependent variables in regression equations that have the usual set of Federal spending meas- ures, spending as a percentage of GDP and the square of spending measured in this way, the results shown in Table 7 are obtained. They show what, by now, is a familiar pattern. Up to a certain level of Federal spending, there is a positive impact on the rates of growth in real me- dian family income as householders age and move through their life cycle of income generation. This holds true for the age groups through age 54. In the case of the percentage growth in income as householders move from the 45-54 to the 55-64 age bracket, the statistical results do not show a significant relationship between Federal spending and the dependent variables. In the other th ree cases, we ask the usual question, \"At what level of spending does the negative effect emerge?\" The an- swer is a familiar one, at approximately 17.5 percent of GDP. Once again, we find that Federal Government outlays in excess of about 17.5 percent of GDP are counterproductive."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 301 V. But Is It Fair? The quite variable impacts of the Federal spending on the income history of families has implications for the degree of inequality in the distribution of income in the United States. For example, the fact that the negative effects of excessive Fe deral spending are more apparent among the younger age groups implies a widening spread between their incomes and those in their peak earnings years. In 1994, the mean (not median) family income was much lower in the age groups 15 through 44 than in the 45 and older cases.[10] While on the subject of income inequality, it is worth noting that, until now, little has been said along these lines. Our almost exclusive emphasis has been on economic effi- ciency, not equity considerations. The lack of treatment of equity, or \"fairness\" considerations could be offered as a criticism of our work. Much of the standard justifications for Federal Government programs a nd expenditures focus on matters of this sort, arguing that an important function of government is to inter- vene in the economic system to pr omote greater equality of economic outcomes. In short, much of the rhetoric in support of government spending is redistributionist in tone. Often, these arguments suggest that there is a conflict between the economic goal of efficiency and a"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" Page 302 broader social goal of fairness. We will explore that possibility at this point. The first question is one of measuring the degree of fairness in an economy. While there are some technical ways to do this, such as using Gini coefficients, ordinarily the language of this issue focuses on less technical and more straightforward notions. References to the \"rich\" and the \"poor,\" the \"privileged\" and the \"underprivileged,\" the \"top\" and the \"bottom,\" and \"haves\" and \"have-nots,\" abound. While these concepts are usually employed in an imprecise fashion, we can devise a measure in the spirit of such notions by simp ly dividing the income received by a group of people at the top of the income distribution, say those in the top five percent, by the income obtained by those at the bottom of the distribution, in this case, perhaps, the twenty percent of people with the lowest income.[11] The behavior of this statistic in post-World War II America is shown in Figure 6. It begins at about 3.5 in the late 1940s, falls to be- tween 2.5 and 3.0 in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and then begins a fairly steady ascent until it is in excess of 4.5 by 1994. The 1994 value is the highest in this interval. The question for us is whether the behav- ior of this statistic bears any relationship to Federal Government spend- ing. To pursue this, we have estimated our standard government expen- diture model, with the income distribution ratio as the dependent vari-"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 303 able and the Federal Government share of GDP and its square as the independent variables. The regression results are shown in Table 8. What they show is truly rema rkable There is a significant statistical relationship between the income distribution measure and Federal spending. In itself, that is not surprising. It is the nature of the linkage that is striking. At relatively low levels of Federal spending, a rising Federal share of GDP reduces the re lative gap between the share of in- come received by the top five percen t of the income distribution and the bottom twenty percent. However, be yond some critical level of Federal Government spending, additional outlays widen the gap. The threshold level where this happens? Where else but in the vicinity of 17.5 percent of GDP. Specifically, it occurs at 17.43 percent, almost exactly the same as the 17.57 percent threshold value for maximizing GDP and the 17.42 percent estimate for maximizing the average productivity of labor and real compensation of workers. We call this finding \"startling.\" Why? The answer is simple. Appar- ently, when it comes to the optimal size of government, there is no in- herent conflict between economic effi ciency and equity, as we have measured it. A Federal Government that is larger than is optimal in an economic efficiency sense also produces a greater gap between the in- comes at the top and the bottom of the income distribution. Too much Federal Government is not only ineffi cient; it also incr eases the dispar- ity in economic outcomes in the United States."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" Page 304 VI. The Family in Perspective [12] Before the advent of large scale government welfare, a plethora of private organizations provided assistance for individuals who were eco- nomically disadvantaged--churches, aid societies, widows' and orphans' benevolent groups, etc. As Marvin Olasky has documented, these pri- vate organizations had an impressi ve record in reducing poverty and economic distress.[13] They did it largely by relying on human good- ness based on values such as love and compassion rather than by mechanistic disbursement of f unds. Personal responsibility was re- quired. As Olasky recounts, \"No one was allowed to eat and run\" at the pre-New Deal private charities. A dditionally, families took care of less fortunate relatives. While private organizations such as the Salvation Army continue to help the poor, there is strong evidence that their fi- nancial support has been dramatically eroded by the public's knowledge that the government provides public assistance.[14] When the modern system of public assistance evolved in the 1930s, proponents felt that a humane society should take care of those who had no male breadwinner in the home. No thought was given to the possibil- ity that public assistance predicated on the absence of a male head of household might lead to an increase in the number of such families. If you subsidize something, usually you get more of it, and this has been the case with the single parent families and the welfare system. We be- lieve the evidence supports two propos itions: (1) Welfare has increased the incidence of single parent families and contributed to the decline in traditional families (two married parents living together with their chil- dren); and (2) Welfare has contributed to illegitimate babies being pro- duced to obtain or increase public assistance payments. There has been a meteoric increase in the proportion of children not living in two-parent families (Figur e 7). Today, about 3 of 10 children live outside the traditional family arrangement, double the proportion of a generation ago.[15] During the same period, real public aid expendi- tures rose sharply as well. Not only did spending on income mainte- nance programs rise in real per capita terms, but they rose significantly faster than personal income."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 305 While the literature on the relationship between welfare and family structure was distinctly mixed in the 1970s, more recent studies have more clearly indicated a significan t relationship between public assis- tance and the breakdown of traditiona l family arrangements.[16] Over 20 years ago, a study showed that AFDC promoted marital dissolu- tion.[17] Several more recent studies have confirmed these notions by revealing significant positive correlations between the presence of sin- gle-parent, female-headed families and welfare.[18] On balance, the evidence is that the programs of the welfare state reduce the need for a traditional marital union, with the division of labor associated with it.[19] Clearly, so cial scientists and other academics belatedly are discovering what ordinary Americans have known for decades: welfare destroys families.[ 20] The opportunity costs of getting and staying married have risen as th e largesse of the welfare state has provided persons with surrogate s pouses, in an economic sense. One consequence of this was described in our report on the impact of the welfare state on children,[21] a persistently high rate of poverty among the one group least able to help themselves, America's children. VI. Concluding Remarks A number of significant conclusions have emerged from this analy- sis of the effects of Federal Government spending on the American fam- ily: First, there is the general descriptive fact that the rate of growth in real median family income has slowed sharply since 1973, amounting to"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":" Page 306 total growth of only 2.5 percent compared to a 103.8 percent rise be- tween 1947 and 1973. Second, there is the analytic finding that levels of Federal Govern- ment spending that exceed 17.97 percent of Gross Domestic Product produce decreases in real median fa mily income, contributing to ex- plaining the retardation of the post-1973 real income growth. Third, we conclude that $100 billion of Federal Government spend- ing restraint would increase real median family income by $895.35 (1994 dollars), some 2.3 percent of the 1994 income level. Fourth, there is substantial disparity by age group in the impact of Federal Government spending in excess of the critical value at which it begins to have negative effects. The younger the householder in a fam- ily, the more substantial the impact, both absolutely and relatively. For families with a householder aged 15-24, a decision to restrain Federal spending by $100 billion would increase real income by 10.2 percent. Fifth, the time pattern of real median family income growth as householders age has undergone a profound transformation. No longer is the assumption of rising incomes from generation to generation as certain as it once was. Our calculati ons indicate that at least one, and possibly two, generations of Americans have missed out on the Ameri- can Dream of perpetual generational economic progress, largely because the Federal Government claims too large a share of the nation's Gross Domestic Product. Sixth, there is no conflict between the twin goals of economic effi- ciency and economic equity when evaluating the impact of Federal Government spending on the American economy. The level of Federal outlays that is generally consistent with promoting economic efficiency (about 17.5 percent of GDP) also appears to minimize the relative gap between incomes at the top and botto m of the American income distri- bution. The basic thrust of these conclusions is quite the same as those sug- gested by our earlier studies. At its present size, the American Federal Government is dangerous to our economic health. Appendix to report Unintended Consequences of Attempts to Redistribute Income [22] Conventional wisdom long has held that public policy has worked to reduce income inequality in America, or that, at least, it has the real capability of achieving that goal.[23] For example, the evidence is"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"The Decline and Fall of America Page 307 strong that there was a pronounced d ecline in measured inequality dur- ing the 1930s and 1940s, a period that greatly increased government intervention on both the tax and expenditure side designed to reduce inequality.[24] Increased government expenditures went, or so it was argued, largely to alleviate the plight of the poor and, thus, greater Fed- eral public aid expenditures brought a bout greater equality. Similarly, it commonly has been maintained that higher and more progressive Fed- eral taxes serve to further reduce inequality in America. There is another view, however, which holds that government inter- vention in markets may have a different impact. This has been argued by Tullock, Reynolds and Smolensky, and Bastiat.[25] There are at least five arguments supporting this position. First, there is the important public choice insight that relativel y high income rent-seekers may suc- cessfully direct public policies toward distributing income to themselves instead of the poor. Second, there are good supply side propositions that suggest that government redistribution efforts might lead to reduced work effort and that leisure-work substitution reaches a point that trans- fer activities lead increasing numbers of persons to \"choose\" to be poor.[26] Third, there is the deleterious effect that distributional coali- tions can have on growth in income.[27] Fourth, increased public trans- fer payments may crowd out private charity for the poor. Finally, market adjustments serve to offset many government transfer activities. For example, the farm program may provide \"transitional transfers\" to farm- ers, but in the long run the subsidy payments get capitalized in land and other prices and agriculture mainta ins its long run competitive rate of return (zero economic profits). All of these may comb ine to nullify the intended redistributive effects of a wide range of government policies. Endnotes to Report 1.

Changing family size may distort these comparisons somewhat. Since 1973, there has been a significant decline in the number of persons per family, from 3.48 to 3.20 in 1994. If the real median family income es- timates are crudely adjusted (by dividing them by the number of persons per family), the percentage increase in real income between 1973 and 1994 is somewhat higher than the 2.5 percent reported here, standing at 11.5 percent. However, there is little impact in the pre-1973 post-World War II years. Thus, the general nature of the pattern of changes in real family income growth is not altered by introducing the family size ad- justments. Family size data are from various issues of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. 5. For details, see our The Impact of the Welfare State on the American Worker. 6. Op. cit. 7. Ibid. 8. Similarly, five-year moving averag es of these ten-year percentage changes were used in constructing the hypothetical income histories that extend beyond the year 1994. 9. We do not do the age 55-64 to age 65 and over analysis since the age 65 and over category is open-ended, meaning that at any one time it contains people who were in not in the age 55-64 group ten years ear- lier. 10. Using mean (not median) income data, we calculate that the 1994 mean income of families with householders in the ages 15-44 range was $38,349. For those families with House holders aged 45 and older, it was $42,331. 11. This approach to measuring income inequality is a point in time ap- proach that does not take into account the movement of people between income classes over time.
