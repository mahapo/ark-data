My telephone number is area code 713 521-9896. This is my 1979 updated report on the concentration camp program of the Department of Defense of the United States. On April 20, 1976, after a rapid and thorough investigation, I filed suit on behalf of the People of the United States against various personages that had a key part in a conspiratorial program to do away with the United States as we know it. This is a progress report to you, the plaintiffs, the People of the United States. The civil action number is 76-H-667. It is entitled, \"Complaint Against the Concentration Camp Program of the Dept. of Defense\". It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the southern district of Texas, Houston division. The judge responsible for the case was Judge Carl Beau (phonetic spelling). Chapter 1: A NATIONAL EMERGENCY Page 1 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"You have no doubt heard the story: Once upon a time, under the Nazi regime in Germany, a man worked on an assembly line in a baby carriage factory. His wife was going to have a baby, but the Nazi government would not let anybody buy a baby carriage. The man decided he would secretly collect one part from each department and assemble the carriage himself. When this was done he and his wife gathered up the pieces and assembled it. When they were finished they did not have a baby carriage; they had a machine gun. And that is exactly the situation that I am going to present to you at this time. The center for the Study for Democratic Institutions recently completed a proposed constitution for the \"Newstates of America\". The Center is Rockefeller funded. To give you an indication of the type of constitution proposed, the term \"national emergency\" is mentioned 134 times. The document did not have a Bill of Rights and the right to own arms was taken away. At the same time, House Concurrent Resolution #28 awaited for calling a constitutional convention on or before July 4, 1976. The presiding officer of such are event would have been Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President and president pro tem of the Senate. This particular resolution awaited in committee. Obviously money would not be spent on these massive programs unless there would be the chance for the actual implementation of such a scheme. However, in case the American people do not voluntarily adopt a new constitution less troublesome to those who desire dictatorship, there is Executive Order #11490, which will include its predecessors when it is cited herein. The Executive Order authorizes the secretaries of the various agencies to prepare for any \"national emergency\" type situation; including, but not limited to, those specified in the Executive Order itself. If you read the Order, there is nothing at all left to the imagination. For any conceivable pretext, a national emergency may be declared based upon this frightening decree, dated October 1969. The Order itself was prefaced in March of 1969 by another Executive Order which established the federal regions and their capitals. All the departments of the government were involved, including the Law Enforcement and Health, Education and Welfare. Congressman Larry McDonald has revealed to Congress that various guerrilla and terrorist groups were being financed by the federal government. If they (the terrorist groups) actually began in search of activities, Executive Order #11490 would be activated. But as mentioned previously, if you will read Executive Order #11490, you will see that a \"national emergency\" may be declared for any conceivable pretext whatsoever. If the Order itself were activated, here is what would happen. The next day you and your family would be standing in front of your local post office with your neighbors; the front doors bursting with block-long lines of people waiting to be registered. After waiting in line with your family for hours, you finally get channeled through the doors. Once inside, you overhear the postal clerk with his sidearm on telling a frightened registrant, \"Look there is nothing I can do. The truck behind the building will take you to a work camp where you have been assigned. Your wife has been assigned to a factory and there's nothing I can do.\" Then your son or daughter looks up at you with a quivering voice and asks, \"Dad, why are we here?\" Chapter 2: IMPLEMENTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT Page 2 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There's much more to life in a \"free country\" than paying your mortgage. You have to be aware of what is going on and act accordingly and participate in government; that is, get involved. Examine the organization chart on Executive Order #11490 to discover how we have all helped finance (through our tax dollars) the mechanics of the overthrow of our Constitution. Executive Order #11490 designates certain authorities to the Office of Preparedness, which in turn designates authority to the various departments of the federal government. If the Order were implemented, the Post Office Department would be responsible for a national registration. The State Department would be responsible for the protection of the United Nations personnel or property and prevention of escape from the United States. The Department of Defense would be responsible for its expropriation of industry; direction of service and national production system; control of censorship; and communication expropriation of non- industrial facilities. The Commerce Department would be responsible for expropriation, selection and international distribution of commodities (which would be the actual looting of the United States), census information and human resources. The Treasury Department would be responsible for collection of cash and non-cash items and the recreation of evidence of assets and liabilities. The Justice Department would have concurrent responsibility with the Department of State for prevention of escape from the U.S.; for replenishing the stockpile of narcotics; for a national police force; for correctional and penal institutions; for mass feeding and housing of prisoners, and for use of prisoners to augment manpower which would be slave labor. The Federal Bank (which is not a FEDERAL bank) would be responsible for regulation of withdrawal of currency. The General Services Administration would be responsible for confiscation of private property for government use. Health Education and Welfare would be responsible for nationalization of education (which the Department of Education has already done), health services, hospitals and mental institutions. The Labor Department would be responsible for recruiting manpower; referring manpower; and allocating manpower so each particular person that was registered at the post office in this regional registration would be told where be (or she) was going to work. Housing & Urban Development would be responsible for transfer of persons to temporary or permanent housing in regional emergency planning and cooperation. The Transportation Department is responsible for emergency enforcement and control and movement of passengers and the emergency operation of the Alaskan railroad. There are two specific agencies here that we need to look at and to keep in mind. They are: Health Education and Welfare, and the Justice Department, as those two agencies are related to the Department of Defense. The various military departments are part of the Department of Defense. Under it, we have the secretary of Army, Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff of Personnel and law enforcement, U.S. Army's forces command, and continental Army Reserve & National Guard. And under that we have the four armies dividing up the United States. Under the Fifth Army we have the provost marshal, who is directly connected to the Deputy Chief of Staff for law enforcement personnel. Under the provost marshal for the Fifth Army we have the 300 Military Police Prisoner-of-War Command at Livonia, Michigan.

I believe we must get the best deal we can in our negotiations before the United States and the Soviet both perceive these changes and the balance that occurs. When these perceptions are in agreement, and both sides know the U.S. is inferior, we must have gotten the best deal we can. Americans at that time will not be happy that I have settled for second, but it will be too late. Zumwalt: Then why not take it to the American people? They will not accept the decision to become second best while we are in a position of Gross National product twice that of the U.S.S.R. Kissinger: That's a question of judgment. I judge that we will not get their support and if we seek it and tell the fact as we would have to, we would lose our negotiating leverage with the Soviets. Zumwalt: But isn't that the ultimate immorality in a democracy; to make a decision for the people of such importance without consulting them? Kissinger: Perhaps, but I doubt that there are 1 million who could even understand the issue. Zumwalt: Even if that presumption is correct, those 1 million can influence the opinions of the majority of the people. I believe it is my duty to take the other course. Kissinger: You should take care, lest your words result in a reduction in the Navy budget. So we see what the intention of the State Department is regarding the People. Another fact: On Dec. 30, 1975, the California National Guard announced in a press release (which I have) that the state's Military Police battalions were organized and trained to provide immediate response to virtually every civil and man-made disaster, as well as to assist law enforcement officers in emergency situations; to carry out their law enforcement as well as their military mission. When I asked four of the defendants in this case for their mission statement they did not provide it, although they say it is public information. The training spoken of for the California National Guard covers such subjects as dealing with individual civilians/civil population, detention procedures, citizen's rights, and similar matters. And you know as well as I do that when there is Martial raw, or Martial Rule, citizens have no right, because the Constitution is preempted. Even the uniforms of the National Guards who participate in this program are different from the regular uniforms. Army spokesmen will not reveal more about the uniforms, but the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department para-military unit, who have received this training have army fatigues dyed black for their uniforms. A further fact is the disaster preparedness plan for the Marine Corps Supply Center in Barstow, California. Quoting from that document: Under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, the preservation of law and order is the responsibility of local and state government. And the authority to maintain the peace and enforce the law is invested in the authority of those governments. Page 4 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There are specific exceptions to the above concept. One of these pertains to federal intervention to civil disturbances in certain situations. Military commanders are deemed to have the inherent authority to take any measure reasonably necessary for the protection of life and property in the event of a sudden unexpected public calamity which disrupts the normal process of government and presents an emergency so eminent as to make it dangerous to await instructions from appropriate authorities. This includes law enforcement duties. The manual mentions something called \"Garden Plot Forces\" which we will discuss at length in a few minutes. Don Bell (who writes a weekly report) reported on July 25, 1975 that in May of 1975 the 303 Civil Affairs group of the U.S. Army Reserves in Kearny, New Jersey conducted an exercise to sharpen plans for a military takeover of the state government. According to Colonel Frances Clart they had conducted similar studies on how to seize municipal and county government over the past few years. But this was the first time they had studied STATE government. Such units were trained during World War II to operate captured governments. We never had federal troops training to take over government in the United States. When local violence or catastrophe struck, the National Guard, under command of the governor, went into action. This is definitely not the situation at this time. Chapter 3: CONTROLLING THE MASSES On February 16, 1975, in the 'San Gabriel Valley Tribune' it was reported that the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, funded by the Department of Justice, and the Police Foundation, funded by the Ford Foundation, are prime movers toward implementing a national police force. Each, however, contends they support local police agencies. The total program involves military units that have the function of taking over the administration of local and state governments. That program is \"Operation Cable Splicer\" by Army civil affairs groups, a sub-plan of \"Operation Garden Plot\" (the Martial law program). The method by which the national police concept is being presented to the public has changed. It was first disguised under the cover of protection against civil disturbances. This program was as follows: A) Keep the people from gathering in the streets. B) Isolate and neutralize the revolution's leadership. C) Dispersal of crowds and demonstrators. This is followed by successful prosecution in order to: 1) Validate the action of the police; 2) Deny the arrestee's propaganda materials, and; 3) Deny them the opportunity to recover money damages against the police for arresting them. Let me quote for you the scenario which was developed for Cable Splicer One, Two and Three to justify the needs for dealing with civil disturbances: Page 5 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Phase One - an arrest and shooting provoke crowd unrest and threats against public officials and a riot begins to form: Phase Two - police vehicles are ambushed, various attempted assassinations of public officials occur, destruction and raiding of armories occur, and thousands of people begin to gather and local police lose control; Phase Three - increased movement of rioters and the crowds must be dispersed before they become sympathetic with the rioters. The National Guard and the local police lose control.\" This scenario provides for an orderly transition from state to federal control. The Deputy Attorney General of California commented at a Cable Splicer Three conference that anyone who attacks the State, even verbally, becomes a revolutionary and an enemy by definition. They are the enemy and must be destroyed. This program was taught in almost every state west of the Mississippi River and included as participants local active military, reserve military and civilian police. The course name was \"Civil Emergency Management Course\". The official explanation that was to be given if any questions were asked about the program was: \"This activity is a continuous, joint law enforcement-military liaison effort and a continuation of coordination established last year.\" In 1976, the 'Oakland Tribune' carried the most complete explanation of what is planned. It is reported in its entirety in the 'National Chronicle' which added an analysis to the story. (The 'Oakland Tribune's editor died suddenly after the story was published.) And I quote: Last Saturday the California National Guard unveiled a new Law Enforcement Assistance Force, L.E.A.F., a specially trained and outfitted Military Police Unit, whose members will serve as shock-troops in the state's war against political protesters and demonstrators. I saw a full-dress exhibition of what the California National Guard has planned for the next American revolution. Helicopters, SWAT teams, civilian military policemen in jack boots and helmets, twelve-gauge shotguns,.38 and.45 caliber pistols, radios, walkie talkies, and electrically-controlled intelligence centers wired for instant communications with any police force in the state. L.E.A.F. is a 1,000 member unit put together this year to handle unique law enforcement problems such as mass civil disobedience, protest demonstrations and riots. In other words, breaking heads and taking names. L.E.A.F. has the support of Governor Brown, a quarter- million dollars worth of grants from the federal government, and no public opposition from civil liberties groups. For all its ineptitude however, L.E.A.F. has a frightening possibility from a civil liberty standpoint. It is a direct product of the California \"Cable Splicer\" conferences -- a series of high-level secret meetings between government officials, law enforcement officers and military planners held during the late '60s and early '70s. The meetings were held as late as 1975 so far, as many public records show. These were the conferences which Counter-Spy magazine had identified as California's \"Garden Plot Sub-plan\". Gray Davis -- Gov. Brown's right hand man -- says L.E.A.F. is to assist civil police, not to replace them. Gray says, \"Civilians could expect a civilian type law enforcement rather than what is commonly known as Martial Law.\" Despite this assurance, L.E.A.F.'s exercises look Page 6 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"disturbingly like the military coup described in the novel, Seven Days In May. L.E.A.F. soldiers with nightstick's stood at intersections, stopping cars with suspicious occupants, checking I.D. cards and generally intimidating onlookers with their SWAT style uniforms, their sidearms and helmets. Perhaps more ominously, several participants in the role-playing exercises Saturday admitted that even under simulated pressure there has already been a number of incidents where the L.E.A.F. troops used excessive force to quell disturbances -- even though their orders forbade it. Former L.E.A.A. administrator, Charles Ross Dovan (phonetic spelling), is on record as having stated that local law enforcement has failed and must be replaced by a national police force. Patrick Murphy, the administrator of the Police Foundation, states, \"I have no fear of a national police force. Our 40,000 police departments are not sacred.\" Ex-Attorney General William Saxby warned that if we can go on as we are, crime will invade us and the national police will take over. For the policemen who do not cooperate and still want to be policemen, there is the program of Contemporary Research, Inc., an organization of psychologists, sociologists, education specialists and economic experts, who work toward a solution of many of today's social problems. The same organization develops specialized computer programming for the new world-wide military command and control system, as well as computer base systems for law enforcement agencies at all levels of government. The L.E.A.A. alone will receive over a billion dollars a year over the next 4 years, even though it has been ineffective against crime. This is because the L.E.A.A. is not geared to fighting crime; it's geared to developing a system for takeover of the United States with the assistance of the Department of Defense. Chapter 4: PLANS FOR A POLICE STATE One of the programs the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration works on in its fight against crime is psycho-surgery. If you don't cooperate with their programs, you are merely operated on so that you will be as cooperative as an adding machine. Or, the L.E.A.A. supports drug research for the same purpose-to neurological sources violence. Hence, as an example, if a law were passed whereby the ownership of firearms was declared to be illegal, you would be placed in one of these programs if you did not cooperate. The L.E.A.A. control exercise (at the state's level) is from the Office of Criminal Justice Planning of the Governor's Office. Here in Texas, Mr. Robert C. Klowers is still the executive director in that office. But all states have that particular department. In May, 1975 the 'L.E.A.A. Newsletter' describes the function of one of its organizations: the National Institute of Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice. This organization funds something called the \"United Nations Clearinghouse\" in Rome, Italy. The function of that organization is, among other things, the exchange of Criminal Justice System information with the Soviet Union. And it goes without saying that we have nothing to learn from the Criminal Justice System of the Soviet Union. These incredible projects are being funded with our tax dollars. The code name for these projects are: \"Garden Plot\" and \"Cable Splicer'. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of Page 7 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the state and local government by the federal government. An investigation was completed in November 1975 by 4 sources: The Conservative publication, 'American Challenge'; the leftist 'New Times'; the foundation financed Fund for Investigative Journalism, and; Don Wood of the trustworthy 'Ozark Sunbeam'. It involves the potential creation of a Police State through the use of the Pentagon and its computerized intelligence dossier (lodged in the Pentagon basement) of thousands of citizens by the National Guard, state and local police departments, the L.E.A.A., plainclothes military forces, SWAT teams, and the Department of Justice. Brigadier General J. L. Julienit (phonetic spelling), senior Army officer of the Pentagon National Guard Bureau, has admitted, \"I know of no state that did not have some form of these exercises within the last year.\" Today the Cable Splicer handbook is composed of 6 loose-leaf 3-ring binders that are merely an outline for the impending takeover and destruction of our Constitution. The Sixth Army used the term \"Cable Splicer\" for the name of the operation, but it is not revealed the name of the operation in the other military areas within the U.S. On page 4, paragraph 10 on Public Information, the instructions state: As a means to prevent adverse publicity or misleading psychological effects in regard to coordinating, planning, and conducting this exercise, all military participants involved will perform such duties in civilian clothing when exercise oriented activities are conducted at law enforcement facilities. In the event inquiries are received regarding this exercise, the response should be limited to identifying the activity as a continuous, joint law enforcement military liaison effort and a continuation of coordination established last year. On page 6, security guidance is explained to the effect that if anybody asks any questions, limit the information that is given out on the basis of it being in the interest of \"national interest\" (security). Now, in the festivities celebrating the success of completion of the exercises, Attorney General Stanley R. Larsen, the commanding general of the Sixth Army stated: The most serious challenge facing all of us will be the challenge of discharging our legitimate responsibilities. For a significant portion of a society at large is likely to regard us with suspicion and t question, even challenge our authority on the basic assumption of our profession. Part of this challenge we must be prepared to deal with; a potentially dangerous portion of our society which, in truth, could well become the domestic enemy. The manual includes instructions on operation of confinement facilities, handling and processing prisoners; including searching, transporting, feeding, housing and handling of the special class of persons called \"detainees\". The plan also specifically includes a proposition for confiscation of privately-owned weapons and ammunition. Chapter 5: PREPARING TO TAKE PRISONERS The Army has over 350 separate record centers containing substantial information on civilian political activities. Page 8 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Virtually every major army unit has its own set aside from this. The Fifth Army of San Antonio has over 100,000 files of its own. The overall operation command post is a domestic room at the Pentagon. There are 25 million card on individuals and 760,000 on organizations held by the Defense Central Index of investigations alone. And this information includes political, sociological, economic and psychological profiles. All this type of information on 25 million Americans. Since 1970 local county and state police forces all over the country have undertaken crash programs to install various kinds of computerized information systems. A large portion of this is being paid for by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Beginning in 1970, Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the destruction of all these data banks, but they were not destroyed. All the outlawed collection is now located at Mt. Weathey, Clark County, West Virginia and similar Pentagon facilities designed as adjuncts to the president's emergency powers under the Executive Orders. The cadre of specialized persons to enforce this plan are found in the U.S. Army Reserves Military Police POW Command at Livonia, Michigan. Mr. Fenren (phonetic spelling) of the 300th Military Police POW Command at Livonia told me, when I called him from the Federal Information Center at Houston, that the camps in the Command were for foreign prisoners of war and for \"enemies of the United States\". I asked him if enemies of the United States included U.S. citizens. He became angry, wouldn't deny it and referred me to a very sinister individual at the Army Reserve facility here at Houston who I talked to; who explained to me that the prisoners were called \"inventory\" and \"internees\". He would not deny that the camps were for U.S. citizens. I called the Pentagon, spoke with the defendant there, and then with the provost marshal for the Fifth Army, and do you know what? Not one of these persons would deny that the system was for U.S. citizens. The provost marshal for the Fifth Army, when I mentioned the names of all the camp sites, said; \"Well at least you've got that right.\" The names of the detention facilities that I gave him were a list that I had acquired from the 'Ozark Sunbeam'. That list of names was the same list of facilities designated under the old Detention Act of 1950 as \"emergency detention centers\". But there is only one problem: That act was supposed to have been repealed in 1971. After some research, I found out what the problem was. One Congressman, when the hearings were held for the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act, mentioned that there are 17 other bits of law that provided for the same thing. So it didn't matter whether they ever repealed the Emergency Detention Act. The public was in fact tricked by the Congress of the United States! Here are the designated sites: Tucked away in the Appalachian Mountains of central Pennsylvania is a bustling town of approx. 10,000 people. Fifteen to twenty years ago it was a sleepy village of 400. Allanwood, Pennsylvania is linked to New York City by Interstate U.S. 80. It takes up approximately 400 acres and is surrounded by a 10-foot barbed-wire fence. It now holds approximately 300 minimum security prisoners to keep it in shape. It could hold 12,000 people from one day to the next. Thirty miles from Oklahoma City on U.S. 66 is El Reno, Oklahoma with an approximate population of 12,000. Due west, 6 miles from tow, almost in sight of U.S. 66 is a complex of buildings which could pass for a small school. However, the facility is overshadowed by a guard house which appears to be something like airport control tower, except that it's manned by a vigilant, uniformed guard. This is a federal prison camp or detention center. Page 9 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"These camps are all located near super-highways or near railroad tracks or both. The federal prison camp at Florence, Arizona could hold 3,500 prisoners. It is presently kept in condition by approximately 400 legally convicted prisoners. Wickenberg, Arizona is famous for its municipal airport, which was once government-owned. It is now occupied by a private party. It is rumored to be capable of being taken back by the federal government without notice. Now there are a couple other of these facilities which probably exist under the same arrangements. This particular rumor has existed for about 9 or 10 years. The only way it can actually be established is by looking at the local contract for the Wickenberg Municipal Airport itself and the parties that have possession of it. As I mentioned previously, these names were ratified by the provost marshal of the Fifth Army who is in charge of the 300th Military Police POW Command. He is the one who verified them. He said, as I mentioned before, \"Well at least you've got that right.\" Some of the locations are: Tool Lake in California, now in private hands. It can be retaken without notice. Mill Point, West Virginia. I couldn't find a thing on Mill Point, but in that area we have all kinds of prisons; Alderson, W.V., a women's federal reformatory; Lewisburg, W.V., a federal prison; Greenville, S.C. in Greenville County is now occupied by the State Youthful Offenders Division. Even that is a mystery to the people of that area. At Montgomery, Alabama we have a federal civilian prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base. Now does that sound right? There's one at Tucson, Arizona, David Munson Air Base. In Alaska we have Elmendorf at Eielson Air Force Base. And that brings us to a facility in Florida called Avon Park, Florida. I sent a representative to see what was there. He found the Avon Park Bombing and Gunnery Range, which is also listed as the Avon Park Correctional Institute. No one is permitted entrance and probably there is no over flight permitted because it is a bombing and gunnery range. This was one of the places ratified by the provost marshal of the Fifth Army. In 1976, as well as on March 20, 1979, I went to the Sheriff's Department in Houston to see if our local Sheriff had been infiltrated by these plans. Well, it appears so. I was put in contact with a Lt. Kiljan (phonetic spelling) who is in charge of some secret unit in the department. I asked him if be had participated in military training or in training with military personnel here in the Sheriff's Department. He denied it, and when I asked him if be would testify so under oath he became angry and stated, \"You are just an ordinary citizen. I don't have to tell you anything.\" I later discovered that Lt. Kiljan is the ex-director of the Houston branch office of the U.S. Secret Service. Now where does his money come from? The area is administered by the Houston- Galveston Area Council. In this regional government plan, each federal region is divided into state clearinghouses, and each state clearinghouse is divided into area clearinghouses. And for our area we have the Houston- Galveston Area Council. It serves as a conduit for federal funds in two major areas: L.E.A.A. and H.E.W. Most everybody thinks this organization (the Houston-Galveston area Council) is for the development of the area; the geographical area here in Houston. It is not. It is for the Page 10 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"development of L.E.A.A. and H.E.W. projects. Now this finds its counterpart in every community across the U.S. It provides for these agencies a liaison for intergovernmental communications, interaction and coordination. Chapter 6: MIND CONTROL: DRUGS AND PROPAGANDA I examined their projects to see what they were doing. This regional government program distributes federal funds for two major purposes: 1) Radio hookups between every police agency in the state to Fort Sam Houston, and; 2) Mental health programs,including programs for the mentally ill having priority of beds and hospitals. Another interesting fact to consider is that in the Pine Bluff Arkansas Arsenal \"B-Z\" is stored. It's a nerve gas which creates sleepiness, dizziness, stupor, and the incapacity to move about. According to the Associated Press, the agent can be sprayed by aerosol, injected or sprayed over large areas by a bomb. The Military has admitted that one potential use of the gas is for civilian control. So whatever they planned, they've also planned a way for you to go to your destination in a tranquil state of mind. H.E.W., by law, is operated in conjunction with the United Nations through the World Health Organization. Back in 1948, the International Congress on Mental Health, a U.N. organization, declared in its pamphlet \"Mental Health and World Citizenship\" that; Prejudice, hostility or excessive nationalism may become deeply imbedded in the developing personality without awareness on part of the individual concerned. In order to be effective, efforts of changing individual must be appropriate to the successive stages of the unfolding personality. While in a case of a group of society, change will be strongly resisted unless an attitude of acceptance has first been engendered. Principles of Mental health cannot be successfully furthered in any society unless there is progressive acceptance of the concept of world citizenship,... Programs for social change to be effective require a joint effort of psychiatrists and social scientist, working together in cooperation with statesmen, administrators and others in positions of responsibility. The three phases of the development are: 1) Mental hospitals for segregation, care and protection of persons of unsound minds.; 2) Community Mental Health Care Centers, so that persons may be treated in their own neighborhood.; 3) Child Care Centers for dealing with early difficulties of nationalism in a child's life. Two years earlier, Major General G.B. Chisholm, Deputy Minister of Health in Canada, Page 11 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"who later became director of United Nations World Health Organization, explained; \"Self defense may involve a neurotic reaction when it means defending one's own excessive material wealth from others who are in great need.

Further, the reinterpretation and eventual eradication of the individual's concept of right and wrong which has been the basis of child training are the belated objectives of practically all effective psychotherapies. Now if we digress even further, to Buria (phonetic spelling), the director of the Soviet Secret Police in the 1930's, we see he explained the communist political strategy through the use of \"mental healing\" of psychiatry: Psycho-politics is the art and science of asserting and of maintaining a dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, bureaus, and masses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through mental healing. You must work... until every teacher of psychology unknowingly or knowingly teaching only communistic doctrine under the guise of psychology. If you look at the Russian manual of instruction of psycho- political warfare, we see in chapter 9; Psycho-political operations should at all times be alert to the opportunities to organize for the betterment of the community mental health centers. Now, under the new national Mental Health program at this moment there are more than 600 of these community mental health centers across the United States. The whole thing was promoted by Dr. Stanley F. Yoles (phonetic spelling), who was the director of the National Institute of Mental Health in 1969. And he stated back then, that the newest trend in treating mental illness is care at local health care centers where the patient is not isolated from his (or her) family and friends. They have been working on this program for 46 years publicly. Now across the U.S through your tax dollars you have 603 centers (to be exact); Community Health Centers that are all part of this program. And this is how they are part of the program (it has already happened): In the mid-1950s, there were set into motion an interesting chain of events. About 1956 the Alaska Mental Health Bill was proposed and later passed. It granted approximately 12 million dollars, and 1 million acres of public land to Alaska so that it could develop its own mental health program. Now this was a little abnormal since Alaska only had a little over 400 people who were classified as mentally ill! After the bill was passed, Alaska passed its own enabling legislation to get into the mental health business. They started by adopting the essential elements of the Public Health Service Draft Act on the hospitalization of the mentally ill in the old \"Interstate Compact on Mental Health\", now called the Uniform Mental Health Act. There were no provisions for jury trial in it or anything else. You would just be picked up and taken to the Alaskan- Siberian Asylum incommunicado and the state would also confiscate all of your personal and real property! And they actually tried to do it in 1954 in the case of Ford vs. Milinak (phonetic spelling), which declared the act as adopted in another state (Missouri) as unconstitutional. Page 12 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"But the act itself still exists, modified, but essentially in the same form, the Uniform Mental Health Act to which approximately 6 states subscribe. And in passing most State Constitutions, if you will check them from the period of 1935, made a part of their constitution the practice of having a person submit to a 90-day mental examination to determine his (or her) sanity, without any provisions for a trial by jury. This was part of the national program at that time. In this act, the governor could have anyone picked up and sent to the Mental Health Institution in Alaska or elsewhere. The result as rumors back in the '50s, were that there was in fact a sinister, Frankenstein-type mental health prison in Alaska. I wrote to Alaska (the officials that is) and asked them for a description of the land of 1 million acres that they were eligible to receive, under the Alaska Mental Health Act, were. And I also asked them for a copy of the inventory they ran for their facilities back at that same time. Well, so far no answer. And probably, I will never receive an answer without a court order. But through the years, there was a spot in Alaska that was continually referred to: Southeast of Fairbanks; southwest of Fairbanks; northwest of Fairbanks; somewhere near Fairbanks. Then I received information that a pilot had flown over the area once and had his license revoked. And so, for $1.85 each, I ordered the low-level navigation maps from the federal government for Alaska and located the Alaska-Siberian Asylum for the treatment of enemies of the United States. It's right where rumor over the past 20 years had placed it: Southwest of Fairbanks. It stands out like a sore thumb! It's the only one of that geometric configuration within the sate of Alaska, and you will note a black line running up through Fairbanks and down over near that area of the map. That is the railroad that the Department of Transportation would take the emergency operation of, under the Executive Order, if the Executive Order went into effect. And H.E.W. would be responsible for making a determination of whether or not you were mentally disturbed because of your nationalistic tendencies, your love for the United States, or your adherence to any political or religious doctrine. But let's look a little further into the type of program that the L.E.A.A. is paying for through the Department of Justice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, located in the backwoods of North Carolina, near a tiny village called Butner, is constructing a mammoth 42 acre research complex for prisoners from throughout the East. Who will be sent for experiments to test new behavioral programs and techniques? Target date for completion of the entire system is ironically 1984. And so, they're using right now, under the L.E.A.A. program, something called anectine (Phonetic spelling). Punishment for troublesome behavior within the prison is being done by drugs and shock, likely to be the most selected examples of programs that have made use of anectine, a derivative of South American curare. Anectine was originally used as a beginning factor to electro- convulsive shock. Such shocks applied to the bead are so strong they can break and graze bones under the strain of resulting muscle contractions. Since anectine paralyzed the muscles without dampening consciousness or the ability to feel pain, by first injecting the inmates with it, researchers can turn up the voltage as high as they want without cracking the inmates' skeleton when his body is thrown into convulsions by the jolt. What the anectine does, in short, is to simulate death within 30 to 40 seconds of injection. It brings on paralysis first with the small rapidly moving muscles in the nose, fingers and eyes, and then in the diaphragm and the cardiovascular system. As a result, the patient Page 13 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"cannot move or breathe and yet remains fully conscious, as though drowning and dying. This is from the 1974 publication, 'Human Behavior'. Chapter 7: THE PEOPLE VS. THE CONSPIRATORS The federal government answered my suit in June (1976) by filing an unsworn general denial of everything that I had alleged. I spoke with the assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the case and asked him if he had gone to the trouble to call any of the parties mentioned in the suits. since I had provided not only the addresses, but their telephone numbers to provide a faster means of investigation. He said he had not. He had not even done a minimal amount of investigation of the case, but yet he filed a denial of my allegations. I filed a motion in the meantime to take the deposition of the person who writes the training programs for the concentration camp guards, Mr. Richard Burrage, the 75th Maneuver Air Command at Army Reserve Center at Houston, Texas, stating that in light of all the recent activity of government agents, one of the agencies involved might attempt to murder this key witness, the author of the training camp program. The federal Judge denied my motion, stating that I had not quoted enough cases to him justifying my request. However, he was also aware as that there were no cases existing on this set of facts, but as you will see as I go along with this report, he chose to ignore it. I then made an agreement with the assistant U.S. Attorney to take the deposition to Mr. Burrage. After I'd made the arrangements, the U.S. Attorney refused to voluntarily go along with taking the deposition. It is very difficult to find justice in our system of courts. Law is usually practiced by the \"buddy system\", hence the court rules are overlooked or not followed. On July 20, a hearing was held at the magistrates of Norman Black U.S. District Court in Houston. The courtroom was completely filled with spectators. And although the news media had been contacted, no representatives of the press were there. There is a news media blackout on this matter here in Houston. Brief oral arguments were presented. The U.S. Attorney explained that I was not the proper person to bring the suit because, although the free exercise of my constitutional rights was threatened by the concentration camp program as alleged, it did not constitute my injury. The magistrate was impressed with the information I had thus far collected and stated that he would bring it to the attention of the federal judge. The U.S. Attorney tried to have my investigation of the case halted, but the magistrate would not go along that far with a pre- arranged decision. As an additional indication of what I was up against, the original hearing was scheduled for 10:30 in the morning. However, the U.S. Attorney had secretly had the time changed to 2:30 in the afternoon. The magistrate gave the U.S. Attorney permission to file for motion to dismiss because he felt that the concentration camp program, to be used for persons who exercise their freedom of speech, did not present any injury. Now, on July 23 I had placed in the 'Houston Post' and in the 'Houston Chronicle' newspapers the following advertisement in the legal section. Quote: \"Solicitation for witnesses in Civil Action 78 - H - 667, Federal District Court of Houston, People extemporal Page 14 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"William Pabst vs. Gerald Ford et al. The action titled: Complaint Against the Concentration Camp Program of the Dept. of Defense. Attention: If you have participated in Operation Garden Plot, Operation Cable Splicer, the 300th Military Police Prisoner of War Command, or the Army Reserve Civil Affairs group, you may be involved in a program that needs to be deposed for this suit. To give your testimony call or write; (and here I placed my name address and telephone number). As I previously mentioned, there is a news media blackout on the story here in Houston. Both newspapers refused to carry the ad. First at the 'Houston Post'; I had to threaten them with a law suit to carry out the ad, even though I was paying for it. And then at the 'Chronicle'; I had to meet with the president and various vice presidents because a refusal from that paper had come up from their own lawyers. Both newspapers finally carried it, but only after two days of complaining. The initial response of both papers was; \"We don't carry stories like that\", and; \"Don't you think that the people planning the concentration camps have our best interests in mind?\" As you will hear for yourselves, the policies definitely do not reflect our best interests. The next event that occurred was that the U.S. Attorney filed a \"Statement of Authority\", showing the reasons that he could find why I should not be allowed to take depositions to get more information from the person who was writing the concentration camp guard training program. However, his brief was completely filled with misquotes of the law from many cases. He'd mention the case and then invent whatever the case should say. In my brief to the court at this point, I notified the judge of the violation of the law requiring honesty in such matters. But the notification was ignored by the judge, who apparently sanctioned this most dishonest of acts commonly known as \"quoting out of context\". Chapter 8: THE GENEVA CONVENTION My brief filed on August 27. On August 31, formal arguments were set. The new courtroom of the magistrate was almost filled again. However, no one from the news media showed up for this hearing either. The few who were contacted had been told not to go; they would lose their jobs. At the hearing I introduced evidence that heretofore had never been introduced in any court of law in the U.S. The U.S. Attorney had denied, you will remember, everything in my suit without so much as even a tiny investigation. So I introduced him to evidence the following letter from the Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff of Personnel, signed by; I.B. Sergeant, Colonel G.S., Acting Director of Human Resources Development. Quoting: On behalf of President Ford, I am replying to your letter 27 May, 1976, regarding a news article in the Dallas Morning News. As much as he would like to, the president cannot reply personally to every communication he receives. Therefore, he has asked the departments and agencies of the federal government in those instances where they have special knowledge or special authority under law. For this reason your communication was forwarded to officials of the Dept. of Defense. Within the Dept. of Defense, the Army is responsible for custody and treatment of enemy prisoners of war and civilian internees as defined under terms of the Geneva Convention of Page 15 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1949. Therefore, the Army is prepared to detain prisoners of war and detainees as defined in Article IV of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war and protection of civilian persons. It is U.S. policy that its Armed Forces adhere to the provisions of international law to set the example for other countries of the world to follow and respecting the right and dignity of those who become victim of international conflict. It should be noted that the Army program is designed for implementation during conditions of war between the U.S. and one or more foreign countries. The Army had no plans nor does it maintain detention camps to imprison American citizens during domestic crises. The problem with this letter is that it's not true, and that's what I'm going to discuss at this point. First of all, in verifying the authenticity of the claims in the letter, I checked the Geneva text and there is no article in the Geneva Convention entitled as the letter states. There is, however, on each of the classifications; \"Protection of War Victims/Civilian Persons\" and a separate article on \"Prisoners of War\". That was the first discrepancy. Then I turned to Article IV of the Geneva Convention. That article did not set up any requirements or authorizations for military units of any type and does not even suggest it. Hence, the second discrepancy. The next problem with the letter from President Ford's representative is that it states that he prisoner of war guard program is set up for the implementation for \"conditions of war between the U.S. and one or more (foreign) countries.\" However, Article III of the Geneva Convention reads that the treaty applies to (and I am quoting): \"In case of an armed conflict not of an international character, occurring within the territory of one of the high contracting parties.\" Obviously and armed conflict occurring within one's own territory did not mean between one or more of the parties to the treaty, especially if only one is involved. Now, the examples of this type of conflict are: civil war, armed insurgency and guerrilla activities. In other words, they're speaking of a domestic conflict. An even more shocking item is found in the last pages of the 1949 Geneva Convention under \"Protection of War Victims/Civilian Persons\". You will find the index card, the identification card, forms to be used for writing your family, and everything necessary for the administration of a concentration camp is contained in this treaty that the U.S. signed and ratified. Further, if there is a conflict in the U.S. involving only the U.S. this convention or treaty can go into operation; which includes the procedures for setting up the concentration camps. Article LXVIII of the Convention states (and I paraphrase): If you commit an offense that is solely intended to harm the occupying power, not harming the life or limb of members of the occupying power, but merely talking against such a force, such as the Martial Law situation, you can be imprisoned provided that the duration of such imprisonment is proportional to he offense committed. Well, President Dwight Eisenhower didn't feel that provision was strong enough. So he had the following additions placed in the treaty, which states: \"The U.S. reserves the right to impose the death penalty in accordance with the provisions of Article LXVIII without regard to whether the offenses referred to therein are punishable by death under the law of the occupied territory at the time the occupation begins.\" So not only can you be imprisoned for having exercised freedom of speech; you can be put to death under the provisions of the Geneva Convention in 1949 for having exercised, or Page 16 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"attempting to exercise, freedom of speech. The next item that I introduced into evidence was a field manual; FM 41-10, \"Civil Affairs Operation\". You will remember at the outset that I mentioned Civil Affairs groups. Let me quote to you from that manual what one of the functions of the Civil Affairs activities includes: Item 4. Assumption of full or partial executive, legislative and judicial authority over a country or area. So let's see what a \"country or area\" is defined as in the same manual. It includes: small towns and rural areas, municipalities of various population sizes, districts, counties, provinces or states, regions of national government. Nowhere in the manual does it exclude this program from being put into effect right here in the United States. As a matter of fact in Kearny, New Jersey, the Civil Affairs group went into that area and practiced taking over that governmental unit. And yet the Army in its letter of June 16-states that these programs are not for us. Yet they are practiced here in the United States under conditions that can only occur here at home. The study outline of field manual, FM 41-10 on page j-24 under \"Penal Institutions 1-B\", you see there is a program on concentration camps and labor camps-number, location and capacity. It is important to note that a concentration camp and a labor camp are always located near each other, for obvious reasons. Again on page d-4 of the same manual you'll find a sample receipt for seized property; a sample receipt written in English and containing terminology applicable to only U.S. territory. On page 8-2 of the same manual, under the heading \"Tables of Organization and Equipment\", we find that there are 3 other organizations that would be working along with the Civil Affairs operation: The Chemical Service Organization, the Composite Service Organization, and the Psychological Operations Organization, along with the various Civil Affairs organizations. In July of that year (1976), the following Civil Affairs groups met with the following airborne groups at a staging area in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. A staging area is where military units meet before they go into action. They met with the 82nd Airborne and part of the 101st Airborne; the 32nd Civil Affairs group of San Antonio, Texas headquarters; the 362nd Civil Affairs brigade from Dallas, Texas; the 431st Civil Affairs company from Little Rock Arkansas headquarters; the 306th Civil Affairs group, U.S. Army Reserves, Fayetteville, Arkansas commanded by Lt. Colonel N. McQuire (phonetic spelling) and William Highland. The 486th Civil Affairs company from Tulsa, Oklahoma; the 418th Civil Affairs company from Kansas City, MO.; the 307th Civil Affairs group from St. Louis, MO.; the 490th Civil Affairs group from Abilene, Tex.; the 413th company from Hanlin, La; the 12th S.S. group, 2nd Battalion (headquarters unknown). They're ready to go into action. The problem is as it appears they were ready to take over the entire government of the United States as their mission sets out. One man who attended Page 17 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"this staging area talked to a Civil Affairs sergeant and asked him what his job was. The sergeant explained that the civilians of this country will really be surprised some day when the Civil Affairs groups begin to operate the government. Now the Dept. of the Army still maintains that all this is not for the United States, yet this training continues here for us. The evidence is overwhelming; the plan exists for the imprisonment of millions of U.S. citizens. And even through all this information was presented to the federal magistrate, he still felt that no one was injured by such a plot. On the 2nd day of September, 1976, the magistrate recommended to the federal judge that the case be dismissed. And the sole basis for his reasoning to dismiss was that we have to be actually physically injured before we can maintain a law suit of this type. He did not feel that although all this active planing, preparation and training was going on, that any U.S. citizen had been injured even though the citizen may fear exercising his or her freedom for fear of being detained and imprisoned in a concentration camp at a later date. Chapter 9: IGNORING THE CONSTITUTION The case of Tatum B. Laird, heard before the Supreme Court in 1974, is a case in point. It involved the Army intelligence collecting apparatus, which was developing a list of names of persons who the Army felt were troublesome. The Supreme Court held that the making of lists of this type did not of and by itself present any injuries. The minority opinion in that case was that the injury in the case with a program such as this made people afraid to use their freedom of speech for fear of being sent to jail for it. But the majority did not buy that argument. The difference between that case and this case although we also have the computer program, is that we have something much further past that point; the concentration camp guard program and the Civil Affairs program for the taking over of all functions of our government. In light of that the federal judge said that this is not an injury. As a matter of fact the U.S. Attorney alleged that even if people were placed in concentration camps, if they were all treated the same they would still not have the right to go to federal court. On the 20th day of September, I filed a memorandum to notify the magistrate and the federal judge that I had discovered that the federal government had a program for a number of years to suspend our constitutional right of the writ of habeas corpus. This information substantiated the complaint. Habeas corpus is the name of that legal instrument utilized to bring someone before a judge when that person is being illegally imprisoned or detained so that he (or she) may obtain his (or her) freedom. The Constitution states that the writ of habeas corpus shall never be suspended. I found the disturbing information in a report; 94-755, 94th Congress, 2nd Session Senate, April 26th, 1976, entitled \"Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Book II\". On page 17-d, entitled \"First Amendment Rights\", the report states that more importantly \"the government surveillance activities in the aggregate, whether expressly intended to do so, to deter the exercise of First Amendment rights by American citizens who become aware of the government's domestic intelligence program.\" Beginning on page 54 it is stated that, beginning in 1946, four years before the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 was passed, the FBI advised the Attorney General that it had secretly Page 18 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"compiled a secret index of potentially dangerous persons. The Justice Dept. then made tentative plans for emergency detention based on suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Department officials deliberately avoided going to Congress. When the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 was passed, it did not authorize the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. But shortly after passage of that act according to a bureau document, Attorney General J.R. McGraft told the FBI to disregard it and to proceed with the program as previously outlined. A few sentences later on page 55 it states, \"With the security index, use broader standards to determine potential dangerousness than those described in the statute.\" And unlike the act, Department plans provided for issuing a master search warrant and a master arrest warrant. This is the center importance: It is the same thing that I am alleging in federal court, yet the magistrate chose to ignore these facts also. We have government officials not only ignoring the will of Congress, but doing the opposite of what the Constitution provides by planning illegally for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. In addition, as mentioned before, the master search warrant and the master arrest warrant are forms fed into the computer, which print the names and addresses on them from the tapes previously prepared by the intelligence-gathering program. As you are arrested, your home will be searched and anything found there may be confiscated. This program has existed since 1946 up to and including 1973, and without proper access to judicial discovery techniques, it can't be determined whether the same plan now exists under the same name or under another name right now. This memorandum was filed on September 28 to make the court aware of the danger that our rights of freedom of speech and lawful assembly are in. But the court, on September 30, after this notification was received, dismissed the case. However, in keeping with the practice of federal courts in Houston of actively participating in the obstruction of justice, I was not notified of the dismissal until the 6th of October, which gave me just 2 working days to submit any further motion in a 10-day period before time starts running for the appeal. What I have just said regarding the federal courts in Houston is not only my opinion; the 'Houston Chronicle', surprisingly, published an extensive document severely criticizing the federal court in Houston for making up their own rules as they go along with the proceeding, as well as commenting on the communist-like Supreme Court attitude of the judges and court personnel. My experience here has been that the court has returned to me almost every document I filed. Then after a big argument they reaccept the document, stating that they just made a mistake. In reality, the Power structure doesn't want these type of cases in any federal court. Chapter 10: SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE On the 8th of October, I had submitted a request for finding the facts in the filing which had been established by the evidence presented: 1) The 300th Military Police POW Command is located at Livonia, Mich. 2) The Dept. of the Army has stated that said Command exists per se the Geneva Page 19 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Convention of 1949, a treaty of the U.S., Article IV thereof under the title relative to the treatment of prisoners of war and protection of civilian persons. 3) No such title exists in the Geneva Convention per se. 4) There are separate titles, one which is; a. Multilateral Protection of War Victims/Prisoners of War; b. Multilateral Protection of War Victim/Civilian Persons. 5) Nevertheless, Article IV of both titles does not provide for the creation of any military programs for concentration camps. 6) Whether Mr. Fenren of the 300th Military Police POW Command has stated that the purpose of the Command is for the detention of foreign prisoners of war and enemies of the United States. 7) Further, Article III, concerning civilian persons, makes the treaty applicable to conflicts occurring solely within the territory of the United States that are not of an international character, which is capable of including any type of conflict in its description whether it be civil war or guerrilla activity or anything else. The text states: In case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties, each party to a conflict shall be bound to apply to the minimum of the following provisions. 8) Dept. of the Army field manual FM41-10, Civil Affairs Operations of Civil Affairs Organization, lists as one of its functions the assumption of full or partial executive, legislative and judicial authority over a count or an area and there is no specific exclusion of the United States as such a country or area. 9) Said manual defines country along certain geographical population basis, county, state regions and national government. 10) Said organization has in fact conducted practiced takeovers of local and state governments in the continental United States, including but not limited to the state of New Jersey. 11) Said organization includes in its study outline on page j-24 a section on concentration camps and labor camps. 12) Said organization includes in it operations composite service operations and psychological operations organizations. 13) Said psychological operation is working with the U.S. Public Health Service, are prepared to operate any and all mental health facilities in the United States as tools of repression against outspoken but nonviolent political conduct of the United States citizens in conjunction with all the above, which is to be used for the same purpose. 14) Further, the Dept. of Justice, in conjunction with this program, has had plans for the suspension of writ of habeas corpus since the year of 1946; has planned depriving persons being detained under this total program any means for protection against tyrannical political Page 20 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"repression. The plaintiff requested that the court make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law, consistent therewith as shown by the evidence on record before the court. The effect of this request is that the case must go back to the district judge for further consideration. I mentioned that it appeared that all this planning for concentration camps was to be directed against anyone regardless of his political persuasion or his ideology who exercised freedom of speech against the established power structure of international bankers and multinational corporations. But with Proposition B-type movements threatening to reduce taxes throughout our nation, I foresee an activation of emergency programs so that the parasites on the federal take will continue to receive their checks. Chapter 11: ARE YOU ON THEIR LIST? In the same Senate document, on intelligence activities on the right of Americans referred to on pages 166 and 167, you will find that the federal government has targeted its intelligence activities against one group of Americans. On page 166 the first classification listed is rightists and anti-Communist groups. The first group on Page 167 on Army surveillance lists the John Birch Society as number 1 and the Young Americans for Freedom as the number 2 target. Therefore, the groups of U.S. American citizens considered to be the biggest enemy of the United States by the federal government at this is the conservative patriot. Although this information has been available since April of this year (1979), no one has mentioned this incredible discovery that the federal government considers the patriotic conservative as its greatest enemy. I have received all kinds of information regarding this case from all across the United States. Chapter 12: THE PRICE OF APATHY I obtained the 1945 report of the O.S.S. (office of Strategic Services), the precursor of the C.I.A., 7th. Army, William W. Quinn, Colonel G.F.C.A.C. of the G2, on the liberation of Dachau, a concentration camp during the liberation in Germany. It contains many groups of information, but the relevant portion of the report concerns itself with the section on the townspeople. Quoting from his report, on why the people of this little town didn't complain or didn't overthrow oppressors, but just continued to go along and get along even though they lost their freedom in the process. I quote: These words crop up and up again. They are the rationalization of a man who admits that he was a member of the Nazi party. \"I was forced to do so by business reasons\", they state. We were lied to in every respect but they admit they knew the camp existed. But they saw the work detail to the inmates passing through the streets under guard, and in some instances the S.S. behaved brutally even towards the townspeople. When asked if they realized that within the last 3 months before the liberation 13,000 men lost their lives within stone's throw of where the people lived, they claimed they were shocked and surprised. When asked if they never saw transports of dead and dying pass through he streets along the Page 21 of 24 CONCENTRATION CAMP PLANS FOR U.S. CITIZENS 03/02/2004 http://www.heart7.net/mcf/us - concentration - camps.htm"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"railway, they referred only to the last one. They insist that most of the trains came in at night and that they were sealed cars. Did they never ask what was in the endless procession of cars that came in full and always went out empty? A typical reply was, \"We were told it was all army material and booty from France.\" It is established that anyone who stated that he saw only one train come in the daytime was telling a flat lie. There are quite a few such people in Dachau. The analysis of the anti-Nazi element of the town: 1) The people knew what was going on in the camp, even ten years prior to liberation; 2) The town did a thriving business from the concentration camp guard; 3) Ninety percent are guilty and have dabbed themselves with the blood of innocent human beings; 4) The people are to blame for their cowardice; they were all too cowardly. They didn't want to risk anything. And that was the way it was in all of Germany. The conclusion of this report written on Dachau written in 1945 on the liberation of the concentration camp applies today. The conclusion is as follows: If one is to attempt tremendous task and accept the terrible responsibility of judging a whole town, assessing it in mass as to collect a guilt of innocence of all its inhabitants for their complicity in committing this most heinous of crimes, one would do well to remember the fearsome shadow that hangs over everyone in this state in which crime has been incorporated and called the government. So you can see how the whole program is related here. My lawsuit was against one single aspect of the total program: The enforcement arm of the conspiracy. The people who make up the cadre that is going to occupy the concentration camps where enemies of the United States will be placed. Remember Solzhenitsyn's words in the 'Gulag Archipelago': Resistance should have began right there but it did not begin. You aren't gagged, you really can and you really ought to cry out that arrests are being made on the strength of false accusations. If many such outcries had been heard all over the city would arrests have no longer have been so easy. They, the tyrants, can't work in the public eye. Those people who were so apathetic, hoping that nothing was really wrong, that nothing would happen to their persons and property, sat back and watched. The anarchists, financed by multinational interests, looted and pillaged their country.

And when you have to steal food to eat because our production is for foreign use because the Dept. of Commerce, through Executive Order 11490 and its predecessors, is responsible for international distribution of our commodities, don't sit in the culvert hiding and eating and wondering what happened: You made it all possible. When your family is split up and spread across the United States to do slave labor and you never see your loved ones again, it will be your fault: You did nothing to prevent it. Once we lose our freedom we are never going to regain it. That is why we must stand together to prevent the loss of our freedom as citizens of the United States. Thank you very much.
