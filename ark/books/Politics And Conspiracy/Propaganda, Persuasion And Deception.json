Be Reasonable: Selected Quotations for Inquiring Minds , by Laird Wilcox and John George (Prometheus, 1994), and The Degeneration of Belief , by Laird Wilcox (Editorial Research Service, 1999). Other sources include my own notes, quotations sent to me by friends, internet searching, and the read - ing of a very large number of books. It’s important to bear in mind that quotations are, almost by definition, statements removed from their original context, i.e., brief statements taken from an often vastly larger work. Even in cases where the quotation is brief, to the point and matter-of-fact, the larger work may frame it in a particular way that might get lost or muted when considered apart from it. In addition, people are often inconsistent. A per - son may say one thing in a particular work and then say something quite the opposite in another, or sometimes even the same work. Another factor to consider is state of mind. I have heard writers say, “I knew what I was thinking when I wrote that,” implying that it was somehow different from what the statement appears to mean now when read by others, perhaps of a different persuasion. People are often inconsistent in their beliefs and dou - ble standards often appear in their writings. For example, a person may defend freedom of expression and write glowing statements in its behalf, and then advocate denying that same freedom when it is claimed by a hated person or group. Politicians are particularly prone to this distressing behavior. Having said all of this, nevertheless the vast majority of quotations in this volume do, in fact, mean what they appear to say in plain language. However, it’s important to realize that there may be cases in which the author or others may dispute this. My advice is this: if you are going to use a quote from this volume in an important way, i.e., in an academic thesis or dissertation or in work for publication, it may be to your advantage to go to the original source and determine its suitability and/or accuracy for yourself.

Reality does not come nearly packaged in two- or three-minute lengths; raw history is filled with perversities, contradictions, ratted edges. ... TV is a storytelling medium. It abhors ambiguities, ragged edges, and unresolved issues. ... The effect all to frequently is to impose upon an event or situation a preconceived form that alters reality, heightening one aspect at the expense of another for the sake of a more compelling story, blocking out complications that get in the way of the narrative. ELIE ABEL, “Television in International Conflict,” in The News Media and National and International Conflict (Andrew Arno & Wimal Dissayanake, eds.), 1984. 2. Government by idea tends to take in everything, to make the whole of society obedient to the idea. Spaces not so governed are unconquered, beyond the border, unconverted, unconvinced, a future danger. LORD ACTON (1834-1902). 3. When a man you like switches from what he said a year ago, or four years ago, he is a broad-minded person who has courage enough to change his mind with changing conditions. When a man you don't like does it, he is a liar who has broken his promise. FRANKLIN P. ADAMS (1861-1960). 4. Images are not arguments, they rarely even lead to proof, but the mind craves them. HENRY BROOKS ADAMS (1838-1918), The Education of Henry Adams , 1907. 5. The whispering campaign, disgusting as it is, would appear to be a permanent campaign method with us. So long, at least, as our politics are primarily concerned with men rather than with measures, it will be the men who will be attacked; characters, not ideas. JAMES TRUSLOW ADAMS (1878-1949), “Our Whispering Campaigns,” Harper’s , September 1932. 6. The ‘hidden meaning” emerges simply by the way the story looks at human beings; thus the audience is invited to look at the characters in the same way [as the story] without being made aware that indoctrination is present. ... th[e] message is hidden only by a style which does not pretend to touch anything serious and expects to be regarded as featherweight. Nevertheless, even such amusement tends to set patterns for the members of the audience without their being aware of it. THEODOR W. ADORNO (1903-1969), “How To Look At Television,” Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television, 8 , 1954. 7. Now how is this network news determined? A small group of men...s ettle upon the 20 minutes or so of film and commentary to reach the public... They can elevate men from obscurity to national prominence within a week. They can reward some politicians with national exposure and ignore others... Nor is their power confined to the substantive. A raised eyebrow, an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast, can raise doubts in a million minds... SPIRO AGNEW, Vice-President of the United States, Speech, Midwest Republican Conference , 13 November 1969, 8.

SPIRO AGNEW, Vice-President of the United States, Speech, Midwest Republican Conference , 13 November 1969. 9. If you could master one element of personal communications that is more powerful than anything we’ve discussed, it is the quality of being likable . I call it the magic bullet, because if your audience likes you, they’ll forgive just about everything else you do wrong. If they don’t like you, you can hit every rule right on target and it doesn’t matter. ROGER AILES, You Are The Message , 1988. 10. The first information survival skill we all need is the ability to decode propaganda and demythologize the highly commercialized and entertainment-based U. S. culture. Psychologists politely call it ‘resistance to enculturation.’ Writer Ernest Hemingway had a less elegant term: ‘crap detecting.’ KARL ALBRECHT, article in Training and Development , February 2001. 11. Who speaks to the instincts speaks to the deepest in mankind, and finds the readiest response. AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT (1799-1888). 12. The flow of ideas, the capacity to make informed choices, the ability to criticize, all of the assumptions on which political democracy rests, depend largely on communications. And you [the media] are the guardians of the most powerful and effective means of communication ever designed. DEAN ALGER, The Media and Politics , 1989. 13. Choice is at the core of democracy; the absence of choice means that democracy is lessened to one degree or another, depending on the nature of the lost choice. DEAN ALGER, The Media and Politics , 1989. 14. [A] non-scientific way of speaking about public opinion, sometimes encountered in popular usage and even in the literature, represents the opinion content as a kind of essence which, like a platonic “idea,” is distributed into the minds of all those who endorse it. The expression that a certain opinion is “public” illustrates this usage. FLOYD ALLPORT, “Toward a Science of Public Opinion,” Public Opinion Quarterly 1 , 1937. 15. Charisma, as a psychological quality or emanation, may be thought of as a surcharge of personality or leadership characteristics that fill most easily the emptinesses of another person’s psyche: especially those created by boredom, depression, and developmental deficits. Charisma, through its power to overstimulate, can effectively mask the narcissistically seductive and self-service aims are often blatantly evident. GERALD ALPER, The Puppeteers: Studies of Obsessive Control, 1994. 16. What bothers me is that the hyper-adversarialism that has ruined the American legal system is now really corroding journalism. ... It is driven by the TV shows. You get two people who are adversaries and watch them fight. The more they fight, the better TV is. ... It’s adversarialism as pure sport. JONATHAN ALTER, in Breaking the News (James Fallows), 1997. 17. The propagandist tries to stimulate others to accept without challenge his own assertions.... Propaganda makes use of slogans, but it also makes effective use of symbols. A symbol is a concrete representation of an idea, action, or thing - a sign that stands for something.... A symbol can be a word, a mark, an object, a song, a flag, an image, a picture, a statue, or some collective group representation -- anything that conveys a common thought to masses of people. AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION, What Is Propaganda ? 1944. 18. There is no such thing as ideational morale without bias. Hopes, aspirations, duties, and the hierarchy of values, in which first things are put first and means are subordinated to ends, are all 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"forms of bias. They cannot be implanted by cultivating an attitude of neutral detachment. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, Morale for a Free World , 1944. 19. The finding is almost universal that the ethos of the sources is related in some way to the impact of the message. This generalization applies not only to political, social, religious, and economic issues but also to matters of aesthetic judgment and personal taste. KENNETH ANDERSON & THEODORE CLEVENGER, JR., “A Summary of Experimental Research in Ethos,” Speech Monographs 30 (1963). 20. There is undoubtedly an intimate and compelling relationship between persuasion and coercion. The persuader, in his examination of alternatives, may find his position greatly strengthened when one alternative offered is the surrender to coercive methods. ... While persuasion may be viewed by some as the antithesis of coercion, persuasion may often depend on it’s opposite to achieve its goal. J. R. ANDREWS, “The Rhetoric of Coercion and Persuasion: The Reform Bill of 1832,” The Quarterly Journal of Speech, 56 , 1970. 21. The secret agent is a journalist who assumes prominence in the opposition for his strident calls to violence; he is the speaker who addresses proletarian meetings and urges them to put an end to capitalism... [Revolutionaries] suspicion of each other contributes far more to their helplessness than to their safety. L. ANDRIEUX, Recollections of a Prefect of Police, Paris; Vol 1 , 1885. 22. The vested interests - if we explain the situation by their influence - can only get the public to act as they wish by manipulating public opinion, by playing either upon the public’s indifference, confusions, prejudices, pugnacities or fears. SIR NORMAN ANGELL (1874-1967), The Great Illusion , 1933. 23. Propaganda is a soft weapon; hold it in your hands too long, and it will move about like a snake, and strike the other way. JEAN ANOUILH (1910-1987), The Lark , 1955. 24. Once upon a time, this country divided itself neatly along party lines. ... Television has changed all that. Now, we are split by a new division: between loyalists and apathetics. On the one hand, media propaganda can often shore up loyalists to vote for their traditional party; on the other hand, the same propaganda is increasingly peeling off a band of citizens who turn from independence to apathy, even antipathy, toward out political institutions. STEPHEN ANSOLABEHERE & SHANTO IYENGAR, Going Negative: How Political Advertisements Shrink and Polarize the Electorate , 1995. 25. The brevity of the [political] advertising message may actually strengthen its information value. The typical person’s attention span for political information is notoriously short lived ... The great majority of voters bypass or ignore information that entails more than minimal acquisition costs, preferring to use messages that are simple to digest and easily obtained. STEPHEN ANSOLABEHERE & SHANTO IYENGAR, Going Negative: How Political Advertisements Shrink and Polarize the Electorate , 1995. 26. The most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what is untrue. ANTISTHENES (444- 365 BC). 27. Lenin made ideology into a form of philosophical propaganda. He was both ideologue and ideologist. In his hand, communism became a revolutionary dogma. DAVID E. APTER, Ideology and Discontent , 1964. 28. The fundamental reason for the superiority of totalitarian propaganda over the propaganda of other parties and movements is that its content, for members of the movement at any rate, is no longer an objective issue about which people may have opinions, but has become as real and untouchable an 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"element in their lives as the rules of arithmetic. HANNAH ARENDT (1906-1975), The Origins of Totalitarianism , 1968. 29. The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and the deceiver want to hide. HANNAH ARENDT (1906-1975), Crisis of the Republic , 1972. 30. The successful propagandist does not behave when on the platform in a relaxed, informal, and ‘familiar’ style; on the contrary, he has the ‘presence’ and dramatizes himself and his message by a certain amount of showmanship. Schizophrenics and hysterics have often been successful in the past as religious leaders, probably because their intense conviction or dramatic self-presentation courted authority with their audiences. MICHAEL ARGYLE (1925-2002), The Psychology of Interpersonal Behavior , 1969. 31. He is making decisions when, in reality, it has all been managed by the persuader armed with the results from experimental social psychology. ... So we have a world in which the client is to feel genuinely better about himself as a human being because he has had an encounter with a canvasser who was schooled in winning and controlling others. C. ARGYRIS, “Dangers in Applying Results from Experimental Social Psychology,” American Psychologist, 30 , 1975. 32. You will develop your case mainly by arguing that what been done is, for example, noble and useful. The facts themselves are to be taken on trust; proof of them is only admitted on those rare occasions when they are not easily credible or when they are set down to someone else. ARISTOTLE (384-322 BC), Rhetoric . 33. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. The first kind depends upon the personal character of the speaker; the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind; the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers when a speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question. ARISTOTLE (384-322 BC), Rhetoric . 34. Often beliefs that we hold are never called into question; when they are not, it is relatively easy for us to lose sight of why we hold them. Thus, if subjected to severe attack, such beliefs may crumble. ELLIOT ARONSON, The Social Animal, 1976. 35. Those who produce television news can exert a powerful influence on our opinions simply be determining which events are given exposure – and how much exposure they are given. ELLIOT ARONSON, The Social Animal , 1976. 36. Depending on the context, objects and alternatives can be made to look better or worse. Often we do not pay much attention to the influence of context, much less question the validity of the alternatives presented. This greatly enhances the power of “context makers” such as politicians, advertisers, journalists, and sales agents. ELLIOT ARONSON, The Social Animal , 1976. 37. The cinema implies a total inversion of values, a complete upheaval of optics, of perspective and logic. It is more exciting than phosphorus, more captivating than love. ANTONIN ARTAUD (1895- 1948). 38. The marketing strategies used to appeal to utilitarian and hedonic needs are very different. Advertising that appeals to utilitarian needs tends to be more informative and rational. ... Advertising 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"that appeals to hedonic needs tends to be more symbolic and emotional. HENRY ASSAEL, Consumer Behavior and Marketing Action , 1998. 39. Self-concept (or self-image) theory holds that individuals have a concept of self based on who they think they are (the actual self) and a concept of who they think they would like to be (the ideal self). ... The greater the difference between the actual self and the ideal self, the lower an individual’s self- esteem. In a marketing context, dissatisfaction with oneself could influence purchases, particularly for products that could enhance self-esteem. HENRY ASSAEL, Consumer Behavior and Marketing Action , 1998. 40. [I]f you do not structure your messages properly, they are not likely to be received as you intended them to be, and the responses may be unsatisfactory. Conversely, properly structured messages “turn on” and influence the thinking process of your target audience, they feed data suitable to the mind-set of your receiver. NORBERT AUBUCHON, The Anatomy of Persuasion , 1997. 41. Thus, as we think about the task of creating messages to mesh with the thinking process of the receiver, we also need to think about what that person is trying to do. Then we need to learn how he or she thinks through the task. What are the priorities, the logic, the flow? Once we know these things, we can decide how to influence that process with a structured message that will mesh and interact effectively. NORBERT AUBUCHON, The Anatomy of Persuasion , 1997. 42. Remember that what pulls the strings is the force hidden within; there lies the power to persuade. MARCUS AURELIUS (121-180 AD), Roman Emperor. 43. The opinion of 10,000 men is of no value if none of them know anything about the subject. MARCUS AURELIUS (121-180 AD), Roman Emperor. 44. Public opinion is no more than this; What people think that other people think. ALFRED AUSTIN (1835-1913), Poet Laureate of England, 1887. ~B~ 45. It is not the lie that passeth through the mind, but the lie that sinketh in, and settleth in it, that does the hurt. FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626), Essays . 46. Words are but the images of matter; and except they have a life of reason and invention, to fall in love with them is all one as to fall in love with a picture. FRANCIS BACON (1561-1626), The Advancement of Learning , 1605. 47. The deeper social loss of giantism in the media is not in its unfair advantage in profits and power. This is real and it is serious. But there gravest loss is in the self-serving censorship of political and social ideas, in news, magazine articles, books, broadcasting and movies. Some intervention is direct and blunt. But most of the screening is subtle, not even occurring at the conscious level, as when subordinates learn by habit to conform to the owners ideas. But subtle or not, the ultimate result is a distorted reality and impoverished ideas. BEN BAGDIKIAN, The Media Monopoly, 1983. 48. You may talk of the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius, but the real tyranny is the tyranny of your next-door- neighbor...Public opinion is a permeating influence and it exacts obedience to itself; it requires us to think other men’s thoughts, to speak other men’s words, to follow other men’s habits. WALTER BAGEHOT (1826-1877), The Character of Sir Robert Peel, 1856. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"49. How do you persuade another person? Our culture distinguishes two ways. The first is the Platonic way, the use of reason... The other form of persuasion (direct use of the passions) seeks to eliminate the mind and critical faculties. It provokes feeling rather than thought. It is employed when the persuader suspects that the logical steps in the argument will not survive critical examination. F. G. BAILEY, The Tactical Uses Of Passions , 1983. 50. Lying to the strong is a generalized version of the Fifth Amendment: truth could be dangerous because it might give the dominant adversary another weapon. ... The power I get from a successful lie is your loss, and you gain is the secret I fail to keep or the deception you uncover. F. G. BAILEY, The Prevalence of Deceit , 1991. 51. Collusive lying occurs when two parties, knowing full well that what they are saying or doing is false, collude in ignoring the falsity. They hold it between them as an open secret. F. G. BAILEY, The Prevalence of Deceit , 1991. 52. Muck is raked to find sinners and sins, not to identify defects in a system. These are like witchcraft accusations in tribal Africa. ... [This] provides a simulacrum of criticism and the illusion of an open society and a governing class responsive to those below it. But in fact the dominant ideology is left intact; and is even fortified by putting the blame on individuals rather than on the social order. F. G. BAILEY, The Prevalence of Deceit , 1991. 53. Advertisers, not governments, are the primary censors of media content in the United States today. C. EDWIN BAKER, Advertising and the Democratic Press , 1994. 54. When I began to think about it, I realized that I had been doing what every writer, unconsciously, is always doing: a writer is never listening to what is being said, he is never listening to what he is being told. He is listening to what is not being said, he is listening to what is not being told, which means that he is trying to discover the purpose of the communication. JAMES A. BALDWIN (1924-1987), The Evidence of Things Not Seen , 1985. 55. Warfare is often defined as the employment of military means to advance political ends. ... Another, more subtle means – political warfare – uses images, ideas, speeches, slogans, propaganda, economic pressures, even advertising techniques to influence the political will of an adversary. JAMES A. BALDWIN (1924-1987), Foreword, On Political War (Paul A. Smith), 1990. 56. The power of authority is never more subtle and effective then when it produces a psychological “atmosphere” or “climate” favorable to the life of certain modes of belief, unfavorable, or even fatal, to the life of others. ARTHUR BALFOUR (1848-1930), The Foundations of Belief , 1895. 57. The propaganda strategist must combine sufficient semantic rigidity and consistency to retain control over his followers, with sufficient flexibility in the choice of terminology and organizational methods to attract new followers. FREDERICK C. BARGHOORN (1911-1991), “Soviet Political Warfare: Strengths and Weaknesses,” in Propaganda And The Cold War (John B. Whitton), 1963. 58. While eschewing pacifism, for example, in doctrinal communications to communists, the Kremlin in its communications to “bourgeois” audiences has often sought to exploit pacifist moods and movements. In establishing links with such moods and movements, they have concealed, played down or even blandly denied the class struggle and violence aspects of their theory. FREDERICK C. BARGHOORN (1911-1991), “Soviet Political Warfare: Strengths and Weaknesses,” in Propaganda And The Cold War (John B. Whitton), 1963. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"59. Television is the first truly democratic culture – the first culture available to everybody and entirely governed by what the people want. The most terrifying thing is what people do want. CLIVE BARNES, New York Times, 30 December 1969. 60. Identification with the listener is everyone’s constant aim in speaking: discarding a certain word for a more precise one, choosing this example instead of that, or altering the sequence of ideas from that originally planned. These are decisions to enhance effectiveness and to increase opportunities of securing favorable responses and unity with listeners. HAROLD BARRETT, Speaking In America , 1993. 61. Our constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press is equipped to deal with direct and crude assaults on freedom of expression, but is incapable of responding to the more subtle challenge of securing admission for ideas to the dominant media. JEROME BARRON, Freedom of the Press For Whom?, 1973. 62. Character assassination is at once easier and surer than physical assault; and it involves far less risk for the assassin. It leaves him free to commit the same deed over and over again, and may, indeed, win him the honors of a hero even in the country of his victim. ALAN BARTH, The Loyalty of Free Men , 1951. 63. Propaganda is an organized and public form of the process which the psychologist calls “suggestion.” F. C. BARTLETT (1887-1969), Political Propaganda , 1940. 64. The fact that political propaganda, is it often been shaped, aims, either wittingly or unwittingly, at producing whole nation groups in which all individuals think, act and feel alike, has profound consequences. For this aim can be realized only in so far as the population concerned can be guarded from other influences. A successful propaganda of this type carries with it a dominant and stringent censorship. F. C. BARTLETT (1887-1969), Political Propaganda , 1940. 65. Complete systems and schemes of psychological explanation are the biggest stumbling block in psychology. F. C. BARTLETT (1887-1969), in A History of Psychology in Autobiography , Vol. 3, 1936. 66. He who presents his argument first may convert the audience and they in turn may exercise their oft- exercised prerogative of not listening to the opposing case. Hence to have the first word rather than the last word could be decisive in the real world, but for a reason which may seem irrelevant to the relative merits of primacy versus recency. RAYMOND A. BAUER, “The Obstinate Audience,” American Psychologist , May 1964. 67. Male subjects low in generalized self-confidence are generally the more persuasible. Females are more persuasible in general but on the whole this is not correlated with self-confidence or self- esteem. RAYMOND A. BAUER, “The Obstinate Audience,” American Psychologist , May 1964. 68. Vilify! Vilify! Some of it will always stick. PIERRE BEAUMARCHAIS (1732-1799). 69. I run the Daily Express purely for propaganda and for no other purpose. LORD BEAVERBROOK (1879-1964), Evidence to the Royal Commission on the Press , 1948. 70. Man is...a creature with a name who lives in a world of symbols and dreams and not merely matter. His sense of self-worth is constituted symbolically, his cherished narcissism feeds on symbols feeds on symbols, on an abstract idea of his own worth, an idea composed of sounds, words, and images, in the air, in the mind, on paper.

A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep. SAUL BELLOW, To Jerusalem and Back , 1976. 74. Stereotypes...are over generalized beliefs based on too limited experience...they are like other first- order primitive beliefs in that they appear to the individual to be self-evident...All of us rely upon stereotypes to some extent for “packaging” our perceptual and conceptual worlds. DARYL J. BEM, Beliefs, Attitudes and Human Affairs , 1970. 75. Propaganda is sometimes referred to as a Soviet ‘secret weapon,’ or as an instrument of ‘thought control’ – which presupposes a substantial degree of official success in shaping public opinion. Yet at other times Soviet communication is assumed to be absurdly crude, inept and dreary; and it is said that no one in Russia believes in Marxism-Leninism any longer. D. W. BENN, “Soviet Propaganda: The Theory and the Practice,” The World Today, 41, 1985. 76. Journalists say a thing that they know isn’t true, in the hope that if they keep on saying it enough it will be true. ARNOLD BENNET (1867-1931), The Title , 1918 . 77. A metaphor is a direct comparison of two things that equates one thing with a special feature of the other. The use of metaphor often makes it possible to substitute politically useful meanings for potentially damaging realities. W. LANCE BENNETT, Public Opinion in American Politics , 1980. 78. If people become slowly conditioned to judge political performances for dramatic qualities rather than other features like truth, principle, or observable consequences, minor annoyances like inconsistency, duplicity, or failure on the part of the political actor may be forgiven in exchange for compelling dramatic performances. W. LANCE BENNETT, Public Opinion in American Politics , 1980. 79. We (journalists) can attribute any social problem to official policies, the machinations of those who benefit from it, or the pathology of those who suffer from it. We can trace it back to class or racial inequalities, to ideologies such as nationalism or patriotism, or to resistance to the regime. ... In choosing any such ultimate cause we are also depicting a setting, an appropriate course of action, and sets of virtuous and evil characters, and in doing so in a way that will appeal to some part of the public that sees its own sentiments or interests reflected in that choice of a social scene. W. LANCE BENNETT & MURRY EDELMAN, “Toward a New Political Narrative,” Journal of Communication, 35 , 1985. 80. Given sufficient control over information and enough public distance from the reality of events, even the most unlikely situations can be endowed with powerful emotional trappings. W. LANCE BENNETT, Public Opinion in American Politics , 1980. 81. The personalized view of politics gives people little, if any, grasp of political processes or power structures. Without a grasp of these things it is virtually impossible to understand how the political system really works. As a result, the political world becomes a mystical real populated by actors who either have the political “force” on their side or do not. The mysterious possession or loss of power further encourages the audience to abandon political analysis in favor of casting their political fates with the hero of the moment. W. LANCE BENNETT, News: The Politics of Illusion , 1983. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"82. In order to understand how symbols are used and what makes them effective or ineffective, it is useful to know something about their psychological effects. Each symbol has at least two effects on us. One effect engages our thinking processes. This cognitive effect is responsible for the basic meaning of a symbolic message. The second effect engages our emotions, or affect , by triggering a feeling about the message. W. LANCE BENNETT, News: The Politics of Illusion , 1983. 83. People tend to see or hear communications that are favorable or congenial to their dispositions; they are more likely to see and hear congenial communications than neutral or hostile ones. And the more interested they are in the subject, the more likely is such selective attention. BERNARD BERELSON (1912-1979) & GARY A. STEINER (1931-1966), Human Behavior: An Inventory of Scientific Findings , 1964. 84. People tend to misperceive and misinterpret persuasive communications in accordance with their own predispositions, by evading the message or by distorting it in a favorable direction. BERNARD BERELSON (1912-1979) & GARY A. STEINER (1931-1966), Human Behavior: An Inventory of Scientific Findings , 1964. 85. Both censorship and propaganda deny the same right: press freedom. Nonetheless, censorship arouses media indignation while propaganda is rarely mentioned. MARIELLA BERGOLI, “The Untold Threat of Propaganda,” Mediachannel.org , 28 November 2001. 86. I am aware the word “propaganda” carries to many minds an unpleasant connotation. Yet, whether, in any instance, propaganda is good or bad depends on the merit of the cause urged, and the correctness of the information published. EDWARD L. BERNAYS (1891-1995), Propaganda , 1928. 87. It was [World War One] which opened the eyes of the intelligent few in all departments of life to the possibilities of regimenting the public mind. EDWARD L. BERNAYS (1891-1995), Propaganda , 1928. 88. [People us] pat words or images which stand for a whole group of ideas and experiences [and are] rarely aware of the real reasons which motivate their actions. EDWARD L. BERNAYS (1891-1995), Propaganda , 1928. 89. [In dealing with] established beliefs [one] must either discredit the old authorities or create new authorities by making articulate a mass opinion against the old belief or in favor of the new. EDWARD L. BERNAYS (1891-1995), Crystalizing Public Opinion , 1923. 90. (Persuasion involves) a conscious attempt by one individual to change the attitudes, beliefs, or the behavior of another person or group of individuals through the transmission of some message. ERWIN BETTINGHAUS, Persuasive Communications , 1994. 91. Careful and correct use of language is a powerful aid to straight thinking, for putting into words precisely what we mean necessitates getting our own minds quite clear on what we mean. WILLIAM I. B. BEVERIDGE (1879-1963), The Art of Scientific Investigation , 1950. 92. In manipulating the public, he [the propagandist] attempts to discover the emotional opinions which they already accept. He then fastens or conditions the emotions he desires to one of these already established beliefs. WILLIAM W. BIDDLE, Manipulating The Public , 1931. 93. It [propaganda] relies upon the drive of certain preponderant emotions to result in the desired behavior. Theoretically, any emotion can be “drained off” into any activity by skillful manipulation.

While seeking to legitimatize their revolution by sanctifying a place, a process, or even a picture, Frenchmen still sought to define their beliefs in words. There was a trend toward radical simplification, however, as they increasingly tended to use labels for arguments. JAMES H. BILLINGTON, Fire in the Minds of Men , 1980. 98. Promotion of any private interest contrary to the general welfare, for whatever reason, is not compatible with honest journalism. So-called news communications from private sources should not be published without public notice of their source of else substantiation of their claims to value as news, both in form and substance. GEORGE L. BIRD & FREDERICK E. MERWIN, The Newspaper and Society , 1942. 99. It is obvious that we need to judge and persuade not on the basis of whimsy, falsehood, or inadequate information and methods, but rather on the basis of purposeful deliberation which employees as much truth as the subject admits and proceeds systematically through methods of investigation, evaluation, and communication suited to the subject, the audience, and the purpose. LLOYD F. BITZER, “Political Rhetoric,” in Handbook of Political Communication (Nimmo & Sanders), 1981. 100. Propaganda is characterized by the following: (1) a heavy or undue use of authority figures as spokesmen, rather than empirical validation, to establish its truths or conclusion; (2) the utilization of unverified and perhaps unverifiable abstract nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, rather than empirical validations, to establish its truths, conclusions, or impressions; (3) a finalistic and fixed view of people, institutions, and situations divided into groups (friends and enemies), situations to be accepted or rejected, (4) a reduction of situations into readily identifiable cause-effect relationships, ignoring multiple causality, (5) a time-perspective characterized by an under or overemphasis on the past...rather than a demonstrated consciousness of time flow. JOHN JAY BLACK, Another Perspective on Mass Media Propaganda , (paper prepared for annual convention of the Association for Education in Journalism), Madison, WI, 21-24 August 1977. 101. [O]ne approach to understanding the nature of the growing disconnection between and among journalists, sources, subjects, and audiences might be to use the analytical tools of propaganda, social psychology, semantics and, fundamentally, the tools of ethics. ... The moral and ethical ramifications of all this are significant. They are found in our manipulation of sources, subjects and audiences; in the fuzziness of our claims about truth and the subtle ways in which we discourage critical thinking; in our simplification of inherently complex stories; in any of a number of ways in which we blur the lines among media’s foundational but discrete roles of informing, entertaining and persuading.

Then I asked: ‘Does a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so?’ He replied: ‘All Poets believe that it does, and in ages of imagination this firm persuasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm persuasion of anything.’ WILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827), The Marriage of Heaven and Hell , 1793. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"103. Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even specially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity but the one that removes the awareness of other possibilities. ALAN BLOOM (1930- 1992), The Closing of the American Mind , 1987. 104. Public ignorance is useful to the expert. The more ignorant the public, the more dependent and powerless the public is at the hands of the expert and thus the more economically vulnerable. The more uninformed the public, the less that public is able to challenge the word of the expert. Hence public ignorance gives the expert leverage to maintain and enhance his earnings, power and status. PAUL BLUMBERG, The Predatory Society: Deception in the American Marketplace , 1989. 105. In a society that prides itself on science, knowledge, precision, rationality, and careful measurement, advertising represents a huge island of the irrational where reason is intentionally obfuscated and decision based on intelligence measurement and comparison are deliberately sabotaged. PAUL BLUMBERG, The Predatory Society: Deception in the American Marketplace , 1989. 106. [M]otion pictures not only bring new objects to the attention of people but, what is probably more important, they make what has been remote and vague, immediate and clear. HERBERT R. BLUMER, “Moulding of Mass Behavior Through the Motion Picture,” American Sociology Society Publication 29 , August 1935. 107. Media power is not supposed to be shared: That’s an infringement of editorial autonomy. It’s not supposed to be controlled: That’s censorship. It’s not even supposed to be influenced: That’s news management! But why should media personnel be exempt from Lord Acton’s dictum that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely? And if they are not exempt, who exactly is best fitted to guard the press guardians, as it were. JAY BLUMLER, “Purposes of Mass Communications Research: A Transatlantic Perspective,” Journalism Quarterly, 55 , 1978. 108. Many men have got a great name from the false opinions of the crowd. And what could be baser than such a thing? For those who are falsely praised, must blush to hear their praises. And if they are justly won by merits, what can they add to the pleasure of a wise man’s conscience? For he measures his happiness not by popular talk, but by the truth of his conscience. BOETHIUS (480-525 AD), The Consolations of Philosophy . 109. Whether the “masses” are denied legitimate access to decision makers by reason of despotism, bureaucratic deviousness, or simple technical obfuscation, the resultant erosion of democratic process can be much the same... ROBERT BOGUSLAW (1919-1993), “Systems of Power,” in Information Technology In A Democracy (Alan Westin), 1971. 110. When the authentic record of events is clear and widely understood, the competing visions must take it into account ... [But] Whenever occasion are so chaotic and indiscriminate that the community has no clear observational impression of the facts, people are given free rein to fantasize within the assumptions of their rhetorical vision. ERNEST G. BORMANN, “Fantasy and Rhetorical Vision: The Rhetorical Criticism of Social Reality,” Quarterly Journal of Speech, 58 , 1972. 111. Once regarded as the herald of enlightenment in all spheres of knowledge, science is now increasingly seen as a strictly instrumental system of control.

DANIEL J. BOORSTIN (1914-2004), Democracy and it’s Discontents , 1974. 113. The deeper problems connected with advertising come less from the unscrupulousness of “our deceivers” than from out pleasure at being deceived, less from the desire to seduce than from the desire to be seduced. DANIEL J. BOORSTIN (1914-2004), The Image: A Guide To Pseudo-Events in America , 1962. 114. The successful advertiser is the master of a new art: the art of making things true by saying they are so.

A deft administrator these days must master “the technique of denying the truth without actually lying.” DANIEL J. BOORSTIN, The Image: A Guide To Pseudo-Events In America , 1962. 118. The people whose decisions determine the policies and actions of nations do not respond to the ‘objective’ facts of the situation, whatever that may mean, but to their ‘image’ of the situation. KENNETH E. BOULDING (1910-1993), “National Images and International Systems,” Journal of Conflict Resolution , 1959. 119. [A symbolic image] is a kind of rough summation or index of a vast complexity of roles and structures. These symbolic images are of great importance in political life. ... Value images do not usually consist of a long and detailed list of alternatives in a carefully compiled rank order. They consist, rather, of a “posture” which in a sense summarizes an extremely complex network of alternatives and situations. KENNETH E. BOULDING (1910-1993), The Image: Knowledge in Life and Society , 1956. 120. A rigorous interpretation of the opinion polls would require an epistemological examination of each of the questions asked, plus concerning the system of the questions, an analysis of the whole system of answers, which together would be the only way to know what were the questions the people really thought they were answering.

Usually, a euphemism is the avoidance of direct communication. WINSTON L. BREMBECK & WILLIAM S. HOWELL, Persuasion: A Means of Social Control , 1952. 125. It has been the practice of many persuaders throughout history to use the existing frustration or a receiver or audience, perhaps magnify it, and then direct the aggressive behavior toward some target person or group, or to rhetorically create frustration based on some situation that has not been perceived by the receiver and then to show how the tension created can be reduced or eliminated by attempting the persuaders recommendation. WINSTON L. BREMBECK & WILLIAM S. HOWELL, Persuasion: A Means of Social Influence , 1976. 126. The preferred and most common method propagandists used to reach their American audience was through the American media. As the principle link between the government and the citizens, the news media often determined the framework for discussion of public interests. The British aimed to use this agenda-setting function to influence public debates. SUSAN A. BREWER, To Win The Peace: British Propaganda in the United States During World War II , 1997. 127. It was the dramatic theme of civilization versus barbarism, rather than their fairly subtle method of cultivating elite opinion, which later won British propagandists their reputation as sensationalist manipulators. SUSAN A. BREWER, To Win The Peace: British Propaganda in the United States During World War II , 1997. 128. When the aim is to rouse from indifference, to inspire, or to simulate lagging enthusiasm and faiths, persuasion is a process of vitalizing old desires, purposes or ideals. When the aim is to secure the acceptance of new beliefs or courses of action, persuasion is a process of substituting new desires, purposes, or ideals for old ones. WILLIAM N.

Propaganda by censorship takes two forms: the selective control of information to favor a particular viewpoint, and the deliberate doctoring of information in order to create an impression different from that originally intended. JAMES A. C. BROWN (1911-1964), Techniques of Persuasion , 1963. 139. The potency of Hitler’s propaganda, however, has been grossly exaggerated. Democracy had failed, and the only real choice open to the Germans was between Communism and the Nazis. JAMES A. C. BROWN (1911-1964), Techniques of Persuasion , 1963. 140. The most difficult thing in the world is to change minds to directions which conflict with the attitudes deeply embedded in the nuclear self. JAMES A. C.

Ideological types, as they were depicted in TV shows, had little resemblance beyond the external trappings to their objective counterparts in the real world. The psychopath looked like a hippie but was not in any philosophical sense a hippie. Yet the message was: beware the hippie, within lives a psychopath. LES BROWN, Television: The Business Behind The Box, 1971. 142. Having no real aim, acquisitiveness, as Aristotle correctly said, has no limit. Hence the psychological premise of a market economy is not, as in classical theory of exchange, that the agents know what they want, but that they do not know what they want. In advanced capitalist countries advertising exists to create irrational demands and keep the consumer confused; without the consumer confusion perpetuated by advertising, the economy would collapse. NORMAN O. BROWN (1913- 2002), Life Against Death , 1985. 143. Political language is often leaded and ambiguous.

Local TV causes the public to look at each unusual occurrence through the wrong end of a telescope.

In the interest of economizing effort we do three things ... we narrow the selectivity of attention more or less to those things that are somehow essential to the enterprises in which we are engaged. ... Secondly, we “recode” into simpler form the diversity of events that we encounter ...

JEAN de LA BRUYERE (1645-1696), Les Caracteres , 1688. 147. Even honest rhetoric is fundamentally concerned with appearances. ... Rhetoric at the command of honest men strives that what is desirable shall appear desirable, that what is vicious shall appear as vicious. It intends that the true or probably true shall seem so, that the false or doubtful shall be vividly realized for what it is. D. C. BRYANT, “Rhetoric: It’s Functions and It’s Scope,” Quarterly Journal of Speech, 39 , 1953. 148. Public opinion is a congeries of all sorts of discrepant notions, beliefs, fancies, prejudices, and aspirations. It is confused, incoherent, amorphous, varying from day to day and week to week. But in the midst of this diversity and confusion every question as it arises into importance is subject to a process of consolidation and clarification until there emerge and take shape certain views or sets of inter-connected views, each held and advocated in common by bodies of citizens. JAMES BRYCE (1838-1922), Modern Democracies , 1921. 149. The best way in which the tendencies at work in any community can be discovered and estimated is by moving freely among all sorts and conditions of men and noting how they are affected by the news or the arguments brought from day to day to their knowledge. JAMES BRYCE (1838-1922), Modern Democracies , 1921. 150. Totalitarian propaganda owes an essential part of its effectiveness to political romanticism - romanticism concerning the Reich, romanticism of elites, romanticism of revolution, romanticism of nihilism....

KENNETH BURKE (1897-1993), A Rhetoric of Motives , 1969. 157. Constant repetition of the item to be inculcated unsupported by any reasons will have an immense effect on the suggestible, herd-minded human. An opinion, an idea, or a code acquired in this manner can be so firmly fixed that one who questions its essential rightness will be regarded as foolish, wicked, or insane. Suggestion, then, is the key to inculcating discipline, esprit, and morale. JOHN H. BURNS, Infantry Journal , December 1928. 158. More than ever, election campaigns are managed and orchestrated. Each party attempts to shape the agenda so that the media reflects its views on favorite issues. Public opinion is monitored though opinion polls. An election campaign is increasingly seen by those in charge as an exercise in marketing and many of the skills of selling goods and services to customers are now applied to the electorate. D.

The people’s right to obtain information does not, of course, depend on any assured ability to understand its significance or use it wisely. Facts belong to the people simply because they relate to interests that are theirs, government that is theirs, and votes that they may desire to cast, for they are entitled to an active role in shaping every fundamental decision of state.

A person is susceptible to suggestion when (1) he has no adequate mental context for the interpretation of a given stimulus or event or (2) when his mental context is so rigidly fixed that a stimulus is automatically judged by means of this context and without any examination of the stimulus itself.

For the “superior morality” of which we hear so much, we too would desire to be thankful: at the same time, if were but blindness to deny that this “superior morality” is properly rather an “inferior criminality,” produced not by greater love of virtue, but by greater perfection of Police; and of that far subtler and stronger police, called Public Opinion.

Semantics teaches us to watch our prejudices, and to take our exercise in other ways than jumping to conclusions. Semantics is the propagandist’s worst friend. STUART CHASE (1888-1985), Guide to Straight Thinking , 1956. 183. Labels for essences and qualities, such as “the sublime,” “individualism,” “truth” [have] no discoverable referents in the outside world, and by mistaking them for substantial entities somewhere at large in the environment, we create a fantastic wonderland. This zone is the especial domain of philosophy, politics, and economics. STUART CHASE (1888-1985), The Tyranny of Words , 1938. 184. Children are prone to uncritical identification. They appreciate resemblances more than differences. They love big things and little tiny things, and are unmindful of the middle ground where most things lie. They see some elements in a situation but leave out many of its characteristics. They frequently generalize from one or two instances. STUART CHASE (1888-1985), The Tyranny of Words , 1938. 185. We seldom come down to earth, but allow our language forms of symbolic machinery to fashion a demonology of absolutes and high-order abstractions, in which we come to believe as firmly as Calvin believes in the Devil.

The newspaper exerts its influence...b y screening and selecting the items to be printed, by the way these items are presented, the emphasis and treatment accorded them, the headlines and pictures used, the typography and format employed, the position in the paper, and the skill employed in the writing and pictorial presentation. HARWOOD L. CHILDS (1898-1972), Public Opinion: Nature, Formation, and Role , 1965. 190. We live in a world of conflicting ideologies and philosophical systems. All of them start with certain assumptions, certain premises incapable of absolute proof. The only certainty is that every listing of human values us back ultimately to a premise, an assumption, a mere opinion. HARWOOD L. CHILDS (1898-1972), An Introduction to Public Opinion , 1940. 191. The strategy of persuasion comprises those techniques which are primarily concerned with stimulating the sense to produced favorable responses. Often such techniques serve as short cuts to results that would not be reached if reflective processes were invoked. The distinguishing feature of the strategy of persuasion, therefore, is the attempt to bring about favorable responses without bringing into play serious mental activity. HARWOOD L. CHILDS (1898-1972), An Introduction to Public Opinion , 1940. 192. The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. This gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate. NOAM CHOMSKY, The Common Good , 1998. 193. To ask serious questions about the nature and behavior of one’s own society is often difficult and unpleasant: difficult because the answers are generally concealed, and unpleasant because the answers are often not only ugly ... but also painful. ... In contrast, the easy way is to succumb to the demands of the powerful, to avoid searching questions, and to accept the doctrine that is hammered home incessantly by the propaganda system. NOAM CHOMSKY, Toward a New Cold War , 1982. 194. Any expert in indoctrination will confirm, no doubt, that it is far more effective to constrain all possible thought within a framework of tacit assumption than to try to impose a particular explicit belief with a bludgeon.

The data provide strong evidence that cultural difference exists in the persuasibility of the Americans and Chinese, the latter being significantly more persuasible.

WINSTON CHURCHILL (1874-1965), The Second World War , 1959. 199. The former peacetime structure of society had been ... superseded and life had been raised to a strange intensity by the war spell.

There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented after one another.

Strategic propaganda carried on for years can be successful in developing, modifying or changing an individual’s fundamental beliefs and self concept.

The only purpose of deception is to make one’s opponent act in a manner calculated to assist one’s own plans and to prejudice the success of his. In other words, to make him do something.

RUTH ANNE CLARK, Persuasive Messages , 1984. 212. As implemented by state communism, national programs of reconstructi0n, like industrialization or the collectivization of agriculture, were intended to have profound effects on people’s habits of thought and behavior, to an extent that would far exceed the mere propaganda of words and images. In practice, communist regimes have represented social change through a screen of censorship and illusion, producing a condition which some have described as dream-like because the official version of reality is so far at odds with everyday life. TOBY CLARK, Art and Propaganda in the Twentieth Century , 1997. 213. Fascist propaganda seldom promised material comforts, claiming instead to replace the materialism of capitalist life with a realm of spontaneous feeling, physical immediacy and the reintegration of individuals with the collective soul of their nation. TOBY CLARK, Art and Propaganda in the Twentieth Century , 1997. 214. The art of power and its minions is the same in all countries and in all ages.

For the Communist, freedom, democracy, equality and, above all, peace can come only when communism is firmly established throughout the world. Whatever forces oppose communism, they are by their very nature reactionary, undemocratic, fascist, anti-popular and repressive. When we study the communist viewpoint, we must consider it in terms of these double values. JOHN C. CLEWS, Communist Propaganda Techniques , 1964. 217. A lie is defined here as a statement intended to deceive others. ... The essence of lying then is not the truth or falsity of the statements, but the conscious intention to mislead. Whether or not someone is lying depends on their intentions and beliefs, what they believe to be true or untrue.

In analyzing all communications, overtly propagandistic or not, we must be cautious about one particular word: is.

Metaphors are persuasive so long as they are suasive.

JAMES E. COMBS & DAN NIMMO, The New Propaganda , 1993. 232. The most obvious contribution of television to American life is the absorption of time that otherwise would be spent differently. By taking time from other activities, it has changed the character and availability of other options as well as coloring the way each day is lived out in the average home. The attention of the mass media for which television is responsible represents one of the defining characteristics of life in the second half of our century. GEORGE COMSTOCK, Television in America , 1980. 233. The modern press itself is a new phenomenon. Its typical unit is the great agency of mass communication.

The creation of an external enemy is one of the most important elements in motivating soldiers to fight and in galvanizing societies to support a war effort. This is as true for counter-terrorism and criminal justice as it for warfare – conventional or unconventional.

[I]n a mass media-dominated political arena, such as the United States, the struggle to define issues and disseminate information and opinions favorable to one’s own goals is often played out in public with the objective of shifting, harnessing, or tapping into existing popular opinions and beliefs. Political power lies with those who strike the resonant chord, turning the discourse toward or away from particular issues. ANN N. CRIGLER, “Making Sense of Politics; Constructing Political Messages and Images,” in The Psychology of Political Communication (Ann N. Crigler, ed), 1998. 253. We could benefit by a journalism course for consumers. If we could teach people how to read a newspaper, how to listen to radio and watch television...w e could create an understanding of media, of the individual strengths and weaknesses of each medium.

The first law in advertising is to avoid the concrete promise...a nd cultivate the delightfully vague. JOHN CROSBY, 1947. 255. Polling is not democracy, and it is not truth. Most important, it often is not even public opinion. Public opinion is a great billowing cloud, impossible to capture with a few quick measurements. The doubt inherent in it distinguishes opinion from belief and conviction. CYNTHIA CROSSEN, Tainted Truth: The Manipulation of Fact in America , 1994. 256. Polling looks scientific because of the way the results are expressed – percentage points, cross- tabulations, margins of error, statistical significance. But much of polling ... is a soft science built on the shifting sands of human language and psychology. In hard science, research should be replicable, with identical results. But because public opinion is constantly changing and polls can never be exactly duplicated, there is no way to judge their accuracy. CYNTHIA CROSSEN, Tainted Truth: The Manipulation of Fact in America , 1994. 257. Language, whether written or vocal, is the chief medium through which propaganda operates. To many people, indeed, “controlling beliefs and attitudes through language” is equated with “propaganda.” RICHARD S. CRUTCHFIELD (1912-1977) & DAVID B. KRECH (1909-1977), Theory and Problems of Social Psychology , 1948. 258. From the eve of the German invasion of Poland to the moment of Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the British government mounted a concerted effort to draw the United States into the war. ... By 1941 they had established a sizable propaganda machine on both sides of the Atlantic. The full scale and impact of this activity has never been revealed. NICHOLAS JOHN CULL, Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign Against American “Neutrality” in World War II , 1995. 259. Propaganda cannot be defined by the nature of the material propagated; the definition must rest on the intent underlying the dissemination or, as is the case of censorship, the suppression of the material in question. NICHOLAS JOHN CULL, Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign Against American “Neutrality” in World War II , 1995. 260. [Propaganda] comprises a whole family of epistemic disservices abetted mostly (but not entirely) by the media: It plays upon perplexity; it cultivates confusion; it poses and information and knowledge; it generates belief systems and tenacious convictions; it prefers credibility and belief states to knowledge; it supplies ersatz assurances and certainties; it skews perceptions; it systematically disregards superior epistemic values such as truth, understanding and knowledge; it discourages 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"reasoning and a healthy respect for rigor, evidence and procedural safeguards; it promotes the easy acceptance of unexamined belief and supine ignorance.

Nazi Germany, at its peak...was a society in which force, ostracism, ridicule, occupational control, belief systems, spheres of intimates, the contract, and deception were applied with great energy. The result was one of the most efficient and effectively organized large-scale social systems in history. RAY P. CUZZORT (1926-1999), Using Social Thought , 1989. 262. Whatever it is that makes ridicule work among human beings, a small amount of it seems to go a long, long way. Ridicule is powerful as a control agent. RAY P. CUZZORT (1926-1999), Using Social Thought , 1989. ~D~ 263. It is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of reason, CHARLES DARWIN (1809-1882), The Descent of Man , 1871. 264. Objectivity is all right if it is really objective, if it conveys as accurate an impression of the truth as can be obtained. But to let demonstrably false statements stand with no warning of their falsity is not what I would call objectivity. ELMER DAVIS (1890-1958), Speech , University of Minnesota, 1951. 265. The communicator’s audience is not a passive recipient – it cannot be regarded as a lump of clay to be molded by the master propagandist. Rather ... they must get something from the manipulator if he is to get something from them. A bargain is involved. W. PHILLIPS DAVISON, “On The Effects of Communication,” Public Opinion Quarterly, 23 , 1959. 266. Decision is meaningful only if there are alternatives from which to choose; it is intelligent only if the alternatives are understood. Thus, the prime requisite which must be met if debate is to provide sound decisions is that it be through and complete, that all arguments and information relevant to decision be known and understood. ... [Which is only possible if there is] full confrontation of opposing opinions, arguments, and information relevant to decision. DENNIS G. DAY, “The Ethics of Democratic Debate,” Central States Speech Journal 17 , February 1966. 267. The act of suppression is no less harmful to the decision-making process because it is covert instead of over. The social effects are the same: decision based on incomplete debate. The covert suppression of argument and information is as ethically culpable as is over suppression. And personal conviction I no justification for either. Covert suppression is the greater threat to democratic processes because it is clandestine and is more difficult to overcome because of the ego- involvement that usually accompanies personal conviction. DENNIS G. DAY, “The Ethics of Democratic Debate,” Central States Speech Journal 17, February 1966. 268. Television’s power lies not only in the way it structures the flow of daily life, but in its consequent ability to interrupt this flow. Media events are an example of this interruptive dimension.

Once disinformation becomes a habit in any sphere, once people become careless about the exact truth, then we are all at risk. It is not the deliberate lie which we have to fear (something that in a democracy can usually be spotted as blatant propaganda), but the half-truth, the embellished truth and the truth dressed up to appear as something quite different.

All that once was directly lived has become mere representation . ... Understood on its own terms, the spectacle proclaims the predominance of appearances and asserts that all human life, which is to say all social life, is mere appearance. GUY DEBORD, The Society of the Spectacle , 1995. 272. Goody-goody words are like the currants in a currant cake. There is no doubt about the goodness of such words. Their value is inbuilt and accepted by everyone. The words have long been established as convenient ways to saying: good, right, proper, ought to be done. The response to such words is emotional because they were set up in the first place as emotional capsules. ... Such goody-goody words include: dignity, honesty, courage, justice, tradition, firmness, decisive, flexible, responsible . EDWARD DeBONO, Practical Thinking , 1971. 273. The first nucleus of fighters will be divided into small propaganda patrols which will cover the mountain areas, going into villages, holding meetings, speaking here and there, in order to explain the social goals of the Revolution, to denounce the enemies of the peasantry, to promise agrarian reform and punishment for traitors. REGIS DEBRAY, Revolution in the Revolution , 1968. 274. Television, as a medium, especially tends to reduce abstract or ideological principles to human, personal components. Political issues and actions are linked to individuals. We have choices not among policies but between actors. Victims, villains, and heroes are easier to identify than issues, causes or ideas. ROBERT E. DENTON, JR., “Primetime Politics,” in Ethical Dimensions of Political Communication , 1991. 275. In addition to telling us what to think about, the media also tell us how to think. With the reporting of facts comes a subsequent judgment. There is always a conclusion, point, or reason for a presentation, but there is little or no time for synthesis or analysis. Awareness is valued more than understanding. ROBERT E. DENTON, JR., “Primetime Politics,” in Ethical Dimensions of Political Communication , 1991. 276. On television, the news tends to be more political, personal and critical than in other media. Television demands drama and a visual slice of life rather than comprehensive coverage of life, people, and events.... . In truth, television is simply unreliable in providing sufficient and accurate political information for citizens to make electoral or policy decisions. ROBERT E.

The instruments of authority are education and propaganda, force and violence, and economic measures and economic manipulation, depending upon whether or not acts are considered legitimate. Political leadership (whatever may be true of other kinds of leadership) in part depends upon skill in working with these instruments of authority.

One of the main jobs of the advertiser in this conflict between pleasure and guilt is not so much to sell the product as to give moral permission to have fun without guilt. ERNEST DICHTER (1907-1992), President, Institute for Motivational Research, Inc., quoted in The Hidden Persuaders (Vance Packard), 1957. 289. To most people ... the world as it surrounds them and confronts them is somewhat confusing and disturbing. There are no simple and clear-cut political and economic developments; there are no naïve dichotomies of good and bad people. Every single problem, when answered more thoroughly and truthfully, is loaded with “ifs.” The very first people to use mass media – the storytellers – realized that they had to structure and simplify meanings of events in order to perform their functions. They introduced fairies and devised heroes and villains for the sake of young and older children; and the modern mass media – radio, film, television, newspapers, and magazines – found it wise to follow suite. ERNEST DICHTER (1907-1992), The Strategy of Desire , 1960. 290. The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words. PHILIP K. DICK (1928-1982), I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon , 1985. 291. Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by that that he feels, but that he excels in simulating, though he feels nothing. DENNIS DIDEROT, Paradox of Acting . 292. The student of symbolism knows that this is often true, but does not avoid the less reassuring aspect of the political process: that government can often shape people’s wants before it reflects them. To the extent that governmental actions create popular beliefs and wants, the political process is not democratic but potentially antidemocratic, for political processes are not always based on the people’s will even when they seem to be. It is tempting to take the appearance for the reality. KENNETH M. DOLBEARE & MURRAY J. EDELMAN, American Politics: Policies, Power & Change , 1977. 293. The metaphors we use, usually unconsciously, to describe political events and issues also subtly shape our political thought. ... Political metaphors help shape both what we see as fact and how we evaluate political developments. ... The metaphoric mode in which people perceive complex political issues and events is an obstacle to complete understanding and to changes in perception and belief as new information becomes available. KENNETH M. DOLBEARE & MURRAY J. EDELMAN, American Politics: Policies, Power & Change , 1977. 294. [Propaganda is]...a systematic attempt by an interested individual (or individuals) to control the attitudes of groups of individuals through the use of suggestion and to control their actions. LEONARD W. DOOB (1909-2000), Public Opinion and Propaganda , 1966. 295. “ it is later than you think” -- almost every propagandist tries to employ this slogan in a direct or indirect form during his propaganda campaign. The impression he wishes to create is that time is running out; he who hesitates is lost; the moment for action is now. LEONARD W. DOOB (1909-2000), Public Opinion and Propaganda , 1966. 296. Among intentional propagandists the Idea is worshipped above all else... For international propagandists are convinced that is Ideas which make the world go round and which therefore are peculiarly a symptom of their own genius. LEONARD W.

Even when predictions have no advice or warning built into them, they still act powerfully on their audiences because they naturally function in the same way that promises do in the sense that they create expectations. MAX DUBLIN, Futurehype: The Tyranny of Prophecy , 1989. 300. It is in the nature of caricature to oversimplify and to represent an exaggerated aspect of reality as the whole thing. MAX DUBLIN, Futurehype: The Tyranny of Prophecy , 1989. 301. False predictions are destructive in the same way that lies are because, when uttered with conviction, they disarm and inspire us and put us into false positions. Furthermore, these false positions, like all false positions, encourage us to act in ways we never would if we really understood where we stood and what we were doing, in ways that are typically self-defeating. MAX DUBLIN, Futurehype: The Tyranny of Prophecy , 1989. 302. Man creates the significant symbols he uses in communication. Symbols are not “given” by God, “evoked” by natural needs, “forged” in the class struggle, or “perfected” in the “pure realms” of art. They are used to related, and when we have new needs in relationships, we need new symbols. But needs, or at least social needs, are invented or created.... Wants are never given; they are created. HUGH DUNCAN, “The Search For A Social Theory of Communications,” Human Communication Theory: Original Essays [Frank Dance, ed], 1967. 303. It is the ambiguity of symbols which makes them so useful in human society. Ambiguity is a kind of bridge that allows us to run back and forth from one kind of meaning to another, until we take firm resolve to cross the bridge into new, and fixed meanings. HUGH DUNCAN, Symbols in Society , 1968. 304. Symbols, then, create and sustain beliefs in ways of acting because their function as names which signify proper, dubious, or improper ways of expressing relationships. HUGH DUNCAN, Symbols in Society , 1968. 305. What was once thought can never be unthought. FRIEDRICH DURRENMATT, The Physicist , 1962. 306. Methods of communication and propaganda give modern dictators a hold over nations which bears no comparison with ancient tyrants... Today authority has powerful arms at its disposal which makes any resistance on the part of citizens more difficult. MAURICE DUVERGER, The Ideas of Politics , 1964. 307. Masters of political communication have always understood this, and in addition to being able to fire the hearts of men with words they have been capable of performing the deeds that gave those words force. It can never be forgotten that what the propagandist is after is action. MURRAY DYER, The Weapon On The Wall: Rethinking Psychological Warfare , 1959. 308. [T]he premises on which black operations are undertaken must accept as their first and basic rule of operation the position that any decision to undertake a particular piece of work, in secret, must be subjected to the test of whether, if it becomes known, the damage it will do to our acknowledged aims, openly stated, will do more harm than is acceptable if we are still to maintain that we are an 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"honorable and ethical people. MURRAY DYER, The Weapon on the Wall: Rethinking Psychological Warfare , 1959. ~E~ 309. According to the heuristic conceptualization, people sometimes exert little cognitive effort in judging message validity. Instead, recipients may base their agreement with a message on a rather superficial assessment of a variety of persuasion cues, such as surface or structural characteristics of persuasive messages (e.g. their length or number of arguments), communicator characteristics (e.g. likability or expertise), and audience characteristics (e.g., positive or negative audience reactions to the message.) ALICE EAGLY & SHELLY CHAIKEN, “Cognitive Theories of Persuasion,” in Advances in Social Psychology (Leonard Berkowitz), 1984. 310. Other ways to lie include: misdirecting, acknowledging an emotion but misidentifying what causes it; telling the truth falsely, or admitting the truth but with such exaggeration or humor that the target remains uninformed or misled, half-concealment, or admitting only part of what is true, so as to deflect the target’s interest in what remains concealed; and the incorrect inference dodge, or telling the truth but in a way that implies the opposite of what is said. PAUL ECKMAN, Telling Lies , 1985. 311. There are two kinds of clues to deceit: leakage, when the liar inadvertently reveals the truth; and deception clues, when the liar’s behavior reveals only that what he says is untrue. PAUL ECKMAN, Telling Lies , 1985. 312. There are two major forms of lying: concealment, leaving out true information; and falsification, or presenting false information as if it were true. PAUL ECKMAN, Telling Lies , 1985. 313. When there is a choice about how to lie, liars usually prefer concealing to falsifying. There are many advantages. For one thing, concealing usually is easier than falsifying. Nothing has to be made up. There is no chance of getting caught without having the whole story worked out in advance. PAUL ECKMAN, Telling Lies , 1985. 314. Semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign. A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else. This something does not necessarily have to exist or to actually be somewhere at the moment in which a sign stands for it. Thus semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everything that can be used in order to lie. UMBERTO ECO, A Theory of Semiotics , 1976. 315. The critical element in political maneuver for advantage is the creation of meaning: the construction of beliefs about the significance of events, of problems, of crisis, of policy changes, and of leaders. The strategic need is to immobilize opposition and mobilize support. While coercion and intimidation help to check resistance in all political systems, the key tactic must always be the evocation of meanings that legitimize favored courses of action.... MURRAY EDELMAN, “Political Language and Political Reality,” PS , Winter 1985. 316. The enemy themes that most surely and consistently evoke mass arousal and anger are those that make it hardest to take the enemy as a significant other: those that emphasize the respects in which he does not share our human traits and potentialities for empathy, for compassion, and for social attachments. The alien, the stranger, or the subhuman are the themes struck repeatedly. MURRAY EDELMAN, Politics As Symbolic Action , 1971. 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"317. Only rarely do the media, officials, or interest groups point to historical change in institutions or in material conditions as the explanation of controversial elements. ... They thrive upon heroes, villains, contests for votes, legislative and judicial victories and defeats, and especially upon the evocation of leaders with whom people can identify or whom they can blame for their discontents. MURRAY EDELMAN, “Constructing the Political Spectacle,” in Public Policy: The Essential Readings (Theodoulou & Cahn), 1988. 318. The speaker who advocates “true” freedom is invariably arguing for restraints on some group’s freedom, just as the insertion of the word “true” before “equality” is a sign that some inequality is being rationalized. MURRAY EDELMAN, “Political Language and Political Reality,” PS , Winter 1985. 319. One-sidedness was considered to be propagandistic; a two-sided message was not. Skilled propagandists know, however, that two-sided messages often are persuasive as propaganda and appeal to members of a popular culture. ALEX EDELSTEIN, Total Propaganda , 1997. 320. Mass propaganda emphasized emotional appeals rather than rational assertions; in a popular culture more knowledge-based propaganda is projected. ALEX EDELSTEIN, Total Propaganda , 1997. 321. The media ... protect business interests for their own economic well being. The suppression of anti- business news is common. The media also “front” for government by assuming its actions to be more legitimate than those who oppose it, and by generally ignoring its victims. HOWARD J. EHRLICH, The Politics of Media Control , 1974. 322. People are not free if the critical events of their society are systematically unreported or distorted. HOWARD J. EHRLICH, The Politics of Media Control , 1974. 323. A man’s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. ALBERT EINSTEIN (1875-1955). 324. The mere fact of naming an object tends to give definiteness to our conception of it – we have then a sign that at once calls up in our minds the distinctive qualities which mark out for us that particular object from all others. GEORGE ELIOT (1918-1880), The George Eliot Letters (Gordon Haight, ed), 1954. 325. For action makes propaganda’s effect irreversible. He who acts in obedience to propaganda can never go back. He is now obliged to believe in that propaganda because of his past action...He is what one calls committed. JACQUES ELLUL, Propaganda: The Formation Of Men’s Attitudes , 1965. 326. To be effective, propaganda must constantly short-circuit all thought and decision. It must operate on the individual at the level of the unconscious. He must not know that he is being by outside forces. JACQUES ELLUL, Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes , 1965. 327. The public will accept news if it is arranged in a comprehensive system, and if it does not speak only to the intelligence but to the “heart.” This means, precisely, that the public wants propaganda, and if the State does not wish to leave it to a party, which will provide explanations for everything (i.e., the truth), it must itself make propaganda. JACQUES ELLUS, Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes , 1965. 328. To study the propaganda, information or ‘cultural’ policies of nation-states is one way, perhaps the most concrete, of discovering how they see their role in the international arena, how they perceive their own influence, how they measure their own prestige.

The relative attractiveness of two options can change when they are described differently, even if logically the two descriptions are equivalent.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882), Nature , 1836. 332. The media do not control what people prefer; they influence public opinion by providing much of the information people think about and by shaping how they think about it. ROBERT M.

The findings suggest that media messages can indeed move audiences in directions counter to their predominant dispositions...opinion toward the unfamiliar are more susceptible to media influence that those toward the unfamiliar. ROBERT M. ENTMAN, Democracy Without Citizens , 1989. 334. Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some aspects of perceived reality and make them more salient in the communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation and/or treatment recommendation for the item describes. Frames then, define problems ... diagnose causes ... make moral judgments ... offer and justify treatments for the problem and predict their likely effects. ROBERT M. ENTMAN, “Framing: Toward a Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm,” Journal of Communication 43, 1993. 335. The ceremonial permits a group to behave in a symbolically ornamental way so that it seems to present an ordered university; each particle achieves an identity by its mere interdependence with all others. ERIK ERIKSON (1902-1994), Young Man Luther , 1962. 336. The [idealized notion] of a public opinion originated with the informed public and moving “upward” to affect social institutions. With the modern media, influence moves directly “downward” from the mass media – and the institutions they reflect – to public opinion as a mass audience. ROBERT S. ERIKSON & KENT L. TEDIN, American Public Opinion: It’s Origins, Content and Impact , 1995. 337. Propaganda is persuading people to make up their minds while withholding some of the facts from them. HAROLD EVANS. ~F~ 338. For TV purposes, the ideal world is one in which whatever is on the screen at this moment is entirely engrossing.

Very few events come entirely out of the blue, even if headlines about them do. ... Before World War II Josef Stalin rounded up most of the men in the Caucasus mountain region now called Chechnya and shipped them off to Siberia, fearful that they would collaborate with the Nazis. Those who eventually made it back found the most of their land had been appropriated. To grasp what happened in 1995, it was necessary to know what had happened in 1945. JAMES FALLOWS, Breaking The News: How The Media Undermine American Democracy , 1996. 340. Tremendous potential power comes with being a reporter. You have the negative power to say things about other people, in public, to which they can never really respond in kind. You have the positive power to expand other people’s understanding of reality by bringing new parts of the world to their notice. Taking this power seriously means taking your calling seriously, which in turn means recognizing the impact of the tool or weapon in your hands. JAMES FALLOWS, Breaking The News: How The Media Undermine American Democracy , 1996. 341. Journalists have published thousands of hoaxes. ... The media’s hoaxes are usually to entertain – not cheat – the public. Thus, hoaxes are a form of practical joking, but on a grand scale. ... Each time journalists created a hoax, something peculiar happened. Other Americans swore that the stories they created were true. Strangers claimed that they witnessed every event the journalists described, or that they possessed other evidence proving that every detail was true. FRED FEDLER, Media Hoaxes , 1989. 342. Employing the term “conspiracy theory” serves as a strategy of delegitimation in political discourse.

Some degree of acquiescence on the part of the oppressed is necessary, whether this is conditioned by propaganda, surveillance or simply despair. VICTOR FERKISS, Technological Man: The Myth and the Reality , 1969. 344. Government have ever been careful to hold a high hand over the education of the people. They know, better than anyone else, that their power is based almost entirely on the school. Hence, they monopolize it more and more. FRANCISCO FERRER (1859-1909), The Modern School . 345. Were a portrait of man to be drawn, one in which there would be highlighted whatever is most human, be it noble or ignoble, we would surely place well in the foreground man’s enormous capacity for self- delusion. HERBERT FINGARETTE, Self-Deception , 1969. 346. The move into self-deception is, as we know intuitively, a morally ambiguous move. So long as we take ignorance and knowledge to be central to self-deception, we can do nothing to resolve this ambiguity or to deepen our insight into it; we re left with the paradoxical truth that the self-deceiver “in his heart” knows what he sincerely denies. HERBERT FINGARETTE, Self-Deception, 1969. 347. The self-deceiver is “unable” to admit the truth to himself (even though he knows in his heart it’s so). There is a kind of genuineness to his “ignoring”; it is not simple hypocrisy, or lying, or duping of others. Yet we also feel that in some sense, he could admit the truth if only he would .

When television news is a major component of an individual’s symbolic reality, we contend that it is also a dominant factor in his or her construction of subjective reality. Not only will individual priorities reflect those of the broadcasts (the first level of agenda setting), but to some extent understanding and attitudes will be shaped by the salience of attributes in the television coverage (the second level of agenda setting).

Again and again it must turn out its product with the same density, texture, and flavor. MARSHALL W. FISHWICK, “The Ethics of Popular Culture,” in Ethical Dimensions of Political Communication (Robert E. Denton, ed), 1991. 354. An opinion may serve purposes for an individual that [are dependent] on the special psychological significance the opinion may have for that individual. The danger or disadvantage of psychological attachments of this kind is that the opinions so based are not responsible to ordinary influence because of their psychological importance to the individual. WILLIAM H. FLANIGAN & NANCY H. ZINGALE, Political Behavior of the American Electorate , 1975. 355. Opinions serve a social function if they aid the individuals in adjusting to others or in becoming part of a group. In some cases individuals may use opinions to set themselves apart from others....Nevertheless, for highly salient issues an individual is apt to find that holding a socially unacceptable view is both uncomfortable and costly. WILLIAM H. FLANIGAN & NANCY H. ZINGALE, Political Behavior of the American Electorate , 1975. 356.

There is some reason to believe that people may even be immunized against persuasive appeals by being “inoculated” with a mild dose of the “enemy idea.” ... The alien ideas, like the germs [in an inoculation], stimulate the organism into developing its defenses. ... He needs to practice “answering” opposing arguments; with enough of an attack on his beliefs to motivate – but not overwhelm – him, he would have no reason to build his defenses. ANNE E.

We should bear in mind a basic premise: There is no reason why the reader should accept the writer as an authority on any subject at any time, regardless of whether he is a specialist or whether his byline is well known. The only effective reporting and writing is that which convinces the reader by the recitation and logical presentation of facts. This requires that the reporter know the subject thoroughly and be able to explain it clearly. WES GALLAGHER, Associated Press, in The Fourth Estate (Hulteng & Nelson), 1971. 374. The advantage of media frames for journalists is that they serve as guidelines in helping select what information to spotlight and what to ignore. Facts take on their meaning from being framed in some fashion. Many facts are spotlighted by certain frames and ignored or discounted by others. WILLIAM A. GAMSON, Talking Politics , 1992. 375.

GEORGE GERBNER, “Mass Media and Human Communication Theory,” Human Communication Theory [Frank Dance, ed], 1967. 384. How options are framed affects decision making. Studies have shown that the wording of examples leads people to choose differently.

Using polling, media, and public relations techniques, modern sates have learned a good deal about the manipulation and management of mass opinion.

Much of what journalists do that is ethically suspect is not illegal – it does not violate a specific statute. For example, there is no statute against lying. There is no statute against entrapment by a journalist. There is no statute against the ambush interview. TOM GOLDSTEIN, The News At Any Cost , 1985. 406. The frame around a picture is a visual directive focusing our gaze toward what it surrounds and away from everything else. It defines what is in the picture and what is out. The framer’s art is to build margins that blend with a picture so we notice what is framed rather than the frame itself. DANIEL GOLEMAN, Vital Lies, Simple Truths: The Psychology of Self-Deception , 1985. 407. The defenses – our bastions against painful information – operate in a shadow world of consciousness, beyond the fringes of awareness. Most often we are oblivious to their operation and remain the unknowing recipient of the version of reality they admit into our ken.

Politicians rise to power because they can talk persuasively to voters and political elites. Once in power, their daily activities are largely verbal – commands, dialogues, debates, formulation of proposals, laws, orders, decisions, and legal opinions. DORIS A. GRABER, Political Language, in Handbook of Political Communication (Nimmo & Sanders, eds), 1981. 411. Political stories in the mass media are significant in furnishing raw material for the formation of political images. Most people do not invent political images out of thin air. Rather, they combine current political data supplied by the mass media with existing knowledge and attitudes and then weave these strands into a plausible and pleasing gestalt. DORIS A. GRABER, “Personal Qualities in Presidential Images: The Contribution of the Press,” Midwest Journal of Political Science , 16. 412. The media often serve and attitude and behavior models. In the process of image creation, the media indicate which views and behaviors are acceptable and even praiseworthy in a given society and which are unacceptable or outside the mainstream. ... Media stories also indicate what is deemed important or unimportant by America’s dominant groups, which conforms to prevailing standards of justice and morality, and how various events are related to each other.

By painting the enemy in dark hued imagery of vice, corruption, evil, and weakness, one may more easily convince himself of his own superior virtue and thereby gain a symbolic victory of ego- enhancement. RICHARD B. GREGG, “The Ego-Function of the Rhetoric of Protest,” Philosophy and Rhetoric, 4 , 1971. 415. Political elites throughout recorded history have tried to control political communication. They have attempted to foster the construction of favorable images in the minds of potential supporters through the symbolism of majestic architectural creations and elaborate public ceremonies. They have sought to mold human minds through propaganda and terror in internal struggles and external wars. They have used public relations tactics and political advertising as gentler forms of political persuasion. They have attempted to shape the flow of political communication through official secrecy and through controls over mass media. DORIS A. GRABER, “Whither Research on the Psychology of Political Communication?” in The Psychology of Political Communication (Ann N. Crigler, ed), 1998. 416. The central task of Communist propaganda is to instill in the toilers the Marxist-Leninist worldview, loft ideological and political qualities, and the norms of communist morality and to encourage conscious, creative participation by all in the process of the socialist and communist transformation of society. GREAT SOVIET ENCYCLOPEDIA , Vol. 24, “Propaganda,” 1973-1983. 417. Political labels are image-laden, appealing as much to the emotions as to the intellect. Although they provide basic categories of rational analysis, they may simultaneously evoke responses that are neither analytical nor rational. This broader evocative power, the power to reach both mind and heart, gives the labels a political importance they would not have were their meanings precise and limited. DAVID GREEN, The Language of Politics in America , 1987. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"418. To rely on denigrative labels is to define one’s position negatively (in terms of what one is against}, concede the intellectual initiative to one’s opponents, and admit one has no positive program.

The progressive label is a metaphor built on the discordant yet harmonizable elements of “movement” and “stability.,” As a political self-designation, the metaphor implies “forward movement” or progress without loss of “stability.” DAVID GREEN, The Language of Politics in America , 1987. 420. Television has left its mark on a generation raised in front of this seductive monster, this shifting parade of images and emotions, all separated by a demanding succession of commercial impulses that trivializes what precedes and what follows it. THOMAS GRIFFITH, How True: A Skeptic’s Guide To Believing The News , 1974. 421. I trust polls least when they profess to record public reaction to such amorphous subjects as abortions, welfare or pollution. So much turns on the phrasing of questions, which then give a false authority to the numerically specific. THOMAS GRIFFITH, How True: A Skeptic’s Guide To Believing The News , 1974. 422. Advocacy journalists, the other branch of the new journalism, are not fictionalists but polemicists. ... Yet finally, advocacy is destructive of what journalism is all about, to the degree that it feels no need to scruple about accuracy, get the whole story or to give the other side its due. THOMAS GRIFFITH, How True: A Skeptic’s Guide To Believing The News , 1974. 423. Communist propagandists rely on three tested principles of their profession: (1) The language must be so simple that everyone can understand it. (2) The emphasis must be made in emotional rather than intellectual terms, stressing hate, love, sympathy, etc. (3) The message must not only be stated simply and emotionally, but it also must be reiterated so extensively that the listener will repeat it in his sleep. PETER GROTHE, To Win The Minds of Men , 1958. 424. The distinction between “honesty” and “rhetoric” is traditional and customary. Rhetoric is supposed to be indirect and artful; honesty, direct and artless. But this distinction tends to wear thin we remember that all discourse, spoken or written, has distinct and palpable form. What we see and think and feel must be translated into words and this translation is a creative process. Thus, even honesty uses a kind of art, and the person speaking honestly must be as alert and convincing as the sales pitcher or the liar. ROBERT GRUDIN, On Dialogue: An Essay In Free Thought , 1996. ~H~ 425. By the public sphere we mean first of all a real of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed. ... Citizens behave as a public body when they confer in an unrestricted fashion – that is, within the guarantee of freedom of assembly and the association and the freedom to express and publish their opinions JURGEN HABERMAS, quoted in Jurgen Habermas (M. Pusey), 1978. 426. The hidden persuader, whether he aware of it or not, is engaging in a non-democratic practice. He takes advantage of the fact that although men may have the latest capacity for making rational, conscious choices, they are also part animal and as such can be exploited.

The ethics of salesmanship have infected every area of life. Politics has become a branch of public relations. Persuasion has been substitut4ed for debate and the search for the right image has replaced the search for the right policy. STUART HALL & PADDY WHANNEL, The Popular Arts, 1964. 429. As a foundation, it is important to recognize that public relations work fundamentally involves the construction of social reality. ... Constructionists contend that representations of objects or problems in people’s minds vary from the corresponding actual objects on which they are based. More important, constructionists contend that people act based on these perceptions, or what [Walter] Lippmann (1922) deftly described as “the pictures inside our heads,” rather than “objective reality.” KIRK HALLAHAN, “Seven Models of Framing: Implications for Public Relations,” The Journal of Public Relations Research 11 , 1999. 430. Framing operates by biasing the cognitive processing of information by individuals. ...

KIRK HALLAHAN, “Seven Models of Framing: Implications for Public Relations,” The Journal of Public Relations Research 11 , 1999. 431. The sector of public opinion generally most vulnerable to ideological propaganda is constituted by that peculiar class concentrated in the great cities, called the intellectuals. Their principle characteristic is a preoccupation with ideological formulations, a preoccupation that tends to blind them to what actually is as opposed to what is said.

[I]f a person is primed by exposure to a prior story about the economy, associations from that initial concept will travel in one’s memory to activate related information on that topic to a higher level than other information, thereby setting the agenda that that is important when it comes to processing later information such as political ad. ...

An important general cognitive principle is that information processing is constructive; that is, people do not literally store and retrieve information they read or hear in the media (or anywhere else). Rather, he can modify it in accordance with their beliefs and the context in which it is received. RICHARD JACKSON HARRIS, A Cognitive Psychology of Mass Communication , 1994. 442.

ARNOLD HAUSER (1892-1978), The Social History of Art , 1951. 451. Manipulative photography is a state of political advertising and journalism. Pictures of a candidate’s political opponents in TV ads are almost always in unflattering black and white, sometimes projected in slow motion to give the opponent a menacing, dinosaurlike quality. Newspeople have a tendency to seize on photos that “illustrate” their point, but often distort reality. CARL HAUSMAN, Lies We Live By , 2000. 452. [A] strategy used ... to get around telling the truth [is] redefining one of the words that determines the truth. Torturing a definition is a powerful strategy because people usually don’t check all the premises on which you’ve based your argument, and if they do – and you’re caught – you can always claim honesty because the results actually do follow from your mutated definition. CARL HAUSMAN, Lies We Live By , 2000. 453. And it is only tradition and old custom, founded on an obsolete state of things, that assigns any value to parliamentary oratory. The world has done with it, except as an intellectual pastime.

NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE (1804-1864), “Notes on Travel (1858),” in The Complete Writings of Nathaniel Hawthorne , 1888. 454. [Every person] is affected every hour of his life not only by the words he hears and uses, but also by his unconscious assumptions about language. These unconscious assumptions determine the way he takes words – which in turn determines the way he acts, whether wisely or foolishly.

HAYAKAWA (1906-1992), Language in Action , 1941. 455. Calumny requires no proof. The throwing of malicious imputations against any character leaves a stain which no after-refutation can wipe out.

GEORGE HEGEL (1770-1831), The Philosophy of Right , 1821. 459. In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain and maintain power through the use of words. From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe. FRANK HERBERT (1920-1986), Dune , 1965. 460. We are less convinced by what we hear than by what we see. HERODOTUS (ca 484-425 B.C.), Histories , ca. 430 B.C. 461.

The way that we process information, even unambiguous information, is heavily influenced by information that we have previously encountered. ... Variously known as “category accessibility,” “implicit memory,” and “priming,” the impact of prior experience on ongoing perception and cognition is pervasive. JAMES L.

When a nation goes to war, it fights not only on the side of God but also on the side of ballyhoo and bullshit, together with the darker divinities of bowdlerization and blue pencil. The public must be informed and persuaded to do what is expected of it. JOHN HILVERT, Blue Pencil Warriors: Censorship and Propaganda During World War II , 1984. 464. Where...d oes propaganda start or stop in a dramatic work? ... The American stage was consciously political and social virtually from the beginnings of the Republic, when the Tories and the Revolutionists exchanged insults in their amateur stage productions. Then ensured the considerable vogue of comedies like The Contrast and Fashion , favorable to our frontier virtues and democratic ideals. In the middle of the nineteenth century, abolitionism found popular expression in an immensely successful stage version of Uncle Tom’s Cabin ... MORGAN Y. HIMMELSTEIN, Drama Was A Weapon: The Left-Wing Theater in New York, 1929-1941 , 1963. 465. The legitimate stage was thus changing, and the Communists sought to change it even further into a new theatre to propagandize their planned revolt. ... But they were not alone in seeking to create a new theatre movement for the thirties. They were aided by the intellectual Marxists, the fellow travelers who followed the Party line but did not want to do the dirty work of the revolution. MORGAN Y. HIMMELSTEIN, Drama Was a Weapon: The Left-Wing Theater in New York, 1929-1941 , 1963. 466. The broad messes of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force. ADOLPH HITLER (1889-1945), Mein Kampf , 1933. 467. The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted and their understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they quickly forget.

The state therefore must proceed with ruthless determination and take control of this instrument of popular education [the press] and put it in the service of the state and nation. ADOLPH HITLER (1889- 1945), Mein Kampf , 1933. 469. The function of propaganda is, for example, not to weigh and ponder the rights of different people, but exclusively to emphasize the one right which it has set out to argue for. Its task is not to make an objective study of the truth, in so far as it favors the enemy, and then set it before the masses with academic fairness; its task is to serve our own right, always and unflinchingly. ... As soon as our own propaganda admits so much as a glimmer of right on the other side, the foundation of doubt in our own right has been laid. ADOLPH HITLER (1889-1945), Mein Kampf , 1933. 470. In particular the use of reductive labels pre-empts even an acknowledgement of an element of causation in what is, of course, a far more complex reality. It is as if the political and social structures in which acts of political violence are clearly embedded are theoretically and politically irrelevant to their understanding. From this intellectual closure too easily stems the crude denunciation of those who seek to understand causative factors in these attacks, as also condoning them.

Words are wise men’s counters, -- they do but reckon by them; but they are the money of fools. THOMAS HOBBES (1588-1679), Leviathan, 1651 . 472. Perhaps it is time for academics, journalists, and policy-makers to stop trying to place all issues and all people along a single liberal-conservative dimension if most people do not use such a dimension. Why should we not stop expecting citizens to conform to elite standards of ideological consistency, and start expecting elites to change in response to ordinary citizens ‘ patterns of belief? JENNIFER L. HOCHSHILD, What’s Fair?: American Beliefs About Distributive Justice , 1981. 473. The real persuaders are our appetites, our fears and above all our vanity. The skillful propagandist stirs and coaches these mental persuaders. ERIC HOFFER (1902-1983). 474. The thought control of dictatorships is imposed by force, but discussion, criticism and debate can be stifled by fear as well as by force. Persecution [by] public opinion can be as powerful as purges and pogroms. Frightened men are, at best, irresponsible in their actions and, at worst, dangerous. Of all the forms of tyranny over the mind of man, none is more terrible than fear -- to be afraid of being one’s self among one’s neighbors. PAUL G. HOFFMAN (1891-1974), Address, Freedom House , 1951. 475. The growth of the mass media of communication and their use in politics have brought politics closer to the people than ever before and have made politics a form of entertainment in which the spectators feel themselves involved. Thus it has become, more than ever before, an arena in which private emotions and personal problems can be readily projected. Mass communications have made it possible to keep the mass man in an almost constant state of political mobilization. RICHARD HOFSTADTER (1916-1970), The Paranoid Style in American Politics , 1965. 476. The temptation is great, under the pressures of daily journalism, to leap to conclusions, to act as an advocate, to make assumptions based on previous experience, to approach a story with preconceived notions of what is likely to happen. ... An open mind is the mark of the journalist; the propagandist has made up his mind in advance. JOHN HOHENBERG, The Professional Journalist , 1969. 477.

PAUL HOLLANDER, Political Pilgrims , 1981. 478. The strength of a suggestion depends in part on the degree to which it seems to be of spontaneous origin, an act of the individual’s own initiative. Arrogance and domination are at once and instinctively resented and resisted. The more indirect the suggestion, the more it can be made as to be an original determination or plan or conclusion on the part of the listener, the greater its dynamic power. H. L.

[E]veryone who is now between the ages of thirty-odd and forty-odd [in 1965] had already shared a common experience by the time they entered the armed services.

JOHN CLELLON HOLMES, “15 cents before 6:00 PM: The Wonderful Movies of the Thirties,” Harper’s , December 1965. 480. Men are idolaters, and want something to look at and kiss, or throw themselves down before; they always did, they always will; and if you don’t make it of wood, you must make it of words. OLIVER WENDALL HOLMES, SR. (1809-1894), The Poet at the Breakfast Table , 1872. 481. The differentiating characteristic of the psychological instrument of statecraft is that it attempts to manipulate people’s perception of the world independently or relatively independently of any changes in the material world. ROBERT T. HOLT, “A New Approach to Political Communications,” in Propaganda and the Cold War (John B. Whitton), 1963. 482. One who is asked to present a “new approach” often adopts a favorite trick of the rhetorician. He erects a straw man that he labels the “old approach.” It is formidable in appearance, but of no real substance. It can easily be destroyed, and the new proposals appear in striking contrast to the demolished straw man. ROBERT T. HOLT, “A New Approach to Political Communications,” in Propaganda and the Cold War (John B. Whitton), 1963. 483. But now change your theme and sing to us of the stratagem of the Wooden Horse, which Epeius built with Athene’s help, and which the good Odysseus contrived to get taken one day into the citadel of troy as an ambush, manned by the warriors who then sacked the town. HOMER, Greek Poet. 484. Truth of fact and wisdom of policy can be more readily achieved through the lively interchange of ideas and opinions than by unchallengeable edicts on the part of a self-perpetuating elite. SIDNEY HOOK (1902-1989), “The Ethics of Controversy,” Ethics and Persuasion (Richard Johannesen, ed), 1967. 485. It is touching to see how these flocks of men are duped by the printed and spoken word, how marvelously deficient their critical faculty. The sacrosanct word “democracy” is able to fabricate a catechism even richer in miraculous fair stories than the old one, and these people are quite ready to gulp it down devoutly. ALISTAIRE HORNE, The Fall of Paris , 1968. 486. A relatively low degree of fear arousal will sometimes be the optimal level – that too strong a fear appeal can evoke some form of interference which reduces the effectiveness of the communication. CARL I. HOVLAND (1912-1961), et. al., Communication and Persuasion , 1953. 487. One way a communication can reinforce the acceptance of new beliefs is to arouse and then alleviate emotional tension.

ROBERT HUGHES, Culture of Complaint , 1993. 491. Power has always been one of the reasons why men sought ownership or direction of the press or any part of it. Ambitious political figures have used party newspapers as mouthpieces. Chain owners have attempted to condition the community opinion of a dozen cities at once by using the gatekeeper control to keep some kinds of news out of the daily stream. JOHN L. HULTENG & ROY PAUL NELSON , The Fourth Estate: An Informal Appraisal of the News and Opinion Media , 1971. 492. Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the ease with which the many are governed by the few, and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of the rulers. When we inquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find out that, as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is, therefore, on opinion only that government is founded, and the maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments as well as the most free and popular. DAVID HUME (1711-1766), First Principles of Government , 1742 . 493. A motion picture may have a real propaganda point – you will remember The Grapes of Wrath, Mission to Moscow, and Gentlemen’s Agreement ... are likely to be more effective than any number of factual reports. WILLIAM HUMMEL & KEITH HUNTRESS, The Analysis of Propaganda , 1949. 494. In propaganda, as in life, we seldom have difficulty with concrete terms, terms whose referents are obvious and understood. But with abstractions the situation is entirely different. For almost every abstraction we have our own private system of referents, either derived from experience or graciously supplied to us by interested propagandists. WILLIAM HUMMEL & KEITH HUNTRESS, The Analysis of Propaganda , 1949. 495. We are inclined to call reports which favor our own interests true; reports from the opposition are called propaganda. WILLIAM HUMMELL & KEITH HUNTRESS, An Analysis of Propaganda , 1949. 496. The old idea that words possess magical powers is false, but its falsity is the distortion of a very important truth. Words do have a magical effect -- but not in the way that magicians supposed, and not on the objects that they are trying to influence. Words are magical in the way they affect the minds of those who use them. ALDOUS HUXLEY (1894-1963). 497. Political and religious propaganda is effective, it would seem, only upon those who are already partly or entirely convinced of its truth. ... The propagandist is a man who canalizes an already existing stream. In a land where there is no water, he digs in vain. ALDOUS HUXLEY (1894-1963), “Notes on Propaganda,” Harper’s Monthly Magazine , December 1936. 498.

The biggest danger I encountered in my years as an editor was a reflective cynicism among some reporters that led them to assume they knew what a story was about, before they had actually done the reporting. They would begin with an assumption of who the good guys and the bad guys were, and then organize the facts around that hypothesis. Sometimes, reporters were so confident about their a priori hypotheses that they would make only the most perfunctory, last-minute efforts to contact the “bad guys.” DAVID IGNATIUS, “Just the Facts,” Washington Monthly , January-February 1999. 500.

SHANTO IYENGAR & DONALD KINDER, News That Matters , 1987. 501. By calling attention to some matters while ignoring others, television news influences the standards by which governments, presidents, policies, and candidates for public office are judged. SHANTO IYENGAR & DONALD KINDER, News That Matters , 1987. 502. The power of television news to set the public agenda depends partly on which public we have in mind. Television coverage is particularly effective in shaping the judgments of citizens with limited political resources and skills. Those who rarely get caught up in the world of politics find network news presentations particularly compelling. ... The more removed the viewer is from the world of public affairs, the stronger the agenda-setting power of television news. SHANTO IYENGAR & DONALD KINDER, News That Matters , 1987. 503. [T]he classical agenda setting effect may be a particular manifestation of a general inclination in human inference – an inclination to overvalue “salient” evidence. ... Conspicuous evidence is general accorded importance exceeding its inferential value; logically consequential but perceptually innocuous evidence is accorded less. SHANTO IYENGAR, et. al., “Experimental Demonstrations of the ‘Not-So-Minimal’ Consequences of Television News Programs,” American Political Science Review, 76 , 1982. 504. Situations sometimes arise in practical propaganda in which the logical mode ( ad rem ) does not produce the necessary effect, despite the convincingness of the arguments and correctness of the propagandist’s position. The psychological mode ( ad hominem ) proves to be more effective, for the propagandist takes into account the usual course of reasoning and conclusions to which the listener resorts proceeding from his interests and convictions. Psychological arguments make the propagandist’s words more convincing, comprehensible, and clear. INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES (USSR), Social Psychology and Propaganda , 1985. 505. Because public opinion in the United States is popularly regarded as a moral force, one note of caution regarding its influence should be sounded here. Public opinion as a social phenomenon per se has nothing within it making it inherently a power either for good or evil; without direction it is amoral. If it is to serve as an aid to democracy, this result can accrue only through the determination and efforts of people-of-good-will; otherwise the possibility of enslavement of people through public opinion, directed by propaganda, is always present. FREDERICK C. IRION, Public Opinion and Propaganda , 1950. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"~J~ 506. The public opinion apparatus equipped government officials with two capabilities, the ability to manipulate and to respond to public opinion. The aspect of the apparatus that was developed first and most extensively was the capacity to conduct public relations campaigns aimed at shaping popular preferences. The second capacity involved gathering intelligence on public opinion; in particular, polling became a central aspect of government efforts to gain a regular and reliable grip on public opinion.

There is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those who hear it. WILLIAM JAMES, Varieties of Religious Experience, 1902. 508. The language of the television screen is the language of close-ups. ... These typical close-up shots reflect the personal and social contact that is characteristic of television. ... Distance is related to intimacy. Television simulates intimate relationships. ... The reliance on close-ups creates new rules for our sense of interpersonal space. KATHLEEN H. JAMIESON & KARLYN CAMPTELL, The Interplay of Influence , 1983. 509. Speaking effectively on television requires an ability to create both the illusion of eye contact with an unseen audience and to converse with a camera. Delivering from a ghosted text requires a skill at speaking someone else’s words as if they were your own and investing a script with the illusion of spontaneity. Most televised speechmaking is built on these minor, but not insignificant, forms of deception. KATHLEEN H. JAMIESON, Eloquence In An Electronic Age , 1988. 510. Messages that induce fear dampen our disposition to scrutinize them for gaps in logic. When the message is fear arousing, personal involvement and interest in it minimize systemic evaluation. KATHLEEN M. JAMIESON, Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction and Democracy , 1992. 511. Television can pair previously disconnected images with a speed and seamlessness that defies the scrutiny of the suspicious. Inviting us to impute a causal link to things only associatively tied is such a stock-in-trade of product advertising that over time we have lost our awareness of how strange some of the paired associations are. KATHLEEN M. JAMIESON, Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction and Democracy , 1992. 512. [Eloquent images] rivet photographic attention because little or no commentary is required – the picture is the story. ... It is both the freshness of the symbols and the ability to stand for more than themselves that make the attractive to news photographers. KATHLEEN JAMIESON & KARLYN KOHRS CAMPBELL, The Interplay of Influence , 1997. 513. Implicit in the use of fear appeals is the assumption that when emotional tension is aroused, the audience will become more highly motivated to accept the reassuring beliefs or recommendations advocated by the communicator. IRVING L. JANIS & S. FESHBACH, “Effects 0f Fear-Arousing Communications,” Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology 19 , 1956. 514. I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion.

If the eighteen-year old is no simple carbon copy of his parents – as the results clearly indicate – then it seems most likely that other socializing agents have ample opportunity to exert their impact. ...

KENT JENNINGS & RICHARD G. NIEMI, “The Transmission of Political Values from Parent to Child,” American Political Science Review, 62 , 1968. 516. [A] formidable obstacle to honest thinking is laziness – the reluctance to face “the insupportable fatigue of thought. ... How much easier it is to fall in with accepted opinion than to question it! Hence is derived the tendency to accept without question whatever one sees in print, or the expressed opinions of so-called “authorities.” R. W. JEPSON, Clear Thinking , 1936. 517. Propaganda, in fact, has its best changes of success when those to whom it is addressed are in a passive receptive and uncritical mood, or when their will or power to resist is weak. If the propagandist has reason to suspect that these conditions are not present, he may try to create them artificially, and so predispose his hearers to listen. R. W. JEPSON, Clear Thinking , 1936. 518. In Germany, under Hitler’s Nazi influence, the ends of national survival and National Socialist justified any persuasive means.

SAMUEL JOHNSON (17091784), The Life of Samuel Johnson (James Boswell), 1791. 523. Propaganda is a form of communication that is different from persuasion because it attempts to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist. Persuasion is interactive and attempts to satisfy the needs of both persuader and persuadee. GARTH JOWETT and VICTORIA O’DONNELL, Propaganda and Persuasion , 1986. 524. The ability of the movies to transport an audience outside of its local cultural experience is a significant one and accounts for much of the concern about “movie influence.” Thus, while movies may alienate people from the own local experience, they also prepare people for a wider cross-section of society as a whole.

MARVIN KARLINS and HERBERT I. ABELSON, Persuasion: How Opinions and Attitudes are Changed , 1970. 532. When the audience is generally friendly, or when your position is the only one that will be presented, or when you want immediate, though temporary, opinion change, present one side of the argument. ... When the audience initially disagrees with you, or when it is probable that the audience will hear the other wise from someone else, present both sides of the argument. ... Arguments presented at the beginning or at the end of a communication will be remembered better than arguments presented in the middle. MARVIN KARLINS & HERBERT I. ABELSON , Persuasion: How opinions and Attitudes are Changed , 1970. 533. Persuasion requires, ideally speaking, complete emotional and effective resonance between the persuader and the audience. As the propagandist develops his master theme, “These are the sources of your deprivations, and here are the means for removing them,” he must not encounter any emotional or affective resistance. PAUL KECSKEMETI, “Propaganda,” in Handbook of Communication (Ithiel de Sola Pool, et. al.), 1975. 534. To be persuasive, the propaganda theme has to be perceived as coming from within .

Social scientist, no doubt unwittingly, have often defined propaganda in such a way as to make their definition into an ideological weapon.

The Bolsheviks, who possessed an all-encompassing ideology, assumed that their opponents, the liberal democrats of the West, did so as well. Because they were determined to propagandize their ideology, they took it for granted that believers in other worldviews were doing the same. When Westerners denied that they carried out propaganda, the Bolsheviks regarded such denials as sheer hypocrisy. Indeed, to some of the Russian leaders it seemed precisely the covert nature of “bourgeois” propaganda that make it so effective. PETER KENEZ, The Birth of the Propaganda State , 1985. 541. First, people pay special attention to behaviors and events relevant to their expectations, and often even seek information that confirms their expectations. ...

KENRICK, et. al,, Social Psychology: Unraveling the Mystery , 1999. 542. Population segments most susceptible to media management usually think they think independently, critically, clearly, and can readily discriminate between truth and falsity, reality and fantasy. This self- perception of autonomy is a basic indoctrination-priming tool. Humans who think they think for themselves often do not. The better primed by cultural values, the more vulnerable to manipulation. WILSON BRIAN KEY, The Age of Manipulation , 1989. 543. Symbols circumvent conscious thought and logic. They evoke vague, unspecified feelings. Symbolism constitutes a subliminal technique of communication.

Normative social influence occurs when an individual acts as others do to gain approval or avoid the disapproval of other group members. ... When subjects indicated their judgments in face-to-face situation where the others could identify their response, they conformed more than when others did not know their responses. CHARLES EMERSON KIMBLE, Social Psychology: Studying Human Interaction , 1990. 547. Identification occurs when a person adopts a behavior or expresses an attitude because some person or persons whom he or she admires display that behavior or attitude. ... One way that identification has been exploited occurs when advertisers get celebrities who are widely respected or admired to endorse their products.

CHARLES EMERSON KIMBLE, Social Psychology: Studying Human Interaction , 1990. 549. The media, sometimes intentionally, but often unintentionally, have the function of providing models for behavior. In some instances, propaganda is used in a deliberate attempt to influence values and beliefs. In other instances, the content of the ads and entertainment functions to convey particular norms of society. JOHN W. KINCH, Social Psychology , 1973. 550. Psychological operations wield words as nonviolent weapon systems, set stages, exploit successes, and minimize failures when properly employed. ... [Specialists must] rather intelligence that enables them to determine the predispositions, vulnerabilities, and susceptibilities of targeted audiences. ROBERT C.

Nazi concentration camps. MARSHALL KIRK & ERASTES PILL, “The Overhauling Of Straight America,” Guide Magazine , November 1987. 552. Pejorative as well as laudatory labels and appellations, be they “terrorist,” “tyrant,” “and “dictator,” or conversely, “political prisoner,” “asylum seeker,” and “freedom fighter,” are potent instruments in the struggle between competing political camps. Often they are indiscriminately used by contesting parties to either dignify or vilify, reward or punish, both the labelers and their adversaries. Frequently, labels and appellations not only describe what people already are but further help determine what they might become. NICHOLAS N. KITTRIE, Rebels With A Cause: The Minds and Morality of Political Offenders , 1999. 553. Denigrating political opponents by slanders, slurs, innuendos, rumors, invective, or embarrassing charges is both a deplored and a time-honored practice. ... The method is politically attractive because it is cheap and easy. Rumor has the advantage of anonymity and is almost impossible to combat effectively; name-calling is cheap because it gathers up a battery of vague charges into one ball that can be hurled. The damage is done without a chance for defense. ORRIN E. KLAPP, Symbolic Leaders: Public Dramas and Public Men , 1964. 554.

JOSEPH KLAPPER & CHARLES Y. GLOCK, Scientific American , February, 1949. 555. There is [an] area in which mass communication is extremely effective, and that is in the creation of opinion on new issues. By “new issues” I mean issues on which the individual has no opinion... The individual has no disposition to defend, and so the communication falls, as it were, on defenseless soil. And once the opinion is created, then it is this new opinion which becomes easy to reinforce and hard to change. JOSEPH KLAPPER, Modern Communications and Foreign Policy , 1967. 556. Communications research strongly indicates that persuasive mass communication is in general more likely to reinforce the existing opinions of its audience than it is to change such opinions. Minor attitude change appears to be a more likely effect than conversion and a less likely effect than reinforcement. JOSEPH KLAPPER, The Effects of Mass Communication , 1960. 557. The war [WWI] was made to appear one of defence against a menacing aggressor. The Kaiser was painted as a beast in human form. ... The Germans were portrayed as only slightly better than the hordes of Genghis Kahn, rapers of nuns, mutilators of children, and destroyers of civilization. PHILIP KNIGHTLY, The First Casualty , 1995. 558. The most persistent sound which reverberates through men’s history is the beating of drums. ARTHUR KOESTLER (1904-1983), Janus: A Summing Up , 1979. 559. At the dawn of the new millennium, the transformation of mainstream journalism is now complete. The aim of today’s newspaper is not merely to gather and impart the news but to influence public opinion. News gathering and reporting have become merely a means to that end. The tools of propaganda have found a new home. BOB KOHN, Journalistic Fraud , 2003. 560. A newspaper can effectively disparage those who oppose its political views by lacing its news stories with eggs thrown by others. This is just a variation of the Quote-Someone-Who-Agrees-With-Us technique. BOB KOHN, Journalistic Fraud , 2003. 561. A classic technique of propaganda is to link a person or an idea to a positive or negative symbol. The propagandist hopes that the reader’s receptivity to the substance of the issue will be tainted by the negative label or aided by the positive label. BOB KOHN, Journalistic Fraud , 2003. 562. Biased headlines are important. Most people don’t read newspapers; they scan them – that is, they read the headlines... To influence the headlines is to influence public opinion. BOB KOHN, Journalistic Fraud , 2003. 563. In its appeal to the patriotic and conservative bourgeoisie, the regime played on the people’s need for security and order and stresses those moderate aspects of fascist that would guarantee harmony. TRACY H. KOON, Believe, Obey, Fight: Political Socialization of Youth in Fascist Italy, 1922-1943 , 1985. 564. Fascistization took many different forms: an increase in the blatantly political content of school curricula and the introduction of state textbooks; ever-tighter control and subordination of teachers to make them faithful servants of the state and eliminate academic freedom; more rigid centralization of the school administration to bring all academic personnel under the close supervision of the ministry...

The problem of what to report and how to report it will never be resolved, because the line between fact and the subjective view of that fact remains elusive. Then, too, he who burns with zeal to correct the errors of one side risks error on the other side. Still, we can do a good job of it – as long as we keep the flag of objectivity flying high. That will give a more honest and more accurate view of this imperfect world than trusting a latter-day Trotsky, or any other partisan on any side, to tell us what’s what. ANDREW KOPKIND, “What’s Wrong With Objectivity,” Saturday Review , 11 October 1969. 566. Without television, terrorism becomes rather like the philosopher’s hypothetical tree falling in the forest: no one hears it fall and therefore it has no reason for being. And television, without terrorism, while not deprives of all interesting things in the world, is nonetheless deprived of one of the most interesting. TED KOPPEL, quoted in “Terrorism and the Mass Media” (R. F. FARNEN), Terrorism, 2 , 1990. 567. Propaganda is a bit like pornography – hard to define but most people think they will know it when they see it. A widely accepted definition holds that “propaganda is the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a view to influencing the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for predetermined ends and through psychological manipulations.” CLAYON R. KOPPES & GREGORY D. BLACK, Hollywood Goes To War , 1987. 568. The ads were lurid even by Hollywood standards. A huge Japanese figure, blood dripping from its buck-toothed fangs, rose from the sea. His octopus tentacles swatted American planes from mid-air and crushed American ships on the high seas. CLAYON R. KOPPES & GREGORY D. BLACK, Hollywood Goes To War , 1987. 569. In Tarzan Triumphs (RKO, 1942) Nazi agents parachute into Tarzan’s peaceful kingdom and occupy a fortress, hoping to exploit oil and tin. Johnny Wiesmiller, a slightly flabby but still commanding noble savage, rallies his natives (all of them white) against the Axis. “Kill Nadzies!” Tarzan commands the natives. They nod eagerly. The Germans are so despicable even the animals turn against them. CLAYTON R. KOPPES & GREGORY D. BLACK, Hollywood Goes To War , 1987. 570. The affairs of men are conducted by our own man-made rules and according to man-made theories. Man’s achievements rest upon the use of symbols. For this reason, we must consider ourselves as a symbolic, semantic class of life, and those who rule the symbols rule us. ALFRED KORZBSKI, Science and Sanity , 1941. 571. When we say “our rulers” we mean those who are engaged in the manipulation of symbols. There is no escape from the fact that they do, and that they always will, rule mankind, because we constitute a symbolic class of life, and we cannot cease from being so. ALFRED KORZBSKI (1879-1950), Science and Sanity , 1941. 572. [Social marketing is] the design, implementation, and control of programs seeking to increase the acceptability of a social idea or practice in a target group(s). It utilizes concepts of market segmentation, consumer research, idea configuration, communication, facilitation, incentives, and exchange theory to maximize target group response. P. KOTLER, Marketing For Nonprofit Organizations , 1975. 573. [T]he mass media alter “reality” in many ways. Errors of fact appearing in the media and intentional bias distort or change our notions of “what really happened” in a given situation.

One reason why people hold inconsistent opinions is that they have different opinions for different social situations. ... An opinion is an “answer” that is given to “a question” in a given situation. When the question or situation varies somewhat, a somewhat different response can be expected. Differences in the wording of questions often give quite different results. ROBERT E. LAND & DAVID O. SEARS, Public Opinion , 1964. 577. Stereotypes are the mind’s shorthand for dealing with complexities. They have two aspects: they are much blunter than reality; they are shaped to fit a man’s preferences or prejudgments. Thus two principles are involved: differentiation or its lack, and biased preferential perception. ROBERT E. LANE, Political Ideology , 1962. 578. The mass media force attention to certain issues. They build up public images of political figures. They are constantly presenting objects suggesting what individuals in the mass should think about, know about, have feelings about. KURT LANG & GLADYS ENGEL LANG, in Reader in Public Opinion and Communication (Berelson & Janowitz), 1966. 579.

If the media succeed with their spectacles and grand simplifications, it is because their audiences define happiness as the state of being well and artfully deceived. People like to listen to stories, to belief what they’re told, to imagine that the implacable forces of history speak to them with a human voice. Who can bear to live without myths? LEWIS LAPHAM, “Gilding the News,” Harper’s , July 1981. 582. Today the label “demagogue” frequently is used to render a negative ethical judgment of a communicator. Too often the label is left only vaguely defined; the criteria we are to use to evaluate a person as a demagogue are unspecified. In ancient Greece, a demagogue simply was a leader or orator who championed the cause of the common people. CHARLES U. LARSON, Persuasion , 1983. 583.

Advertising serves no so much to advertise products as to promote consumption as a way of life. ... The propaganda of commodities serves a double function. First, it upholds consumption as an alternative to protest or rebellion. ... In the second place, the propaganda of consumption turns alienation itself into a commodity.

How one thinks and what one thinks about are molded by the language one uses to express one’s thoughts. JOHN LASKI, “Basic Confusions,” Times Educational Supplement , 13 November 1981. 587. The real power of the press comes from the effect of its continuous repetition of an attitude reflected in the facts which its readers have no chance to check, or by its ability to surround those facts by an environment of suggestion which, often half-consciously, seeps its way into the mind of the reader and forms his premises for him without his even being aware that they are really prejudices to he has scarcely given a moment of thought. HAROLD J. LASKY (1893-1950), The American Democracy , 1948. 588. A well-established ideology perpetuates itself with little planned propaganda by those whom it benefits most. When thought is taken about ways and means of sowing conviction, conviction has already languished, the basic outlook of society has decayed. HAROLD D. LASSWELL (1902-1978), Politics: Who Gets What, When, How , 1958. 589. The illusion of victory must be nourished because of the close connection between the strong and the good. If we win, God is on our side. If we lose, God may have been on the other side. HAROLD D. LASSWELL (1902-1978), Propaganda Technique in the World War , 1927. 590. The psychological function of revolutionary propaganda, like war propaganda, is to control aggressiveness, guilt, weakness, affection. Marxism, for example, fosters the projection of aggressiveness by denouncing “capitalism” as predatory. HAROLD D. LASSWELL (1902-1978), Politics: Who Gets What, When, How . 1958. 591. Revolutionary propaganda selects symbols which are calculated to detach the affections of the masses from the existing symbols of authority and to attach their affections to challenging symbols and to direct hostilities toward existing symbols of authority.

The mass media bestow prestige and enhance the authority of individuals and groups by legitimizing their status . Recognition by the press or radio or magazines or newsreels testifies that one has arrived, that one is important enough to have been singled out from the large anonymous masses, that one’s behavior and opinions are significant enough to require public notice.

Mental contagion is the most powerful factor in the propagation of a revolutionary movement. In certain men, the revolutionary spirit is a mental condition independent of the object on which it is exercised. No concession could appease them. GUSTAVE Le BON (1841-1931), Aphorisms of Present Times , 1913. 602. Reason and argument are incapable of combating certain words and formulas.

GUSTAVE Le BON (1841-1931), The Crowd , 1895. 603. The power of words is bound up with the images they evoke, and is quite independent of their real significance. Words whose sense is the most ill-defined are sometimes those that possess the most influence.

Name calling -- giving an idea a bad label -- is used to make us reject and condemn the idea without examining the evidence... Glittering generality -- associating something with a “virtue word” -- is used to make us accept and approve the thing without examining the evidence. Testimonial consists in having some respected or hated person say a given idea or program or product or person is good or bad.

If a word is not what it represents, then whatever you might say about anything will not be it . If in doubt, you might try eating the word steak when hungry, or wearing the word coat when cold. In short, the universe of discourse is not the universe of direct experience. ... This suggests a general principle: our adjustment (and ultimately, survival) is correlated with our expectations, that is, our ability to predict happenings accurately. This is a way of saying that the correctness of our expectations depends upon the similarity of structure of the language used and the happenings represented. IVY J. LEE, Language Habits in Human Affairs , 1941. 608. Social proof is the tendency to believe what most people believe. If an advocate creates the impression that “everyone knows” that someone is lying and covering up facts, there is a subtle implication that those who disagree are somehow flawed in credibility. ...

The surest way of discrediting a new political idea, and of damaging it, is to reduce it to absurdity while ostensibly defending it. For every truth is “exorbitant,” if it is exaggerated, if it is carried beyond the limits in which it can be actually applies, can be reduced to absurdity, and is even found to become an absurdity under the conditions. V. I. LENIN (1870-1924), Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder , 1920. 610.

WYNDHAM LEWIS, 1932. 613. The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché.

The skilled interrogator can play on people’s need not to feel a terrible person. The totalist can stir up guilt about past behavior and then plant the idea that such behavior could only have been indulged in because the victim’s ideology was wrong. By embracing the new ideology, he can absolve himself of guilt. ... Society operates by the manipulation of guilt, by the setting of rules which induce guilt if broken. ROBERT J. LIFTON, Thought Reform And The Psychology of Totalism , 1961. 615. People vary greatly in their susceptibilities to guilt and shame, depending upon patterns developed in early life. But since guilt and shame are basic to human existence, this variation can be no more than a matter of degree. Each person is made vulnerable through his profound inner sensitivities to his own limitations and to his unfulfilled potential... ROBERT J.

If you don’t agree, it’s propaganda. PAUL LINEBARGER (1913-1966), Psychological Warfare , 1948. 620. Political warfare consists of the framing of national policy in such a way as to assist propaganda or military operations, whether with respect to the direct political relations of governments with one another or in relation to groups of people possessing a political character.

WALTER LIPPMAN (1889-1974), Public Opinion, 1922. 626. Without some form of censorship, propaganda in the strict sense of the word is impossible. In order to conduct a propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event. WALTER LIPPMAN (1889-1974), Public Opinion , 1922. 627. Patriotic spectacles serve an important function. In the midst of agonizing changes, the imagined power and majesty of the nation-state compensates for the loss of individual and collective power. As we control our lives less and less, we look increasingly to images outside ourselves for signs of the power and worth that we have lost. GEORGE LIPSITZ, “Dilemmas Of Beset Nationhood,” in Bonds of Affection: Americans Define Their Patriotism , (John Bodnar, Ed.), 1996. 628. The attention devoted to ceremonial commemoration of past wars may be not so much evidence of how easy it is for people to go to war, but rather how much persuasion, rationalization, and diversion are required to make warfare acceptable. GEORGE LIPSITZ, “Dilemmas Of Beset Nationhood,” in Bonds of Affection: Americans Define Their Patriotism (John Bodnar, Ed), 1996. 629. Terrorism has become one of the cant words of our time, used to justify all manner of sin on the part of governments seeking to discredit or oppress their political opposition.

LIVINGSTONE, The Cult of Counterterrorism , 1990. 630. Teleological theories hold that the ultimate standard of what is morally right is the non-moral value that is brought into being. Right and wrong are exclusively a function of results and outcomes. Very roughly speaking, the ends justify the means in teleological theories. SCOTT LLOYD, “A Criticism of Social Responsibility Theory: An Ethical Perspective,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 6 , 1991. 631. Deontological theories, on the other hand, deny that what is morally right is exclusively a function of non-moral consequences. They affirm that there are more considerations that may make a rule or an action morally right than simply the goodness or badness of its consequences. Intent, motive, and the inherent nature of an act or rule – features of the act itself instead of the value it brings into existence – all serve as justification in defining what is right or wrong in deontological theories.

Fantasy ... often represents a convenient way for man to temporarily lie to himself in order to make life more palatable.

LUDWIG, The Importance of Lying , 1965. 638. As the ultimate expression of social engineering, many rulers aspire to control the minds of their subjects. Part of the utopian mentality is to create a society of like-minded individuals who not only do the rulers bidding but affirm whatever he says to be true. When a ruler can fill the minds of others with “correct thoughts and values, he has achieved the ultimate in interpersonal control. ARNOLD M. LUDWIG, King of the Mountain: The Nature of Political Leadership , 2002. 639. [M]edia coverage and terrorism are soul mates – virtually inseparable. They feed off each other.

LUKASZEWSKI, “The Media and the Terrorist: A Dance of Death, Executive Speeches , June 1987. 640. Propaganda is promotion which is veiled in one way or another as to (1) its origin or sources, (2) the interests involved, (3) the methods employed, (4) the content spread, and (5) the results accruing to the victims -- any one, any two, any three, any four, or all five. FREDERICK E. LUMLEY (1880-1954), The Propaganda Machine , 1933. 641. Cinema’s strength lies in the fact that, like any art, it imbues an idea with feeling and with captivating form but, unlike the other arts, cinema is actually cheap, portable and unusually graphic. Its effects reach where even the book cannot reach and it is, of course, more powerful than any kind of narrow propaganda.

Those holding a doctorate, professional license, or clergy post thereby gain more access to minds than those lacking such distinctions. AARON LYNCH, Thought Contagion , 1996. 646. Beliefs affect retransmission in so many ways that they set off a colorful, unplanned growth race among diverse “epidemic” of ideas. Actively contagious ideas are now called memes ... by students of the newly emerging science of memetics. AARON LYNCH, Thought Contagion , 1996. 647. The ways that memes retransmit fit into several general patterns called modes : the quantity parental, efficiency parental, proselytic, preservational, adversative, cognitive, and motivational modes. Each one involves a thought contagion’s “carrier,” or host , serving to increase the idea’s “infected” group, or host population . AARON LYNCH, Thought Contagion , 1996. 648.

Give me the writing of a nation’s advertising and propaganda, and I care not who governs its politics. HUGH MACLENNAN, MacLean’s, 5 November 1960. 662. Television feeds us poison ivy by lying to us about what life is really like, what people are really like. Communication between people is increasingly out of sync. Television has lied to us about ourselves, and because it shovels information at us in such quantities so relentlessly and with such impact, we believe it instead of believing our own guts. We find it harder to understand each other. We find it harder to understand ourselves. LORING MANDEL, “Television Pollutes Us All”, New York Times , 25 March 1970. 663. It is almost impossible for public opinion to form any kind of verdict based on actual facts. Newspapers nowadays use facts merely as the raw material of propaganda. By suppression, or alteration, or overemphasis, or by the trick of false perspective, or by scare headlines and editorial comment, the “facts” are made to convey exactly the particular idea which the newspaper desires to suggest to its readers. A. E. MANDER, Public Enemy The Press , 1944. 664. Living within artificial, reconstructed, arbitrary environments that are strictly the products of human conception, we have no way to be sure that we know what is true and what is not.

JERRY MANDER , Four Arguments For The Elimination of Television , 1978. 665. Television limits and confines human knowledge. It changes the way humans receive information from the world. In place of natural multidimensional information reception, it offers a very narrow- gauged sense experience, diminishing the amount and kind of information people receive. Television keeps awareness contained within its own rigid channels, a tiny fraction of the natural information field. Because of television we believe we know more, but we know less.

Information received first will affect the encoding of later information. GEORGE E. MARCUS, et. al., With Malice Towards Some: How People Make Civil Liberties Judgments, 1995. 668. Symbols that evoke basic and fundamental responses include such stimuli as “communists,” “the KKK,” “drug kingpins,” “Woodstock,” “homeboys,” and “Saddam.” These symbols are powerful, so much so that when linked to less emotionally charged stimuli, they can extend their reach quite broadly. GEORGE E. MARCUS, et. al., With Malice Towards Some: How People Make Civil Liberties Judgments , 1995. 669. Introjection implies the existence of an inner dimension distinguished from and even antagonistic to the external exigencies – an individual consciousness and an individual unconscious apart from public opinion and behavior. The idea of “inner freedom” here has its reality: it designates the private space in which man may become and remain “himself.” HERBERT MARCUSE (1898-1979), One- Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society , 1964. 670. Mass production and mass distribution claim the entire individual, and industrial psychology has long since ceased to be confined to the factory. ... The result is, not adjustment but mimesis , an immediate identification of the individual with his society and, through it, with the society as a whole. HERBERT MARCUSE (1898-1979), One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society , 1964. 671. The behaviorist is inclined to ask, “What has the subject learned to do?” The cognitivist, on the other hand, would be inclined to ask, “How has the subject learned to perceive the situation?” The cognitivist is interested in examining a learning situation in terms of such factors as motivation, the personality of the subject – in short, the entire range of the subject’s psychological field. ROM J. MARKIN, JR., Consumer Behavior: A Cognitive Orientation , 1974. 672. While tactical victories may be won by tricks and perversions of the truth, strategy demands a long- distance and coherent war policy, into the framework of which all propaganda should fall. ... propaganda must be based on a long-term calculation of realities ... it must be consistent with geographic, economic and psychological facts; ... whatever propaganda you make for the war will dog your steps in the peace and after it.

This impact of mass media – the ability to effect cognitive change among individuals – has been labeled the agenda-setting function of mass communication. Here may lie the most important effect of modern mass communication, the ability of media to structure our world for us. MAXWELL E. McCOMBS & DONALD L. SHAW, quoted in The Effects of Mass Communication on Political Behavior (Sidney Kraus & Dennis Davis), 1976. 676. In choosing and displaying news, editors, newsroom staff, and broadcasters play an important part in shaping political reality. Readers learn not only about a given issue, but also how much importance to attach to that issue from the amount of information in a news story and its position. In reflecting what candidates are saying during a campaign, the mass media may determine the important issues -- that is, the media may set the “agenda” of the campaign. MAXWELL E. McCOMBS & DONALD L. SHAW, “The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media,” Public Opinion Quarterly , Summer, 1972. 677. This basic, primitive notion of agenda-setting is a truism. If the media tell us nothing about a topic or event, then in most cases it will simply not exist in our personal agenda or in our life space. MAXWELL E. McCOMBS, “Agenda-Setting Research: A Bibliographic Essay,” Political Communications Review , 1976. 678. Persuasion as a means of control always involves the introduction of a consideration not materially relevant to the situation but deliberately made relevant. The persuader must deliberately create and alleviate discomforts in order to control behavior. NEIL A. McDONALD, Politics: A Study of Control Behavior , 1965. 679. With the coming of television, and the knowledge of how it could be used to seduce voters, the old political values disappeared. Something new, murky, undefined started to rise from the mists. JOE McGINNIS, The Selling of the President , 1969. 680. It is not surprising ... that politicians and advertising men should have discovered one another. And, once, they recognized that the citizen did not so much vote for a candidate as make a psychological purchase of him, not surprising that they began to work together.... JOE McGINNIS, The Selling of the President , 1969. 681. Advertising, in many ways, is a con game, too. Human beings do not need new automobiles every third year; a color television brings little enrichment of the human experience; a higher or lower hemline no expansion of consciousness, no increase in the capacity to love. ... It is not surprising, then, that politicians and advertising men should have discovered one another. JOE McGINNIS, The Selling of the President , 1969. 682. Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don’t really any rights left.

MARSHALL McLUHAN (1911-1980). 688. The citizen’s right to choose presupposed the available of alternatives from which a meaningful selection could be made, and a rational, knowledgeable electorate capable of exercising its rights. Democracy was real, in other words, only when it involved the participation of an informed, rational electorate. BRIAN McNAIR, An Introduction to Political Communication , 1995. 689. To say that the media have important cognitive and agenda-setting effects in modern democracies is perhaps, by this stage of our history, a statement of the obvious. BRIAN McNAIR, An Introduction to Political Communication , 1995. 690. The media are active in defining political ‘reality.’ Through the processes of newsgathering and production described in the previous chapter, the audience is finally presented with a ‘finished’ articulation of what ‘really’ matters in political affairs at any given time. Journalists communicate to us the ‘meaning’ of politics. They insert the events of political life into narrative frameworks which allow them to be told as news stories. BRIAN McNAIR, An Introduction to Political Communication , 1995. 691. Control of the mass media offers several important possibilities. First, the media can attract and direct attention to problems, solutions or people in ways that can favour those with power and correlatively divert attention from rival individuals and groups. Second, the mass media can confer status and confirm legitimacy. Third ... the media can be a channel for persuasion and mobilization. Fourth, the mass media can help to bring certain kinds of publics into being and maintain them. DENIS McQUAIL, Media Performance: Mass Communication and the Public Interest , 1992. 692.

The word serves as camouflage and defense mechanism. It fills the need to deceive, disguise, to utter falsehoods, to conceal thought or absence of thought, to confuse others.

In my own experience, I have been amazed to see how unrealistic are the bases for political opinion in general. Only rarely have I found a person who has chosen any particular political party -- democratic or totalitarian -- through study and comparison of principles. JOOST A. MERLOO, The Rape Of The Mind , 1956. 700. Man, the symbolizing animal, often mistakes the map for the land, the symbol for the real thing. There even lives in man the desire for symbols only rather than for the thing itself. In his labelomania – his urge to tack names and labels on everything – he runs away from action and reality. JOOST A. MERLOO, “Contributions of Psychiatry,” Human Communication Theory [Frank Dance, Ed}, 1967. 701. The more an individual feels himself to be part of the group, the more easily can he become the victim of mass suggestion.

Use of Stereotypes : The mass media, in their news and interpretation aspects, simplify the reality of events with regularity. The present men and events as one dimensional and static.

The detectable warning signs that the “news” is propaganda is any use of labels, inferences, false associations or unidentified sources instead of logic to make a point. Other warning flags should go up when the journalist acts like a prophet, mind reader or judge. Any guesses about a subjects motivation is an alert to either propaganda or a manufactured story.

The daily bombardment of television commercials, political announcements, sermons, and editorials constantly enjoins us with appeals to our feelings and emotions: anxiety, guilt, sympathy, psychological well-being, physical comfort, security, pleasure, joy. A plethora of injunctions are aimed at attributes of loyalty, generosity, devotion, compassion, dedication, and patriotism. C. D. MORTENSEN, Communication: The Study of Human Interaction , 1972. 734. [History will see advertising] “as one of the real evil things in our time. It is stimulating people constantly to want things, want this, want that. MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE (1903-1990), quoted in The Want Makers: Inside the World of Advertising , 1988. 735. As is ever the case with deceit, the camera’s deceitfulness varies in direct ration with its plausibility; because it has the reputation of not being able to lie, it lies the more effectively. In this sense, “good” photographs are more harmful than bad ones, and the greater the photographer the greater is liable to be the lie projected. MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE (1903-1990), in “Introduction,” The Man From M.A.L.I.C.E . (David Levine), 1966. 736. Governmental constraints on political communication, the mobilization of bias by powerful interests, and the commercial character of the media create a situation where news items that would invite challenges of the status quo are either omitted or embedded in interpretations which depreciate them.

[M]ass media play an indispensable role in the construction of social problems in the public mind. Their role in helping to create an impersonal social reality is more clear when there is evidence that public reality is operating independently of the aggregate of private realities. DIANA C. MUTZ, Impersonal Influence: How Perceptions of Mass Collectives Affect Political Attitudes , 1998. 742. By making some issues more accessible in people’s minds than others, news priorities prime the public to attach greater weight to certain issues when they evaluate the performance of political leaders. DIANA C. MUTZ, Impersonal Influence: How Perceptions of Mass Collectives Affect Political Attitudes , 1998. 743. Preconceptions may control interpretations.

In the East, where people have grown accustomed to thinking primarily in images, the cinema is the sole possible means to propaganda because it does not require the preliminary, gradual preparation of the masses.

With all great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which they owe their power.

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE (1844-1900), 1878. 756. The beating of drums, which delights young writers who serve a party, sounds to him who does not belong to the party line like a rattling of chains, and excites sympathy rather than admiration. FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE (1844-1900), Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions , 1879. 757. In man [the] art of simulation reaches its peak: here deception, flattery, lying and cheating, talking behind the back, posing, living in borrowed splendor, being masked, the disguise of convention, acting a role before others and before oneself. ... They are deeply immersed in illusions and dream images; their eye glides only over the surface of things and sees ‘forms’; their feeling nowhere leads into truth, but contents itself with the reception of stimuli, playing, as it were, a game of blindman’s bluff on the backs of things. FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE (1844-1900), On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense. 758. One of the important ethical problems associated with persuasion ... stems from the difficulty of deciding where persuasion ends and coercion begins. It is hard to determine whether there are forces operating from the outside or inside that are in a real sense “forcing” a particular choice. If, for example, a man fears reprisal for following a course of action, he may still be “free” to act or not, but it is a moot question whether his decision is a result of free choice or of coercion. THOMAS R. NILSEN, Ethics of Speech Communication , 1974. 759. If freedom of choice is to have meaning there must be adequate information upon which to base the choice, and if self-determination is to have meaning there must be significant alternatives whose implications are known among which to choose. THOMAS R. NILSEN, “Free Speech, Persuasion, and the Democratic Process,” Quarterly Journal of Speech 44 , 1958. 760.

The highly involved individual contrasts opposing views with his own and resists any persuasive effort to change; the less-committed person, however, assimilates alternative positions into his own point of view and accepts any one of a broad range of options as suitable behavior, without changing the attitude with which he has a low degree of involvement. ... Following this reasoning, then, the purpose of persuasion is not to change the attitudes of the committed, but to shift the perceptions of voters with low involvement. DAN NIMMO, The Political Persuaders , 1970. 762. [T]he thesis that mass media do not change attitudes but only reinforce them cannot be upheld under conditions of consonance and cumulation. ... It is true there exists a tendency to protect attitudes through selective perception. Yet the more selective perception is being restricted – by consonance of reporting and editorial comment, reinforced by cumulation of periodical repetition in the media – the more attitudes can be influenced or molded by the mass media. ELIZABETH NOELLE-NEUMANN, “Return to the Concept of the Powerful Mass Media,” Studies of Broadcasting 9 (H. Equchi & K Sata, eds), 1973. 763. The voice of protest, of warning, of appeal is never more needed than when the clamor of fife and drum, echoed by the press and too often by the pulpit, is bidding all men fall in and keep step and obey in silence the tyrannous word of command. Then, more than ever, it is the duty of the good citizen not to be silent. CHARLES ELIOT NORTON, True Patriotism , 1898. 764. In Stalin’s Russia, Mao’s China, as in Orwell’s 1984 , the truth is the same as what is “politically correct.” ... Such extreme contempt for truth works away at the distinction between what is true and what is false until the difference is no longer recognizable even to the functionaries. DAVID NYBERG, The Varnished Truth , 1993. 765. [The modes of response television evokes] are gestalt, nonanalytic, inarticulate, immediate, present- oriented, nonreflective, and emotional. Television focuses on the interpersonal and the affective, compresses experience, and stress instantaneity. It promotes appositive rather than logical thinking, a high level of excitement, and an intellectually passive response. CHRISTINE L. NYSTROM, “Immediate Man: The Symbolic Environment of Fanaticism,” ETC: A Review Of General Semantics 59, 2002. 766.

Abstraction may be defined as the process of using language or word symbols to take the place of real objects and the manipulation of these word symbols as if they were real. MARBURY B. OGLE, Public Opinion and Political Dynamics , 1950. 772. One of the most worrisome problems connected with democracy both as an ideology as a working form of government has always been occasioned by the belief that the citizen-at-large, the so-called “average man,” is capable of arriving at opinions by means of rational, relatively unemotional thought processes. Indeed, as we have seen, democracy as a form of government is especially dependent upon an “informed” public opinion for its successful functioning. MARBURY B. OGLE, Public Opinion and Political Dynamics , 1950. 773. It is the choice of just the right adjective or verb to sum up a situation that evokes from the receiver the response the mass communicator feels should be adopted toward a story. ... The word and the situation it describes become almost inseparable, so that the use of the word triggers a standardized response in the receiver. ROBERT O’HARA, Media For the Millions , 1961. 774. The use stock words and phrases to describe the same situations, which give the news an appearance of sameness. The event being described is news, but it is described in terms applied over the years to similar events. The impression of sameness obscures understanding and limits the range of possible responses for the receiver. ROBERT O’HARA, Media For the Millions , 1961. 775. His reporting may be ‘straight’ in that it contains no overt expression of approval or disapproval, but his vocal inflections, intonation and significant pauses, as well as his facial expressions, can frequently have the same effect as an editorial comment.

When two cognitions are in a dissonant relation, the person with those two cognitions is said to have dissonance, or to experience dissonance, or to be in a state of dissonance. Dissonance is taken to be an aversive motivational state; persons will want to avoid experiencing dissonance, and if they do encounter dissonance they will attempt to reduce it. DANIEL J. O’KEEFE, Persuasion: Theory and Research , 1990. 778. Admitting that perpetual distrust attends on those who are known to be frequent violators of truth, it seems to me that the liar is, as if he is not.

Words are weapons, and it is dangerous in speculation, as in politics, to borrow them from your enemies. JOSE ORTEGA y GASSET (1883-1955), Obiter Scripta , 1936. 781. The whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought. In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. GEORGE ORWELL (1903-1950), Nineteen Eighty- Four , 1949. 782. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of “politically equal,” or that free had once meant “intellectual free.” GEORGE ORWELL (1903-1950), Nineteen Eighty-Four , 1949. 783.

Propaganda is not only a means by which states and organizations can sustain their power and continuity, but also offers their miniature enemies a means of opposing them, such as the propaganda of direct action, and also, for anyone who can afford a computer, cyber-propaganda. NICHOLAS JACKSON O’SHAUGHNESSY, Politics and Propaganda: Weapons of Mass Seduction , 2004. 785. Much of propaganda works, essentially, by subversion. Never in fact was the word more appropriate, since propaganda will rarely succeed by directly challenging a deeply held belief or value, but rather proceeds by misrepresentation that insinuates the individual’s ideological defences. Gaining agreement with a certain definition and the ideological perspective it illuminates is the key, then perfectly logical arguments can then be deployed (and this essentially is what the activity of spin- doctoring refers to). NICHOLAS JACKSON O’SHAUGHNESSY, Politics and Propaganda: Weapons of Mass Seduction , 2004. 786. In elections where people’s enduring commitments are relevant, political propaganda generally serves merely to reinforce their existing attitudes. But in elections where enduring commitments are not called into play, attitudes and votes are more labile, and political persuasion may have major effects. STUART OSKAMP, Attitudes and Opinions , 1977. 787. Each one of us has a very limited range of experiences which we have actually participated in first- hand. Beyond that range, all of our knowledge, beliefs and attitudes come from others, and the great majority probably come from some mass communication medium (ranging from books to billboards to radio and television). STUART OSKAMP, Attitudes and Opinions , 1977. 788. Advertising depends upon the simple precepts of human persuasion. And these have to do, for the most part, with treating the other party as a unique, important individual letting him recognize your distinct positive identity and starting off by getting him nodding in agreement. JOHN O’TOOLE, The Trouble With Advertising , 1981. 789. Political commercials encourage the deceptive, the destructive and the degrading.

Large-scale efforts are being made, often with impressive success, to channel our unthinking habits, our purchasing decisions, and our thought processes by the use of insights gleaned from psychiatry and the social sciences.

Psychological warfare in itself is not a policy, but an instrument. There are things it cannot do. It cannot, in the long run, get away with systemic falsehoods.

Getting repeated justifications from news laws harmonizing with their doctrines, political enthusiasts and unwise philanthropists push their agitations with growing confidence and success.

NORTHCOTE PARKINSON, Left Luggage , 1967. 804. Psychologically, a catch-phrase often plays the part of a cigarette or a pipe in times of fear or nervousness, in periods of stress or distress. In a world momentarily or temporarily strange or bewildering or hostile or dangerous it serves the ordinary person, you and me and the other fellow, much as a floating spar does a shipwrecked mariner or as, to a lonely traveler, a known face glimpsed in a foreign land.

Media agendas have a strong impact on those low in political involvement, the segment of the population that has little interest in politics. Lacking the motivation and perhaps the skills to process political information deeply, these citizens take their cues from the media and accept journalists’ views of what is most important. RICHARD M. PERLOFF, Political Communication: Politics, Press, and Public in America , 1998. 814. The media frame issues in a variety of ways. The news media may accept, reject, or questions the frames that policymakers employ to interpret events.

DR ERIK PEPPER, quoted in Four Arguments For The Elimination of Television , 1978. 818. The music that is used to enhance a religious is an appropriate tool. It is music as propaganda.

American society is perhaps the best example of a social in which direct coercion is at a minimum.

Never before have such pervasive and ubiquitous means of communication existed; never before has public opinion been so completely at the mercy of whoever may control the instrument. THEODORE B. PETERSON, et. al, The Mass Media and Modern Society , 1965. 823. Those who wish to control opinions and beliefs turn less to physical force that to mass persuasion in the form of news and views and entertainment. hey use the advertising campaign and public c- relations programs instead of the threat of the firing squad or the concentration camp. THEODORE B. PETERSON, et. al, The Mass Media and Modern Society , 1965. 824. Have you ever wondered why the first 60 degree F day after a bitterly cold winter seems quite warm, but the first 60 degree F day after an intensely hot summer seems rather cool? Clearly, how we judge something depends upon what we are comparing it to. Our evaluations of social objects are also affected by our comparison points. ... In other words, how positive or negative something feels or how it is rated on some attitude scale depends upon what our frame of reference is. RICHARD E. PETTY & JOHN T. CACIOPPO, Attitudes and Persuasion: Classic and Contemporary Approaches , 1996. 825.

PETTY & JOHN CACIOPPO, Attitudes and Persuasion: Classic and Contemporary Approaches , 1996. 826. Because people are often persuaded by the arguments that others in a group discussion generate, an interesting may occur as a result of a face-to-face discussion – group polarization . That is, people’s attitudes after group discussion are often more extreme than the attitudes held prior to discussion. RICHARD E. PETTY & JOHN CACIOPPO, Attitudes and Persuasion: Classic and Contemporary Approaches, 1996. 827. To make their messages more credible, warriors often use “gray propaganda.” By influencing media outlets in a target country, a government can launder the origins of its messages and make them appear to come from neutral sources.

Their constant yelping about a free press means, with a few honorable exceptions, freedom to peddle scandal, crime, sex, sensationalism, hate, innuendo and the political and financial uses of propaganda.

In [Soviet] antireligious films of the postwar period, for example, Catholicism was singled out for particular abuse. In Conspiracy of the Doomed (1950), a Catholic Cardinal directs a gang of murderers, spies, and saboteurs.

[Propaganda] is a manipulation designed to lead you to a simplistic conclusion rather than a carefully considered one. It is an abuse of persuasion techniques because it tries to short-circuit critical scrutiny, thoughtful evaluations and counter-arguments. ANTHONY PRATKANIS, New York Times , 27 October 1992. 846. Modern propaganda promotes the use of the peripheral route to persuasion and is designed to take advantage of the limited processing abilities of the cognitive miser. The characteristics of modern persuasion – the message-dense environment, the thirty-second ad, the immediacy of persuasion – make it increasingly more difficult to think deeply about important issues and decisions. ANTHONY PRATKANIS and ELLIOT ARONSON, Age of Propaganda , 1991. 847. The power of guilt to convince and persuade stems, as with most emotional appeals, from its power to direct our thoughts and to channel our energies. When we feel guilty we typically pay little attention to the cogency of the argument, to the merits of a suggested course of action. Instead, out thoughts and actions are directed to removing the feeling of guilt -- to somehow making things right or doing the right thing. We fall into the rationalization trap. ANTHONY PRATKANIS and ELLIOT ARONSON, The Age of Propaganda , 1991. 848. Globalized television and the Internet have created new spheres of public involvement – “virtual” communities – organized around various form of simulation. Given the increased opportunities for manipulation of mass opinion through propaganda, such forces reflect the art of directed simulation and the propagation of illusion. RAY PRATT, Projecting Paranoia: Conspiratorial Visions in American Film, 2001. 849. Television seems to confirm the “reality” of events, which do not seem to have occurred unless shown on television. Thus, by maintaining control over what is “on” television, the public sense of reality is manipulated. ... The content is selected by anonymous individuals from a large and unknown subset of information, according to principles which the audience remain unaware of. RAY PRATT, Projecting Paranoia: Conspiratorial Visions in American Film , 2001. 850. The press is the most powerful means for the Communist upbringing of the masses, for the strengthening of their socialist consciousness, speeding up the forward movement of Soviet society, and increasing the sources of its power and glory. The press should inculcate in the people an unwavering and courageous spirit and unyielding faith in our great endeavor. PRAVDA, Soviet Press Day, 1947, quoted in To Win The Minds of Men (Peter Grothe), 1958. 851. Once the point was firmly grasped that the real function of censorship was not so much the removal of particular shots but the creation of the desired ‘balance’ with in an apparently unimpeded and unguided flow of information, the full potential of the British news media could be mobilized for war service.

As far as the press was concerned, the point is that the British system of pre-censorship as opposed to post-censorship , and that it sought to achieve its aims in the first instance by cooperation rather than confrontation with those who produced the newspapers.

NICHOLAS PRONAY, in Propaganda, Politics and Film: 1918-1945 (Nicholas Pronay & D. W. Spring), 1982. 853. Each generation writes its own history of the world. This is not because of any pernicious desire to case aside the worldview of their fathers and mothers or even to rewrite history more to their liking! Although these motives may not be totally absent, each generation creates a history differing in significant details from previous versions principally because they came of age under a new set of circumstances. DAVID PROTESS & MAXWELL McCOMBS, Agenda Setting: Readings on Media, Policymaking and Public Opinion , 1991. 854. A journalist is the lookout on the bridge of the ship of state.

He is there to watch over the safety and welfare of the people who trust him. JOSEPH PULITZER, The North American Review, 1904. 855. In Europe we felt that our enemies, horrible and deadly as they were, were still people. But over here [the Pacific] I soon gathered that the Japanese were looked upon as something subhuman or repulsive; the way some people feel about cockroaches or mice.

Given a greatly expanded franchise, with its corollary of the need to base authority on the support of public opinion, political society invited the attention of the professional controller of public opinion. TERRENCE H. QUALTER, Propaganda and Psychological Warfare , 1962. 857. The cliché thus becomes, not a mark of laziness or ignorance, but an essential tool in newspaper communication. Carefully selected, it will almost automatically elicit the desired response from the casual reader. ... The constant repetition of the same phrases to cover certain situations or to convey certain situations saves the reader the effort of thought and interpretation. TERRENCE H. QUALTER, Propaganda and Psychological Warfare , 1962, 858. Any act of promotion can be propaganda only if and when it becomes part of a deliberate campaign to influence action through influencing attitudes. Once it is established that any statement book, poster or rumor, any parade or exhibition, any statue or historic monument, any scientific achievement or abstract of statistics, whether true or false, rational or irrational in appeal or presentation, originates as the deliberate policy of someone trying to control or alter attitudes, then that thing or activity becomes part of a propaganda process.

Whereas democracy is built upon the assumption that “the people” are capable of rational self- governance, propagandists regard rationality as in obstacle to efficient indoctrination. Since propaganda is often aimed at persuading people to do things that are not in their own best interests, it often seeks to by pass the rational brain altogether and manipulate us on a more primitive level, appealing to emotional symbolism. SHELDON RAMPTON & JOHN STAUBER, Weapons of Mass Deception , 2003. 861. A statement is true or false if what is said to be correspondence to what actually exists or is. ... Someone is being truthful when what they say, they believe to be true. If they intend to deceive, they are not being truthful – they are lying. ... The liar pretends that circumstances are other than they are. MAUREEN RAMSAY, “Justifications For Lying In Politics,” in The Politics of Lying: Implications for Democracy (Cliffe & Ramsay), 2000. 862. The public can be subject of governments ‘manufacturing consent’, a process of managing and orchestrating information received by the public so as to set and limit agendas and color opinions. They can be deceived by other forms of institutionalized lying, by misinformation, the distribution of official lies to give a misleading account of the truth; or by disinformation, the spreading of false information to conceal the truth. Rather than an explicit lie being told, the truth can be evaded by manipulating information and presenting it in such a way so as to disguise a problem from public view. MAUREEN RAMSAY, “Justifications for Lying in Politics,” in The Politics of Lying: Implications for Democracy (Cliffe & Ramsay), 2000. 863. In addition to setting the issue agenda and telling us what criteria to use to evaluate the candidates, the media also influence our perceptions of which candidates merit considerations. There is little doubt that people learn about the candidates through the media. This learning in turn has impact on perceptions and eventually on the choices voters make at the polls. GRAHAM P. RAMSDEN, “Media Coverage of Issues and Candidates,” Political Science Quarterly 111 (1996). 864. [British Prime Minister Stanley] Baldwin’s technique was above all that of keeping his message simple, speaking for the most part in short sentences and always in easy vocabulary. He could therefore establish a rapport with the audience even when it was invisible; there was little danger that the message would go over the viewers’ heads, or that his main thrust would be left unclear. This was especially important in newsreels... J. A. RAMSEY, “Baldwin and Film,” in Propaganda, Politics and Film: 1918-45 (Nicholas Pronay and D. W. Spring), 1982. 865. The abuse of language occurs when its metaphorical nature is hidden, if the representation is identified with the thing represented. Therefore the linguistically hygienic use of metaphor depends on the full recognition of its limitations, that is, on critical consciousness of the generalizations, analogies, and abstractions involved. ANATOLE RAPOPORT, Operational Philosophy , 1953. 866. Metaphor...is the synthesis of several units of observation into one commanding image; it is the expression of a complex idea, not by analysis, nor by abstract statement, but by a sudden perception of an objective relation.

NICHOLAS REEVES, The Power of Film Propaganda: Myth or Reality , 1999. 870. Of the films that did reach that mass audience, those that were positively received were almost always films that confirmed and reinforced existing ideas and attitudes – films that set out to challenge and change those ideas and attitudes were almost entirely unsuccessful.

The story of wartime manipulation of the masses by propaganda has been told elsewhere; the important fact for modern times is that the skillful propaganda methods of wartime have been made a part of the regular peacetime policy of nations.

Where Jacksonian rhetoric differed from Jeffersonian language was in its intimacy and its accessibility.

Objectivity is most valuable, most indispensable when people need a fair description of what’s going on in order to engage in a purposeful activity.

Owing to its concrete, personal, and emotional flavor, this biased sample of information is easy retrievable from memory and therefore exerts a disproportionate influence on our judgments and decisions.

JOHN RUSCIO, “Risky Business: Vividness, Availability, and the Media Paradox,” Skeptical Inquirer , March/April 2000. 904. Events must be somewhat unusual in order to be considered newsworthy, but the very fact of their appearance in the news leads us to overestimate their frequency of occurrence.

BERTRAND RUSSELL (1872-1970), The Conquest of Happiness , 1936. 911. The formal conventions – narrative closure, image continuity, nonreflexive camera, character identification, voyeuristic objectification, frame balance, realist intelligibility, etc. – help to instill ideology by creating an illusions that what happens on the screen is a neutral recording of objective events, rather than a construct operating from a certain point of view. MICHAEL RYAN & DOUGLAS KELLNER, Camera Politica: The Politics and Ideology of Contemporary Hollywood Film , 1988. 912. The political stakes of film are thus very high because film is part of a broader system of cultural representation which operates to create psychological dispositions that result in a particular construction of social reality, a commonly held sense of what the world is and ought to be that sustains social situations. This conception of the role of film necessitates expanding the traditional Marxist notion of ideology... MICHAEL RYAN & DOUGLAS KELLNER , Camera Politica: The Politics and Ideology of Contemporary Hollywood Film , 1988. ~S~ 913. Your side disseminates information, deals with the issues, communicates the facts, publicizes the truth, gets the message to the people; the other side engages in pseudo events, puffer, deliberate distortion, the big lie, smoke screens, media hype, and propaganda. WILLIAM SAFIRE, Safire’s New Political Dictionary , 1993. 914. One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It is simply too painful to acknowledge--even to ourselves--that we’ve been so credulous. So the old bamboozles persist as the new bamboozles arise. CARL SAGAN (1934-1996), “The Fine Art of Baloney Detection,” Parade , 1 February 1987. 915.

GIORGIO SANTILLANA, The Origins of Scientific Thought , 1961. 918. Isolation [is] probably the most terrifying of all human experiences. Primitive societies have always recognized this terror. Isolation or ostracism, means death to them and they use it to punish offenders. The custom -- and the dread as well -- survives in our prison mores where to be put “in solidarity” is the severest punishment meted out to criminals. MILTON R. SAPERSTEIN, Paradoxes of Everyday Life , 1955. 919. Languages are more to us than systems of thought transference.

If we lose the words, may we not also lose the feelings and emotions they represent. JOSE SARAMAGO, Financial Times , 9 January 1999. 921. Human beings think, perceive, imagine, and make moral choices according to narrative structures. Present two or three pictures, or descriptive phrases, to a person and he she will connect them to form a story, an account that related the picture or meanings of the phrases in some patterned way. T. SARBIN, Narrative Psychology: The Storied Nature of Human Conduct , 1986. 922. Through words, sounds and pictures, the various media produce a likeness of the “real” world. Through a process of mediation, they re -present the world to an audience. This re- presentation of reality is apparently similar to the way in which we interpret the world and create meaning for ourselves through our own physical senses. By constructing a representation of reality, the media constructs meanings about the world. ZIAUDDIN SARDAR & BORIN VAN LOON, Introducing Media Studies , 2000. 923. Agenda Setting: the need to tie up news with political agenda and the pressure to manufacture social issues. Even “established facts” are filtered through a number of processes. Facts and impartiality are always at loggerheads with ideology. Most newspapers present their “facts” through their chosen political filters. ZIAUDDIN SARDAR & BORIN VAN LOON, Introducing Media Studies , 2000. 924. [Propaganda] must be perceived as satisfying basic needs and wishes or as solving underlying frustrations and anxieties...E ffective propaganda harmonizes with already existing values, attitudes and opinions... When a situation is confused and ambiguous, propaganda which clarifies it is likely to be accepted. S. STANSFIELD SARGENT, Social Psychology , 1950. 925. Public opinion refers to the beliefs and attitudes held by the members of a sizable group with respect to a particular issue. It rests in considerable part upon the existing opinions and attitudes of individuals, which frequently become stereotyped through interaction with others. S. STANSFIELD SARGENT, Social Psychology , 1950. 926. The moment a word pr phrase begins to rise in public value, a variety of interest groups seek either to destroy its reputation or, more often, to co-0pt it. In this latter case they don’t necessarily adopt the meaning of the word or phrase. They simply want control of it in order to apply a different meaning that suits their own purposes. JOHN RALSTON SAUL, The Doubter’s Companion , 1994. 927.

STEPHEN SCHAFER, The Political Criminal: The Problem of Morality and Crime , 1974. 928. The system operates largely through processes of which people are unaware. Stratification and isolation and segregation are to a great extent the unconscious or semiconscious by-products of the way the social system operates to organize the community. ...T he point is that the process is automatic, unconscious, and thoughtless. People reconcile their democratic faith and their undemocratic behavior by remaining comfortably unaware of the inconsistency of theory and practice. E. E. SCHATTSCHNEIDER, The Semisovereign People , 1975. 929. The threats of sanction and the ideals of the institution are often incongruent.... Institutions traditionally place regulations and restriction on mobility and conduct of members.... Members of the institution are indoctrinated to believe these selected ideas, so that information is more carefully controlled than it is in a network of peers or friends. And...a particular institution [may use] procedures that scapegoat factions and individuals for contextual problems. ALBERT E. SCHEFLEN, MD, Body Language and Social Order: Communication as Behavioral Control , 1972. 930. This scapegoating mechanism can be used for the control of institutional members, for the usurpation of political power, and for the exclusion and control of “undesirables.” Since being blamed can be such a frightful experience, even the threat of its occurrence serves to control the behavior of members. ALBERT E. SCHEFLEN, Body Language and Social Order: Communication as Behavioral Control , 1972. 931. Brainwashing is more than a scareword. It is also a strangely attractive idea. ... We do not want to confront Pogo’s famous insight, “We have met the enemy and he is us”. How much more comforting to thing, “We have met the enemy and he is Satan” or “she is a witch.”... Thus the idea of brainwashing paralyses thought because it places responsibility somewhere else. ALAN W. SCHEFLIN & EDWART M. OPTON, JR., The Mind Manipulators , 1978. 932. There is a world of difference in the content of what is transmitted in religious orders, prisons, educational institutions, mental hospitals and thought reform centers. But there are striking similarities in the manner in which influence occurs. EDGAR SCHEIN, Coercive Persuasion , 1961. 933. The creative process of charismatic imaging is as timeless as projection; it is something that has been intuitively known to mankind long before radio and television, projected as it always has been onto certain public figures through the available media of any historical period... IRVINE SCHIFFER, Charisma , 1973. 934. The opinion poll is a social invention that cannot be considered apart from the institutional web in which it functions. In American society today, this means that opinion survey, however scientifically conceived, is first and foremost an instrument designed for political ends. HERBERT I. SCHILLER, The Mind Managers , 1973. 935. Polling presents itself as a means of registering opinions and expressing choices but, in reality and as it has worked to date, it is a choice-restricting mechanism. Because ordinary polls reduce, and sometimes eliminate entirely, the meaningful context that provides the true spectrum of possible options, the possibilities and preferences they express are better viewed as “guided” choices. HERBERT I. SCHILLER, The Mind Managers , 1973. 936. Myths are used to dominate people.

HERBERT I. SCHILLER, The Mind Managers, 1973. 937. For manipulation to be most effective, evidence of its presence should be nonexistent. When the manipulated believe things are the way they are naturally and inevitably, manipulation is successful. In short, manipulation requires a false reality that is a continuous denial of its existence. ... It is essential, therefore, that people who are manipulated believe in the neutrality of their key social institutions. They must believe that government, the media, education, and science are beyond the clash of conflicting social interests. HERBERT I. SCHILLER, The Mind Managers , 1973. 938. The insurgent terrorist news promoter, as source of news, has at times considerable influence on the way the media report his actions. Yet his opponents, the government and the security forces, are in fact the main sources for the media. A. SCHMIDT & J. DeGRAFF, Violence in Communication , 1982. 939. There is no absurdity so palpable but that it may be firmly planted in the human head if you can only begin to inculcate it before the age of five, by constantly repeating it with an air of great solemnity. ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER (1783-1860), Parerga and Paralipomena , 1851. 940. The cognitive delimiting created by myth can have a very negative result in blocking rational inquiry and the understanding of change. By using myth to elicit a largely emotional response, political leaders can seek to block reform of soften the impact of a change in circumstances. ... But there is a stage beyond this, where a political elite deploys myth in order to preserve its power by erecting barriers to comprehension, by stressing myth to ensure that its actions cannot be challenged because the means of making that challenge are not there. GEORGE SCHOPFLIN, Myths and Nationhood (Geoffrey Hosking & George Schopflin (eds), 1997. 941. One secret of effective communication is the ability to keep one’s language within the level of abstraction that the audience can handle and to very the levels of abstraction within it so that the more abstract are built on a concrete base and the reader or listener can move easily from and simple and homely image to an abstract proposition or summary and back again if necessary. WILBUR SCHRAMM, Men, Messages and Media: A Look at Human Communication , 1973. 942. [The conditions for success in communication are] 1.) The message must be so designed and delivered as to get the attention of the intended destination. 2.) The message must employ signs which refer to experience common to source and destination. 3.) The message must arouse personality needs in the destination and suggest some ways to meet those needs. 4.) The message must suggest a way to meet those needs which is appropriate to the group situation in which the destination finds himself at the time when he is moved to make the desired response. WILBUR SCHRAMM, The Process and Effects of Mass Communication , 1955. 943. The theory of Agenda-Setting is based on two ideas -- that the media are necessarily gatekeepers for reporting the news of the world ... and, secondly, that people feel a continuing need for orientation to the complex world of politics. WILBUR SCHRAMM and WILLIAM E. PORTER, Men, Women, Messages and Media , 1982. 944. Although few people admit to being greatly influenced by ads, surveys and sales figures show that a well-designed advertising campaign...works below the level of conscious awareness and it works even on those who claim immunity to its message.

MICHAEL SCHUDSON, Advertising, the Uneasy Persuasion: It’s Dubious Impact on American Society, 1984. 947. Political advertising involves tuning in on attitudes and beliefs of the voter and then affecting these attitudes with the proper auditory and visual stimuli. ... Commercials that attempt to tell the listener something are inherently not as effective as those that attach to something that is already in him. We are not concerning with getting things across to people as much as out of people. Electronic media are particularly effective tools in this regard because they provide us with direct access to people’s minds. T. SCHWARTZ, The Responsive Chord , 1973. 948. No area can match religion in its reliance on “ethos” to establish the credibility of a person, or to compel belief in a specific creed or course of action. ... This kind of lunacy is so pervasive it’s impossible to describe the limitless deceptions that feed on it, in our social, business or political activities. So, if your maneuver can be married to some aspect of religious ethos, even if only marginally legitimate, you have in invaluable aid. SYDNEY C. SCHWEITZER, Winning With Deception and Bluff , 1979. 949. Use percentages whenever you can. They have the Largest Manipulative Potential. Percentages have a responsibility all their own. “Six out of ten” conveys the message, but “60%” is more impressive, more authoritative, hinting of research and analytical study. SYDNEY C.

Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive. WALTER SCOTT (1771-1832), Marmion. 953. The central implication of the agenda-setting approach is that the media can make certain political symbols salient, and in that way determine which predisposition form the basis of voter choice. DAVID SEARS, “Political Psychology,” The Annual Review of Psychology, 38 , 1987. 954. Political symbols often evoke and mobilize human emotions. Virtually every American war has been fought around such rallying symbols. ... Symbols are particularly useful for distinguishing the bad guys from the good guys. ... When presented to us ... political symbols rivet our attention and evoke strong emotions. Usually, I will argue, it is emotion based on some enduring predisposition rather than on the tangible costs and benefits of the matters to which the symbol refers.

SELNOW, in “Polls and Computer Technologies: Ethical Considerations,” in Ethical Dimensions of Political Communication (Robert E. Denton, Jr., ed), 1991. 959. Voter manipulation is a product of political agenda setting. When we set the agenda – when we tell people what to think about – we direct attention to an issue of our choosing. ... Agenda setting is an important component of the persuasion process because it both focuses and distracts the attention, and thereby affects the priorities. GARY W.

Are you aware that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert ?

Wish-fulfillment in magical thought, then, involves the operation of a generalized power which can, in its most extreme form, make any wish come true.

This has evidently been the fate of the word “democracy.” It has come to mean whatever anyone wants it to mean. BERNARD SMITH, The American Spirit , 1941. 984. Propaganda is essentially different from education. The purpose of education is to develop an individual who will maintain suspended judgment until the evidence is all in and to give him a range of knowledge that will enlarge the outlook of his mind.

If one man argues one way, we seem duty bound to get somebody, whether he’s right or wrong, who will argue the opposite.

HOWARD K. SMITH (1914-2002), Columbia Journalism Review , Fall 1965. 987. The primary characteristic of propaganda is its reliance on irrational techniques of persuasion. ... For present purposes, a technique will be considered irrational if it serves to induce belief in an audience without providing independent support for that belief. Put somewhat differently, a technique is irrational if it produces a claim that cannot survive the unrestricted critical scrutiny of reasonable men. TED J. SMITH, III, Moscow Meets Main Stre e t , 1982. 988. The crudest form of suggestion is name-calling , which offers not proof for a claim but a mere label. For example, by calling someone a “scoundrel” the audience is encouraged to believe that he is one, although no evidence of this has been provided. A common positive variant of this is the technique of role reference, which describes a person in terms of one of his marginal roles in hopes that the audience will falsely ascribe the assumed characteristics of that role to the person. TED J. SMITH, III, “Techniques of Deception,” in Propaganda: A Pluralistic Perspective (Ted J. Smith, ed), 1989. 989. The multiplying forms of information may well spawn disinformation more insidious than any we have yet known.

The point is that, in the end, there is no real moral or political distinction between the small lies and the large, the false quotes and the false policies.

The Nazis do not attach any intrinsic value and any stable meaning to the ideas which according to their claims are important to them.

[T]he conscious decision not to emulate Goebbels cost the [Roosevelt] administration nothing. Americans were not asked to overcome their natural suspicion of official pronouncements, but only to form their own judgments based on “ facts ” supplied them in the most palatable forms from the most credible sources. ... At its most successful, during the international crisis of 1941-1941, the administration’s efforts produced a propaganda din so pervasive so diverse in its sources that by the end of 1941 it had become an unexceptional element of daily life. RICHARD W. STEELE, Propaganda in an Open Society: The Roosevelt Administration and the Media, 1933-1941 , 1985. 1001. [Pro-war] propaganda was extensive but not excessively intrusive.

STEELE, Propaganda in an Open Society: The Roosevelt Administration and the Media, 1933-1941 , 1985. 1002. [Pro-war] propaganda could not be left to speechmakers, journalists, ideologues, politicians, or the others associated with the craft in the past.

What is the difference between unethical and ethical advertising? Unethical advertising uses falsehoods to deceive the public, ethical advertising uses truth to deceive the public. VILHJALMUR STEFANSSON (1879-1962), “Discovery,” 1964. 1005. Euphemism is a deft, elusive, and powerful trickster we use to deceive ourselves, to hide our own motives and feelings from ourselves. It is an evasion we make to look like directness. HOWARD F. STEIN, Euphemism, Spin and the Crisis in Organizational Life , 1998. 1006. Part of the sinister work of euphemism is that we are so much in its thrall that we are certain we are talking about reality, when we are in fact talking about our imagination we have legislated into reality. Through euphemism, we replace, we override and reinvent reality, by the magic of language. HOWARD F. STEIN, Euphemism, Spin and The Crisis in Organizational Life , 1998. 1007.

It is in the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that it assimilates everything to itself as proper nourishment, and, from the first moment of begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by everything you see, hear, read, or understand. LAURENCE STERNE (1713-1768), Tristam Shandy . 1011. Slogans, with us for centuries, act as social symbols and symbolic justifications. Social movements employ them to create impressions, to alter perceptions, to elicit emotional responses, to make demands, and to pressure oppositions. The ambiguity of slogans enable them to serve as verbal bridges from one meaning to another... They simplify complex problems, solutions, and situations while demanding instant corrective actions, many slogans are unique to and readily identifiable with specific social movements or social movement organizations. CHARLES J. STEWART, et. al., Persuasion and Social Movements , 1989. 1012. Every social movement identifies one or more devils and then heaps abuse upon them in the form of name-calling, ridicule, negative associations, and metaphors. Special invective is heaped upon individuals who refuse to support the movement that is fighting for them. CHARLES J. STEWART, et. al., Persuasion and Social Movements , 1989. 1013.

Over the long run, if people are repeatedly bombarded with observations concerning their inconsistent opinions and actions, and if they are eventually convinced that such observations are essentially correct, then their psychological need for consistence will likely cause them to make some changes in the way they thing and act.

Depending on the circumstances, we can also perceive a lie as a sign of contempt – the liar has decided we do not deserve to know the truth – or, in milder cases, of a high-handed decision that we do not need to know what is really going on and are better off without knowing. EVELYN SULLIVAN, The Concise Book of Lying, 2001. 1020. The lies most likely to be successful must not only be believable; they must also take advantage of the prejudices, weaknesses, and fears of those lied to.

Integration propaganda suggests that all is well with the world, and that one should accept one’s society and participate passively within it. Most integration propaganda is covert. It must be constantly present if a technological society is to function smoothly. GEORGE H. SZANTO, Theater & Propaganda , 1978. 1025.

As the base rhetorician uses language to increase his own power, to produce converts to his own cause, and to create loyal followers of his own person – so the noble rhetorician uses language to wean men away from their inclination to depend on authority, to encourage them to think and speak clearly, and to teach them to be their own masters. THOMAS SZASZ, Psychiatrist. ~T~ 1028. Propaganda is often most fully discussed in counter-propaganda. Denouncing the other’s devious techniques and lack of credibility, while displaying similar methods, makes this a paradoxical and in some ways self-undermining process.

The information mill seems to churn even faster these days, and with little regard to the validity of the “facts,” which, whether true or false, can sometimes have devastating effects. For example, a politician’s off-hand comments about an opponent can be transmitted via television to tens of millions of homes within hours, thus creating a serious campaign issue; a stock rumor heard in New York can reach Tokyo in seconds...

To the academician, the language of the reporter is excessively casual, trivializing, and simple- minded, if not downright wrong or silly.

GEORGE E. TAYLOR, “Rearming With Ideas,” Virginia Quarterly Review , Spring 1951. 1035. We must remove the mystique of the ‘hidden persuaders’ so that we can realize how our perceptions are being influenced by them. The medium should not necessarily be the message, although it is in danger of becoming increasingly so. We therefore need to understand how the medium actually works, how it actually functions in mediating information and opinions between one section of society and another. PHILIP M. TAYLOR, Munitions of the Mind: A History of Propaganda From The Ancient World to the Present Day . 1995. 1036. Propaganda ... forces us to think and do things in ways we might not otherwise have done had we been left to our own devices. It obscures our windows on the world by providing layers of distorting condensation. When Nations fight, it thickens the fog of war. Propaganda thus becomes the enemy of independent thought and an intrusive and unwanted manipulator of the free flow of information and ideas... It suggests the triumph of emotion over reason in a bureaucratic struggle by the machinery of power for control over the individual. PHILIP M. TAYLOR, Munitions of the Mind: A History of Propaganda From The Ancient World To The Present Day , 1995. 1037. Whenever there is an organized movement to persuade people to believe or do something, whenever an effort is made to “propagate” a creed or set of opinions or convictions or to make people act as we want them to act, the means employed are called propaganda. EDWARD A. TENNEY, A Primer For Readers , 1942. 1038. Some things you do not do unless you are intent on failing. You don’t insult your audience, but you may kid it; you don’t patronize it or talk down to it; you don’t apologize to it for your convictions; you don’t whine about being “misunderstood”; you don’t beg for favor. You assume and may occasionally appeal to an audience’s spirit of fair play, its sporting instinct, its desire to know what you think. You seek a point of contact... Be sure of your facts and be very sparing in imputing to your opponents base motives. In the minds of some men, honest, well-supported denunciation may stick and bring forth later fruit. NORMAN THOMAS (1884-1968), Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen , 1955. 1039. The goal of persuasion is to generate voluntary compliance. ... The great communicators have that art. They somehow get people to do what they want them to do by getting them to want to do it. ... What force options are available to generating voluntary compliance? The first, surprisingly enough, is your mere presence: the way you show up, the way you approach, carry yourself, stand around, even the way you project your feelings onto your face. GEORGE J. THOMPSON, Verbal Judo , 1993. 1040. Here then is the powerful sentence that will allow you to interrupt anyone without fear of bodily harm: “Let me be sure I heard what you just said.” This simple sentence is so empathetic, so full of conciliation and cooperation, so pregnant with sincerity, that you’ll hardly ever see someone let it slide by. GEORGE J. THOMPSON, Verbal Judo , 1993. 1041. In the case of propaganda using purely rational material the style is factual, information or logical, and the act of persuasion lies mainly in the selection of facts favorable to the argument and the leaving out or discounting of those which are not. ... The purely emotional [style of propaganda] relies on the use of subjective ideas projected with a high level of emotive force accompanied probably by an exploitation of some or all of the techniques of event management.

Propaganda is deliberate promotion, usually emotional, by an individual or a group, using any form of communication, to create, change or control the attitudes and actions of others.

Selection by False Emphasis – Someone or something is selected and then given too much or too little importance by receiving too much or too little newspaper space or radio-television time.

Neutralization, however, is rare because our society is constructed so as to provide every person with consecutive waves of relatively like-minded associates. HANS TOCH, The Social Psychology of Social Movements , 1966. 1048. All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation out to know that war is the surest and the shortest means to accomplish it. This is the first axiom of the science. ALEXIS de TOCQUEVILLE (1805-1859), Democracy in America , 1935. 1049. There are times when it is to the advantage of a communicator to encourage cognitive responses, and times when it is not. If the message is a strong one and the audience is generally well disposed to the message, the speaker should encourage message-related thinking because it is likely to lead to attitude change. If, however, the message is a weak one and the audience is hostile, it may be to the advantage of the communicator to inhibit cognitive response. One way this can be done is through distraction. When competing stimuli distract receivers, they have trouble coming up with counterarguments, and are thus more likely to accept the speaker’s message. ... [A] heckler might actually help out a speaker whose audience is hostile. SARAH TRENHOLM, Persuasion and Social Influence , 1989. 1050. The most powerful forms of social control maybe found not in dramatic coercive situations, but in everyday institutions that shape our lives: family, community, school, church. SARAH TRENHOLM, Persuasion and Social Influence , 1989. 1051. The most important thing to realize about systems of animal communication is that they are not expected to be systems for the dissemination of truth. Instead, they are expected to be systems by which individual organisms attempt to maximize their fitness by communicating to others things that may be true or false.

The prevailing explanation of the cognitive mechanism behind agenda setting is currently framed in terms of the “activation” of cognitive constructs in memory (sometimes called “nodes”) in response to media messages.

At the extreme, the process of stereotyping eventuates in dehumanization: the enemy is judged to be so inhumanely evil or contemptible that anything may be done to “it” without subjectively compromising one’s own humanity and sense of loyalty. AUSTIN J. TURK, Political Criminality , 1982. 1055.

During the early 1960s it became “in” to suggest that to look at both sides of an issue and probe deeply was old fashioned. The new way of the “new journalism” would be advocacy followed by so- called proof of the original opinion. The trouble in starting with a conclusion is that everybody suspects the facts used to sustain the opinion. THOMAS VAIL, “Editorial,” Cleveland Plain Dealer , 11 February 1973. 1062. A man who wishes to impose his opinions on others is unsure of their value. He has to uphold them by all possible means.

PAUL VALERY (1871-1945), Bad Thoughts and Not So Bad , 1942. 1063. The premises of a rhetorical argument must be chosen so that they have cogency for the audience. By the use of a deductive or inductive syllogism, the conclusion is then also cogent in the eyes of the audience.

Over the last two decades, straightforward advertising has given way to branding – given products and services an emotional dimension with which people can identify. In this way, Singapore and Ireland are no longer merely countries one finds in an atlas. They have become “brand states”, with geographical and political settings that seem trivial compared to their emotional resonance among an increasingly global audience of consumers. A brand is best described as a customer’s ideas about a product, the “brand state” comprises the outside world’s ideas about a particular country. P. Van HAM, “The Rise of the Brand State: The Postmodern Politics of Image and Reputation,” Foreign Affairs , October 2001. 1065. A striking expression, with the aid of a small amount of truth, can surprise us into accepting a falsehood, MARQUIS de VAUVENARGUES (1715-1747), Reflections and Maxims , 1746. 1066. A liar is a man who does not know how to deceive, a flatterer one who only deceives fools: he alone can pride himself on his cleverness who knows how to make skillful use of the truth. MARQUIS de VAUVENARGUES (1715-1747), Reflections and Maxims , 1746. 1067. When moral crusaders strive to arouse public awareness about a newly recognized social evil, they must be able to offer explanations of the causes of that evil and propose credible ways of getting rid of it. They must cut through the inevitable complexity and ambiguity by framing the problem in a way that can be widely comprehended. Framing the problem sets the evil within a much broader scope of moral concerns. It provides the basic interpretive assumptions through which the evil can be redefined and linked to other social evils in society. JEFFREY S. VICTOR, Satanic Panic , 1993. 1068. The double of a successful career combined with sensational, often decadent pleasure is standard with such women’s magazines as Cosmopolitan . Their advertising and articles show the contemporary social value attached to the two responses of career and consumerism, the crippling strategies of so many. Multinational corporations and government bureaucracies alike need hard- working professional types who are not tied down and are interchangeable across organizations, people who promptly spend their salaries to keep the consumer economy going.

Symbols, however, can be clearly distinguished from other signs. In a symbol-situation intentional communication occurs – there is a speaker as well as a listener, a writer as well as a reader. ...

Using the technique of instrumental (operant) conditioning, a prisoner’s behavior may be modified by rewarding or punishing behavior which may be modified by rewarding or punishing him according to principles laid down by the captors. These principles are not necessarily readily apparent to the captive. For example, a prisoner may be fed only when he talks about the general area in which the interrogators are interested. This way the prisoner “finds it easier” to talk about some topics rather than other. Gradually, imperceptibly, the field is narrowed down so that the prisoner is talking about what the guard wants.

DAVID WELCH, Propaganda and the German Cinema: 1933-1945 , 1983. 1088. Propaganda has its best chance of success when it clearly designates a target as the source of all misery and suffering... One of the most striking means by which the cinema has influenced social attitudes - changing or reinforcing opinions - is through the use of stereotypes...conventional figures that have come to be regarded as representative of particular classes, races, and so on. DAVID WELCH, Propaganda and the German Cinema: 1933-1945, 1983. 1089. Information distortion is the very heart of propaganda.

When the occasion or object in question is not such as calls for, or as it likely to excite in those particular readers or hearers, the emotions required, it is a common rhetorical artifice to turn their attention to some object which will call for these feelings; and when they are too much excited to be capable of judging calmly, it will not be difficult to turn their passions, once roused, in the direction required, and to make then view the case before them in a very different light.

[Public opinion] is an opinion that gradually takes root among a whole people; especially among those who have the most influence when they work together as a group. In this way it wins the upper hand to such an extent that no one meets it everywhere. It is an opinion that without being noticed takes possession of most heads, and even in situations where it does not dare express itself out loud it can be recognized by the louder and louder muffled murmur. It then only requires some small opening that will allow it air, and it will break out with force.

Thus, according to priming theory, the media not only affect the perceived salience of issues, but also influence the degree to which issues are used as criteria to evaluate political leaders...

By Laird Wilcox If it’s a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed? Kahlil Gibran, 1923. Roger Scruton, in the Dictionary of Political Thought defines “extremism” as: 1. Taking a political idea to its limits, regardless of unfortunate repercussions Impracticalities, arguments and feelings to the contrary, and with the intention not only to confront, but to eliminate opposition. 2. Intolerance toward all views other than one’s own. 3. Adoption of means to political ends which show disregard for the life, liberty and human rights of others. A related view is found in the work of Milton Rokeach, whose book The Open and Closed Mind is a classic in the field of dogmatic thinking, prejudgment and intolerance. He observes: To study the organization of belief systems, we find it necessary to concern ourselves with the structure rather than the content of beliefs. The relative openness or closedness of a mind cuts across specific content; that is, it is not uniquely restricted to any particular ideology, or religion, or philosophy. ... Thus, a basic requirement is that the concepts to be employed in the description of belief systems must not be tied to a particular belief system; they must be constructed to apply to all belief systems. These views basically reflect my own experience that political “extremism” in the behavioral sense is much more a matter of style than content. In the forty years I have been studying political groups of the left and right, I have found that many people can hold radical or unorthodox views and still entertain them in a more or less reasonable, rational, and non-dogmatic manner, fully cognizant of honest disagreement among people of good will. On the other hand, I have known people whose views were in the political “mainstream” but who presented them in a shrill, uncompromising, bullying, or distinctly authoritarian manner. The latter exhibited an unambiguous behavioral extremist mentality while the former demonstrated only ideological unorthodoxy, which is hardly to be feared in a free society. The use of “extremist” as an epithet tends to confuse this issue. If the term is to have a legitimate meaning it’s important to be clear on what it is. As used here, it’s taken to mean anyone who exhibits an “extremist” behavioral style, examples of which will be given. What one wants to avoid is the name- 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"calling trap, as in calling someone a “pervert” or a “subversive,” based primarily on the fact that you don’t like them or disagree over some issue. Using emotionally-loaded epithets are characteristic of what one should be trying to avoid. Political ideologues are fully aware of the thought-stopping power of name-calling and labeling, and often attempt one-sided definitions of “extremism” that condemn the views of their political opponents while leaving their equally strident and intolerant behavior untouched. For the term to have any objective meaning, it must apply equally across the board. The late Robert F. Kennedy recognized this when he observed, What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents. An important point here is that the extremist behavioral style is not found only on the statistical fringes of the political or religious spectrum, but sometimes in the “middle” as well. An individual or group that is uncompromisingly “centrist” may be far more dogmatic and prejudiced than someone with more radical or unorthodox views but who expresses them in an open, tolerant and amiable manner. In many years of observing the behavior of political ideologues of the right and left in American politics I have compiled a list of behavioral traits that appear to be commonplace among the more strident, intolerant and dogmatic among them. To the extent that they represented a “threat” to anything, it was through this expressed stridency, intolerance and dogmatism, and most generally in the sense of their incapacity to participate in the rational give and take that democratic systems require. Only in very unusual cases do they represent any sort of physical threat to the general safety. This list has been passed around among other observers of this phenomenon over the years and there’s a general consensus of its general validity. These traits are: 1. The use of slogans, buzzwords, epithets and clichés are common among people of extremist temperament. These devices allow complex issues and problems to be dramatically simplified. Cognitive shortcuts of this kind are useful in order to suppress awareness of troublesome facts and counterarguments and to bolster group solidarity. 2. An emphasis on emotional responses and corresponding devaluation of reasoning and rational analysis is a common extremist trait. Extremists have an unspoken reverence for propaganda and persuasion , which they may call “getting educated” or “consciousness-raising.” Harold D. Lasswell, in his book Psychopathology and Politics says, “The essential mark of the agitator is the high value he places on the emotional responses of the public.” 3. Extremists often practice and openly advocate flagrant double standards . They generally tend to judge themselves and their allies in terms of their intentions, which they view generously, and judge their opponents by their acts, which they view very critically. This is known as the sinister attribution error , referring to the tendency to attribute bad intentions or untrustworthiness to the oppositional other. They want you to accept their claims on faith or authority, but demand strict proof from those of their opponents. They tend to view arguments that call their premises into question as hostile propaganda or provocation but use similar arguments when attacking others. 4. Confusing of mere similarity with essential sameness is a common extremist trait. Hence, for the extremist socialized medicine may be “just like” Communism or the appearance of ethnic pride is “just like” Nazi Germany. Instead of trying to understand complex phenomena in its own context, they tend to associate it with a God word or a Devil word in order to stereotype and reduce cognitive complexity. 5. Extremists often attack the character or reputation of an opponent rather than deal with the more concrete issues and views they present. Through this kind of character assassination or ad hominem attack, they may question motives, qualifications, associations, personality, mental health and so on as a diversion. In some cases these matters may not be entirely irrelevant, but they shouldn’t obscure the issues in question. 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"6. Some extremists tend to identify themselves in terms of their enemies , i.e., who they hate and who hates them. Accordingly, extremists may become emotionally bound to their opponents in a strange symbiotic relationship , where their lives have meaning primarily in terms of conflict and opposition to one another. Because they view their opponents as unprincipled and powerful, they tend, perhaps subconsciously, to emulate them and adopt their tactics. 7. A Manichean worldview tends to characterize many extremists, in which they see the world in terms of absolutes of good and evil, with no middle ground, gray areas or intermediate positions. Issues tend to be framed in a strongly polarized sense of right and wrong, with the “right” position happily coinciding with their interests. All issues tend to become “life and death” issues. Their slogan is “ those who are not for me are against me .” 8. Hypersensitivity and vigilance are hallmarks of the extremist style. They may perceive hostile innuendo in casual comments; imagine hostility and rejection “concealed” in honest disagreement and dissent, and manage to discover “subtle” manifestations of one thing or another in ordinarily innocuous events. 9. An inclination toward groupthink permeates extremist organizations. They are prone to the kind of inward-looking group cohesiveness that Irving Janus discussed in his book, Victims of Groupthink . This involves a strong tendency to conform to group norms and to preserve solidarity at the expense of dealing with conflicting evidence and disquieting observations or criticisms that may call into question their shared assumptions and beliefs of the group. Reality testing is often diminished among extremists. 10. Extremists tend to believe that it’s OK to do what would otherwise be instantly recognized as bad things in the service of a good cause . This may include shouting down speakers, harassment, intimidation, threats, censorship, and even violence in some cases. Defeating heretics, deniers, critics or other “enemies” becomes an all-encompassing goal to which other values become subordinate. In this case, for extremists the end justifies the means . 11. Finally, extremists often have problems tolerating ambiguity and uncertainty . Indeed, the ideologies and belief systems extremists tend to adopt often represent grasping for certainty and absolute truth and security in an uncertain world. The anxiety and uncertainty attendant to making complex decisions and value judgments is overcome by quick decisions based on strong feelings, tradition, patriotism, ideology or some other defining abstraction.

The Protocols of Ritual Defamation How values, opinions and beliefs are controlled in democratic societies . By Laird Wilcox 2002 \"The critical element in political maneuver for advantage is the creation of meaning: the construction of beliefs about the significance of events, of problems, of crisis, of policy changes, and of leaders. The strategic need is to immobilize opposition and mobilize support. While coercion and intimidation help to check resistance in all political systems, the key tactic must always be the evocation of meanings that legitimize favored courses of action...\" MURRAY EDELMAN, \"Political Language and Political Reality,\" PS , Winter 1985. 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"“ At the extreme, the process of stereotyping eventuates in dehumanization: the enemy is judged to be so inhumanly evil or contemptible that anything may be done to “it” without subjectively compromising one’s own humanity and sense of loyalty.” AUSTIN TURK, Political Criminality , 1982. “ Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even especially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts.

Definitions: The term “ protocol ” refers to a set of rules or established method. The term “ ritual ” refers to a predictable, stereotyped pattern that embraces number of elements, as in a ritual. The term “ defamation ” refers to the destruction or attempted destruction of the reputation, status, or standing in the community of a person or group of like-minded persons by deliberately unfair, false, misleading or hateful communication. Defamation might be confused with mere criticism, opposition or expression of opinion, which is necessary for a free society. The essence of a democratic system depends on a large degree of freedom of expression and of give and take in the marketplace of ideas. It is only through the vigorous exploration of alternative explanations and sorting of conflicting facts and competing ideas that wise and reasonably just decisions can take place. Hypersensitive individuals or groups often claim to have been unfairly defamed when they have merely been criticized or challenged with results unsatisfactory to themselves. It is important to differentiate between deliberate ritual defamation on the one hand, and mere criticism and disagreement on the other. For the purposes of this brief essay, the central element is defamation and the necessarily accompanying stigmatization in retaliation for the real or imagined attitudes, opinions or beliefs of the subject, with the intention of silencing or neutralizing his or her influence, and/or making an example of them so as to discourage similar independence and “insensitivity” or non-observance of taboos on the part of others. Ritual defamation differs in nature and degree from simple criticism or disagreement in that it is aggressive, organized, premeditated and skillfully applied with the idea of neutralizing or eliminating an opponent rather than simply refuting or proving him incorrect. Ritual defamation is often performed by an organization or representative of a special interest group. The elements of a Ritual Defamation are these : 1. In a ritual defamation the subject (hereinafter referred to as the \"offender\") must have violated a particular taboo in some way, usually by expressing or identifying with a forbidden attitude, opinion or belief. It is not necessary that he “do” anything about it or undertake any particular course of action, only that they engage in some form of communication or expression. In some cases even that is not necessary, only that they are associated with or \"linked\" to a taboo idea or behavior in some way. It is largely directed against presumed attitudes, opinions or beliefs. 2. The primary method of attack in a ritual defamation is to assail the character of the offender, and never to offer more than a perfunctory challenge to the particular attitudes, opinions or beliefs expressed or implied. Any kind of debate with the offender is absolutely forbidden. The primary tool of ritual defamation is stigmatization through character assassination. 3. An important rule in ritual defamation is to avoid engaging in any kind of debate over the truthfulness or reasonableness of what has been expressed, only to condemn it. To debate the issue opens the issue up for examination and discussion of its merits and to consider the 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"evidence or arguments that may support the forbidden views, which is just what the ritual defamer is trying to avoid. The primary goal of a ritual defamation is censorship and repression and marginalization of the offender. 4. The offender is often somebody in the public eye - someone who is vulnerable to public opinion - although perhaps in a very modest way. It could be a businessman, schoolteacher, public official, newspaper writer, scholar, or merely an outspoken citizen. Visibility enhances vulnerability to ritual defamation. 5. An attempt, often successful, is made to involve others in the ritual defamation. In the case of a public official, other public officials will be urged to denounce the offender. In the case of a student, other students will be called upon to reject and ostracize them, in the case of a teacher, other teachers will be recruited, and so on. 6. In order for a ritual defamation to be effective, the offender must be dehumanized to the extent that he becomes thoroughly identified with the offending attitude, opinion or belief, and in a manner which distorts it to the point where it appears at its most extreme. For example, a victim who is defamed as a “subversive” will be identified with the worst images of subversion, such as espionage, terrorism and treason. An offender defamed as a “pervert” will be identified with the worst images of perversion, including child molestation and rape. An offender defamed as a “racist” or“anti-Semite” will be identified with the worst images of racism or hatred of Jews, such as lynchings or gas chambers. 7. To be maximally successful, a ritual defamation must bring pressure and humiliation on the offender from every quarter, including family and friends. If the offender has schoolchildren, they may be taunted and ridiculed as a consequence of adverse publicity. If the offender is employed they may be ostracized or fired from their job. If the offender belongs to clubs or associations, other members maybe urged to expel them. 8. Ritual defamation is highly symbolic and emotional and is designed to largely bypass rational cognitive processes. In its modern form it is a relatively sophisticated method of focusing hatred through skillful (albeit unprincipled) manipulation of symbols, prejudices and ideas. 9. Any explanation the offender may offer, including the claim of being wronged or misunderstood, is considered irrelevant. To claim truth as a defense for a politically incorrect value, opinion or belief is interpreted as defiance and only compounds the problem. Ritual defamation, it must be emphasized, is not necessarily an issue of being wrong or incorrect about a matter, but rather of “insensitivity” and failing to observe social taboos. An interesting aspect of ritual defamation as a practice is its universality. It is not specific to any value, opinion or belief or to any group or subculture. It may be used against any political, ethnic, national or religious group. It may, for example, be used by anti-Semites against Jews, or by Jews against anti- Semites; by right-wingers against left-wingers, or vice-versa, and so on. The power of ritual defamation lies entirely in its capacity to intimidate and terrorize through the use of stigmatization. It embraces some elements of primitive superstitious behavior, as in placing a “curse” or “hex” upon selected victims. It results in the tainting, labeling or marking of a person as \"impure,\" somehow less than human and as an outcast. It is a tool often used against rebels and dissenters. In totalitarian societies it is a primary means of control. A literary example of ritual defamation is Nathaniel Hawthorn’s novel, The Scarlet Letter, where a young woman was forced to wear a large “A” on her clothing to indicate that she had committed adultery. A 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"historical example might be the witch hunts that occurred in colonial America. A more modern example might be the McCarthy period of the 1950’s, where both Communist and non-Communist leftists were charged with disloyalty and subversion, and recent crusades for “political correctness” in American society have produced a large number of victims unfairly linked to ideas or beliefs they do not hold. Ritual defamation plays into the subconscious fear most people have of being shunned, abandoned or rejected by the tribe or community and its accompanying psychological support systems. For some victims the experience can be terrifying. Only the strongest psyches can survive it undamaged. The weakness of ritual defamation lies in its tendency toward overkill and in its obvious maliciousness. More analytical or reflective citizens might perceive it as bullying, harassment or mere cruelty. Occasionally a ritual defamation will fail because of poor planning and failure to correctly judge the vulnerability of the offender, or because its unprincipled viciousness generates sympathy for them. It is important to recognize and identify the patterns of a ritual defamation. Like virtually all propaganda and disinformation campaigns it is accomplished primarily through the manipulation of meaning and the use of words and symbols that characterize, identify and stigmatize. It is not used to persuade an opponent or to promote an opposing viewpoint but to inflict public punishment and humiliation . Dr. Edward Manner, professor of philosophy at Notre Dame University, observes that “ stigmatization is one of the most oppressive, inhumane forms of punishment any group of human beings can inflict on one of its members .” He notes that it is “ a form of social control a civilized society will use rarely, and only with the greatest of care.” Permission to reprint What is Political Extremism ? and/or The Protocols of Ritual Defamation in full is granted providing no changes are made.

Amon g the rarities in the collection, Mr. Wi lcox said, is a tap e of a pro-Fascist speech by Charles A. Lindbergh in the 1930’ s an d American Com munist documents from the sam e era. He collects his material through his network of con tacts in extremist political move ments an d through read ing their publications, which often have advertisements for books an d tap es. “I’ve bou gh t, been given, or trad ed for all of it,” he said. A stead y stream of students an d researchers used the closed-stack collection, w hich has minimal restriction s. “ It is so far the lead ing collection of its kind; it is extraor dinary,” said Lym an Tow er Sargent, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri in St. Lou is, who has used the collection for a textbook on con temporary political ideologies. Mr. Wi lcox, the son of a con struction accountant who move d his fam ily frequently, has had a near- lifelon g fascination with extremists; he grew up listening to intense political debates between relatives who ran the political ga mut, from socialists to m embers of the Joh n Birch Society. “ Wh y does someon e become a Com munist?” he asks. “Wh y does som eon e becom e a Bircher? Wh at mak es them vu lnerab le to extremist politics – and not necessarily the particular kind they end up with, which really is al most ac cidental?” Mr. Wi lcox , who describes himself as a “classical free-speech liberal,” has a few theories, based on his acquaintan ce with a number of extremists. He says all extremists tak e a political notion to its limits, regar dless of the price they may pay in their person al lives. They brook no op position to their views, often feeling morally superior to others. They also often show a disturbing fon dness for letting the ends justify the m ean s. Despite what he sees as almost a pathetic cast to man y extremists’ lives, he argu es that they are som etimes prop hetic, and that tod ay ’s fringe move ment may be tom orrow ’s mainstream organ ization . “M ost of the social movement that has taken place in the United States in the last century started ou t as being viewed as the work of extremist grou ps,” Mr. W ilcox said. “T he wom en’s move ment, you know , was like a bunch of nuts, a bunch of feminists, suffrage ttes, crackpots, cook s. That’s how they were viewed. 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"“ The civil righ ts move ment was viewed as marginal also, watched by the F.B.I., suspected of all kinds of terrible things,” he said. “Y et these were grou ps that develop ed a sign ificant follow ing that actually attached themselves to legitimate issues.” B2 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1995. Emergence of Extremist Groups Reflects Changing U. S. Society, Researcher says . By Dennis Farney Staff Repor ter of the Wall Street Jou rnal Olathe, Kan . – “E xtremists are the first to sense that society is chan ging – an d, often, the first to get it wrong.” S o says Laird Wi lcox, who ough t to k now . For three decad es now , this intrigu ing m an with the look an d burly build of a m otorcycle rider – h as been studying extremists the way a l epidopterist studies moths. He has interviewed their leaders an d collected their often-paran oid literature. Alon g the way, he fou nded the Wi lcox Collection of Contemporary Political Move ments at the nearby University of Kan sas. I t is one of the largest collection s of extremist literature in the U. S . Eroding Freedom s Now, as a civil libertarian, the 52-year-old Mr. Wi lcox is worried. He fears the grow ing backlash agai nst Oklahom a City’s tragi c bom bing will result in new laws that erod e the freedom s of everyon e. “T his is a fairly typical civil liberties crisis, where a notorious, horrifying crime has been com mitted an d they’re casting a very wide net,” he said. “What I think is goi ng to happen is a civil-liberties rollback from the great gains mad e in the 60s .... Wh at they’re goi ng to do is go back to the FBI of the ‘50s , with all of the abuses that existed then.” Mr. Wi lcox is the first to con cede that his is an unpop ular view, especially now . Violence, of cou rse, can not be tolerated. But violence and perception s are two different things, an d he argues that extremist grou ps aren’t always wrong in their perception s that society is chan ging arou nd them – or that it needs chan ging. Until the ‘60s , after all, man y civil righ ts grou ps were regar ded as extreme for protesting segregation . Extremist grou ps are like the miner’s can ary, the first indicators that the political atmosphere is chan ging. So what kind of chan ge is “the pop ulist righ t,” as he calls it, sensing now . From its perspective, he said, it senses an American society grow ing stead ily less toleran t of low er-middle-class val ues an d lifestyles even as – indeed, precisely becau se – it is growing more toleran t of gays , of careerist women, of nonsmok ers in restau ran ts, of endan gered species. “There has been a reversal of roles,” he said. “T he left is becom ing the law an d order group in society.” 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"As a case in point, he said civil-righ ts attorney Morris Dees was the first to prop ose tighter security law s in the wak e of the Oklahoma City bom bing. Now, in som ething rare, President Clinton , Newt Gingrich an d Orrin Hatch seem to have united in a push to tigh ten security law s; indeed, a kind of political bidding war seems to be in its early stage s. “ Wh at I think the militias picked up on is that there are huge chan ges com ing in society,” he said. One is a growing “intoleran ce” of dissent – from the left as well as the righ t. Another is the grow ing role of wom en in politics: wom en are more alarmed by gu n ownership than men, and their con cern is being tran slated into law s that gon e ow ners find threatening. Still an other is the grow ing erosion of the importan ce of nation al boundaries by the ever-more-importan t global econ om y. All these trends, while com forting to many, are threatening to man y, particularly those in the lower-middle class. “T hey sense a theft of their culture,” he said. Individualists’ Rage It’s dou btful that the typical righ t-wing militia member would voi ce his sense of loss this articulately, thou gh . “T hey’re not deep thinkers,” said John George, the co-author with Mr. Wi lcox of a 1991 study of political extremism in America. This, the authors say, hints at on e of the major differences between righ t-wing an d left-wing extremist groups. Leftists tend to be more articulate an d more inclined to cluster arou nd a shared ideology; righ tists, in general, are too individualistic to share an y elab orate ideology an d less verbal when it com es to exp ressing their rage.” Mr. Wi lcox himself, who joined the leftist Students for a Democratic Society in his 1960’ s college days at the University of Kan sas, left that grou p after becom ing disenchan ted with the rigid ideology that progr essively envelop ed it. Tod ay, he has grow n skeptical of ideologi es – al l ideolog ies. H e sees them as trap s for the m ind. As an an tidote, he com piled a book entitled “S elected Quotation s for the Ideologi cal Skeptic.” Taken as a whole, the quotation s con stitute a warning agai nst extremism == and a warning against gove rnment overreaction to extremism. One the on e han d is Jam es Baldwin, the nove list, who warned: “A devot ion to human ity ... is too easily equated with a devot ion to a Cause, and Causes, as we know, are notoriously blood thirsty.” But on the other is Jam es Mad ison , who wrote in 1778: “I believe there are more instan ces of the ab ridgement of the freedom of the peop le by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent an d sudden usurpations.” 124"}]
