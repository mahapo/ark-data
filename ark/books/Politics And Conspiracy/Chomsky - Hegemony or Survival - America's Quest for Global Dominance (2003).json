His reasoning had to do with the adaptive value of what we call \"highe r intelligence,\" meaning the particular hum an form of intellectual orga nization. Mayr estimated the num ber of s pecies since the ori gin of l ife at about fifty bi llion, onl y one of w hich \"a chieved the kind of i ntelligence needed to establish a civilization.\" It did so ve ry re cently, pe rhaps 100,000 ye ars ago. It is generally assumed that only one small breeding group survi ved, of which we are all descenda nts. Mayr speculated that the hum an form of intellectual orga nization may not be favore d by selection. The history of life on Earth, he wrote, refutes the claim that \"it is better to be smart than to be stupid,\" at least judgi ng by biological success: beetles and bacteria, for example, are vastly more successful than hum ans in terms of survi val. He also made the rather somber obs ervation that \"the average life expe ctancy of a species is about 100,000 ye ars.\" We are entering a period of hum an history that may provi de an answer to the que stion of whether it is better to be smart than stupid. The most hope ful pros pect is that the que stion will not be answered: if it receives a definite answer, that answer can only be that hum ans were a kind of \"biological error,\" using their allotted 100,000 years to destroy themselves and, in the proc ess, much else. The species has surely develope d the capacity to do just that, and a hypot hetical extraterrestrial obs erver might well conc lude that hum ans have demons trated that capacity throughout their history, dramatically in the past few hundre d years, with an assault on the environm ent that sustains life, on the diversity of more complex orga nisms, and with cold and calculated savagery, on e ach ot her as well. Two Superpowers The year 2003 ope ned with many indications that conc erns about hum an survi val are all too realistic. To mention just a few examples, in the early fall of 2002 it was learned that a pos sibly terminal nuc lear war was barely avoided fort y years earlier. Immediately after this startling discove ry, the Bus h administration blocked UN effort s to ban the militarization of space, a serious threat to survi val. The administration also terminated internationa l negotiations to prevent biological warfare and move d to ensure the inevitability of an attack on Iraq, despite popul ar oppos ition t hat was without historical pre cedent. Aid orga nizations with extensive expe rience in Iraq and studies by respected medical orga nizations warned that the planne d inva sion might precipitate a hum anitarian catastrophe . The warnings were ignore d by Washington and evoke d little media interest. A high-l evel US task forc e conc lude d that attacks with weapons of mass destruction (WMD) within the United States are \"likely,\" and would become more so in the event of war with Iraq. Numerous specialists and intelligence agencies issued similar warnings , adding that Washington's belligerence, not only with regard to Iraq, was increasing the long-t erm threat of internationa l terrori sm and prol iferation of WMD. These warnings too w ere dismissed. Noam Chom sky 2 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In September 2002 the Bus h administration announc ed its Nationa l Security Strategy, which declared the right to resort to forc e to eliminate any perceived challenge to US globa l hegemony, which is to be permanent. The new grand strategy arous ed deep conc ern worldwide, even within the fore ign policy elite at hom e. Also in September, a propa ganda campaign was launc hed to depict Sadda m Hussein as an imminent threat to the United States and to insinua te that he was respons ible for the 9-11 atrocities and was planning others. The campaign, timed to the ons et of the midterm congre ssiona l elections , was highly successful in shifting attitude s. It soon drove American publ ic opinion off the globa l spectrum and helped the administration achieve electoral aims and establish Iraq as a prope r test case for t he newly announc ed doc trine of re sort to forc e at will. President Bus h and his associates also persisted in unde rmining internationa l effort s to reduc e threats to the environm ent that are recogni zed to be severe, with pretexts that barely conc ealed their devotion to narrow sectors of private pow er. The administration's Climate Cha nge Science Progra m (CCS P), wrote Science magazine editor Dona ld Kenne dy, is a travesty that \"include d no recommenda tions for emission limitation or other form s of mitigation,\" contenting itself with \"vol untary re duc tion t argets, which, e ven if m et, would allow US emission ra tes to continue to grow at around 14% per decade.\" The CCS P did not even cons ider the likelihood, sugge sted by \"a grow ing body of evidence,\" that the short -term warming change s it ignore s \"will trigge r an abrupt nonl inear proc ess,\" produc ing dramatic temperature change s that could carry extreme risks for the United States, Europe , and other temperate zone s. The Bus h administration's \"contemptuous pass on multilateral enga gement with the globa l warming probl em,\" Kenne dy continue d, is the \"stance that began the long continuing proc ess of erodi ng its friends hips in Europe ,\" leading to \"smoldering resentment.\" 2 By Octobe r 2002 it was becoming hard to ignore the fact that the world was \"more conc erned about the unbri dled use of American pow er than ... about the threat pos ed by Sadda m Hussein,\" and \"as intent on limiting the giant's pow er as ... in taking away the despot's weapons .\" 3 World conc erns mount ed in the months that followed, as the giant made clear its intent to attack Iraq even if the UN inspections it reluctantly tolerated failed to une arth weapons that would provi de a pretext. By December, support for Washington's war plans scarcely reached 10 percent almost anyw here outside the US, accordi ng to internationa l polls. Two months later, after enorm ous worldwide prot ests, the press report ed that \"there may still be two supe rpow ers on the planet: the United States and world publ ic opinion\" (\"the United States\" here meaning state pow er, not the publ ic or even elite opi nion). 4 By early 2003, studies revealed that fear of the United States had reached remarkable heights throughout the world, along with distrust of the political leadership. Dismissal of elementary hum an rights and needs was matched by a display of contempt for democracy for which no parallel comes easily to mind, accompanied by profe ssions of sincere dedication to hum an rights and democracy. The unfol ding events shoul d be deeply disturbi ng to thos e who have conc erns about the world they are leaving t o their gra ndc hildren. Though Bus h planne rs are at an extreme end of the traditiona l US policy spectrum , their progra ms and doc trines have many precursors, both in US history and among earlier aspirants to globa l pow er. More ominous ly, their decisions may not be irrationa l within the framework of prevailing ideology and the institutions that embody it. There is ample historical precedent for the willingne ss of leaders to threaten or resort to violence in the face of significant risk of catastrophe . But the stakes are far highe r toda y. The choice between hegemony and survi val has rarely, if ever, been so starkly pos ed. Noam Chom sky 3 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Let us try to unra vel some of the many strands that enter into this complex tapestry, focusing attention on the world pow er that proc laims globa l hegemony. Its actions and guiding doc trines must be a primary conc ern for everyone on the planet, particularly, of cours e, for Americans. Many enjoy unus ual adva ntages and freedom , hence the ability to shape the future, and shoul d face with care the respons ibilities that are the immediate corol lary of s uch pri vilege. Enemy Te rritory Thos e who want to face their respons ibilities with a genuine commitment to democracy and freedom —e ven to decent survi val— shoul d recogni ze the barriers that stand in the way. In violent states these are not conc ealed. In more democratic societies barriers are more subtle. While methods differ sharply from more brut al to more free societies, the goa ls are in many ways similar: to ensure that the \"gre at beast,\" as Alexande r Hamilton called the people, doe s not stray from its prope r confi nes. Cont rolling the general popul ation has always been a dom inant conc ern of pow er and privilege, particularly since the first mode rn democratic revolution in seventeenth-century England. The self- described \"men of best qua lity\" were appa lled as a \"giddy multitude of beasts in men's shapes\" rejected the basic framework of the civil confl ict raging in England between king and Parliament, and called for gove rnm ent \"by count rym en like ours elves, that know our wants,\" not by \"kni ghts and gentlemen that make us laws, that are chos en for fear and do but oppre ss us, and do not know the people's sores.\" The men of best qua lity recogni zed that if the people are so \"de praved and corrupt \" as to \"confe r places of pow er and trust upon wicked and unde serving men, they forfe it their pow er in this behalf unto thos e that are good, though but a few.\" Almost three centuries later, Wilsonian idealism, as it is standa rdly termed, adopt ed a rather similar stance. Abroa d, it is Washington's respons ibility to ensure that gove rnm ent is in the hands of \"the good, though but a few.\" At hom e, it is necessary to safegua rd a system of elite decision-m aking and publ ic ratification —\"pol yarchy,\" i n the terminology of pol itical science—not democracy. 5 As president, Woodrow Wilson himself did not shrink from severely repressive policies even within the United States, but such measures are not norm ally available in places where popul ar struggl es have won a subs tantial measure of freedom and rights. By Wilson's day it was widely recogni zed by elite sectors in the US and Britain that within their societies, coercion was a tool of diminishing utility, and that it would be necessary to devise new means to tame the beast, primarily through control of opi nion a nd a ttitude . Huge indus tries have since develope d de voted to these ends . Wilson's own view was that an elite of gentlemen with \"elevated ideals\" must be empow ered to preserve \"stability and righteous ness.\" 6 Leading publ ic intellectuals agreed. \"The publ ic must be put in its place,\" Walter Lippm ann declared in his progre ssive essays on democracy. That goa l could be achieved in part through \"the manufa cture of cons ent,\" a \"self-cons cious art and regular orga n of popul ar gove rnm ent.\" This \"revolution\" in the \"pra ctice of democracy\" shoul d enable a \"specialized class\" to manage the \"common interests\" that \"ve ry largely elude publ ic opinion entirely.\" In essence, the Leninist ideal. Lippm ann had obs erved the revolution in the practice of democracy firsthand as a member of Wilson's Com mittee on Public Inform ation, which was established to coordi nate wartime propa ganda and achieved great success in whipping the popul ation into war fever. The \"respons ible men\" who are the prope r decision-m akers, Lippm ann continue d, must \"live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd.\" These \"ignora nt and meddlesome outsiders\" are to be \"spectators,\" not \"pa rticipants.\" The herd doe s have a \"func tion\": to trample periodically in support of one or another element of the leadership class in an election.

Just how diminished the publ ic arena shoul d be is a matter of debate. Neoliberal initiatives of the past thirty years have been designe d to restrict it, leaving basic decision-m aking within largely una ccount able private tyrannies, linke d closely to one another and to a few pow erful states. Democracy can then survi ve, but in sharply reduc ed form . The Reagan-Bus h sectors have taken an extreme pos ition in this regard, but the policy spectrum is fairly narrow . Some argue that it scarcely exists at all, mocking the pundi ts who \"actually make a living contrasting the finer points of the sitcoms on NBC with thos e broa dcast on CBS \" duri ng election campaigns : \"Through tacit agreement the two major parties approa ch the contest for the presidency [as] political kabuki [in which] the players know their roles and everyone sticks to the script,\" \"striking pos es\" that cannot be taken serious ly. 7 If the publ ic escapes its marginalization and passivity, we face a \"crisis of democracy\" that must be ove rcome, liberal intellectuals explain, in part through measures to discipline the institutions respons ible for \"the indoc trination of the young\"—s chool s, universities, churc hes, and the like— and pe rhaps even through gove rnm ent control of t he media, if self-censorship doe s not suffi ce. 8 In taking these views, contempora ry intellectuals are drawing on good cons titutiona l sourc es. James Madison held that pow er must be delegated to \"the wealth of the nation,\" \"the more capable set of men,\" who unde rstand that the role of gove rnm ent is \"to prot ect the minori ty of the opul ent against the majority.\" Precapitalist in his worldview, Madison had faith that the \"enlightened Statesman\" and \"be nevolent philosophe r\" who were to exercise pow er would \"discern the true interest of their count ry\" and gua rd the publ ic interest against the \"mischief\" of democratic majorities. The mischief would be avoided, Madison hope d, unde r the system of fragmentation he devised. In later years he came to fear that severe probl ems would arise with the likely increase of thos e who \"will labor unde r all the hardships of life, and secretly sigh for a more equa l distribution of its benefits.\" A good de al of m ode rn hi story re flects these confl icts ove r who w ill make decisions , and how . Recogni tion that control of opinion is the founda tion of gove rnm ent, from the most despotic to the most free, goe s back at least to David Hume, but a qua lification shoul d be adde d. It is far more import ant in the more free societies, where obe dience cannot be maintained by the lash. It is only natural that the mode rn institutions of thought control—fra nkly called propa ganda before the word became unfa shiona ble because of totalitarian associations —s houl d have originated in the most free societies. Britain pione ered with its Ministry of Inform ation, which unde rtook \"to direct the thought of most of the world.\" Wilson followed soon after with his Com mittee on Public Inform ation. Its propa ganda successes inspired progre ssive democratic theorists and the mode rn publ ic-relations indus try. Leading participants in the CPI, like Lippm ann and Edward Bernays, quite explicitly drew from these achievements of thought control, which Bernays called \"the engineering of cons ent, ... the very essence of the democratic proc ess.\" The term propa ganda became an entry in the Encyclopa edia Britannica in 1922 and in the Encyclope dia of Social Sciences a decade later, with Harold Lasswel's scholarly endors ement of the new technique s for controlling the publ ic mind. The methods of the pione ers were particularly significant, Randa l Marlin writes in his history of propa ganda , because of their \"widespread imitation ... by Nazi Germany, South Africa, the Soviet Union, a nd t he US Pentagon,\" t hough t he achievements of t he PR indus try dw arf them all. 9 Noam Chom sky 5 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Probl ems of dom estic control become particularly severe when the gove rning authori ties carry out policies that are oppos ed by the general popul ation. In thos e cases, the political leadership may be tempted to follow the path of the Reagan administration, which established an Office of Public Diplomacy to manufa cture cons ent for its murde rous policies in Central America. One high gove rnm ent offi cial described its Operation Truth as \"a huge psychological ope ration of the kind the military conduc ts to influence a popul ation in denied or enemy territory\"—a frank characterization of pe rvasive attitude s toward t he dom estic popul ation. 10 Enemy Te rritory Abroad While the enemy at hom e often has to be controlled by intensive propa ganda , beyond the borde rs more direct means are available. The leaders of the curre nt Bus h administration—m ostly recycled from more reactiona ry sectors of the Reagan-Bus h I administrations —provi ded suffi ciently clear illustrations duri ng their earlier stints in offi ce. When the traditiona l regime of violence and repression was challenge d by the Churc h and other miscreants in the Central American dom ains of US pow er, the Reagan administration responde d with a \"war on terror,\" declared as soon as it took offi ce in 1981. Not surpri singly, the US initiative instantly became a terrori st war—a campaign of slaught er, torture, and ba rbarism—that soon e xtende d to ot her re gions of t he world as well. In one count ry, Nicaragua , Washington had lost control of the armed forc es that had traditiona lly subdue d the region's popul ation, one of the bitter legacies of Wilsonian idealism. The US-backed Somoza dictatorship was ove rthrow n by the Sandinista rebels, and the murde rous Nationa l Guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected to a campaign of internationa l terrori sm that left the count ry in ruins. Even the psychological effects of Washington's terrori st war are severe. The spirit of exube rance, vitality, and optimism that followed the ove rthrow of the dictatorship could not long survi ve as the reigning supe rpow er intervened to dash the hope s that a grim history m ight finally take a different cours e. In the other Central American count ries targeted by the Reaganite \"war on terror,\" forc es equippe d and trained by the United States maintained control. Without an army to defend the popul ation against the terrori sts—that is, the security forc es themselves— atrocities were even worse. The record of murde r, torture, and devastation was extensively report ed by hum an rights orga nizations , churc h groups , Latin American scholars, and many others, but it remained little know n to citizens of t he state that bore pri me respons ibility, a nd w as qui ckly effaced.11 By the mid-1980s , the US-backed state terrori st campaigns had created societies \"affected by terror and panic ... collective intimidation and generalized fear,\" in the words of a leading Churc h-ba sed Salvadora n hum an rights orga nization: the popul ation had \"internalized acceptance\" of \"the daily and freque nt use of violent means\" and \"the freque nt appe arance of tortured bodi es.\" Returni ng from a brief visit to his native Guatemala, journa list Julio Godoy wrote that \"one is tempted to believe that some people in the White Hous e worship Aztec gods —w ith the offe ring of Central American blood.\" He had fled a year earlier when his newspaper, La Epoc a, was blown up by state terrori sts, an ope ration that arous ed no interest in the United States: attention was carefully focused on the misdeeds of the offi cial enemy, real no doubt but hardly detectable given the scale of US- backed state terror in the region. The White Hous e, Godoy wrote, installed and support ed forc es in Central America that could \"easily compete against Nicolae Ceausescu's Securitate for the World Crue lty Prize.\"12 After the terrori st commande rs had achieved their goa ls, the cons eque nces were reviewed at a confe rence in San Salvador of Jesuits and lay associates, who had more than enough persona l expe rience to draw on, quite apart from what they had obs erved through the grisly decade of the Noam Chom sky 6 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1980s .

In the offi cial rhetoric of the Nationa l Security Strategy, \"Our forc es will be strong enough to dissuade potential adve rsaries from purs uing a military build-up in hope s of s urpa ssing, or e qua ling, t he pow er of t he United States.\"1 One well-know n internationa l affairs specialist, John Ikenbe rry, describes the declaration as a \"gra nd strategy [that] begins with a funda mental commitment to maintaining a unipolar world in which the United States has no peer competitor,\" a condi tion that is to be \"pe rmanent [so] that no state or coalition could ever challenge [the US] as globa l leader, prot ector, and enforc er.\" The declared \"approa ch rende rs internationa l norm s of self-de fense?enshrined by Article 51 of the UN Cha rter?almost meaningless.\" More generally, the doc trine dismisses internationa l law and institutions as of \"little value.\" Ikenbe rry continue s: \"The new imperial grand strategy presents the United States [as] a revisionist state seeking to parlay its momentary adva ntages into a world orde r in which it runs the show ,\" prom pting others to find ways to \"work around, unde rmine, contain and retaliate against U.S. pow er.\" The strategy threatens to \"leave the world more dange rous and divided\" a nd t he United States less secure,\"2 a view widely shared w ithin the fore ign pol icy elite. Enforcing Hegemony The imperial grand strategy asserts the right of the United States to unde rtake \"pre ventive war\" at will: Preventive, not preemptive.3 Preemptive war might fall within the framework of internationa l law. Thus if Rus sian bom bers had been detected approa ching the US from the military base in Grenada conjured up by the Reagan administration in 1983, with the clear intent to bom b, then, unde r a reasona ble interpre tation of the UN Cha rter, a preemptive attack destroyi ng the planes and perhaps even the Grenadan base would have been justifiable. Cuba , Nicaragua , and many others could have exercised the same right for many years while unde r attack from the US, though of cours e the weak would have to be insane to implement their rights. But the justifications for preemptive war, w hatever they m ight be, do not hol d for pre ventive war, pa rticularly as that conc ept is interpre ted by its curre nt enthus iasts: the use of military forc e to eliminate an imagined or inve nted threat, so that even the term pre ventive is too c haritable. Preventive war falls within the category of war crimes. If inde ed it is an idea \"whos e time has come,\"4 t hen the world is in de ep troubl e. As the inva sion of Iraq began, the prom inent historian and Kenne dy adviser Arthur Schlesinge r wrote that The president has adopted a policy of \"anticipatory self-defense\" that is alarmingly similar to the policy that imperial Japan employed at Pearl Harbor, on a date which, as an earlier American president said it would, lives in infamy. Franklin D. Roosevelt was right, but today it is we Americans who l ive in infamy.5 He adde d that \"the globa l wave of sympathy that engul fed the United States after 9-11 has given way to a globa l wave of hatred of American arroga nce and militarism,\" and even in friendly Noam Chom sky 8 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"count ries the publ ic regards Bus h \"as a greater threat to peace than Sadda m Hussein.\" Internationa l law specialist Richard Falk finds it \"inescapable\" that the Iraq war was a \"Cri me against Peace of the sort for which survi ving German leaders were indicted, pros ecuted, and puni shed at the Nuremberg t rials.\"6 Some defende rs of the strategy recogni ze that it runs roughs hod ove r internationa l law but see no probl em in that. The whole framework of internationa l law is just \"hot air,\" legal scholar Michael Glennon writes: \"The grand attempt to subject the rule of forc e to the rule of law\" shoul d be depos ited in the ashcan of history\" a conve nient stance for the one state able to adopt the new non- rules for its purpos es, since it spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined on means of violence and is forgi ng new and dange rous paths in developing means of destruction, ove r near- una nimous world oppos ition. The proof that the system is all \"hot air\" is straightforw ard: Washington \"made it clear that it intends to do all it can to maintain its preeminence,\" then \"announc ed that it would ignore \" the UN Security Counc il ove r Iraq and declared more broa dly that \"it would no longe r be bound by the [UN] Cha rter's rules gove rning the use of forc e.\" QED. Accordi ngly, the rules have \"collapsed\" and \"the entire edifice came crashing dow n.\" This, Glennon conc lude s, is a good thing, since the US is the leader of the \"enlightened states\" and therefore \"must resist [any e ffort ] to curb i ts use of forc e.\"7 The enlightened leader is also free to change the rules at will. When the military forc es occupyi ng Iraq failed to discove r the weapons of mass destruction that allegedly justified the inva sion, the administration's stance shifted from \"absolute certainty\" that Iraq pos sessed WMD on a scale that required immediate military action to the assertion that American accusations had been \"justified by the discove ry of equipment that potentially could be used to produc e weapons .\" Senior offi cials sugge sted a \"refinement in the controve rsial conc ept of a 'preventive war' \" that entitles Washington to take military action \"against a count ry that has deadly weapons in mass qua ntities.\" The revision \"sugge sts instead that the administration will act against a hos tile regime that has nothing more than the intent and a bility to de velop [W MD].\"8 Virtually any count ry has the potential and ability to produc e WMD, and intent is in the eye of the beholder. Hence the refined version of the grand strategy effectively grants Washington the right of arbitrary aggre ssion. Lowering the bar for the resort to forc e is the most significant cons eque nce of the collapse of t he proc laimed argum ent for t he inva sion. The goa l of the imperial grand strategy is to prevent any challenge to the \"pow er, pos ition, and prestige of the United States.\" The quot ed words are not thos e of Dick Che ney or Dona ld Rum sfeld, or any of the other statist reactiona ries who form ulated the Nationa l Security Strategy of September 2002. Rather, they were spoke n by the respected liberal elder statesman Dean Acheson in 1963. He was justifying US actions against Cuba in full know ledge that Washington's internationa l terrori st campaign aimed at \"regime change \" had been a significant factor in bringing the world close to nuc lear war only a few months earlier, and that it was resumed immediately after the Cuba n missile crisis was resolved. Nevertheless, he instructed the American Society of Internationa l Law that no \"legal issue\" arises when the US responds to a challenge to its \"pow er, pos ition, a nd pre stige.\" Acheson's doc trine was subs eque ntly invoke d by the Reagan administration, at the other end of the political spectrum , when it rejected W orld Court jurisdiction ove r its attack on N icaragua , dismissed the court orde r to terminate its crimes, and then vetoed two Security Counc il resolutions affirming the court judgm ent and calling on all states to obs erve internationa l law. State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer explained that most of the world cannot \"be count ed on to share our view\" and that \"this same majority often oppos es the United States on import ant internationa l que stions .\" Accordi ngly, we must \"reserve to ours elves the pow er to determine\" which matters fall \"essentially Noam Chom sky 9 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"within the dom estic jurisdiction of the United States\"\" in this case, the actions that the court conde mned as the \"unl awful use of forc e\" against Nicaragua ; in lay terms, internationa l terrori sm.9 Cont empt for internationa l law and institutions was particularly flagrant in the Reagan-Bus h years\" the first reign of Washington's curre nt incumbents\" and their successors continue d to make it clear that the US reserved the right to act \"uni laterally when necessary,\" including the \"uni lateral use of military pow er\" to defend such vital interests as \"ensuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy s uppl ies, and s trategic resourc es.\"10 But the pos ture was not exactly ne w. The basic principles of the imperial grand strategy of September 2002 go back to the early days of World War II. Even before the US entered the war, high-l evel planne rs and analysts conc lude d that in the pos twar world the US would seek \"to hold unque stione d pow er,\" acting to ensure the \"limitation of any exercise of sove reignty\" by states that might interfere with its globa l designs . They recogni zed furt her that \"the fore most requirement\" to secure these ends was \"the rapid fulfillment of a progra m of complete rearmament\"\" then, as now , a central compone nt of \"an integrated policy to achieve military and econom ic supre macy for the United States.\" At the time, these ambitions were limited to \"the non-G erman world,\" which was to be orga nized unde r the US aegis as a \"Grand Area,\" including the Western Hemisphe re, the form er British Empire, and the Far East. After it became fairly clear that Germany would be defeated, the plans were extende d to include as much of E urasia as pos sible.11 The precedents, barely sampled here, reveal the narrow range of the planning spectrum . Policy flows from an institutiona l framework of dom estic pow er, which remains fairly stable. Econom ic decision-m aking pow er is highly centralized, and John Dewey scarcely exagge rated when he described politics as \"the shadow cast on society by big bus iness.\" It is only natural that state policy shoul d seek to cons truct a world system ope n to US econom ic penetration and political control, tolerating no rivals or threats.12 A crucial corol lary is vigilance to block any move s toward inde pende nt developm ent that might become a \"virus infecting others,\" in the terminology of planne rs. That is a leading theme of pos twar history, often disguised unde r thin Col d War pretexts that were also exploited by t he supe rpow er rival in its narrow er dom ains. The basic missions of globa l management have endure d from the early pos twar period, among them: containing other centers of globa l pow er within the \"ove rall framework of orde r\" managed by the United States; maintaining control of the world's energy suppl ies; barring una cceptable form s of inde pende nt nationa lism; and ove rcoming \"crises of democracy\" within dom estic enemy territory. The missions assume different form s, notably in periods of fairly sharp transition: the change s in the internationa l econom ic orde r from about 1970; the restoration of the supe rpow er enemy to something like its traditiona l qua si-colonial status twenty years later; the threat of internationa l terrori sm aimed at the United States itself from the early 1990s , shoc kingly cons ummated on 9-11. Over the years, tactics have been refined and modified to deal with these shifts, progre ssively ratcheting up the means of violence and driving our enda nge red species closer to the edge of catastrophe . Nevertheless, the September 2002 unve iling of the imperial grand strategy justifiably sounde d alarm bells. Acheson and Sofaer were describing policy guidelines, and within elite circles.

Distingui shed specialists and publ ic intellectuals may then sobe rly explain that law is a flexible living instrum ent so that the new norm is now available as a guide to action.

It must be important enough t o be worth the trouble. 3. There must be a way to portray it as the ultimate evil and an imminent threat to our survival. Iraq qua lified on all count s. The first two condi tions are obvi ous . The third is easy to establish. It is only necessary to repeat the impassione d orations of Bus h, Blair, and their colleague s: the dictator \"is assembling the world's most dange rous weapons [in orde r to] dom inate, intimidate, or attack\"; and he \"ha s already used them on whole villages\" leaving thous ands of his own citizens dead, blind, or transfigure d. ... If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.\"13 The president's eloque nt denunc iation in his Janua ry 2003 State of the Union addre ss surely rings true. And certainly thos e who contribute to enha ncing evil shoul d not enjoy impuni ty\" among them, the speaker of thos e lofty words and his curre nt associates, who long support ed the man of ultimate evil in full awareness of his crimes. It is impressive to see how easy it is, while recount ing the mons ter's worst offe nses, to suppre ss the crucial words \"with our help, which continue d because we didn't care.\" Praise and support shifted to denunc iation as soon as the mons ter committed his first authentic crime: disobe ying (or perhaps misunde rstanding) orde rs by inva ding Kuwait in 1990. Punishment was severe”for his subjects. The tyrant, how ever, escaped uns cathed and was furt her strengthened by t he sanctions regime then impos ed by hi s form er fri ends . As the time approa ched to demons trate the new norm of preventive war in September 2002, Nationa l Security Adviser Condol eezza Rice warned that the next evidence of Sadda m Hussein's intentions might be a mushroom cloud\" presumably in New York; Hussein's neighbors , including Israeli intelligence, dismissed the allegations , which were later unde rmined by the UN inspectors, though Washington continue d to claim otherwise. From the first moments of the propa ganda offe nsive, it was appa rent that the pronounc ements lacked credibility. \" 'This administration is capable of any lie ... in orde r to adva nce its war goa l in Iraq,' says a US gove rnm ent sourc e in Washington with some two decades of expe rience in intelligence.\" Washington oppos ed inspections , he sugge sted, because it feared that nothing much would be found. The president's claims about Iraqi threats \"shoul d be viewed as transparent attempts to scare Americans into support ing a war,\" two leading internationa l-relations scholars adde d. That is standa rd ope rating proc edure . Washington still refuses to provi de evidence to support its 1990 claims of a huge Iraqi military buildup on the Saudi borde r, the primary justification offe red for the 1991 war, claims instantly unde rmined by t he one journa l that inve stigated them, but to no e ffect.14 Evidence or not, the president and his associates issued grim warnings about the dire threat Sadda m pos ed to the United States and to his neighbors , and his links to internationa l terrori sts, hinting broa dly that he was invol ved in the 9-11 attacks.

Within weeks, some 60 percent of Americans came to regard Sadda m Hussein as \"an immediate threat to the US\" who must be remove d quickly in self-de fense. By March, almost half believed that Sadda m Hussein was persona lly invol ved in the 9-11 attacks and that the hijackers include d Ira qis. Support for t he war was strongl y corre lated w ith these beliefs.15 Abroa d, \"publ ic diplomacy ... failed badly,\" the internationa l press report ed, but \"at hom e it has succeeded brilliantly in linking the war on Iraq with the trauma of September 11. ...

Public diplomacy worke d its magic with Congre ss instantaneous ly. In Octobe r, Congre ss granted the president authori ty to go to war \"to defend the nationa l security of the United States against the continuing threat pos ed by Iraq.\" This particular script is familiar. In 1985, President Reagan declared a nationa l emergency, renewed annua lly, because \"the policies and the actions of the gove rnm ent of Nicaragua cons titute an unus ual and extraordi nary threat to the nationa l security and fore ign policy of the United States.\" In 2002, Americans again had to tremble in fear, this time before Ira q. The brilliant success of publ ic diplomacy at hom e was revealed onc e again when the president \"provi ded a pow erful Reaganesque finale to a six-w eek war\" on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. He was free to declare\" without conc ern for skeptical dom estic comment\" that he had won a \"victory in a war on terror\" by having \"remove d an ally of Al Qaeda.\"17 It is immaterial that the alleged link between Sadda m Hussein and Osama bin Laden, in fact, his bitter enemy, was based on no credible evidence and largely dismissed by competent obs ervers. Also immaterial is the onl y know n conne ction be tween the Ira q inva sion a nd t he threat of terror: that the inva sion enha nced the threat, as had been widely predicted; it appe ars to have been a \"huge setback in the 'war on t error' \" by s harply increasing A l Qaeda recruitment.18 The propa ganda impact persisted past the end of the war. After the failure of intense effort s to discove r WMD, a third of the popul ation believed that US forc es had found WMD and more than 20 percent believed Iraq had used them duri ng the war.19 These may simply be the reactions of people who are subject to fear of just about anything after many years of intense propa ganda designe d to tame the \"gre at beast\" by i nduc ing pa nic. The phra se \"pow erful Reaganesque finale\" is presumably a reference to Reagan's proud announc ement that the US was \"standing tall\" after having ove rcome the terrible threat pos ed by Grenada. Astute commentators adde d that Bus h's carefully staged USS Abraham Lincoln extravaganza marked \"the beginning of his 2004 reelection campaign,\" which the White Hous e hope s \"will be built as much as pos sible around nationa l-security themes, a staple of the campaign being the remova l of Iraqi leader Sadda m Hussein.\" To furt her drive hom e the message, the offi cial campaign ope ning was delayed until mid-S eptember 2004 so that the Republ ican Conve ntion, meeting in New York, would be able to celebrate the wartime leader who alone can save Americans from a reenactment of 9-11, as he did in Iraq. The electoral campaign will focus on \"the battle of Iraq, not the war,\" chief Republ ican political strategist Karl Rove explained. This is part of a \"far larger and longe r war against terrori sm that [Rove ] sees clearly, perchance fort uitous ly, stretching well toward E lection D ay 2004.\"20 A nd s urely be yond.

If unpl easant, they w ould not be inve stigated, and traces would disappe ar from view, at least if the past is any guide. Victors do not inve stigate their own crimes, so that little is know n about them, a principle that brooks few exceptions : the death toll of the US wars in Indoc hina, for example, is not know n within a range of millions .

The principle has been applied in subs eque nt tribuna ls, but onl y to de feated enemies or ot hers who c an be safely de spised. After the inva sion of Iraq was declared a success, it was publ icly recogni zed that one motive for the war had been to establish the imperial grand strategy as a new norm : \"Publication of the [Nationa l Security Strategy] was the signa l that Iraq would be the first test, not the last,\" the New York Times report ed. \"Ira q became the petri dish in which this expe riment in pre-emptive policy grew.\" A high offi cial adde d that \"we will not hesitate to act alone , if necessary, to exercise our right of self- defense by acting pre-emptively,\" now that the norm has been established. \"The exemplary nature of the whole exercise [in Iraq] is well recogni zed by the rest of the world,\" Harvard Middle East historian Roge r Owen obs erved. Peoples and regimes will have to change the way they see the world \"from a view based on the United Nations and internationa l law to one based on an identification\" with Washington's agenda . They are being instructed by the display of forc e to put aside \"any s erious cons iderations of na tiona l interest\" in fa vor of re flecting \"A merican goa ls.\"21 The need for a demons tration of strength to \"maintain credibility\" in the eyes of the world may have tippe d the balance on the war with Iraq. In a review of planning, the Financial Times traced the decision to go to war to mid-D ecember 2002, after Iraq's subm ission of its declaration on armaments to the UN. \" 'There was a feeling that the White Hous e was being mocked,' says one person who worke d closely with the Nationa l Security Counc il duri ng thos e days after the declaration was delivered on December 8. 'A tinpot dictator was mocking the president. It provoke d a sense of ange r inside the White Hous e. After that point, there was no pros pect of a diplomatic solution.' \"22 What followed was just diplomatic theater for obfus cation while military forc es were put in pl ace. With the grand strategy not only offi cially declared but also implemented, the new norm of preventive war takes its place in the canon. The US may now find it pos sible to turn to harder cases. There are many tempting pos sibilities: Iran, Syria, the Ande an region, and a num ber of others. The pros pects depend in large part on whether the \"second supe rpow er\" can be intimidated and contained. The moda lities for establishing norm s merit furt her reflection. Most import ant, only thos e with the guns and the faith have the authori ty to impos e their demands on the world. A revealing example of the preroga tives of pow er is the widely hailed \"norm ative revolution\" that ende d the millennium. After a few false starts, the 1990s became \"the decade of hum anitarian intervention.\" The new right to intervene on \"hum anitarian\" grounds was established by the coura ge and altruism of the US and its allies, particularly in Kosovo and East Timor, the two jewels in the diadem. The Kosovo bom bing in particular is unde rstood by distingui shed authori ties to have established the norm of resort to forc e without Security Counc il authori zation. A simple que stion arises: Why were the 1990s cons idered \"the decade of hum anitarian Noam Chom sky 13 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"intervention\" but not the 1970s ? Since World War II there have been two major examples of resort to forc e that really did put an end to terrible crimes, in both cases argua bly in self-de fense: Indi a's inva sion of East Pakistan in 1971, ending a mass slaught er and other horrors , and Vietnam's inva sion of Cambodi a in December 1978, terminating Pol Pot's atrocities as they were picking up through 1978. Nothing remotely comparable took place unde r the Western aegis in the 1990s . Accordi ngly, someone who doe s not unde rstand the conve ntions might be pardone d for asking why \"the new norm \" w as not recogni zed as such in the 1970s . The idea is unthinka ble, and the reasons seem clear. The real examples of intervention that terminated huge atrocities were carried out by the wrong people. Still worse, in both cases the US was adamantly oppos ed to intervention and move d instantly to puni sh the offe nde r, particularly Vietnam, by subjecting it to a US-backed Chi nese inva sion, then even harsher sanctions than before , while the US and UK offe red direct support for the ous ted Khmer Rouge . It follows that the 1970s cannot have been the decade of hum anitarian intervention, and no new norm s could have been established then. The essential insight was form ulated by a una nimous vote of the Internationa l Court of Justice in one of i ts earliest rul ings , in 1949: The Court can only regard the alleged right of intervention as the manifestation of a policy of force, such as has, in the past, given rise to most serious abuses and such as cannot, whatever be the defects in international organization, find a place in international law ...; from the nature of things, [intervention] would be reserved for the most powerful states, and might easily lead to perverting the administration of justice itself.23 While Western pow ers and intellectuals were admiring themselves for having established the new norm of hum anitarian intervention in the late 1990s , the rest of the world also had some thought s on the matter. It is illuminating to see how they reacted, say, to Tony Blair's repetition of the offi cial reasons for the bom bing of Serbia in 1999: failure to bom b \"would have dealt a devastating blow to the credibility of NATO\" and \"the world would have been less safe as a result of that.\" The objects of NATO's solicitude did not seem ove rly impressed by the need to safegua rd the credibility of thos e who had been crushing them for centuries. Nelson Mande la, for example, conde mned Blair for \"encoura ging internationa l chaos, toge ther with America, by ignori ng other nations and playing 'policeman of the world' \" in their attacks on Iraq in 1998 and Serbia the next year. In the world's largest democracy\" which, after inde pende nce, began to recove r from the grim effects of centuries of British rule\" the Clinton-Bl air effort s to shore up NATO's credibility and make the world safe were also not appre ciated, but offi cial and press conde mnations in Indi a remained unhe ard. Even in Israel, the client state par excellence, the pretensions of Clinton-Bl air and a hos t of dom estic admirers were ridiculed by leading military and political analysts as a return to old-fa shione d \"gunboa t diplomacy\" unde r the familiar \"cloak of moralistic righteous ness,\" and as a \"da nge r to the world.\"24 Another sourc e of inform ation might have been the nona ligne d move ment, the gove rnm ents of about 80 percent of the world's popul ation at the time of their South Summit in April 2000. The meeting was the most import ant in their history, the first ever at the level of heads of state, who, in addition to issuing a detailed and sophi sticated critical analysis of the neoliberal socioeconom ic progra ms called \"globa lization\" by Western ideologue s, also firmly rejected \"the so-called 'right' of hum anitarian intervention.\" That stand was reiterated in the summit of nona ligne d count ries in Malaysia in Februa ry 2003, in the same words .25 Perhaps they had learned too much history, the hard way, to be comfort ed by exalted rhetoric and had heard enough about \"hum anitarian intervention\" ove r the centuries.

The authori ty is sometimes delegated to reliable clients. Thus , Israel's crimes are permitted to establish norm s: for example, its regular resort to \"targeted killings \" of suspects\" called \"terrori st atrocities\" when carried out by the wrong hands . In May 2003, two leading Israeli civil rights attorne ys provi ded \"a detailed list of all of the liquidations and all of the attempted assassinations that Israel's security forc es carried out\" duri ng the al-Aqsa Intifada, from Nove mber 2000 through April 2003. Using offi cial and semioffi cial records , they found that \"Israel carried out no less than 175 liquidation attempts\"\" one attempt every five days\" killing 235 people, of whom 156 were suspected of crimes. \"It greatly pains us to say the following,\" the lawyers wrote, but \"the cons istent, widespread policy of targeted liquidations bounds on a crime against hum anity.\"26 Their judgm ent is not quite accurate. Liquidation is a crime in the wrong hands , but it is a justified, if regrettable, act of self-de fense when carried out by a client, and even establishes norm s for the \"the bos s-man called 'partner,' \"27 who provi des authori zation. The \"bos s-man\" himself made use of Israel's precedent with the assassination by missile of a suspect in Yemen, along with five other people who happe ned to be nearby, to much acclaim. The hit was \"conve niently timed [as an] Octobe r surpri se ... to show the incum- bent in his finest hour, on the eve of the midterm elections ,\" and offe r \"a taste of w hat is to come.\"28 A more far-re aching example of establishing norm s was Israel's bom bing of the Osirak reactor in Iraq in June 1981. At first the attack was criticized as a violation of internationa l law. Later, after Sadda m Hussein was transform ed from favore d friend to uns peakable fiend in Augus t 1990, the reaction to the Osirak bom bing also shifted. Once a (minor) crime, it was now cons idered an honore d norm , and was greatly praised for having impeded Sadda m Hussein's nuc lear weapons progra m. The norm , how ever, required the evasion of a few inconve nient facts. Short ly after the 1981 bom bing, the Osirak site was inspected by a prom inent nuc lear phys icist, Richard Wilson, then chair of the phys ics department at Harvard University. He conc lude d that the installation bom bed was not suited for plutonium produc tion, as Israel had charged, unlike Israel's own Dimona reactor, which had report edly produc ed several hundre d nuc lear weapons . His conc lusions were support ed by the Iraqi nuc lear phys icist Imad Khadduri , who was in charge of expe rimental work at the reactor before the bom bing and later fled the count ry. He too report ed that the Osirak reactor was uns uitable for the produc tion of plutonium, though after the Israeli bom bing in 1981, Iraq took the \"solid decision to go full speed ahead with weaponi zation.\" Khadduri estimated that it would have taken Iraq decades to obtain the required amount of weapons -gra de material, had the progra m not been sharply accelerated as a result of the bom bing. \"Israel's action increased the determination of Arabs to produc e nuc lear weapons ,\" Kenne th Waltz conc lude d. \"Israel's strike, far from fore closing Iraq's nuc lear career, ga ined Ira q support from some other Arab states to purs ue it.\"29 Whatever the facts, thanks to Iraq's inva sion of Kuwait a decade later, the norm that Israel established in 1981 i s now firmly in pl ace. And if inde ed the 1981 bom bing accelerated the prol iferation of WMD, that in no way tarnishes the deed, and teaches no lessons about the cons eque nces of resort to forc e in violation of old-fa shione d conc eptions of internationa l law\" conc eptions that must be discarded now that they have been demons trated to be \"hot air\" by the bos s-man's contempt for them.

The Red Cros s strongl y prot ested the refusal of the US command to allow it access to prisone rs of war, in violation of the Geneva Conve ntions , and to captured civilians.31 Moreove r, the designa tions are capricious . An enemy combatant can be anyone that the US choos es to attack, with no credible evidence, as Washington c onc edes.32 Justice Department thinking is illuminated by a confi dential plan leaked to the Center for Public Integrity, entitled \"Domestic Security Enha ncement Act of 2003.\" This \"ne w assault on our civil liberties\" vastly expa nds state pow er, Yale Law profe ssor Jack Balkin writes. It unde rmines cons titutiona l rights by granting the state the authori ty to rescind citizenship on the charge of provi ding \"material support \" to an orga nization on the attorne y general's blacklist even if the accused has no idea that the orga nization has been blacklisted. \"Give a few dollars to a Muslim charity Ashcroft thinks is a terrori st orga nization,\" Balkin writes, \"and you could be on the next plane out of this count ry.\" The plan states that \"an intent to relinqui sh nationa lity need not be manifested in words , but can be inferred from conduc t\"; inferred by the attorne y general, whos e judgm ent we must honor, on faith. Analogies have been drawn to the darkest days of McCarthyism, but these new propos als are more extreme. The plan also extends pow ers of surve illance without court authori zation, permits secret arrests, and furt her prot ects the state from the scrutiny of citizens, a matter of great significance to the reactiona ry statists of the Bus h II regime. \"There is no civil right\" not even the precious right of citizenship\" that this Administration will not abus e to secure ever gre ater control ove r American life,\" Ba lkin conc lude s.33 President Bus h is said to have on his desk a bus t of Winston Churc hill, a gift from his friend Tony Blair. Churc hill had a few things to say on t hese topics: The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is in the highest degree odious, and the foundat ion of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist.34 Noam Chom sky 16 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The pow ers the Bus h administration is demanding go well beyond even these odious practices.

International Law and Institutions The imperial grand strategy effectively dispenses with \"the internationa l rule of law as an ove rarching goa l of pol icy,\" a critical review by t he American A cademy of A rts and S ciences poi nts out, noting that neither internationa l law nor the UN Cha rter is even mentione d in the Nationa l Security Strategy. \"The primacy of law ove r forc e [that] has been a major thread in American fore ign policy since the end of World War II\" disappe ars from the new strategy. Also \"all but disappe ared\" are the internationa l institutions \"that extend the reach of law, and seek to cons train the pow erful as well as to grant the weak a voice.\" From now on, forc e reigns , and the US will exercise that forc e as it sees fit. The analysts conc lude that the strategy will increase \"the motivation of U.S. enemies to act [in reaction to their grow ing] resentment of perceived intimidation.\" They will seek \"cheap and easy ways of exploiting U.S. vulnerabilities,\" which abound. Lack of conc ern with this on the part of Bus h planne rs is also illustrated by the fact that the Nationa l Security Strategy contains just a single sentence on enha ncing arms control effort s, for which the administration has only contempt.35 Writing in the Academy's journa l, two internationa l affairs specialists describe the plans for \"extende d confront ation, not political accommoda tion,\" as \"inhe rently provoc ative.\" They warn that \"the appa rent commitment of the United States to active military confront ation for decisive nationa l adva ntage\" carries immense risks.36 Many conc ur, even on na rrow grounds of s elf-interest. The Academy's assessment of the primacy of law ove r forc e in American policy requires serious qua lifications . Since World War II, the US gove rnm ent has adopt ed the standa rd practice of pow erful states, regularly choos ing forc e ove r law when that was cons idered expe dient for \"the nationa l interest,\" a technical term referring to the special interests of dom estic sectors that are in a pos ition to determine policy. For the Anglo-A merican world, that truism is as old as Adam Smith. He bitterly conde mned the \"merchants and manufa cturers\" in England who were \"by far the principal architects\" of policy and made sure their own interests were \"most peculiarly attende d to,\" no matter how \"gri evous \" the effect on others, including the victims of their \"savage injustice\" abroa d and t he people of E ngland a s well.37 T ruisms have a way of re maining t rue. The dom inant elite view with regard to the UN was well expre ssed in 1992 by Francis Fukuya ma, who had served in the Reagan-Bus h State Department: the UN is \"pe rfectly serviceable as an instrum ent of American unilateralism and inde ed may be the primary mechanism through which that unilateralism will be exercised in the future.\" His prediction prove d accurate, presumably because it was based on cons istent practice going back to the early days of the UN. At that time, the state of the world gua ranteed that the UN would be virtually an instrum ent of US pow er. The institution was greatly admired, though elite distaste for it increased notably in subs eque nt years. The shift of attitude roughl y traced the cours e of decolonization, which ope ned a small window for \"the tyranny of the majority\": that is, for conc erns emanating from outside the centers of conc entrated pow er that the bus iness press calls the \"de facto world gove rnm ent\" of \"the masters of the uni verse.\"38 When the UN fails to serve as \"an instrum ent of American unilateralism\" on issues of elite conc ern, it is dismissed.

His secretary of state, Warren Chri stophe r, wrote in 1994 that Iraqi compliance is not \"enough to justify lifting the embargo,\" thus \"changing the rules unilaterally,\" Dilip Hiro points out.39 Washington's use of UN inspectors (UNSCO M) to spy on Iraq also unde rmined inspections , which were terminated by Iraq after Clinton and Blair bom bed the count ry in December 1998 in defiance of the UN. The likely outcome of these inspections is know n with confi dence only to ideologue s on all sides. It was clear enough throughout , how ever, that disarmament through internationa l inspectors was not the US-UK objective and that the two warrior s tates would not comply w ith the relevant UN resolutions . Some commentators have pointed out that Israel has the lead in violating resolutions . US-backed Turke y and Moroc co have also violated more Security Counc il resolutions than Iraq. These resolutions have to do with highly significant matters: aggre ssion, harsh and brut al practices duri ng decades-long military occupa tions , grave breaches of the Geneva Conve ntions (war crimes, in terms of US law), and other matters that rank highe r than incomplete disarmament. The resolutions conc erning Iraq also refer to internal repression, and in this respect Sadda m Hussein's record was horre ndous , but that was (regrettably) only a side issue, as revealed by the support for him by the curre nt incumbents in Washington well past his worst crimes and the war with Iran. Resolutions conc erning Israel do not come unde r Cha pter VII, which would carry the threat of forc e, but any such propos al would instantly be vetoed by t he US. The veto brings up another import ant matter missing from the discussions of Iraq's incomplete compliance with Security Counc il resolutions . Plainly, if Iraq had had the right of veto, it would have been in defiance of no UN resolutions . No less plainly, any serious discussion of defiance of the Security Counc il must take into account vetoes, the most extreme form of nonc ompliance. That exercise is exclude d, how ever, be cause of t he conc lusions that would fol low at onc e. The issue of the veto was not entirely ignore d duri ng the preparation for the Iraq inva sion. France's threat to veto a UN declaration of war was bitterly conde mned. \"They said they are going to veto anything that held Sadda m to account ,\" Bus h declared, with his familiar conc ern for truth, as he delivered his ultimatum to the Security Counc il on March 16, 2003. There was much fury about France's iniquity, and talk of actions to puni sh the count ry that did not follow orde rs from Cra wford, Texas. In general, threat of veto by others is a scanda l, revealing the \"failure of diplomacy\" and the miserable behavior of the UN.

Bus h and Blair unde rscored their contempt for internationa l law and institutions at their subs eque nt summit meeting at a US military base in the Azores, where they were joined by Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. The US-UK leaders \"issued an ultimatum\" to the United Nations Security Counc il: capitulate in twenty-four hours or we will inva de Iraq and impos e the regime of our choice without your meaningless seal of approva l, and we will do so\" crucially\" whether or not Sadda m Hussein and his family leave the count ry. Our inva sion is legitimate, Bus h declared, because \"the United States of America has the sove reign authori ty to use forc e in assuring its own nationa l security,\" threatened by Iraq with or without Sadda m. The UN is irrelevant because it \"ha s not lived up to its respons ibilities\"\" that is, to follow Washington's orde rs. The US will \"enforc e the just demands of t he world\" e ven if the world ove rwhelmingly obj ects.43 Washington also took pains to ensure that the essential hollow-ness of offi cial declarations was in plain view, for all the world to see. At a news confe rence on March 6, the president stated that there is only \"a single que stion: Has the Iraqi regime fully and unc ondi tiona lly disarmed as required by 1441, or has it not?\" He then immediately went on to make it clear that the answer to the single que stion did not matter, announc ing that \"when it comes to our security we really don' t need anyone 's permission.\" UN inspections and Security Counc il deliberations were therefore a farce, and even completely verified compliance was irrelevant. A few days earlier Bus h had declared the answer to the \"single que stion\" immaterial: the US will institute the regime of its choice even if Sadda m disarms completely, and even if he and his cohort s disappe ar, as unde rscored at the Azores summit.44 The president's disregard of the single que stion was in fact already on the record. A few months earlier, White Hous e spoke sman Ari Fleischer had inform ed the press that \"the policy of the United Noam Chom sky 19 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"States is regime change , with or without inspectors\"; \"regime change \" doe s not mean a regime that Iraqis might prefer, but one that the conque ror will impos e, calling it \"de mocratic,\" which is standa rd pra ctice; even Rus sia installed \"pe ople's democracies.\" Later, with the war winding dow n, Fleischer restored the \"single que stion\" to its primary status: Iraq's pos session of WMD \"is what this war was about and is about .\" As Bus h was presenting his self-contradictory stance at his news confe rence, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw announc ed that if Sadda m Hussein disarmed, \"we accept that the gove rnm ent of Iraq stays in place,\" so that the \"single que stion\" is disarmament: talk about \"liberation\" and \"de mocracy\" is mere fluff, and Britain will not support Bus h's resort to war on his grounds \" except that Britain made it clear that it would do a s it was told.45 Meanwhile Col in Powell contradicted the president's declaration that the US will take control of Iraq no matter what: \"The que stion simply is: has Sadda m Hussein made a strategic, political decision to comply with the United Nations Security Counc il resolutions [and] to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction? That's it in a nutshell... . That's the que stion. There is no other que stion.\" Back to the \"single que stion,\" rejected by the president five days earlier and again the following day. As the inva sion began, Powell returne d to the \"single que stion.\" Iraq \"was being attacked because it had violated its 'internationa l obligations ' unde r its 1991 surre nde r agreement, which required the disclosure and disarmament of its dange rous weapons .\"46 Everything else that has been claimed is therefore irrelevant: the US will unilaterally decide that the inspectors shoul d not be permitted to do their work, and the 1991 agreement entitles the US to resort to violence, contrary t o its explicit wordi ng. Pick some other da y and a udience and t he goa l is \"liberation\" a nd \"de mocracy\" not onl y for Ira q but for the region, a \"nobl e dream.\" The message is clear: We will do what we choos e, giving whatever pretext happe ns to be on ha nd. Y ou w ill \"catch up,\" or e lse. Unexplained is why the threat of WMD became so severe after September 2002, while before Nationa l Security Adviser Rice had accepted the cons ensus that \"if they do acquire WMD, their weapons will be unus able because any a ttempt to us e them will bri ng na tiona l obl iteration.\"47 Punishment for being \"against us\" can be severe, and the benefits of catching up and remaining \"relevant\" are subs tantial. Senior US offi cials were dispatched to Security Counc il members to \"urge leaders to vote with the United States on Iraq or risk 'paying a heavy price,' \" not an insignificant conc ern for fragile count ries \"whos e conc erns drew little attention before they lande d seats on the counc il.\" Mexican diplomats tried to explain to Washington's emissaries that the people \"are ove rwhelmingly oppos ed to a war,\" but that plea was dismissed as ridiculous .48 A special probl em arose for \"count ries that have succumbed to popul ar pressure to embrace democracy [and] now have a publ ic to answer to.\" For them, repercussions for taking democratic form s serious ly may include econom ic strangul ation. In contrast, \"Mr. Powell made clear that US political and military allies will benefit from handout s.\" Ari Fleischer meanwhile \"hot ly denied\" that Bus h was offe ring quid pro quos in exchange for votes, \"evoki ng peals of laught er from the press corps ,\" the Wall Street Journa l report ed.49 Rewards for following orde rs include not only financial handout s but also authori zation to escalate terrori st atrocities. Rus sian president Vladimir Putin, whos e relations with Bus h are report ed to be particularly soulful, was awarded \"a diplomatic nod for Rus sia's crackdow n on Che chen separatists\" a move that some analysts here and in the Middle East contend could damage long-t erm US interests.\" One might imagine some other reasons to be conc erned about Washington's support for state terrori sm.

Remarkably, Turke y did not fully subm it, teaching a lesson in democracy to the West that arous ed great ire and, as Secretary of State Powell sternly announc ed at onc e, instant puni shment for t he misdeed.51 The \"diplomatic niceties\" are for thos e who prefer to be delude d, as is the appa rent support of Security Counc il members for the US-initiated Resolution 1441. The support is in fact subm ission; signe rs unde rstood what the alternative would be. In systems of law that are intende d to be taken serious ly, coerced acquiescence is inva lid. In internationa l affairs, how ever, it is honore d as diplomacy. After the Iraq war, the UN again prove d \"irrelevant,\" because its \"complicated trade system for Iraq\" caused probl ems for US companies granted contracts unde r US military rule. The complicated trade system was in fact impos ed by the US as part of its sanctions regime, for which there was virtually no support outside the UK. But now it was in the way. Hence, in the words of a \"coalition diplomat,\" the US wanted \"the message to be, 'We're coming here [to the Security Counc il] because we want to, not because we have to.' \" The background issue, diplomats on all sides agree, is \"how much of a free hand the U.S. shoul d be given to manage Iraqi oil and establish a successor gove rnm ent.\" Washington demands a free hand. Other count ries, a large majority of the US popul ation, and (to the extent that we have inform ation) the people of Iraq prefer \"to extend U.N. ove rsight there\" and \"to norm alize Iraq's diplomatic and econom ic relations ,\" as well as its internal affairs, within that fra mework.52 Through all the shifts of justifications and pretexts, one principle remains inva riant: the US must end up i n effective control of Ira q, unde r some facade of de mocracy if that prove s feasible.

Elite Concerns Within establishment circles, there has been cons iderable conc ern that \"America's imperial ambition\" is a serious threat even to its own popul ation. Their alarm reached new heights as the Bus h administration declared itself to be a \"revisionist state\" that intends to rule the world permanently, becoming, some felt, \"a menace to itself and to mankind\" unde r the leadership of \"radical nationa lists\" aiming for \"uni lateral world dom ination through absolute military supe riority.\"53 Many others within the mainstream spectrum have been appa lled by the adve nturism and arroga nce of the radical nationa lists who have regained the pow er they wielded through t he 1980s , but now ope rate with fe wer external cons traints. Noam Chom sky 21 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The conc erns are not entirely new. During the Clinton years, the prom inent political analyst Samuel Huntington obs erved that for much of the world the US is \"be coming the rogue supe rpow er, [cons idered] the single greatest external threat to their societies.\" Robe rt Jervis, then president of the American Political Science Association, warned that \"in the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state toda y is the United States.\" Like others, they anticipated that coalitions might arise to count erbalance the rogue supe rpow er, w ith threatening i mplications .54 Several leading figure s of the fore ign policy elite have pointed out that the potential targets of America's imperial ambition are not likely simply to await destruction. They \"know that the United States can be held at bay only by deterrence,\" Kenne th Waltz has written, and that \"weapons of mass destruction are the only means to deter the United States.\" Washington's policies are therefore leading to prol iferation of WMD, Waltz conc lude s, tende ncies accelerated by its commitment to dismantle internationa l mechanisms to control the resort to violence. These warnings were reiterated as Bus h prepared to attack Iraq: one cons eque nce, accordi ng to Steven Miller, is that others \"are likely to draw the conc lusion that weapons of mass destruction are necessary to deter American intervention.\" Another well-know n specialist warned that the \"ge neral strategy of preventive war\" is likely to provi de others with \"ove rwhelming incentives to wield weapons of terror and mass destruction\" as a deterrent to \"the unbri dled use of American pow er.\" Many have noted the likely impetus to Iranian nuc lear weapons progra ms. And \"there is no que stion that the lesson that the North Koreans have learned from Iraq is that it needs a nuc lear deterrent,\" Selig Harrison c ommented.55 As the year 2002 drew to a close, Washington was teaching an ugly lesson to the world: if you want to defend yours elf from us, you had better mimic North Korea and pos e a credible military threat, in this case, conve ntiona l: artillery aimed at Seoul and at US troops near the DMZ. We will enthus iastically march on to attack Iraq, because we know that it is devastated and defenseless; but North Korea, though an even worse tyranny and vastly more dange rous , is not an appropri ate target as long a s it can cause plenty of ha rm. The lesson c ould ha rdly be more vivid. Still another conc ern is the \"second supe rpow er,\" publ ic opinion. Not only was the \"revisionism\" of the political leadership without precedent; so too was the oppos ition to it. Com parisons are often drawn to Vietnam. The common que ry \"W hat happe ned to the tradition of prot est and dissent?\" makes clear how effectively the historical record has been cleansed and how little sense there is, in many circles, of the change s in publ ic cons cious ness ove r the past four decades. An accurate comparison is revealing: In 1962, publ ic prot est was none xistent, despite the announc ement that year that the Kenne dy administration was sending the US Air Force to bom b South Vietnam, as well as initiating plans to drive millions of people into what amount ed to conc entration camps and launc hing chemical warfare progra ms to destroy food crops and ground cove r. Protest did not reach any meaningful level until years later, after hundre ds of thous ands of US troops had been dispatched, densely popul ated areas had been demolished by saturation bom bing, and the aggre ssion had spread to the rest of Indoc hina. By the time prot est became significant, the bitterly anticommunist military hi storian and Indoc hina specialist Be rnard F all had w arned that \"V ietnam as a cultural and historic entity ... is threatened with extinction\" as \"the count ryside literally dies unde r the blows of t he largest military m achine ever unl eashed on a n area of t his size.\"56 In 2002, fort y years later, in striking contrast, there was large-scale, committed, and principled popul ar prot est before the war had been offi cially launc hed. Absent the fear and illusion about Iraq that were unique to the US, prewar oppos ition would proba bly have reached much the same levels as elsewhere. That reflects a steady increase ove r these years in unw illingne ss to tolerate aggre ssion and a trocities, one of m any s uch change s.

These reviews are secret, but in 1989 a passage was leaked conc erning \"cases where the U.S. confront s much weaker enemies.\" The analysts advised that the US must \"de feat them decisively and rapidly.\" Any other outcome would be \"embarrassing\" and might \"unde rcut political support ,\" unde rstood t o be thin.58 We are no longe r in the 1960s , when the popul ation would tolerate a murde rous and destructive war for years without visible prot est.

These have surely been factors in the general decline of trust in leadership revealed by a World Econom ic Forum poll released in Janua ry 2003. Accordi ng to the poll, only NGO leaders had the trust of a clear majority, followed by UN and spiritual/religious leaders, then leaders of Western Europe and econom ic managers, and right below them, corpora te executives. Far below, at the very bottom, were the leaders of t he United States.59 A week after the poll was released, the annua l World Econom ic Forum ope ned in Davos , Switzerland, but without the exube rance of earlier years. \"The mood has darkened,\" the press noted: for the \"move rs and shakers,\" it was not \"globa l party time\" anym ore. The founde r of the WEF, Klaus Schwab, identified the most pressing reason: \"Ira q will be the ove rwhelming theme of all the discussions .\" Powell's aides warned him before his presentation that the mood was \"ugl y\" at Davos , the Wall Street Journa l report ed. \"A chorus of internationa l complaints about the American march toward war with Iraq was reaching a crescendo at this gathering of some 2,000 corpora te executives, politicians and academics.\" They were not ove rwhelmed by Powell's \"sharp new message\": in his own words , \"when we feel strongl y about something we will lead,\" even if no one is fol lowing us . \"W e will act even if ot hers are not pre pared to join us .\"60 The theme of t he WEF was \"Bui lding T rust,\" for good re asons . In his speech, Powell stressed that the US reserves the \"sove reign right to take military action\" when and how it choos es. He said furt her that no one \"trusts Sadda m and his regime,\" which was certainly true, though his comment left out some other leaders who are not trusted. Powell also assured his audience that Sadda m Hussein's weapons were \"meant to intimidate Iraq's neighbors ,\" failing to explain why thos e neighbors did not seem to perceive the threat.61 Much as they despised the murde rous tyrant, Iraq's neighbors joined the \"many outside the United States mystified at why Washington is so obs essed and fearful of what is, in the end, a minor pow er whos e wealth and pow er have been trunc ated by internationa lly impos ed cons traints.\" Aware of the dire effects of the sanctions on the general popul ation, they also kne w that Iraq was one of the weakest states in the Noam Chom sky 23 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"region: its econom y and military expe nditures were a fraction of Kuwait's, which has 10 percent of Iraq's popul ation, and much farther below thos e of others nearby.62 For these and other reasons , the neighbori ng count ries had been mending fences with Iraq for some years ove r strong US oppos ition. Like the US Department of Defense and the CIA , they kne w \"pe rfectly well that toda y's Iraq pos es no threat to anyone in the region, let alone in the United States,\" and that \"To argue otherwise is dishone st.\"63 By the time they met, the \"move rs and shakers\" at Davos had heard even more unpl easant news about \"bui lding trust.\" An opinion poll in Canada found that more than \"36 percent of Canadians viewed the US as the bigge st threat to world peace, against just 21 percent naming Al Qaeda, 17 percent choos ing Iraq and 14 percent North Korea.\" That despite the fact that the general image of the US had improve d to 72 percent in Canada, in contrast to droppi ng sharply in Western Europe . An inform al poll run by Time magazine found that more than 80 percent of responde nts in Europe regarded the US as the greatest threat to world peace.

The headline read, \"Dange r Ahead?

But within a year, the administration succeeded in provi ding an answer: \"Be cause of you and your associates, Mr. Bus h, and what you have done . And if you continue , the fear and hatred you have inspired may extend to the count ry you have shamed as well.\" On that, the evidence is hard to ignore . For Osama bin Laden, it is a victory proba bly beyond his wildest dreams. Intentional Ignorance The funda mental assumption that lies behind the imperial grand strategy, often cons idered unne cessary to form ulate because its truth is taken to be so obvi ous , is the guiding principle of Wilsonian idealism: We\" at least the circles who provi de the leadership and advise them\" are good, even nobl e. Hence our interventions are necessarily righteous in intent, if occasiona lly clumsy in execution. In Wilson's own words , we have \"elevated ideals\" and are dedicated to \"stability and righteous ness,\" and it is only natural, then, as Wilson wrote in justifying the conque st of the Philippines, that \"our interest must march forw ard, altruists though we are; other nations must see to it that they stand off, a nd do not seek to stay us .\"66 In the contempora ry version, there is a guiding principle that \"de fines the parameters within which the policy debate occurs,\" a cons ensus so broa d as to exclude only \"tattered remnants\" on the right Noam Chom sky 24 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"and left and \"so authori tative as to be virtually immune to challenge .\" The principle is \"'America as historical vangua rd\": \"History has a discernible direction and destination. Unique ly among all the nations of the world, the United States comprehends and manifests history' s purpos e.\" Accordi ngly, US hegemony is the realization of history' s purpos e, and what it achieves is for the common good, the merest truism, so that empirical evaluation is unne cessary, if not faintly ridiculous . The primary principle of fore ign policy, root ed in Wilsonian idealism and carried ove r from Clinton to Bus h II, is \"the imperative of America's mission as the vangua rd of history, transform ing the globa l orde r and, in doing so, perpetuating its own dom inance,\" guided by \"the imperative of military supre macy, m aintained in pe rpetuity and proj ected gl oba lly.\"67 By virtue of its unique comprehension and manifestation of history' s purpos e, America is entitled, inde ed obligated, to act as its leaders determine to be best, for the good of all, whether others unde rstand or not. And like its nobl e predecessor and curre nt junior partner, Great Britain, America shoul d not be deterred in realizing history' s transcende nt purpos e even if it is \"he ld up to obloquy\" by the fool ish and resentful, as was its predecessor in globa l rule, accordi ng to its most prestigious advoc ates.68 To still any qua lms that might arise, it suffi ces to refresh our unde rstanding that \"Provi dence summons Americans\" to the task of reform ing globa l orde r: the \"W ilsonian tradition ... to which all recent occupa nts of the Oval Office, regardless of party, have adhe red\"\" as have, commonly, their predecessors, their count erparts elsewhere, and their most reviled enemies, with required change of names.69 But to reassure ours elves that the pow erful are motivated by \"elevated ideals\" and \"altruism\" in the que st of \"stability and righteous ness,\" we have to adopt the stance called \"intentiona l ignora nce\" by a critic of the terrible atrocities in Central America in the 1980s backed by the political leadership that is again at the helm in Washington.70 Adopt ing that stance, not only can we tidy up the past, conc eding the inevitable flaws that accompany even the best of intentions , but more recently, since the adve nt of the new norm of hum anitarian intervention, we can even go on to port ray US fore ign policy as having entered a \"nobl e pha se\" with a \"saintly glow.\" Washington's \"pos t-Col d War interventions were, on the whole, nobl e but half-he arted; they were half-he arted because they were nobl e,\" historian Michael Mande lbaum assures us. Perhaps we are even too saintly: we must beware of \"gra nting idealism a near exclusive hold on our fore ign policy,\" more sobe r voices warn, thus neglecting our own legitimate interests in our dedicated service to ot hers.71 Somehow , Europe ans have failed to unde rstand the unique idealism of American leaders. How can this be, since it is the merest truism? Max Boot sugge sts an answer. Europe has \"oft en been driven by avarice,\" and the \"cynical Europe ans\" cannot comprehend the \"strain of idealism\" that animates US fore ign policy: \"After 200 years, Europe still hasn't figure d out what makes America tick.\" Their ineradicable cynicism leads Europe ans to attribute base motives to Washington and to fail to join its nobl e ventures with suffi cient enthus iasm. Another respected historian and political commentator, Robe rt Kagan, offe rs a different explanation. Europe 's probl em is that it is cons umed with \"pa ranoid, cons piratorial anti-Americanism,\" which has \"reached a fevered intensity,\" though fort una tely a few figure s, like Be rlusconi and A znar, bra ve the storm .72 Unwittingly, no doubt , Boot and Kagan are plagiarizing John Stuart Mill's classic essay on hum anitarian intervention, in which he urge d Britain to unde rtake the enterpri se vigorous ly\" specifically, to conque r more of Indi a. Britain must purs ue this high-m inde d mission, Mill explained, even though it will be \"he ld up to obloquy\" on the continent. Unmentione d was that by doing so, Britain was striking still furt her devastating blows at Indi a and extending the near- monopol y of opium produc tion that it needed both to forc e ope n Chi nese markets by violence and to sustain the imperial system more broa dly by means of its immense narcotrafficking enterpri ses, Noam Chom sky 25 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"all well know n in England at the time. But such matters could not be the sourc e of the \"obl oquy.\" Rather, Europe ans are \"exciting odium against us,\" Mill wrote, because they are una ble to comprehend t hat England i s truly \"a nove lty in the world,\" a remarkable nation t hat acts onl y \"i n the service of others.\" It is dedicated to peace, though if \"the aggre ssions of barbarians forc e it to a successful war,\" it selflessly bears the cost while \"the frui ts it shares in fraternal equa lity with the whole hum an race,\" including the barbarians it conque rs and destroys for their own benefit. England is not only peerless but near perfect, in Mill's view, with no \"aggre ssive designs ,\" desiring \"no be nefit to itself at the expe nse of ot hers.\" It s pol icies are \"bl ameless and l auda ble.\" E ngland w as the nineteenth-century count erpart of the \"idealistic new world bent on ending inhum anity,\" motivated by pure altruism and unique ly dedicated to the highe st \"pri nciples and values,\" though also sadly misunde rstood by the cynical or perhaps paranoid Europe ans.73 Mill's essay was written as Britain enga ged in some of the worst crimes of its imperial reign. It is hard to think of a more distingui shed and truly honora ble intellectual\" or a more disgraceful example of apologe tics for terrible crimes. Such facts might inspire some reflection as Boot and Kagan illustrate Marx's dictum about tragedy replayed as farce. It is also worth recalling that the record of continental imperialism is even worse, and the rhetoric that accompanied it no less glorious , as when France gained Mill's approva l by carryi ng out its civilizing mission in Algeria\" while \"exterminating the indigenous popul ation,\" t he French m inister of w ar de clared.74 Kagan's conc ept of \"anti-Americanism,\" while conve ntiona l, also merits reflection. In such pronounc ements, the term anti-American and its variants (\"ha ting America,\" and the like) are regularly employe d to defame critics of state policy who may admire and respect the count ry, its culture, and its achievements, inde ed think it is the greatest place on earth. Nevertheless, they \"ha te America\" and are \"anti-American\" on the tacit assumption that the society and its people are to be identified with state pow er. This usage is drawn directly from the lexicon of totalitarianism. In the form er Rus sian empire, dissidents were guilty of \"anti-Sovietism.\" Perhaps critics of Bra zil's military dictatorship were labeled \"anti-Bra zilian.\" Among people with some commitment to freedom and democracy, such attitude s are inconc eivable. It would only arous e ridicule in Rom e or Milan if a critic of Berlusconi's policies were conde mned as \"anti-Italian,\" though perhaps it would have passed in M ussolini's day. It is useful to remember that no matter where we turn, there is rarely any short age of elevated ideals to accompany the resort to violence. The words accompanying the \"W ilsonian tradition\" may be stirring in their nobi lity, but shoul d also be examined in practice, not just rhetoric: for example, Wilson's call for c onque st of t he Philippines, already m entione d; or a s pre sident, his interventions in Haiti and the Dominican Republ ic that left both count ries in ruins; or what Walter LaFeber calls the \"W ilson corol lary\" to the Monroe Doctrine, which dictated \"that only American oil interests receive conc essions \" w ithin the reach of i ts pow er.75 The same is true of the worst tyrants. In 1990, Sadda m Hussein warned Kuwait of pos sible retribution for actions that were unde rmining Iraq's battered econom y after Iraq had prot ected Kuwait duri ng the war with Iran. But he assured the world that he wanted not \"pe rmanent fighting, but permanent peace ... and a dignified life.\"76 In 1938, President Roos evelt's close confi dant Sumner Welles praised the Munich agreement with the Nazis and felt that it might lead to a \"ne w world orde r based upon justice and upon law.\" Short ly after, they carried the proj ect forw ard by occupyi ng parts of Czechos lova kia, while Hitler explained that they were \"filled with earnest desire to serve the true interests of the peoples dwelling in this area, to safegua rd the nationa l individua lity of the German and Czech peoples, and to furt her the peace and social welfare of all.\" Mussolini's conc erns for the \"liberated popul ations \" of Ethiopia were no less exalted.

Kenne dy, re spectively).78 We need not assume that these prot estations are disinge nuous , no matter how grot esque they may be. Often one finds the same rhetoric in internal doc uments, where there is no obvi ous reason to dissemble: for example, the argum ent by Stalin's diplomats that \"to create real democracies, some outside pressure would be necessary... . We shoul d not hesitate to use this kind of 'interference into the dom estic affairs' of other nations ... since democratic gove rnm ent is one of the main gua rantees of dura ble peace.\"79 Others agree, doubt less with no l ess sincerity, urgi ng t hat we should not hesitate before police repression by the local government. This is not shameful since the Communists are essentially traitors. ... It is better to have a strong regime in power than a liberal government if it is indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by Communists. George Kenna n, in this case, briefing US ambassadors in Latin America on the need to be guided by a pragmatic conc ern for \"the prot ection of our raw materials\"\" ours , wherever they happe n to be located, to which we must preserve our inhe rent \"right of access,\" by conque st if necessary, in accord w ith the ancient law of na tions .80 It requires a heavy dos e of intentiona l ignora nce and loya lty to pow er to delete from memory the hum an cons eque nces of instituting and sustaining \"strong regimes.\" The same talents are needed to sustain faith in the appe al to nationa l security invoke d to justify the use of forc e, a pretext that can rarely be uphe ld for a ny s tate, on i nspection of t he historical and doc umentary re cord. As these few examples illustrate, even the harshest and most shameful measures are regularly accompanied by profe ssion of nobl e intent. An hone st look would only generalize Thom as Jefferson's obs ervation on t he world situation of hi s day: We believe no more in Bonapar te's fighting merely for the liberties of the seas, than in Great Britain's fighting for the liberties of mankind. The object is the same, to draw to themselves the power, the wealth, and t he resources of other nations.81 A century later, Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state, Robe rt Lansing (who also appe ars to have had few illusions about Wilson-i an idealism), commented scornful ly on \"how willing the British, French or Italians are to accept a manda te\" from the League of Nations , as long as \"there are mines, oil fields, rich grain fields or railroads\" that will \"make it a profi table unde rtaking.\" These \"uns elfish gove rnm ents\" declare that manda tes must be accepted \"for the good of mankind\": \"they will do their share by administering the rich regions of Mesopot amia, Syria, &c.\" The prope r assessment of t hese pre tensions is \"so m anifest that it is almost an insult to state it.\"82 Noam Chom sky 27 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"And manifest inde ed it is, when declarations of nobl e intent are profe rred by others.

An era of enlightenment and benevolence was upon us, in which the civilized nations , led by the United States, then \"at the height of its glory,\" acted out of \"altruism\" and \"moral fervor\" i n purs uit of e xalted ideals.1 Such a shift would be a comfort ing developm ent inde ed. But to join the chorus of self- congra tulation, w e would ne ed to ove rlook s ome recalcitrant facts. The first and m ost striking i s the record of t error a nd c riminal atrocities carried out with the decisive support of the reigning supe rpow er and its allies in very recent years, continuing without noticeable change , and suppre ssed as effectively as in the past within the prevailing intellectual culture, matters of great significance, which do not disappe ar from actual history merely because that is the preference of i ts caretakers. Taking a longe r view, we would also be compelled to disregard the fact that ove r the last millennium, \"war has been the dom inant activity of Europe an states.\" And we would have to put aside the basic reason for that unpl easant reality: \"the central, tragic fact is simple: coercion works ; thos e who apply subs tantial forc e to their fellows get compliance, and from that compliance draw the multiple adva ntages of mone y, goods , deference, [and] access to pleasures denied to less pow erful people\"2—a fact of life unde rstood all too well by most of the people of the world, but a principle of s tatecraft that has been re scinde d, s o w e are now told, not for t he first time. One more immediate way to evaluate the pros pects that were hailed with such enthus iasm is to cons ider the flow of US military aid. A good starting point is the year 1997, when the US fore ign policy was laude d for entering a \"nobl e pha se\" with a \"saintly glow,\" setting the tone for the rhetorical flights that ensued. At the munda ne level of fact, 1997 was of some significance for the hum an rights move ment. In that single year the flow of US arms to Turke y exceeded the combined total of US military aid to Turke y for the entire Col d War period prior to the ons et of its count erinsurge ncy campaign against its miserably repressed Kurdi sh popul ation. By 1997 the campaign had driven millions of people from the devastated count ryside, with tens of thous ands killed and every imaginable form of barbaric torture, ranking high among the crimes of the grisly 1990s . As atrocities escalated, Turke y became the leading recipient of US arms worldwide, Israel and E gypt aside, with 80 pe rcent of i ts suppl y coming from Washington. In the same year, US military aid to Col ombia began to skyroc ket, increasing from $50 million to $290 million two years later, and rapidly grow ing since. By 1999 Col ombia had replaced Turke y as the world leader in US military aid. Further militarization of Col ombia's internal confl icts, deeply root ed in the awful history of a rich society with extreme pove rty and violence, had the predictable cons eque nces for the tortured popul ation and also led gue rrilla forc es to become yet another army terrori zing the peasantry and, more recently, the urba n popul ation as well. The most prom inent Col ombian hum an rights orga nization estimates the num ber of people forc efully displaced at 2.7 million, increasing by 1,000 a day. They estimate that more than 350,000 people were driven from their hom es by violence in the first nine months of 2002, more than in all of 2001. Political killings Noam Chom sky 29 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"were report ed to ha ve risen to twenty a day, doubl e the level of 1998. In the case of the leading recipients of US military aid, the reaction is silence, and increased support for t he atrocities. Cons ider, for comparison, the most demonic and dange rous member of the \"axis of evil.\" The New York Times report s that \"as many as a million people have been relocated inside Iraq,\" conc luding accurately that \"one element of the misery caused by President Sadda m Hussein's rule\" is the internally displaced popul ation.3 The article was headlined \"Uproot ed Iraqis See War as Path to Lost Homes.\" There has been no inqui ry into whether Kurds and Col ombians, uproot ed with extreme violence, appa rently in even greater num bers, might also see war as a path to lost hom es. The propos al would, in fact, be outlandish. Washington could alleviate the misery and perhaps clear the way to a more subs tantial solution to deeply root ed probl ems by simply withdra wing its support for atrocities. But that would require at the very least a willingne ss on the part of the educ ated classes to look into the mirror instead of restricting themselves to lamentations on the crimes of offi cial enemies, about which there is oft en little that can be done . East Timor and Kosovo Just as Col ombia was replacing Turke y as the leading recipient of US military aid, another tale of horror was unfol ding that Washington could easily have brought to a quick end: East Timor. In 1999, Indone sia escalated the atrocities in the territory they had inva ded in 1975, killing perhaps 200,000 people with the military and diplomatic support of the US and Britain, assisted by \"intentiona l ignora nce.\" In the early months of 1999, Indone sian forc es and their paramilitary associates adde d several thous and more to the death toll,4 while the ruling generals announc ed that worse would come if the popul ation voted the wrong way in an Augus t 30 referendum on inde pende nce—a s they did, with amazing coura ge. The Indone sian military made good on its prom ise, driving hundre ds of thous ands from their hom es and destroyi ng most of the count ry. For the first time, the atrocities were well publ icized in the United States. On September 8, the Clinton administration reacted by reiterating its pos ition that East Timor is \"the respons ibility of the Gove rnm ent of Indone sia, and we don' t want to take that respons ibility away from them.\" A few days later, unde r strong internationa l and dom estic pressure, Clinton reversed the 25-ye ar policy of support for Indone sia's crimes in East Timor, and inform ed the Indone sian military that Washington would no longe r directly support their crimes. They immediately withdre w from the territory, allowing a n A ustralian-led U N peacekeeping forc e to enter unoppos ed.5 The lesson was crystal clear: as a handful of activists and critics had been saying for almost twenty- five years, there had never been any need for threats or forc eful measures. It would have suffi ced to withdra w from participation for some of the worst crimes of the late twentieth century to have come to a halt. But that was not the lesson that was drawn. Instead, the doc trinal system, rising to the challenge , drew the required conc lusion: the events in East Timor demons trated that fore ign policy had entered into a \"nobl e pha se,\" as the leaders of the civilized West purs ued their dedication to \"pri nciples and va lues.\" That recasting is an impressive achievement. One wonde rs whether it would be pos sible to contrive a hypot hetical series of e vents that could not be adapted to prove the required thesis. East Timor was offe red as a crucial example of the era of enlightenment with its new \"norm s of hum anitarian intervention.\" There was no intervention, let alone hum anitarian intervention.6 Thos e who were at the height of their glory were still persisting in their decades-old participation in Indone sia's crimes just at the moment when these accolades appe ared.

Account s in the media, journa ls of opinion, and scholarship rarely depart from it. To select some typical examples, we read that after \"violence surge d\" in Kosovo in 1998, Serb forc es \"responde d with an ethnic-cleansing campaign and drove more than half the Albanian popul ation into exile ... The grow ing bloods hed led the U.S. and its allies ... to launc h a massive bom bing campaign, ... allowing Albanian refuge es to return.\"8 \"In the spring of 1999 [Serbs] appe ared to be conduc ting an ethnic cleansing campaign\"; Albanian Kosova rs \"fled the assault, ... recount ing stories of summary executions and forc ed expul sions \" when they reached neighbori ng count ries, and these expul sions and atrocities \"elicited the NATO bom bing campaign\" on March 24.9 Hence the intervention in Kosovo was \"pure ly for the benefit of the people of the region, ... an act of altruism,\" like all US interventions in the region.10 It was \"absolutely right,\" Timothy Garton Ash conc lude s, because it passed the \"ve ry high ... threshold for such hum anitarian intervention, ... something approa ching genoc ide, by the killing or 'ethnic cleansing' of l arge num bers of i ts people\" by t he Serbian gove rnm ent.11 Surely this establishes the case and justifies the praise for the altruistic leaders ope ning a new era of enlightenment. And s o it might, if the claims had any re lation t o the facts. The small sample of quot es presented above is typical in several interesting respects. First, the account s are given without any evidence, though an enorm ous amount was available from impeccable Western sourc es. Second, the standa rd picture reverses the orde r of events. Uncontrove rsially, the bom bing preceded the ethnic cleansing and atrocities, which were, in fact, its anticipated cons eque nce. Kosovo was an ugly place before the NATO bom bing, with an estimated 2,000 killed on all sides duri ng the preceding year. However, the rich Western doc umentary record reveals no change s of significance until the March 24 bom bing began, apart from a slight increase in Serbian atrocities two days earlier, when monitors were withdra wn in anticipation of the NATO attack. The UN began registering refuge es a week later. These basic facts were well know n by May 1999, when the Milosevic indictment was presented; it detailed a series of terrible crimes, which had, how ever, virtually w ithout exception t aken pl ace after the bom bing. On March 24, as the bom bing began, British defense minister George Robe rtson (later NATO secretary-ge neral) testified before the Hous e of Com mons that until mid-Janua ry 1999, \"the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was respons ible for more deaths in Kosovo than the Serbian authori ties had been.\" He was referring to the Albanian gue rrillas, by then CIA -backed—w ho had explained frankly that their goa l was to kill Serbs so as to elicit a harsh reaction that would lead to publ ic support in the West for NATO intervention. A subs eque nt parliamentary inqui ry revealed that Foreign Secretary Robi n Cook had told the Hous e on Janua ry 18 that the KLA had \"committed more breaches of the ceasefire, and until this weekend was respons ible for more deaths than the [Yugos lav] s ecurity forc es.\"12 Robe rtson and Cook are specifically referring to a massacre carried out by the security forc es at Racak on Janua ry 15, in which fort y-fi ve people were report ed killed. But since Western doc umentation reveals no notable change in the distribution of violence after Racak, their conc lusions , if valid in mid-Janua ry, essentially remained so in late March. It was clear at the time that such massacres were of no conc ern to the US or UK leadership. Thus , the Liquica massacre in East Timor short ly after was appa rently far worse, was only one of many, and had no pretext of Noam Chom sky 31 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"self-de fense. Still, this and other massacres led to no change in US-UK support for the Indone sian inva ders. Putting aside such selective conc erns, how ever, the voluminous Western evidence doe s not reveal any s ignificant shift in K osovo be fore the bom bing. Serious scholarship reaches similar conc lusions . Nicholas Wheeler, who doe s not inve rt the chronol ogy, estimates that Serbs had killed 500 Albanians before the NATO bom bing, implying that 1,500 had been killed by the KLA. Nevertheless, he conc lude s that bom bing Serbia was a genuine case of hum anitarian intervention because \"though only a few hundre d Albanians were killed\" prior to the bom bing, \"intelligence points to this as a precursor to a major campaign of killing and ethnic cleansing.\" Again, no credible sourc es are provi ded.13 This is one of the few serious attempts to provi de any justification for the NATO bom bing apart from the inve rted chronol ogy. On March 27, three days after the bom bing of Serbia began, NATO commande r Wesley Clark inform ed the press that the vicious Serbian reaction was \"entirely predictable.\" He adde d that it had been \"ful ly anticipated\" and was \"not in any way\" a conc ern of the political leadership. In his memoirs, Clark report s that on March 6 he had inform ed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that if NATO proc eeded to bom b Serbia, \"almost certainly\" the Serbs would \"attack the civilian popul ation\" and NATO would be able to do nothing to prevent that reaction on the ground. Reviewing Clark's book, Michael Igna tieff recogni zes that accordi ng to the NATO commande r, \"the really decisive impulse\" prope lling the NATO bom bing campaign \"was not Milosevic's hum an rights violations in Kosovo before March 1999; nor was it his wholesale eviction after the bom bing began. What mattered most was the need to impos e NATO's will on a leader whos e defiance, first in Bos nia and then in Kosovo, was unde rmining the credibility of American and Europe an diplomacy and of N ATO's willpow er.\"14 That the primary conc ern was the \"credibility\" of the masters had already been made clear by Clinton and Blair. The point was reiterated in Defense Secretary William Cohe n's subs eque nt report to Congre ss, onc e the usual chronol ogical falsifications are disregarded, and it is confi rmed by Clark's memoirs. Andre w Bacevich gives an even more cynical interpre tation, dismissing all hum anitarian motives. Clinton's resort to forc e in Bos nia in 1995 and his bom bing of Serbia in 1999 were \"not , as claimed, to put a stop to ethnic cleansing or in respons e to claims of cons cience, but to preempt threats to the cohe sion of NATO and the credibility of American pow er.\" The plight of the Kosova rs,\" he alleges, was not a conc ern. The intent of the NATO bom bing was \"to provi de an object lesson to any Europe an state fancying that it was exempt from the rules of the pos t-Col d War era\" established by Washington. What count ed was \"affirming the dom inant pos ition of the United States in a Europe that was unified, integrated, and ope n.\" From the outset, \"the war's architects unde rstood [that] its purpos e had been to sustain American primacy\" in Europe and \"to fore stall the intolerable pros pect of E urope 's backsliding,\" pre sumably out of U S control.15 Four years later, Europe and the US had lost interest. Half of the Kosova rs live in pove rty. Radical Islamists have capitalized \"on the ill feelings produc ed by the internationa l community's negligent behavior,\" monopol izing the distribution of \"food, clothing, and shelter,\" as well as the tools for the cultural survi val of thos e in rura l areas, giving rise to a \"Taliban phe nom enon.\" Postwar Western policies \"m ay prove to be directly re spons ible for t he produc tion of E urope 's ow n T aliban.\"16 Kosovo and East Timor are conve ntiona lly offe red not only as the prime illustration of the new era of hum anitarian intervention but also as a demons tration of how new norm s are evolving \"toward a redefined role for the United Nations .\" The norm s that Western pow ers established in these two cases rende r the UN Cha rter obs olete.

The Need for Colonization As the tragedies of East Timor and Kosovo unfol ded in 1999, Turke y relinqui shed to Col ombia its place as leading recipient of US arms. The reason is not hard to discern: Turki sh state terror was by then a success, Col ombia's was not. Throughout the 1990s and the new era of enlightenment, Col ombia had by far the worst hum an rights record in the Western Hemisphe re and was at the same time by far the hemisphe re's leading recipient of US arms and military training, a corre lation that is well-established and would be of no slight conc ern if it were know n outside of scholarship and dissident circles. Atrocities in Col ombia include displacement of the popul ation through chemical warfare (called \"fum igation\") unde r the guise of a drug war that is hard to take serious ly. One of the leading academic authori ties notes that \"a provoc ative case can be made that US drug policy contributes effectively to the control of an ethnically distinct and econom ically deprived unde rclass at hom e and serves US econom ic and security interests abroa d.\"18 Many criminologists and obs ervers of the internationa l scene regard that as a cons iderable unde rstatement. The analysis helps explain why the US-spons ored actions are carried out with ever greater enthus iasm and zeal even as they increasingly fail to achieve the alleged goa l of dealing with dom estic drug use, and why measures that are know n to be far m ore effective, specifically pre vention a nd t reatment, are scarcely funde d. The gove rnors of Col ombia's targeted southern provi nces, along with peasants and hum an rights activists, have propos ed plans relying on manua l eradication of coca and poppi es and support for alternative crops , but to little effect. Meanwhile the land is poisone d by fum igation, children die, and t he uproot ed and s cattered vi ctims suffe r from sickne ss and i njury. Peasant agriculture is based on a rich tradition of know ledge and expe rience gained ove r many centuries, commonly passed on from mother to daught er. Though a remarkable hum an achievement, it is very fragile and can be destroye d fore ver in a single generation. It is being destroye d, and along with it, some of the richest biodiversity in the world. Campesinos , indigenous people, and Afro-Col ombians are now joining the millions in rotting slums and camps. And with the people gone , multinationa ls can strip the mount ains for coal, extract oil and other resourc es, and proba bly conve rt what is left of the land to ranching by the rich or agroe xport in an environm ent shorn of its treasures and variety. Inform ed analysts and obs ervers describe Washington's fum igation progra ms as another stage in the historical proc ess of driving poor peasants from the land for t he benefit of fore ign i nve stors and Col ombian elites. Like many other centers of turm oil and state terror, Col ombia is part of an import ant oil-produc ing region, and a significant produc er itself: much the same is true of Che chnya , Western Chi na, the Central Asian dictatorships, and other places where state violence was intensified after 9-11 on the pretext of a \"war on terror,\" and with the expe ctation that there would be a nod from Washington.

There is a new and highly regarded literary genre inqui ring into the cultural defects that keep us from respondi ng prope rly to the crimes of others. An interesting que stion no doubt , though by any reasona ble standa rd i t ranks well below a different one : Why do w e persist in our ow n crimes, either directly or through crucial support for murde rous clients? It is instructive to ask how often, or how accurately, one finds reference to Turke y, Col ombia, East Timor, and many similar examples in the contempora ry literature on the flaws in our character. There is much self-congra tulation about the new \"rul ing ideology\" in the moral universe of the enlightened states, grounde d in the principle that \"all states have a respons ibility to prot ect their citizens; if their leaders are una ble or unw illing to do so, they rende r their count ries liable to military intervention— authori zed by the Security Counc il or, failing that (as in the case of Kosovo), by individua l count ries in 'cons cience-shoc king situations .' \"19 Atrocities comparable to or much worse than anything charged to Milosevic in Kosovo before the NATO bom bing were not \"cons cience-shoc king\" when respons ibility traced back hom e, as it often did—a nd even when the crimes took place within, not just near, the borde rs of N ATO. In the case of Turke y, \"cons cience-shoc king situations \" went virtually unhe eded in the United States until the moment in early 2003 when the Turki sh gove rnm ent defied Washington's demands and followed the wishes of 95 percent of its popul ation by refusing to allow an attack on Iraq from its borde rs. At that point, one began to read about \"Turke y's gha stly record of torturing, killing, and 'disappe aring' Turki sh Kurds and destroyi ng more than 3,000 of their villages,\" with citations from hum an rights orga nizations reiterating what they had report ed in far more detail years before while the crimes were in progre ss, thanks to US aid, and could easily have been stoppe d. To this day, the decisive US role remains unde r wraps. As before , the most that can be said is that we \"tolerated\" the abus es suffe red by t he Kurds (Aryeh N eier).20 Massive contribution to major atrocities is not \"toleration.\" The time to expos e the suffe ring of the Kurds is while Washington is provi ding the means to carry out the crimes that are found shoc king in retrospect, with respons ibility safely displaced far away. Such perform ances, which are rout ine, would be deplored among offi cial enemies. Their easy acceptance in the most pow erful state in history a gain doe s not bode well for t he fut ure. Another curre ntly fashiona ble form ulation of the mission of the enlightened states holds that \"the need ... for colonisation is as great as it ever was in the nineteenth century\" to bring to the rest of the world the principles of orde r, freedom , and justice to which \"pos tmode rn\" societies are dedicated; the version offe red by Tony Blair's key fore ign policy adviser, Robe rt Coope r.21 He did not Noam Chom sky 34 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"elabora te on the \"ne ed for colonisation\" in the nineteenth century and the cons eque nces as that obligation was shoul dered by Britain, France, Belgium, and other standa rd-be arers of Western civilization, but an hone st look at the real world may well support his judgm ent that the need for colonization is as compelling now as it was in the days Coope r recalls with nos talgia.

One of these Robe rt Jervis calls a \"change of spectacular proport ions , perhaps the single most striking discontinuity that the history of internationa l politics has anyw here provi ded\": that the states of Europe now live in peace— and, some argue more controve rsially, democracies do not go to war with one another.22 It is this striking discontinuity to which Coope r allude s in joining thos e who hail the birth of a \"pos tmode rn world system\" of law, justice, and civility, though the West must \"revert to the roughe r methods of an earlier era—forc e, preemptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary, when it comes to dealing with thos e who still live in the nineteenth-century world of every state for itself.\" The West must revert to \"the laws of the jungl e ... when we are ope rating i n the jungl e\"—e xactly as it has done in the disgraceful past. Protecting Naughty Children from Infection The enlightened states of the late nineteenth century were not the first to laud themselves for liberating barbarians from their sad fate—by violence, destruction, and plunde r. They were drawing from a rich tradition of distingui shed leaders who were troubl ed by the rising \"flood of evil doc trines and pernicious examples\" and asked \"what would become of our religious and political institutions , of t he moral forc e of our gove rnm ents, and of t hat cons ervative system which ha s saved [us] from complete dissolution [if] the contagion and the inva sion of vicious principles\" is not deterred or ove rcome. In expre ssing these conc erns, the Czar and Metternich were referring to \"the pernicious doc trines of republ icanism and popul ar self-rul e [spread by] the apos tles of sedition\" in the New World—i n the rhetoric of contempora ry planne rs, a rotten apple that might spoil the barrel, a dom ino that might toppl e others. The contagion of these doc trines, they warned, \"crosses the seas, and often appe ars with all the symptoms of destruction which characterize it, in places where not even any direct contact, any relation of proxi mity might give ground for appre hension.\" Worse yet, the apos tles of sedition had just announc ed their intention to expa nd their dom inion by proc laiming the Monroe Doctrine—\"a species of arroga nce, peculiarly American and inexcusable,\" as Bismarck later de scribed it.23 Bismarck did not have to await the era of Wilsonian idealism to learn the meaning of the Monroe Doctrine, explained by Secretary of State Robe rt Lansing to President Wilson, who found his description \"una nswerable,\" though a dvising t hat it would be \"impolitic\" to let it reach the publ ic: In its advocacy of the Monroe Doctrine the United States considers its own interests. The integrity of other American nations is an incident, not an end. While this may seem based on selfishness alone, the author of the Doctrine had no higher or more generous motive in its declaration.24 The doc trine could not yet be implemented fully because of the balance of world pow er, though Wilson did secure US dom ination of the Caribbe an region by forc e, leaving a terrible legacy that remains to this day, and was able to move somewhat beyond, driving the British enemy out of oil- rich Venezuela and support ing the vicious and corrupt dictator Juan Vicente Gomez, who ope ned the count ry to US corpora tions .

The reach of US pow er was still limited in Wilson's time, but as President William Howard Taft had presciently obs erved, \"the day is not far distant [when] the whole hemisphe re will be ours in fact as, by virtue of our supe riority of race, it already is ours morally.\" Latin Americans may not unde rstand, the Wilson administration adde d, but that is because \"they are naught y children who are exercising all the privileges and rights of grow n-ups \" and require \"a stiff hand, an authori tative hand.\" More gentle means shoul d not be ove rlooke d, how ever. It may be useful to \"pa t them a little bit and make them think that you are fond of them,\" Secretary of State John Foster Dulles advised President Eisenhow er.25 There are naught y children everyw here. Wilson regarded Filipinos as \"children [who] must obe y as thos e who are in tutelage\"— at least, thos e who survi ved the liberation he had called for while extolling his altruism. His State Department also regarded Italians as \"like children [who] must be [led] and assisted more than almost any other nation.\" It was therefore right and prope r for his successors to offe r enthus iastic support for the \"fine young revolution\" of Mussolini's Fascism that crushed the threat of democracy among Italians who \"hunge r for strong leadership and enjoy ... being dra matically gove rned.\" T he conc eption re mained in pl ace through t he 1930s and w as revived immediately after the war. As the US unde rtook to subve rt Italian democracy in 1948 by withhol ding food from starving people, restoring the Fascist police, and threatening worse, the State Department's Italian desk offi cer explained that policies must be designe d so that \"even the dum best wop would sense the drift.\" Haitians were \"little more than primitive savages,\" accordi ng to Franklin Delano Roos evelt, who claimed to have rewritten the Haitian Cons titution duri ng Wilson's military occupa tion—s o as to permit US corpora tions to take ove r Haiti's land and resourc es after its recalcitrant Parliament had been sent packing by the marines. When the Eisenhow er administration was seeking to ove rthrow the newly established Castro gove rnm ent in Cuba in 1959, CIA chief Allen Dulles complained that \"there was in Cuba no oppos ition to Castro who were capable of action,\" in part because \"in these primitive count ries where the sun shone , the demands of t he people were far less than in the more adva nced societies,\" so they w ere una ware of how much they w ere suffe ring.26 The need for discipline has been reiterated forc efully ove r the years. To mention another case of contempora ry relevance, when Iran's cons ervative parliamentary gove rnm ent sought to gain control of its own resourc es, the US and Britain instigated a military coup to install an obe dient regime that ruled with terror for twenty-fi ve years. The coup sent a more far-re aching message, spelled out by the editors of the New York Times: \"Unde rdevelope d count ries with rich resourc es now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their num ber which goe s berserk with fanatical nationa lism ... Iran's expe rience [may] strengthen the hands of more reasona ble and more far-seeing leaders [elsewhere], who will have a clear-eyed unde rstanding of the principles of decent behavior.\"27 The same lesson had been taught nearer hom e, at the Cha pulte-pec (Mexico) Confe rence in Februa ry 1945 that laid the basis for the pos twar orde r now that the Monroe Doctrine could be enforc ed in the Wilsonian sense. Latin Americans were then unde r the influence of what the State Department called \"the philosophy of the New Nationa lism, [which] embraces policies designe d to bring about a broa der distribution of wealth and to raise the standa rd of living of the masses.\" Washington was conc erned that \"econom ic nationa lism is the common denom inator of the new aspirations for indus trialization\"—j ust as it had been for England, the United States, and in fact Noam Chom sky 36 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"every other count ry that succeeded in indus trializing. \"Latin Americans are convi nced that the first beneficiaries of t he developm ent of a count ry's resourc es shoul d be the people of t hat count ry.\" T hat was una cceptable: the \"first beneficiaries\" must be US inve stors, while Latin America fulfills its service func tion. The US therefore impos ed an \"Econom ic Cha rter for the Americas\" designe d to eliminate econom ic nationa lism \"in all its form s.\"28 With an exception, how ever: econom ic nationa lism remained a crucial feature of the US econom y, which relied far more than in the past on a dyna mic state sector, oft en ope rating unde r the cove r of de fense. It is useful to re call that even at the peak of t he Col d W ar m ore perceptive obs ervers unde rstood t hat the primary threat pos ed by Com munism was the econom ic transform ation of the Com munist count ries \"in ways that reduc e their willingne ss and ability to complement the indus trial econom ies of the West,\" another version of \"the philosophy of the new nationa lism,\" in this case dating from 1917.29 The same conc erns account for the persistence into the pos twar period of \"the analytical framework American policymakers had develope d and employe d duri ng the interwar years for relations with right-wing di ctatorships\" of E urope an fa scism, historian D avid Schmitz not es.30 T he poi nt has been to control the \"threat of Com munism,\" unde rstood not as a military t hreat, but very m uch in the terms just described. The \"analytical framework\" of relations with the fascist states is eminently worth recalling, if only because it has reappe ared with such cons istency right to the present and therefore can teach us a good deal about the world that has been shaped in no small measure by the most pow erful states and the private institutions that are their \"tools and tyrants,\" to borrow the words of James Madison when he contemplated with much une ase the fate of the democratic expe riment of w hich he was the leading fra mer. The rise of fascism in the interwar period elicited conc ern, but was generally regarded rather favora bly by the US and British gove rnm ents, the bus iness world, and a good deal of elite opinion. The reason was that the fascist version of extreme nationa lism permitted extensive Western econom ic penetration and also destroye d the much-fe ared labor move ments and the left, and the excessive democracy in which they could func tion. Support for Mussolini was effus ive. Across a broa d range of opinion, \"that admirable Italian gentleman\" (as President Roos evelt described him in 1933) enjoye d great respect until World War II broke out. Support extende d to Hitler's Germany as well. It is, incidentally, well to bear in mind that the most mons trous regime in history came to pow er in the count ry that by reasona ble measures represented the highe st peak of Western civilization in the sciences and the arts, and had been cons idered a mode l of democracy before internationa l confl ict took form s that could not accommoda te this conc eption;31 and—ra ther like Sadda m Hussein half a century later—re tained subs tantial Anglo-A merican support until Hitler launc hed di rect aggre ssion t hat infri nge d too s erious ly on U S and U K interests. Support for fascism began at onc e. Praising the Fascist takeove r in Italy, which quickly destroye d the parliamentary system and violently suppre ssed labor and political oppos ition, Ambassador Henry Fletcher articulated the assumptions that were to guide US policy there and elsewhere in years to come. Italy faced a stark choice, he wrote the secretary of state: either \"Mussolini and Fascism\" or 'Giolitti and Socialism\"; Giolitti was a leading figure of Italian liberalism. A decade later, in 1937, the State Department continue d to regard Europe an fascism as a mode rate forc e that \"must succeed or the masses, this time reinforc ed by the disillusione d middle classes, will again turn to the Left.\" That same year, US Ambassador to Italy William Philips was \"gre atly impressed by the effort s of Mussolini to improve the condi tions of the masses\" and found \"much evidence\" in favor of the Fascists' view that \"they represent a true democracy in as much as the welfare of the people is their pri ncipal obj ective.\" H e cons idered M ussolini's accomplishments \"astoundi ng [a nd] a Noam Chom sky 37 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"sourc e of cons tant amazement,\" and enthus iastically praised his \"gre at hum an qua lities.\" The State Department vigorous ly conc urre d, a lso lauding M ussolini's \"m agnificent\" achievements in E thiopia, and hailing Fascism for having \"brought orde r out of chaos, discipline out of license, and solvency out of bankrupt cy.\" In 1939, FDR continue d to regard Italian fascism as \"of great import ance to the world [t hough] s till in the expe rimental stage.\" In 1938, FDR and his close confi dant Sumner Welles approve d of Hitler's Munich settlement, which dismembered Czechos lova kia. As noted earlier, Welles felt that it \"pre sented the opport unity for the establishment by the nations of the world of a new world orde r based upon justice and upon law,\" in which the Nazi mode rates would play a leading role. In April 1941, George Kenna n wrote from his cons ular pos t in Berlin that German leaders have no wish to \"see other people suffe r unde r German rule,\" are \"most anxious that their new subjects shoul d be happy in their care,\" and are making \"i mport ant comprom ises\" to assure this benign out come. The bus iness world, too, was highly enthus iastic about Europe an fascism. Inve stment boom ed in Fascist Italy; \"the wops are unw op-pi ng themselves,\" Fortune magazine declared in 1934. After the rise of Hitler, inve stment boom ed in Germany for similar reasons : a stable climate had been established for bus iness ope rations , with the threat of \"the masses\" contained. Until war broke out in 1939, Scott Newton writes, Britain was even more support ive of Hitler, for reasons deeply root ed in Anglo-G erman indus trial, commercial, and financial relations , and \"a policy of self-pre servation for t he Bri tish establishment\" in the face of ri sing popul ar de mocratic pre ssures.32 Even after the US entered the war, attitude s remained ambivalent. By 1943, the US and Britain had begun their effort s, which intensified after the war, to dismantle the antifascist resistance worldwide and restore something like the traditiona l orde r, often rewarding some of the worst war criminals with prom inent roles.33 Reviewing the record, Schmitz points out that \"the ideological basis and funda mental assumptions of American policy remained remarkably cons istent\" through the rest of the century; the Col d War \"de mande d new approa ches and tactics\" but otherwise left interwar priorities unc hange d.34 The \"analytical framework\" Schmitz illustrates in detail has persisted until the present, leaving immense suffe ring and devastation. Throughout , policy planne rs have faced the \"agoni zing probl em\" of how to reconc ile a form al commitment to democracy and freedom with the ove rriding fact that \"the United States may often need to do terrible things to get what it has always wanted,\" Alan Tone lson obs erves. What the US wanted was \"econom ic policies that would enable American bus iness to ope rate as freely as pos sible and often as monopol istically as pos sible,\" with the aim of creating \"a n integrated, U nited States-dom inated capitalist world econom y. \"3S Still more ominous than the \"phi losophy of the new nationa lism\" was the threat that it could become a \"virus\" that might infect others, not by conque st but by example. That was unde rstood from the earliest days. Secretary of State Lansing warned President Wilson that the Bol shevik disease might spread, \"a very real dange r in view of the proc ess of social unre st throughout the world.\" Wilson was particularly conc erned that \"the American negro [soldiers] returni ng from abroa d\" might be infected by the example of the soldiers' and worke rs' counc ils that were being set up in Germany as the war ende d, establishing a form of democracy that was as intolerable to the West as it was to L enin and T rotsky. S imilar fe ars were expre ssed by L loyd G eorge 's gove rnm ent in Britain, which found \"hos tility to Capitalism\" to be widespread among the worki ng people of England, who were paying close attention to the popul ar counc ils that develope d in Rus sia before the Bol shevik takeove r destroye d them—c ount errevolutiona ry violence that did not alleviate elite conc erns in the West.

Bus iness leaders remained alert to \"the hazard facing indus trialists [with] the newly realized political pow er of the masses\" and the cons tant need for shaping publ ic opinion \"if we are to avoid disaster.\"36 Conc ern ove r Soviet econom ic developm ent and its demons tration effect persisted into the 1960s , when the Soviet econom y began to stagna te, in large measure because of the escalating arms race that Soviet Premier Khrus hchev had sought desperately to prevent. The Col d War itself from its origins in 1917 was in significant respects a \"North-S outh\" confl ict writ large. Rus sia had been Europe 's original \"third world,\" declining relative to the West up to World War I while serving the standa rd func tion of provi ding resourc es, markets, and inve stment opport unities. Rus sia was a special case because of its scale and military pow er, a factor of grow ing import ance after it played the leading role in defeating Nazi Germany and achieved supe rpow er status in the military dimension. But the primary threats remained as they have been throughout the non-W estern W orld: inde pende nt nationa lism and t he virus effect. On these grounds it is pos sible to explain the \"logical illogicality\" noted by the War Department in 1945, when it prepared plans for the US to take control of most of the world and surround Rus sia with military forc e while denying the adve rsary any comparable rights. The illogicality they perceived dissolves as soon as we realize that the Soviet Union might have \"flirted with the thought \" of associating itself with \"a rising tide all ove r the world wherein the common man aspires to highe r and wider hori zons .\"37 The plans were therefore logical and necessary, how ever illogical they m ay appe ar on t he surfa ce. Leading s cholars basically agree. John L ewis Gaddis realistically traces the Rus sia-US confl ict back to 1917, and explains that the immediate Western inva sion was a justified act of self-de fense. It was unde rtaken \"in respons e to a profound and potentially far-re aching intervention by the new Soviet gove rnm ent in the internal affairs, not just of the West, but of virtually every count ry in the world,\" namely, \"the Revolution's challenge ... to the very survi val of the capitalist orde r.\"38 Cha nge in the social orde r in Rus sia and the pos sibility that Rus sian developm ent might infect others therefore justified the inva sion of Rus sia. Attack is therefore defense, another \"logical illogicality\" that becomes cohe rent onc e the doc trinal appa ratus is prope rly unde rstood. On the same grounds , we can unde rstand the persistence of basic policies of the US and other leading Western pow ers before , duri ng, and after the Col d War, always in self-de fense. Note that the defensive inva sion of Rus sia in 1918 is another precursor for the doc trine of preventive war declared in September 2002 by radical nationa lists purs uing their imperial vision. Let's return to the \"striking discontinuity in internationa l politics\" at the end of World II (Robe rt Jervis). One element is that the US became a globa l actor for the first time, displacing its Europe an rivals and using its incomparable wealth and pow er to orga nize the world system, with care and skill. What Jervis had in mind, how ever, is the \"de mocratic peace.\" For centuries, Europe ans had devoted themselves to slaught ering one another, meanwhile conque ring most of the world. By 1945 they realized that the game was ove r: the next time it was played would be the last. Western pow ers can still resort to violence against the weak and defenseless, but not against one another. The Col d War supe rpow er confl ict, too, ke pt to that unde rstanding, t hough not without extreme hazard. The standa rd interpre tation is different: the \"de mocratic peace\" reflects \"some happy combination of liberal norm s and institutions such as representative democracy and market econom ies.\"39 Though these factors are real enough, their contribution to the striking discontinuity cannot be prope rly assessed without due attention to the realization that Western civilization was on the verge of self-annihilation, thanks to the rationa l purs uit of its traditiona l practices.

Decision-m akers at the time undoubt edly unde rstood that the fate of the world was in their hands . Nevertheless, attende es at the confe rence may have been shoc ked by some of the revelations . They were inform ed that in Octobe r 1962 the world was \"one word away\" from nuc lear war. \"A guy named Arkhi pov saved the world,\" said Thom as Blanton of the Nationa l Security Archive in Washington, which helped orga nize the event. He was referring to Vasili Arkhi pov, a Soviet subm arine offi cer who blocked an orde r to fire nuc lear-armed torpe doe s on Octobe r 27, at the tensest moment of the crisis, when the subm arines were unde r attack by US destroye rs. A devastating respons e would have been a near certainty, leading t o a major w ar.2 Participants in the decisions at the time, and at the retrospective fort y years later, did not have to be reminde d of President Eisenhow er's warning that \"a major war would destroy the Northern Hemisphe re.\"3 \"The parallel between Kenne dy's handling of the crisis and President Bus h's deliberations ove r Iraq was a recurre nt theme at the meeting,\" the press report ed, \"with many participants accusing Bus h of ignori ng history,\" saying \"they had come to make sure it doe s not happe n again, and to offe r lessons for toda y's crises, most notably President George W. Bus h's deliberations about whether to strike Iraq.\"4 Schlesinge r was surely not the only one to bring up the fact that \"Kenne dy chos e qua rantine as an alternative to military action [while] Bus h is committed to military action\"; nor, presumably, was he the only one to have been taken aback to learn just how close the world came to de struction e ven unde r the less aggre ssive choice. In his authori tative account of the missile crisis, Raymond Gart-hoff obs erves that \"in the United States, there was almost universal approba tion for President Kenne dy's handling of the crisis.\" That's a fair assessment, though w hether the approva l is warranted is a separate que stion.

He refused to make any form al commitment not to inva de Cuba . Rather, he continue d \"to conduc t an active policy of seeking to unde rmine and displace the Castro regime, including c ove rt ope rations against Cuba ,\" G arthoff obs erves. In a highly provoc ative gesture as the crisis intensified, the missiles were turne d ove r to Turki sh command \"with ceremonial fanfare\" on Octobe r 22. Garthoff comments: the event was \"certainly noted in Moscow, but not in Washington.\"5 There it was presumably regarded as just another exercise of \"l ogical illogicality.\" As history is crafted by the pow erful , the most dramatic moment of the missile crisis was provi ded by UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson at the Security Counc il on Octobe r 25, when he expos ed Soviet deception by unve iling a phot ogra ph of a missile site in Cuba taken by US spy planes. The conc ept \"Stevenson moment\" has entered into historical memory, in celebration of this victory ove r a vicious foe aiming t o de stroy us . As an intellectual exercise, let's imagine how the \"Stevenson moment\" might be viewed by a hypot hetical extraterrestrial obs erver. Call him Martian, and assume that he is free from earthly systems of doc trine and ideology. Martian would surely note that there is no \"Khrus hchev moment\" in history: no moment at which Soviet Premier Nikita Khrus hchev or his UN ambassador dramatically unve iled phot ogra phs of the Jupiter missiles placed in Turke y in 1961-62, or of the provoc ative transfer of the missiles to the Turki sh military with \"ceremonial fanfare\" just as the most dange rous moment in hum an history approa ched. Reflecting on this distinction, Martian shoul d re call that the Jupiter m issiles were onl y a small element of a far gre ater threat to Rus sia, and that Rus sia had repeatedly been inva ded and almost destroye d in the preceding half-century—t wice by newly rearmed Germany, its richer Western part now within a hos tile military alliance led by the world's mightiest supe rpow er; onc e in 1918 by Britain, the US, and their allies. And he might obs erve that there was, of cours e, no Rus sian threat to inva de Turke y, nor any large-scale Rus sian terrori st campaign or econom ic warfare against Turke y, nor even a lesser count erpart to the crimes that the Kenne dy a dministration w as carryi ng out against Cuba at the time. Despite all this, only the \"Stevenson moment\" exists in historical memory. Martian would surely grasp how the distinction reflects the balance of globa l pow er. He would also presumably recall a principle that must be close to a historical universal of intellectual culture: We are \"good\" (whoe ver we happe n to be), and they are \"evil\" if they stand in our way. Therefore , the radical asymmetry makes perfect sense, within the fra mework of e stablished doc trine. The contours of the asymmetry become even sharper when we cons ider the occasiona l effort at extenua tion: the crime of the Rus sians in Cuba was stealth, while the US surrounde d Rus sia with lethal offe nsive weapons quite ope nly. That is true. The world ruler not only has no need to conc eal its intent, but prefers to adve rtise it, to \"maintain credibility.\" The subordi nation of the ideological system to pow er ensures that virtually any action—i nternationa l terrori sm (as in Cuba ), ove rt aggre ssion (as in South Vietnam at the same time), participation in mass slaught er to destroy the only mass-based political party (as in South Vietnam and Indone sia), and many others—w ill either be dispatched to oblivion or reshaped into an act of legitimate self-de fense or an act of benevolence that perhaps went astray.6 The import ance of owning a prope rly crafted \"history\" was revealed onc e again in Februa ry 2003, when Col in Powell addre ssed the UN Security Counc il, inform ing its members that the US would< go to war with or without UN authori zation. The que stion ponde red by commentators was whether Noam Chom sky 42 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Powell would be able to provi de a Stevenson m oment. Some thought he had. New York Times columnist William Safire triumpha ntly report ed Powell's \"Adlai Stevenson moment\": a satellite image of trucks next to a bunke r allegedly storing chemical weapons , then another with the trucks gone 7—c lear proof that Iraq had deceived the inspectors by removing the illegal weapons before they arrived, and that the devious Iraqis had penetrated the inspection team, confi rming the US thesis that the team was unre liable and hence could not be provi ded with intelligence data that Washington claimed to have. It was later conc eded, with Powell's silent nod of agreement, that for a range of reasons —the time lapse between the taking of the phot os, the unc ertain use of the site in que stion—t he phot ogra phs prove d nothing, one of a series of similar cases, which later became a torre nt. Still, this was deemed a \"Stevenson moment,\" though Adam Clymer pointed out that there was a \"stark difference\" between the two: Stevenson's moment was \"one of real fear about Soviet missiles, of imminent nuc lear confront ation.\" Appa rently, there could ha ve been no fe ar, anyw here, about missiles on t he Rus sian borde r. Stevenson's son felt that the differences were even starker. His father had presented the Security Counc il with proof that \"a nuc lear supe rpow er was installing missiles in Cuba and threatening to ups et the world's 'balance of terror' \"—or, from Martian's standpoi nt, threatening to shift the world's balance of terror to be a little less extreme in Washington's favor. And, he continue d, \"That 'moment' had an obvi ous purpos e: containing the Soviet Union and maintaining peace.\"8 In Martian translation, the Stevenson moment did contribute to a partial containment, but of Washington, not the USSR. A pos sible inva sion of Cuba was averted, though Washington's internationa l terrori st campaign and econom ic warfare were resumed at onc e, and the threat to Rus sia was escalated—a ll of which takes on greater significance against the background of supe rpow er interchange s at the time, to w hich w e return. Kenne dy had no doubt s about the threat of the Rus sian missiles in Cuba . Meeting with his high- level advisers (ExCom m), he said, \"It's just as if we sudde nly began to put a major num ber of [medium-range ballistic missiles] in Turke y... . Now that'd be godda m dange rous .\" His nationa l security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, responde d: \"W ell, we did, Mr. President.\" Surpri sed, JFK said, \"But that was five years ago\"—a ctually, one year ago, duri ng his administration. He later expre ssed conc ern that if the facts were know n, his decision to risk war rather than agree publ icly to joint withdra wal of missiles from Cuba and Turke y would not play well in Peoria: he feared most people would cons ider it \"a very fa ir trade.\"9 Whatever one 's judgm ent about the actions of Khrus hchev and Kenne dy, there shoul d be universal agreement that Khrus hchev's decision to dispatch the missiles to Cuba was an act of criminal luna cy, in the light of the pos sible cons eque nces. It would pass beyond luna cy to conde mn thos e who warned of the dange rs and criticized Khrus hchev bitterly for proc eeding despite the risks. It is the merest truism that choices are assessed in terms of the range of likely cons eque nces. We unde rstand the truism very well when cons idering the actions of offi cial enemies but find it hard to apply to ours elves. There are many illustrations , including recent US military exercises. Aid agencies, scholars, and others who prope rly warned of the risks in Afgha nistan and Iraq were ridiculed when the worst, fort una tely, did not come to pass. At the same level of moral imbecility, one would rush into the streets every Octobe r to sing praises to the Kremlin, while ridiculing thos e who warned of the dange rs of placing missiles in Cuba and persist in conde mning the criminal luna cy of t he act. Kenne dy offi cials state that the president had not authori zed an inva sion of Cuba . Secretary of Defense Robe rt McNamara, how ever, inform ed his cabinet associates on Octobe r 22, 1962, that \"the President orde red us to prepare an inva sion months ago... . And we have develope d plans in Noam Chom sky 43 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"great detail,\" fully enough so that an inva sion could be launc hed in a week.10 At the fort ieth anniversary confe rence, McNamara reiterated his view that \"Cuba was justified in fearing an attack.

While this may well have been \"the most dange rous moment in hum an history,\" it is not the only such case of flirting with catastrophe . More generally, it is far from the only illustration of una nticipated and unpre dictable cons eque nces of the resort to, or e ven the threat of, forc e, among t he many re asons why s ane people unde rstand i t to be a last resort, facing a very he avy burde n of proof. Other lessons bear directly on confl icted US relations with Europe , another topical matter at the anniversary meeting. The missile crisis sugge sts some reasons why Europe ans might be wary of the US political leadership—i n that case, not radical right nationa lists but thos e at the liberal, multilateral end of the political spectrum . Europe 's fate was hanging in the balance as the president and his advisers decided to reject what they feared would be regarded as a \"fair trade\" if it were know n. But Europe was kept in the dark and treated with disdain. Kenne dy's ExCom m \"summarily dismissed any idea of sharing with the allies decisions that could have led to the nuc lear destruction of W estern E urope as well as North A merica,\" F rank Cos tigliola writes in a rare study of t he topic. Kenne dy told his secretary of state privately that allies \"must come along or stay behind... . We cannot accept a veto from any other pow er,\" words heard again fort y years later from Bus h and Powell. The US commande r of NATO put its air forc es on alert without cons ultation with Europe . Kenne dy's closest ally, British prime minister Harold Macmillan, told his associates that Kenne dy's actions were \"escalating into war\" but he could do nothing \"to stop •t\"; he kne w only what he could learn from British intelligence. Washington's perception of the US-UK \"special relations hip\" was articulated by a senior Kenne dy adviser in internal discussion at the peak of the crisis: Britain will \"act as our lieutenant (the fashiona ble word is partner).\" McGeorge Bundy sugge sted that some effort be made to encoura ge Europe ans to \"feel that they're a part of it ... reel that they know ,\" but only in orde r to keep them quiet. Europe ans are not capable of the \"rationa l and logical\" approa ch of American decision-m akers, his aide Robe rt Komer advised. If Europe an leaders found out what was happe ning, Bundy adde d, they might make \"noi se ... saying that they can live with Soviet [medium-range ballistic missiles], why can't we.\" The word noise connot es \"discorda nt, unintelligent clamor,\" Cos tigliola adds .11 Perhaps many Europe ans might not be too happy about the significance accorde d their survi val, even if respected US commentators are confi dent that their reluctance to \"come along\" is a sign of \"pa ranoid anti-Americanism,\" \"i gnora nce and a varice,\" a nd ot her \"c ultural deficiencies.\" Internationa l terrori sm dom inated the headlines as the retrospective confe rence took place; so did Washington's allegedly nove l doc trine of regime change . But there is little nove l here: The Cuba n missile crisis grew directly out of a campaign of internationa l terrori sm aimed at forc eful regime change . Historian Thom as Paterson conc lude s, quite plausibly, that \"the origins of the Octobe r 1962 crisis derived largely from the conc erted U.S. campaign to qua sh the Cuba n revolution\" by violence and econom ic warfare.12 We can gain a better insight into curre nt implications by looki ng at how the crisis evolved, a nd t he gui ding pri nciples that motivated pol icy.

In March, the Nationa l Security Counc il (NSC) cons idered means to institute regime change . In May, the CIA began to arm gue rrillas inside Cuba . \"During the Winter of 1959-1960, there was a significant increase in CIA -supe rvised bom bing and incendiary raids piloted by exiled Cuba ns\" based in the US.13 We need not tarry on what the US or its clients would do unde r such circumstances. Cuba , how ever, did not respond with violent actions within the United States for revenge or deterrence. Rather, it followed the proc edure required by internationa l law. In July 1960, Cuba called on the UN for help, provi ding the Security Counc il with records of some twenty bom bings , including names of pilots, plane registration num bers, une xplode d bom bs, and other specific details, alleging cons iderable damage and casualties and calling for resolution of the confl ict through diplomatic channe ls. US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge responde d by giving his \"assurance [that] the United States has no aggre ssive purpos e against Cuba .\" Four months before , in March 1960, his gove rnm ent had made a form al decision in secret to ove rthrow the Castro gove rnm ent, and preparations for t he Ba y of P igs inva sion w ere well adva nced.14 Washington was conc erned that Cuba ns might try to defend themselves. CIA chief Allen Dulles therefore urge d Britain not to provi de arms to Cuba . His \"main reason,\" the British ambassador report ed to London, \"was that this might lead the Cuba ns to ask for Soviet or Soviet bloc arms,\" a move that \"would have a tremendous effect,\" Dulles pointed out, allowing Washington to port ray Cuba as a security threat to the hemisphe re, following the script that had worke d so well in Guatemala.15 Dulles was referring to Washington's successful demolition of Guatemala's first democratic expe riment, a ten-ye ar interlude of hope and progre ss, greatly feared in Washington because of the enorm ous popul ar support report ed by US intelligence and the \"de mons tration effect\" of social and econom ic measures to benefit the large majority. The Soviet threat was rout inely invoke d, abetted by Guatemala's appe al to the Soviet bloc for arms after the US had threatened attack and cut off other sourc es of suppl y. The result was a half-century of horror, even worse than the US-backed tyranny t hat came before . For Cuba , the schemes devised by the dove s were similar to thos e of CIA director Dulles. Warning President Kenne dy about the \"inevitable political and diplomatic fall-out \" from the planne d inva sion of Cuba by a proxy army, Arthur Schlesinge r sugge sted effort s to trap Castro in some action that could be used as a pretext for inva sion: \"One can conc eive a black ope ration in, say, Haiti which might in time lure Castro into sending a few boa tloads of men on to a Haitian beach in what could be port rayed as an effort to ove rthrow the Haitian regime, ... then the moral issue would be cloude d, and the anti-US campaign would be hobbl ed from the start.\"16 Reference is to the regime of the murde rous dictator \"Papa Doc\" Duva lier, which was backed by the US (with some reservations ), so that an effort to he lp H aitians ove rthrow it would be a crime. Eisenhow er's March 1960 plan called for the ove rthrow of Castro in favor of a regime \"more devoted to the true interests of the Cuba n people and more acceptable to the U.S.,\" including support for \"military ope ration on the island\" and \"de velopm ent of an adequa te paramilitary forc e outside of Cuba .\" Intelligence report ed that popul ar support for Castro was high, but the US would determine the \"true interests of the Cuba n people.\" The regime change was to be carried out \"in such a manne r as to avoid any appe arance of U.S. intervention,\" because of the anticipated reaction in L atin A merica and t he probl ems of doc trinal management at hom e.

The mood was reflected in Kenne dy's publ ic pronounc ements: \"The complacent, the self- indul gent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history. Only the strong ... can pos sibly survi ve,\" he told the count ry, soundi ng a theme that would be used to good effect by the Reaganites duri ng their own terrori st wars.17 Kenne dy was aware that allies \"think that we're slightly de mented\" on t he subject of Cuba , a perception t hat persists to the pre sent.18 Kenne dy implemented a crushing embargo that could scarcely be endure d by a small count ry that had become a \"virtual colony\" of the US in the sixty years following its \"liberation\" from Spain.19 He also orde red an intensification of the terrori st campaign: \"He asked his brot her, Attorne y- General Robe rt Kenne dy, to lead the top-l evel interagency group that ove rsaw Operation Mongoos e, a progra m of paramilitary ope rations , econom ic warfare, and sabotage he launc hed in late 1961 t o vi sit the 'terrors of t he earth' on F idel Ca stro a nd, m ore pros aically, to toppl e him.\"20 The terrori st campaign was \"no laughi ng matter,\" Jorge Do-m ingue z writes in a review of recently declassified materials on ope rations unde r Kenne dy, materials that are \"he avily sanitized\" and \"onl y the tip of t he iceberg,\" P iero G leijeses adds .21 Operation Mongoos e was \"the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba from late 1961 until the ons et of the 1962 missile crisis,\" Mark White report s, the progra m on which the Kenne dy brot hers \"came to pin their hope s.\" Robe rt Kenne dy inform ed the CIA that the Cuba n probl em carries \"the top priority in the United States Gove rnm ent—a ll else is seconda ry—no time, no effort , or manpow er is to be spared\" in the effort to ove rthrow the Castro regime. The chief of Mongoos e ope rations , Edward Lansdale, provi ded a timetable leading to \"ope n revolt and ove rthrow of the Com munist regime\" in Octobe r 1962. The \"final definition\" of the progra m recogni zed that \"final success will require decisive U.S. military intervention,\" after terrori sm and subve rsion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in Octobe r 1962—w hen the missile crisis erupt ed.22 In Februa ry 1962, the Joint Chi efs of Staff approve d a plan more extreme than Schlesinge r's: to use \"cove rt means ... to lure or provoke Castro, or an unc ontrollable subordi nate, into an ove rt hos tile reaction against the United States; a reaction which would in turn create the justification for the US to not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, forc e and determination.\"23 In March, at the reque st of the DOD Cuba Project, the Joint Chi efs of Staff subm itted a memorandum to Defense Secretary Robe rt McNamara outlining pretexts which they would cons ider would provi de justification for US military intervention in Cuba .\" The plan would be unde rtaken if \"a credible internal revolt is impos sible of attainment duri ng the next 9-10 months,\" but before Cuba could establish re lations with Rus sia that might \"di rectly invol ve the Soviet Union.\" A prude nt resort to terror shoul d avoid risk to the perpetrator. The March plan was to cons truct \"seemingly unre lated events to camoufl age the ultimate objective and create the necessary impression of Cuba n rashne ss and respons ibility on a large scale, directed at other count ries as well as the United States,\" placing the US \"in the appa rent pos ition of suffe ring defensible grievances [and developing] an internationa l image of Cuba n threat to peace in the Western Hemisphe re.\" Propos ed measures include d blowing up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay to create \"a 'Remember the Maine' incident,\" publ ishing casualty lists in US newspapers to \"cause a helpful wave of nationa l indigna tion,\" port raying Cuba n inve stigations as \"fairly compelling evidence that the ship was taken unde r attack,\" developing a \"Com munist Cuba n terror campaign [in Florida] and even in Washington,\" using Soviet bloc incendiaries for cane-burni ng raids in neighbori ng count ries, Noam Chom sky 46 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"shoot ing dow n a drone aircraft with a pretense that it was a charter flight carryi ng college stude nts on a holiday, and other similarly inge nious schemes—not implemented, but another sign of the \"fra ntic\" and \"s avage\" atmosphe re that pre vailed.24 On Augus t 23 the president issued Nationa l Security Memorandum No. 181, \"a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by U.S. military intervention,\" invol ving \"significant U.S. military plans, maneuve rs, and move ment of forc es and equipment\" that were surely know n to Cuba and Rus sia.25 Also in Augus t, terrori st attacks were intensified, including speedboa t strafing attacks on a Cuba n seaside hotel \"where Soviet military technicians were know n to congre gate, killing a score of Rus sians and Cuba ns\"; attacks on British and Cuba n cargo ships; the contamination of suga r shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuba n exile orga nizations permitted to ope rate freely in Florida.26 A few weeks later came \"the most dange rous moment in hum an hi story.\" Terrori st ope rations continue d through the tensest moments of the missile crisis.

Raymond Garthoff writes that \"the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpe dal on what was, for them, the key que stion remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba .\" These and other actions reveal again, he conc lude s, \"that the risk and dange r to both sides could ha ve been extreme, and c atastrophe not exclude d.\"27 After the crisis ende d, Kenne dy renewed the terrori st campaign. Ten days before his assassination he approve d a CIA plan for \"de struction ope rations \" by U S proxy forc es \"against a large oil refinery and storage facilities, a large electric plant, suga r refineries, railroad bridge s, harbor facilities, and unde rwater demolition of doc ks and ships.\" A plot to kill Castro was initiated on the day of the Kenne dy assassination. The campaign was called off in 1965, but \"one of Nixon' s first acts in offi ce in 1969 w as to di rect the CIA to intensify c ove rt ope rations against Cuba .\"28 Of particular interest are the perceptions of the planne rs. In his review of recently released doc uments on Kenne dy-e ra terror, Do-m ingue z obs erves that \"onl y onc e in these nearly thous and pages of doc umentation did a U.S. offi cial raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to U.S.-gove rnm ent spons ored terrori sm\": a member of the NSC staff sugge sted that it might lead to some Rus sian reaction, and raids that are \"ha pha zard and kill innoc ents ... might mean a bad press in some friendly count ries.\" The same attitude s prevail throughout the internal discussions , as when Robe rt Kenne dy warned that a full-scale inva sion of Cuba would \"kill an awful lot of people, and we're goi ng t o take an awful lot of he at on i t.\"29 Terrori st activities continue d unde r Nixon, peaking in the mid-1970s , with attacks on fishing boa ts, embassies, and Cuba n offi ces ove rseas, and the bom bing of a Cuba na airliner, killing all seventy- three passenge rs. These and subs eque nt terrori st ope rations were carried out from US territory, though by t hen they w ere regarded as criminal acts by t he FBI. So matters proc eeded, while Castro was conde mned by editors for maintaining an \"armed camp, despite the security from attack prom ised by Washington in 1962.\"30 The prom ise shoul d have suffi ced, despite what followed; not to speak of the prom ises that preceded, by then well doc umented, along with inform ation about how well they could be trusted: e.g., the \"Lodge moment\" of July 1960. On the thirtieth anniversary of the missile crisis, Cuba prot ested a machine- gun attack against a Spanish-Cuba n touri st hotel; respons ibility was claimed by a group in Miami. Bom bings in Cuba in 1997, which killed an Italian touri st, were traced back to Miami. The perpetrators were Salvadora n criminals ope rating unde r the direction of Luis Posada Carriles and Noam Chom sky 47 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"financed in Miami. One of the most notorious internationa l terrori sts, Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cuba na airliner bom bing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canos a, a Miami bus inessman who was the head of the tax-exempt Cuba n-A merican Nationa l Founda tion (CA NF). Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at the Ilopa ngo military air base to help orga nize US terrori st attacks against Nicaragua unde r Oliver North's direction. Posada has described in detail his terrori st activities and the fundi ng for them from exiles and CA NF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be inve stigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his subs eque nt ope rations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA . When he later joined Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for Orlando Bos ch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convi cted in the US for a bom b attack on a Cuba -bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to orga nize furt her attacks against Cuba . An ex-CIA offi cial familiar with the Cuba na bom bing identifies Posada and Bos ch as the only suspects in the bom bing, which Bos ch defende d as \"a legitimate act of war.\" Generally cons idered the \"mastermind\" of the airline bom bing, Bos ch was respons ible for thirty other acts of terrori sm, accordi ng to the FBI. He was granted a presidential pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bus h I administration after intense lobbyi ng by Jeb Bus h and South Florida Cuba n-A merican leaders, ove rrul ing the Justice Department, which had found the conc lusion \"inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the publ ic interest for the United States to provi de a safe haven for Bos ch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its ability to urge credibly ot her na tions to re fuse aid and s helter to terrori sts.\"31 Cuba n offe rs to coope rate in intelligence-sharing to prevent terrori st attacks have been rejected by Washington, though some did lead to US actions . \"Senior members of the FBI visited Cuba in 1998 to meet their Cuba n count erparts, who gave [the FBI] dos siers about what they sugge sted was a Miami-based terrori st network: inform ation which had been compiled in part by Cuba ns who had infiltrated exile groups .\" Three months later the FBI arrested Cuba ns who had infiltrated the US- based terrori st groups . Five were sentenced to long t erms in pri son.32 The nationa l security pretext lost whatever shreds of credibility it might have had after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, though it was not until 1998 that US intelligence offi cially inform ed the count ry that Cuba no longe r pos ed a threat to US nationa l security. The Clinton administration, how ever, insisted that the military threat pos ed by Cuba be reduc ed to \"ne gligible,\" but not completely remove d. Even with this qua lification, the intelligence assessment eliminated a dange r that had been identified by the Mexican ambassador in 1961, when he rejected JFK's attempt to orga nize collective action against Cuba on the grounds that \"if we publ icly declare that Cuba is a threat to our s ecurity, fort y m illion M exicans will die laughi ng.\"33 In fairness, how ever, it shoul d be recogni zed that missiles in Cuba did pos e a threat. In private discussions the Kenne dy brot hers expre ssed their fears that the presence of Rus sian missiles in Cuba might deter a US inva sion of Venezuela. So \"the Bay of Pigs was really right,\" JFK conc lude d.34 The Bus h I administration reacted to the elimination of the security Pretext by making the embargo much harsher, unde r pressure from Clinton, who outflanke d Bus h from the right duri ng the 1992 election campaign. Econom ic warfare was made still more stringe nt in 1996, causing a furor even among the closest US allies. The embargo came unde r cons iderable dom estic criticism as well, on the grounds that it harms US export ers and inve stors—the embargo' s only victims, accordi ng to the standa rd picture in the US; Cuba ns are una ffected. Inve stigations by US specialists tell a different story.

In 1999 the Clinton administration eased such sanctions for all count ries on the offi cial list of \"terrori st states,\" apart from Cuba , singled out for unique puni shment. Nevertheless, Cuba is not entirely alone in this regard. After a hurri cane devastated West Indi an islands in Augus t 1980, President Carter refused to allow any aid unless Grenada was exclude d, as puni shment for some uns pecified initiatives of the reform ist Maurice Bishop gove rnm ent. When the stricken count ries refused to agree to Grenada's exclusion, having failed to perceive the threat to survi val pos ed by the nutmeg capital of the world, Carter withhe ld all aid. Similarly, when Nicaragua was struck by a hurri cane in Octobe r 1988, bringing starvation and causing severe ecological damage, the curre nt incumbents in Washington recogni zed that their terrori st war could benefit from the disaster, and therefore refused aid, even to the Atlantic Coa st area with close links to the US and deep resentment against the Sandinistas. They followed suit when a tidal wave wiped out Nicaragua n fishing villages, leaving hundre ds dead and missing in September 1992. In this case, there was a show of aid, but hidde n in the small print was the fact that apart from an impressive dona tion of $25,000, the aid was deduc ted from assistance already scheduled. Congre ss was assured, how ever, that the pittance of aid would not affect the administration's suspension of ove r $100 million of aid because the US-backed Nicaragua n gove rnm ent had fa iled to de mons trate a suffi cient degree of s ubs ervience.36 US econom ic warfare against Cuba has been strongl y conde mned in virtually every relevant internationa l forum , even declared illegal by the Judicial Com mission of the norm ally compliant Organization of American States. The Europe an Union called on the World Trade Organization to conde mn the embargo. The respons e of the Clinton administration was that \"Europe is challenging 'three decades of American Cuba policy that goe s back to the Kenne dy Administration,' and is aimed entirely at forc ing a change of gove rnm ent in Havana.\"37 The administration also declared that the WTO has no competence to rule on US nationa l security or to compel the US to change its laws.

Successful Defiance The reasons for t he internationa l terrori st attacks against Cuba and t he illegal econom ic embargo a re spelled out in the internal record. And no one shoul d be surpri sed to discove r that they fit a familiar pattern—t hat of G uatemala a few years earlier, for e xample. From the timing alone , it is clear that conc ern ove r a Rus sian threat could not have been a major factor. The plans for forc eful regime change were drawn up and implemented before there was any significant Rus sian conne ction, and puni shment was intensified after the Rus sians disappe ared from the scene. True, a Rus sian threat did develop, but that was more a cons eque nce than a cause of US terrori sm and e conom ic warfare. In July 1961 the CIA warned that \"the extensive influence of 'Castroism' is not a func tion of Cuba n pow er... . Castro's shadow loom s large because social and econom ic condi tions throughout Latin America invite oppos ition to ruling authori ty and encoura ge agitation for radical change ,\" for which Castro's Cuba provi ded a mode l. Earlier, Arthur Schlesinge r had transmitted to the incoming President Kenne dy his Latin American Mission report , which warned of the susceptibility of Latin Americans to \"the Castro idea °f taking matters into one 's own hands .\" The report did identify a Kremlin conne ction: the Soviet Union \"hove rs in the wings , flouri shing large developm ent loans and presenting itself as the mode l for achieving mode rnization in a single generation.\" The dange rs of the \"Ca stro idea\" are particularly grave, Schlesinge r later elabora ted, when \"the distribution of land and other form s of nationa l wealth greatly favors the prope rtied classes\" and \"the poor and Noam Chom sky 49 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"unde rpri vileged, stimulated by the example of the Cuba n revolution, are now demanding opport unities for a decent living.\" Kenne dy feared that Rus sian aid might make Cuba a \"show case\" for de velopm ent, giving t he Soviets the uppe r ha nd t hroughout Latin A merica. In early 1964, the State Department Policy Planning Counc il expa nde d on these conc erns: \"The primary dange r we face in Castro is ... in the impact the very existence of his regime has upon the leftist move ment in many Latin American count ries... . The simple fact is that Castro represents a successful defiance of the US, a negation of our whole hemisphe ric policy of almost a century and a half.\"38 To put it simply, Thom as Paterson writes, \"Cuba , as symbol and reality, challenge d U.S. hegemony in Latin America.\"39 Internationa l terrori sm and econom ic warfare to bring about regime change are justified not by what Cuba doe s, but by its \"ve ry existence,\" its \"successful defiance\" of the prope r master of the hemisphe re. Defiance may justify even more violent actions , as in Serbia, as quietly conc eded after the fact; or Iraq, as also recogni zed when pretexts had collapsed. Outrage ove r defiance goe s far back in American history. Two hundre d years ago, Thom as Jefferson bitterly conde mned France for its \"attitude of defiance\" in holding New Orleans, which he cove ted. Jefferson warned that France's \"character [is] placed in a point of eternal friction with our character, which though loving peace and the purs uit of wealth, is high-m inde d.\" France's \"de fiance [requires us to] marry ours elves to the British fleet and nation,\" Jefferson advised, reversing his earlier attitude s, which reflected France's crucial contribution to the liberation of the colonies from British rule.40 Thanks to Haiti's liberation struggl e, una ided and almost universally oppos ed, France's defiance soon ende d, but the guiding principles remain in forc e, determining friend and foe. Guiding Principles The principles illustrated in the missile crisis explain why internationa l law is irrelevant. Domestic law was also declared irrelevant. Rejecting a 1961 legal brief that held the Bay of Pigs inva sion to be a violation of US neutrality laws, Attorne y General Robe rt Kenne dy determined that the US-run forc es were \"pa triots.\" Therefore none of their activities \"appe ar to be violations of our neutrality laws,\" which \"clearly ... were not designe d for the kind of situation which exists in the world toda y.\"41 The world did not sudde nly become extraordi narily dange rous on 9-11, requiring \"ne w paradigms\" that dismantle internationa l law and institutions and grant the White Hous e the pow er to disregard the dom estic rul e of l aw. The achievements of internationa l terrori sm are exclude d from sanitized history, but they are recogni zed with pride by the perpetrators. The famous School of the Americas, which trains Latin American offi cers to carry out their missions , proudl y announc es as one of its \"talking points\" that the US Army helped to \"de feat liberation theology,\"42 the heresy to which the Latin American Churc h succumbed when it adopt ed \"the preferential option for the poor\" and was made to suffe r its own \"terrors of the earth\" for this departure from good orde r. Symbolically, the grim decade of Reagan-Bus h I terror was ope ned, short ly before they took offi ce, by the assassination of a cons ervative Salvadora n archbishop who had become a \"voi ce for the voiceless,\" with thinly veiled complicity of the US-backed security forc es; and the decade closed with the murde r of six Jesuit Salvadora n intellectuals whos e brains were blown out, and their hous ekeeper and her daught er murde red, by an elite Washington-a rmed and -trained battalion that had already compiled a record of bl oody a trocities.

But not the respons ibility that the US owes to the people of Ce ntral America, at least thos e who s urvi ved the murde rous ons laught of t he 1980s .43 In the case of Cuba , \"successful defiance\" elicited reactions that brought the world close to destruction. But that is unus ual. Successful defiance has regularly been ove rcome by one or another form of violence without any risk to the perpetrators. One strategy from the early 1960s was the installation of neo-N azi Nationa l Security States, which had as their goa l \"to destroy permanently a perceived threat to the existing structure of socioeconom ic privilege by eliminating the political participation of the num erical majority,\" that is, the \"popul ar classes.\"44 The move set off a plague of repression and terror throughout the continent, reaching Central America duri ng the Reaganite pha se of the curre nt political leadership. The plague began with the military coup in Bra zil set in motion before Kenne dy's assassination and carried out short ly after. Washington coope rated with the military forc es that ove rthrew parliamentary democracy in recogni tion of their \"ba sically democratic and pro-U nited States orientation,\" Kenne dy's ambassador Lincoln Gordon explained. While the torturers and assassins were carryi ng out their work, Gordon hailed \"the most decisive victory for freedom in the mid-twentieth century.\" The \"de mocratic rebellion,\" Gordon cabled Washington, would help in \"restraining left-wing excesses\" of the form er mode rate popul ist elected gove rnm ent, and the \"de mocratic forc es\" now in charge shoul d \"create a greatly improve d climate for pri vate inve stment.\"45 Gordon' s view was endors ed by other leading figure s of the Kenne dy-J ohns on administrations , though by the 1980s , as in Chi le at the same time, the Bra zilian generals were happy to transfer the wreckage to civilian hands . Despite the enorm ous adva ntages of the \"colossus of the South,\" the generals had left Bra zil in \"the same category as the less develope d African or Asian count ries when it came to social welfare indices\" (malnutrition, infant mortality, etc.), with condi tions of inequa lity and suffe ring rarely matched elsewhere, but a grand success for fore ign inve stors and dom estic pri vilege.46 These patterns have not been restricted to the dom ains of the Monroe Doctrine. To take one of many examples from other parts of the world, while Washington was facilitating the \"de mocratic rebellion\" in Bra zil and seeking to ove rcome Cuba 's effort s to \"take matters into its own hands ,\" elder statesman Ellsworth Bunke r was sent to Indone sia to inve stigate troubl ing condi tions there. He inform ed Washington that \"the avow ed Indone sian objective is 'to stand on their own feet' in developing their econom y, free from fore ign, especially Western, influence.\" A Nationa l Intelligence Estimate in September 1965 warned that if the effort s of the mass-based PKI \"to energize and unite the Indone sian nation ... succeeded, Indone sia would provi de a pow erful example for the unde rdevelope d world and hence a credit to communism and a setback for Western prestige.\" That threat was ove rcome a few weeks later by a mass slaught er in Indone sia and then the installation of the Suha rto dictatorship.

Washington's fury was rous ed by another Cuba n act of successful defiance. When a US-backed South African inva sion came close to conque ring newly inde pende nt Angol a, Cuba sent troops on its own initiative, scarcely even notifying Rus sia, and beat back the inva ders. The South African press warned of \"the blows to South African pride\" and the \"boos t to African nationa lism which has seen South Africa forc ed to retreat\" by black Cuba n soldiers. South Africa's major black newspaper wrote that \"Bl ack Africa is riding the crest of a wave generated by the Cuba n success in Angol a\" and \"t asting t he heady w ine of t he pos sibility of re alizing t he dre am of ' total liberation.' \"48 The defense of Angol a was one of Cuba 's most significant contributions to the liberation of Africa. How remarkable these contributions were was unknow n before Gleijeses's groundbre aking work appe ared, telling \"the story of a small count ry's vision of defying a big pow er's oppre ssion, and, thanks to extraordi nary i ndividua l heroism and s elf-sacrifice, changing a continent.\"49 Gleijeses obs erves that \"Kissinge r did his best to smash the one move ment that represented any hope for the future of Angol a,\" the MPLA. And though the MPLA \"be ars a grave respons ibility for its count ry's plight\" in later years, it was \"the relentless hos tility of the United States [that] forc ed it into an unhe althy depende nce on the Soviet bloc and encoura ged South Africa to launc h devastating military ra ids in the 1980s .\"50 The many campaigns of internationa l terrori sm and econom ic warfare to ove rcome \"successful defiance\" and \"left-wing excesses\" adopt ing \"the philosophy of the new nationa lism\" and perhaps even influenced by liberation theology, barely sampled here, are cons idered insignificant, or perhaps obvi ous ly legitimate, as are their bitter cons eque nces. Accordi ngly, they scarcely enter the enorm ous curre nt literature and publ ic discussion of internationa l terrori sm and Washington's suppos edly new doc trine of \"regime change .\" At worst they can be dismissed with comfort ing euphe misms. An occasiona l casual reference tells us that nothing happe ned in Cuba beyond \"the destabilization campaign know n as Operation Mongoos e.\" And fort una tely, \"with the collapse of the Soviet Union, leftist terrori sm has all but dried up. North Korea and Cuba are no longe r as bus y prom oting disorde r as they onc e were.\"51 Cuba is listed prom inently in scholarly work on terrori sm, but typically as a suspect in the crime, not a victim.52 Reagan-Bus h internationa l terrori sm in Nicaragua and elsewhere doe s not exist, or is at worst traceable to inattention or some other unde rstanda ble departure from the mission assigne d by Provi dence to the leaders of \"the idealistic new world bent on ending inhum anity.\" And the persistence of standa rd ope rating proc edure s after the Col d War also did not occur or doe sn't matter. The ove rriding principle prevails: misdeeds are perform ed by ot hers; we are culpable onl y for i nadve rtent error or ove rsight. It is of the utmost significance for the future that in a world-dom inant pow er even the worst crimes are easily effaced. The wars in Indoc hina are a remarkable example. After years of brut al destruction, m uch of t he US popul ation ha d come to oppos e the wars on pri ncipled grounds . Among educ ated elites, how ever, objections were typically on narrow grounds of cost and failure.

International Terrorism an d Regime Change: Nicaragua It is instructive to look at another internationa l terrori st campaign to ove rcome \"successful defiance\": the terrori st war against Nicaragua . The case is particularly illuminating because of the scale of the terrori st campaigns aimed at regime change , the role of the curre nt Washington leadership in executing them, and the way they were cast when in progre ss and reshaped in retrospect within the intellectual culture. The case has furt her significance because it is so unc ontrove rsial, in the light of the judgm ents of the highe st internationa l authori ties; unc ontrove rsial, that is, among thos e who have a minimal commitment to hum an rights and internationa l law. There is a simple way to estimate the size of that category: determine how often these elementary matters are discussed, even mentione d, in respectable circles in the West, most dramatically after the \"war on terror\" was redeclared on 9-11. From that exercise alone one can draw some conc lusions about the fut ure, not very opt imistic one s. The attack against Nicaragua was one of the highe st priorities of the war on terror launc hed as the Reagan administration came into offi ce in 1981, targeting primarily \"state-spons ored terrori sm.\" Nicaragua was an unus ually dange rous agent of the plague because it was so close to hom e: \"a cancer, right here in our land mass,\" ope nly renewing the goa ls of Hitler's Mein Kampf, Secretary of S tate George Shultz declared to Congre ss.54 Nicaragua was armed by the Soviet Union, which had implanted there \"a privileged sanctuary for terrori sts and subve rsives just two days' driving time from Harlinge n, Texas,\" the president warned — \"a dagge r pointed at the heart of Texas,\" to paraphra se an illustrious predecessor. This second Cuba would become \"a launc hing pad for revolution up and dow n, first of all, Latin America,\" then who know s where? \"Nicaragua n communists have threatened to carry their revolution into the United States itself.\" Soon we may see \"Soviet military bases on America's doors tep,\" a \"strategic disaster.\" Despite the immense odds he faced, the president bravely told report ers: \"I refuse to give up. I remember a man named Winston Churc hill who said, 'Never give in. Never, never, never.' So we won't.\"55 Reagan declared a nationa l emergency because \"the policies and the actions of the gove rnm ent of Nicaragua cons titute an unus ual and extraordi nary threat to the nationa l security and fore ign policy of the United States.\" Explaining the bom bing of Libya in 1986, Reagan announc ed that the mad dog Qadda fi was sending arms and advisers to Nicaragua \"to bring his war hom e to the United States,\" part of his campaign \"to expe l America from the world.\" Particularly ominous was Nicaragua 's \"revolution without borde rs,\" regularly brandished though it had immediately been expos ed as a fraud. The sourc e was a speech by Sandinista leader Tomas Borge explaining that Nicaragua hope d to develop successfully and provi de a mode l for others, who would have to follow their own paths. The speech was transmuted by Reaganite Public Diplomacy into a design for world conque st, and fa ithful ly re layed by t he media.56 Noam Chom sky 53 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Even more interesting than the antics of a political leadership seeking to set new records for absurdi ty and deceit are the actual contents of the doc ument subjected to State Department manipulation. Borge 's words proba bly did strike terror in the hearts of Reagan's planne rs. They unde rstood very well that the real threat is successful developm ent that might \"infect others,\" renewing the dange r of Guatemala's crushed expe riment with democracy and social reform , Cuba 's \"successful defiance,\" and many other examples, back to the days when the American revolution terrified the Czar and Metternich. The threat had to be recast in terms of aggre ssion and terror for the purpos es of P ublic Diplomacy. Pursuing that voc ation, Secretary of State Shultz warned that \"terrori sm is a war against ordi nary citizens.\" As he spoke , US planes were bom bing Libya , killing doz ens of ordi nary citizens. The bom bing was the first terrori st attack in history scheduled for prime-time TV, exactly when all major networks ope ned their evening news, no small technical feat given the logistical difficulties. Shultz warned particularly of the Nicaragua n cancer, announc ing that we must \"cut it out.\" And not by gentle means: \"Negotiations are a euphe mism for capitulation if the shadow of pow er is not cast across the bargaining table,\" Shultz orated, conde mning thos e who advoc ate \"utopian, legalistic means like outside mediation, the United Nations , and the World Court , while ignori ng the pow er element of t he equa tion.\"57 Washington forc efully bl ocked such U topian m eans, be ginning w ith the effort s of Ce ntral American presidents to bring a negotiated peace to the region in the early 1980s . Washington proc eeded to \"cut the cancer out\" by violence and, not surpri singly cons idering the array of forc es, with great success. The leading academic historian of Nicaragua , Thom as Walker, points out that after a few years, Washington's terrori st war had reversed the cons iderable econom ic grow th and social progre ss that followed the ove rthrow of the US-backed Somoza dictatorship, driving the highly vulnerable econom y to disaster so that the count ry achieved \"the une nviable status of being the poore st count ry in the Western hemisphe re\" by the time the administration had achieved its goa ls. One compone nt of the triumph, Walker continue s, was a death toll that would be comparable to 2.25 million dead in the US, relative to popul ation. Reagan State Department offi cial and historian Thom as Carothers obs erves that for Nicaragua , the toll \"in per capita terms was significantly highe r than the num ber of U.S. persons killed in the U.S. Civil War and all the wars of the twentieth century c ombined.\"56 Destruction of Nicaragua was a task of no slight import ance. The count ry's progre ss duri ng the early 1980s was laude d by the World Bank and other internationa l agencies as \"remarkable\" and as \"laying a solid founda tion for long-t erm socio-econom ic developm ent\" (Int er-A merican Developm ent Bank). In the health sector, the count ry enjoye d \"one of the most dramatic improve ments in child survi val in the developing world\" (UNICE F, 1986). The real cancer feared by the Reaganites was thus serious : Nicaragua 's \"remarkable\" transform ation could have metastasized to a \"revolution without borde rs\" in the sense of the speech that was reshaped for propa ganda purpos es. It was therefore only logical, from Washington's point of view, to eradicate the \"virus\" before it could \"infect others,\" who must in turn be \"inoc ulated\" by terror and repression. Like Cuba , Nicaragua did not respond to the terrori st attack with bom bings in the US, effort s to assassinate the political leadership, and other such measures, which, we are solemnly inform ed, meet the highe st standa rds when conduc ted by our leaders. Rather, it approa ched the World Court for relief. Its legal team was led by the distingui shed Harvard University law profe ssor Abram Cha yes. Expe cting that the US would abide by a court decision, the team prepared a very narrow case, restricted to terrori st acts that required scarcely any argum ent, because they were conc eded: mining of N icaragua n ha rbors , in pa rticular.60 Noam Chom sky 54 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"In 1986, the court found in Nicaragua 's favor, dismissing US gove rnm ent claims and conde mning Washington for \"unl awful use of forc e\"—i nternationa l terrori sm, in lay terms. The court ruling went beyond Nicaragua 's narrow charge. Reiterating more forc efully earlier decisions , the court ruled any form of intervention \"prohi bited\" if it interferes with the sove reign right of \"choice of a political, econom ic, social and cultural system, and the form ulation of policy\": intervention is \"wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices.\" The judgm ent applies to many other cases. The court also defined \"hum anitarian aid\" explicitly, ruling all US aid to the contras strictly military, hence illegal. US econom ic warfare was also ruled in violation of valid treaties, therefore unl awful.61 The decision had little detectable effect. The World Court was conde mned as a \"hos tile forum \" by the editors of t he New York T imes, and t herefore irrelevant, like the UN. Legal authori ties not ed for their defense of world orde r dismissed the ruling on grounds that America \"ne eds the freedom to defend freedom \" (Thom as Franck), as it was doing in devastating Nicaragua and much of the rest of Central America. Others conde mned the court because of its \"close ties to the Soviet Union\" (Robe rt Leiken, Washington Post), a claim not worthy of refutation. Subs eque nt aid to the contras was uniform ly described as \"hum anitarian\" in violation of the explicit court ruling. Congre ss immediately approve d an additiona l $100 million to escalate what the court had conde mned as the \"unl awful use of forc e.\" Washington continue d to unde rmine \"Utopian, legalistic means\" until it finally achieved its ends by vi olence. The World Court furt her orde red the US to pay inde mnities, and Nicaragua sought to estimate the costs, unde r internationa l supe rvision. Estimates were in the $17 billion to $18 billion range . The call for reparations was of cours e dismissed as ridiculous , though just to make sure, after the US regained control, the Nicaragua n gove rnm ent was heavily pressured to abandon the claims for reparations manda ted by t he court . Interestingly, the figure of $17 billion is the amount that Iraq has paid to people and companies in compensation for its inva sion of Kuwait. The num bers killed in the Iraqi conque st of Kuwait appe ar to be on the orde r of the US inva sion of Panama a few months earlier (hundre ds or thous ands , accordi ng to various estimates)—a fraction of the deaths in Nicaragua and perhaps 5 percent of thos e killed in the US-backed Israeli inva sion of Lebanon in 1982. There is, of cours e, no thought of c ompensation i n such cases. Another relevant comparison in terms of compensation is Vietnam. Here attitude s vary as usual from dove s to hawks. At the dovi sh extreme, President Carter assured Americans that we owe Vietnam no debt and have no respons ibility to rende r it any assistance because \"the destruction was mutual.\" Others thought we shoul d not be so soft-hearted. Taking a mode rate view, neither hawk nor dove , President Bus h I announc ed that \"it was a bitter confl ict, but Hanoi know s toda y that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past.\" The crimes the Vietnamese committed against us can never be forgot ten, but \"we can begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam war\" if they dedicate themselves with suffi cient zeal to the MIAs, the sole moral issue that remains after an inva sion that left millions dead and three count ries in utter ruins, with unknow n num bers still dying from une xplode d ordi nance and the massive chemical warfare attack against the South; the North was spared this particular horror.

There are earlier precedents. Haiti's liberation from French rule in 1804 shoc ked civilized opinion, which feared that the virus of liberation might spread from \"the first free nation of free men.\"64 For obvi ous reasons , the dange r was particularly acute in the US, which took the lead in isolating the criminal state, relenting only in 1862 when destinations were being sought for freed slaves (Liberia was recogni zed in the same year). In puni shment for the crime of liberation, Haiti was compelled to pay France a huge inde mnity in 1825, which gua ranteed French dom ination and had a catastrophi c effect on t he society that France had de vastated in the war of l iberation i n its richest colony.6s Half a century before France's puni shment of Haiti for its successful defiance, George Washington set fort h in 1779 on the conque st of the adva nced Iroquoi s civilization. His goa l was to \"extirpate them from the Count ry,\" he wrote to Lafayette on the Fourt h of July, and to expa nd American bounda ries westward toward the Mississippi; conque st of Canada was barred by British forc e. The \"Town destroye r,\" as Washington was know n to the indigenous popul ation, completed his mission successfully. The Iroquoi s were then inform ed that they would have to provi de compensation for their treacherous resistance to their liberators. Another Clinton, then gove rnor of New York, inform ed the defeated tribes that \"cons idering our Losses, the Debts we have incurre d, and our form er Friends hip, it is reasona ble that You make to Us a Cession of your Lands as will aid Us in repairing and discharging the same.\" Having little choice, the Iroquoi s ceded their territory, only to discove r that New York S tate proc eeded at onc e to vi olate its solemn treaties and t he prohi bitions of the Articles of Confe deration and to take most of the rest through threats, deception, and guile. A young American soldier later wrote hom e that \"I really feel guilty as I applied the torch to huts that were Homes of Cont ent until we rav-agers came spreading desolation everyw here,\" but perhaps in a good cause: \"Our mission here is ostensibly to destroy but may it not transpire that we pillagers are carelessly sowing t he seeds of E mpire?\"66 Following the US rejection of the World Court orde rs, Nicaragua — still eschewing violent retaliation or threat of terror—t ook its case to the Security Counc il, which endors ed the court 's judgm ent and called on all states to obs erve internationa l law. The US vetoed the resolution. Nicaragua then approa ched the General Assembly, which passed a similar resolution with only the US, Israel, and El Salvador oppos ed; and another the following year with only the US and Israel oppos ed. L ittle of t his was even re port ed, a nd t he matter ha s disappe ared from history. Washington's reaction to the orde rs of the World Court and the Security Counc il was to escalate the terrori st war, while also issuing offi cial orde rs to its forc es to go \"after soft targets\" and to avoid the Nicaragua n army.67 State Department spoke sperson Cha rles Redman confi rmed and justified the new and more extreme terrori st progra ms, issuing a statement that \"would do credit to George Orwell's Ministry of Truth,\" Americas Watch responde d, adding that Redman's conc eption of \"legitimate target\" would justify terrori st attacks on Israeli collectives—or on US civilian targets, for t hat matter.

In 1990, with a \" 'gun to their heads' [as] was clear to many impartial obs ervers\" (Walker), Nicaragua ns succumbed and voted to turn the count ry ove r to the US-backed candidate. US elites celebrated the triumph, entranced by the new \"rom antic age.\" Com mentators across the spectrum of respectable opinion enthus iastically laude d the success of the methods adopt ed to \"wreck the econom y and pros ecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exha usted natives ove rthrow the unw anted gove rnm ent themselves,\" with a cost to us that is \"minimal,\" leaving the victims \"with wrecked bridge s, sabotaged pow er stations , and ruined farms,\" and thus provi ding the US candidate with \"a winning issue\": ending the \"impove rishment of the people of Nicaragua \" (Time).

The offi cial policy of attacking soft targets relied on US control of the skies ove r Nicaragua and the sophi sticated communications equipment provi ded to the terrori st forc es attacking from US bases in Hondura s. The Reagan administration tried the technique that was praised by CIA director Allen Dulles in Guatemala and recommende d for Cuba : pressuring allies to refuse reque sts for military aid, so that Nicaragua would turn to the Rus sians for help and could then be port rayed as a tentacle of the Kremlin-spons ored cons piracy poised to destroy us. The Nicaragua n gove rnm ent did not rise to the bait, how ever. Reaganite propa ganda therefore fabricated lurid tales about Soviet MiGs threatening the US from Nicaragua n bases. That is not surpri sing; one expe cts systems of vast pow er to be committed to lying and deceit. But the reactions are more revealing. Hawks called for the bom bing of Nicaragua in puni shment for this j new crime. Dove s tende d to be more cautious , que stioning the reli-ability of the claims but adding that if they were accurate, then we would have to bom b Nicaragua , because the planes would be \"capable against the United States\" (Senator Paul Tsonga s). US security would be at risk if the Nicaragua n air forc e obtained some vintage 1950s MiGs to defend its airspace. In contrast, there was no threat to Nicaragua 's security when US client forc es attack unde fende d civilian targets unde r the guidance of US planes that controlled the count ry's skies. Another example of \"l ogical illogicality.\" That Nicaragua might have the right to prot ect its airspace from ongoi ng US terrori st attack is next to inconc eivable. The thought was virtually never voiced—w hich is reasona ble, too, given the principle that US actions are defensive by definition so that any reaction to them is aggre ssion, much like the \"internal aggre ssion\" of the South Vietnamese in South Vietnam, \"assaulting\" the American de fende rs \"from the inside,\" in the rhe toric of K enne dy l iberals. With Washington-s tyle democracy and prope r econom ic practice restored, the count ry sank more deeply into political and socioeco-nom ic ruin while attention lapsed in the US. A decade after the US had regained control, half the econom ically active popul ation had left the count ry, \"oft en the boldest, most capable, most determined,\" either legally or as illegal migrant worke rs. Their remittances, estimated at some $800 million annua lly, \"are what keep the damper dow n on unc ontrollable social uphe aval,\" the research journa l of the Jesuit University report ed.

But \"Nicaragua expe riences the end of the world nearly every day [after] the destruction the US gove rnm ent has repeatedly wreaked on this count ry and its people.\" The atrocities of 9-11 may be denounc ed as \"Armageddon,\" but Nicaragua ns recall that their count ry \"lived its own Armageddon in excruciating slow motion [unde r US assault] and is now subm erged in its dismal aftermath,\" having been reduc ed to the second poore st count ry in the hemisphe re (after Haiti), vying with Guatemala for the distinction, also enjoying perhaps the world record for conc entration of w ealth.72 Among the victors, all of this has been effaced in the classic fashion. Nicaragua and El Salvador are remembered as \"relative success stories—a nd precisely the kind of success stories we lack in the Middle East,\" to be remedied by the new crusade for \"de mocratization.\"73 One would be hard put to find a phra se within mainstream commentary sugge sting that the record of internationa l terrori sm of curre nt Bus h administration offi cials might have some bearing on the \"war on terror\" they redeclared on 9-11. Among the leading figure s of the redeclared war is John Negropont e, who ran the Embassy in Hondura s that was the main base for the terrori st attacks on Nicaragua . He was duly chos en to ove rsee the diplomatic compone nt of the curre nt pha se of the war on terror at the United Nations . Its military compone nt is run by Dona ld Rum sfeld, who was Reagan's special envoy to the Middle East duri ng the period of the worst terror there and was also delegated to establish firmer relations with Sadda m Hussein. The Central American \"war on terror\" was supe rvised by Elliott Abrams. After pleading guilty to misdemeanor count s in the Iran-contra affair, Abrams received a Chri stmas Eve pardon from President Bus h I in 1992, and was appoi nted by Bus h II \"to lead the Nationa l Security Counc il's offi ce for Near East and North African affairs, ... the senior director job [that] ove rsees Arab-Is raeli relations and U.S. effort s to prom ote peace in the troubl ed region,\"74 a phra se drawn from Orwell, in light of the record.

His predecessor, John Poinde xter, was in charge of the Iran-contra crimes and was convi cted in 1990 of five felony count s (ove rturne d mostly on technicalities). Bus h II placed him in charge of directing the Pentagon' s Total Inform ation Awareness progra m, unde r which, the ACLU obs erves, \"every American—from the Nebraskan farmer to the Wall Street banke r—w ill find themselves unde r the accusatory cybe r-stare of a n all-pow erful nationa l security appa ratus.\"76 T he rest of t he list is mostly similar. Nicaraguans were the lucky ones during the first phase of the \"war on terror.\" They at least had an army to defend them against state-supported terrorism. In neighboring states the terrorists were the security forces. El Salvador became the leading recipient of US military aid and training (Israel-Egypt aside) by the mid-1980s , as atrocities were peaking. Congr ess imposed human rights conditions on aid to Guatemala, compelling the Reaganites to resort to their international terror network to take over the task, including Argentine neo-Nazis (until they were overthrown at home), Israel, Taiwan, and others experienced in \"counterterror.\" The torture and destruction of the civilian popul ation were consequently much worse. The editors of Envio add that in December 1989, \"the gove rnm ent of George Bus h Sr. orde red the inva sion of Panama, a military ope ration that bom bed civilian neighborhoods and killed thous ands of Panamanians just to flush out a single man, Manue l Noriega. Was that not state terrori sm?\"77 A fair que stion, though much stronge r terms are used when thos e who lack the pow er to control history c arry out such actions . Though \"disappe ared\" by the victors in rout ine fashion, the crimes are not forgot ten by the victims. Panamanians, too, while conde mning the 9-11 attacks, recalled the death of perhaps thous ands of poor people in the cours e of Operation Just Cause, unde rtaken to kidna p a disobe dient thug who was sentenced to life imprisonm ent in Florida for crimes mostly committed while he was on the CIA payrol l.

In Latin America, where there is the longe st expe rience of US violence, support was least, scarcely detectable. Latin Americans hardly have to be reminde d by Carlos Salinas, form er director of gove rnm ent relations for Amnesty Internationa l, that they \"know better than perhaps most people that the U.S. gove rnm ent is one of the bigge st spons ors of terrori sm.\"79 It is easy to dismiss the world as \"irrelevant\" or cons umed by \"pa ranoid anti-Americanism,\" but perhaps not wise.

The first time around, the imagery cons tructed for the leader was not very different, and the rhetoric no less fevered: all states must band toge ther to combat \"the evil scourge of terrori sm\" (Re agan), particularly state-backed internationa l terrori sm, a \"plague spread by depraved oppone nts of civilization itself,\" in a \"return to ba rbarism in the mode rn a ge\" (G eorge Shultz).1 Import ant que stions shoul d have arisen at onc e: What cons titutes terrori sm? How doe s it differ from aggre ssion or resistance? The ope rative answers are revealing, but the que stions never entered the arena of publ ic discussion. A conve nient definition was adopt ed: terrori sm is what our leaders declare it to be . Period. T he pra ctice continue s as the war is redeclared.2 In the 1980s the two main foci of the \"war on terror\" were Central America and the Mideast/Mediterranean region. In Central America, as discussed, the war on terror instantly became a barbaric terrori st war, hailed as a grand success and discarded from history. In the Middle East, as we shall see, the commande rs in Washington and their local associates were again respons ible for crimes far exceeding anything charged to their offi cial enemies. The facts are particularly noteworthy because the retail terror they were oppos ing was inflated by their propa ganda systems to become the lead story of t he year by t he mid-1980s , an impressive achievement. Turni ng elsewhere, duri ng the Reagan years Washington's South African ally had primary respons ibility for more than 1.5 million dead and $60 billion in damage in the newly liberated Portugue se colonies of Angol a and Mozambique . A UNICE F study estimated the death toll of infants and young children in these two count ries at 850,000—150,000 in 1988 alone , reversing gains of the early pos t-inde pende nce years primarily through the weapon of \"mass terrori sm.\" That is putting aside South Africa's practices within its own borde rs, where it was defending civilization against the ons laught s of Nelson Mande la's African Nationa l Congre ss, one of the \"more notorious terrori st groups ,\" accordi ng to a 1988 Pentagon report . Meanwhile the Reaganites evaded sanctions , increased trade, and provi ded va luable diplomatic support for S outh A frica.3 One of t he ende avors of t he curre nt incumbents has become well know n: the success of t he CIA and its associates duri ng the 1980s in recruiting radical Islamists and orga nizing them into a military and terrori st forc e. The goa l, accordi ng to Carter's nationa l security adviser, Zbigniew Brz ezinski, was \"to draw the Rus sians into the Afgha n trap,\" initially by secret ope rations that would induc e them to inva de Afgha nistan.

The Rus sian decision was unde rtaken reluctantly and with narrow and defensive objectives, as \"is now clearly established in the Soviet archives,\" he writes. For the Reaganites, who took ove r a year later, \"the single aim,\" he continue s, was \"bleeding the Rus sians and pilloryi ng the Soviets in world opinion.\" The immediate result was a war that devastated Afgha nistan, with even worse cons eque nces after the Rus sians withdre w and Reagan's jihadis took ove r. The long-t erm result was two decades of terror and civil war. In the 1980s there was threat of worse, as \"CIA -backed incursions of Afgha n gue rillas and saboteurs into Soviet territory nearly provoke d a major Soviet-Pakistani, if not Soviet-American war,\" with unfore seeable cons eque nces.4 After the Rus sians withdre w, the terror orga nizations recruited, armed, and trained by the US and its allies (among them Al Qaeda and similar jihadis) turne d their attention elsewhere, inflaming the Indi a-Pakistan confl ict with \"an unpre cedented terrori st offe nsive in Indi a in March 1993,\" and repeatedly bringing the region to the brink of nuc lear war in later years as the flames spread. A month earlier, related groups had come close to blowing up the World Trade Center, following a \"form ula taught in CIA manua ls.\" The planning was traced to followers of Sheikh Omar Abde l Rahman, who had been helped to enter the US and was prot ected within the count ry by the CIA .5 Other cons eque nces around t he world ne ed not be reviewed. Also at least partially familiar is the long-s tanding support of the present incumbents for Sadda m Hussein, often attributed to obs ession with Iran. That policy continue d without change after Iran's capitulation in the Iran-Ira q war, because of \"our duty to support U.S. export ers,\" the State Department explained in early 1990— a dding t he usual boi lerplate about how aiding S adda m would improve hum an rights, regiona l stability, and peace. In Octobe r 1989, long after the war with Iran was ove r and more than a year after Sadda m's gassing of the Kurds , President Bus h I issued a nationa l security directive declaring that \"norm al relations between the United States and Iraq would serve our longe r-term interests and prom ote stability in both the Gulf and the Middle East.\" He took t he occasion of t he inva sion of P anama short ly after to lift a ban on l oans to Ira q. The US offe red subs idized food suppl ies that Sadda m's regime badly needed after its destruction of Kurdi sh agricultural produc tion, along with adva nced technol ogy and biological agents adaptable to WMD. The warmth of the relations was indicated when a delegation of senators, led by Majority Leader and future Republ ican presidential candidate Bob Dole, visited Sadda m in April 1990. They conve yed President Bus h's greetings and assured Sadda m that his probl ems did not lie with the US gove rnm ent but with \"the haught y and pampered press.\" Senator Alan Simpson advised Sadda m to \"invite them to come here and see for themselves\" to ove rcome their misconc eptions . Dole assured Sadda m that a commentator on V oice of A merica who ha d be en critical of hi m had be en re move d.6 Sadda m was not the only mons ter who won the acclaim of the curre nt incumbents. Among others were Ferdinand Marcos, \"Ba by Doc\" Duva lier, and Nicolae Ceau§e scu; all were ove rthrow n from within, despite strong US support until their fate was sealed. Other favori tes include d Indone sia's President Suha rto, who competed with Sadda m in barbarism. The first head of state honore d with a visit to Bus h the elder's White Hous e was Mobut u Sese Seko of Zaire, another high-ra nking killer, torturer, and plunde rer. The South Korean dictators also received Washington's strong support until US-backed military rule was finally ove rthrow n in 1987 by popul ar move ments. Even minor thugs could be assured of a warm welcome as long as they were perform ing their func tion. Secretary of State Shultz was so enamored of Manue l Noriega that he flew to Panama to congra tulate him after he had stolen an election by fraud and violence, praising the gangs ter for \"initiating the proc ess of democracy.\" Later Noriega lost his usefulness in the contra war and other enterpri ses, and was transferred to the category of \"evil\"— although, like Sadda m, his worst crimes were behind him.

We confront \"evil's face\" by lending it a willing hand, at least if there is something to gain. The immediate pos t-revolution Washington Post article just cited was corre ct in report ing that \"it is nice that President Bus h [I] has offe red to establish diplomatic relations with [Rom ania's] hastily orga nized Counc il of Nationa l Salvation, but that doe s not absolve the West for its role in helping to maintain this tyrant in recent years\"—a message that seems to ha ve gone the way of ot her una cceptable insights into the real world. In 1983, Vice President Bus h expre ssed his admiration for Ceau-§e scu's political and econom ic progre ss and \"respect for hum an rights.\" Two years later Reagan's ambassador resigne d because of Washington's objections to his conc ern for hum an rights. Short ly after, Secretary of State Shultz praised Rom ania as among the \"good Com munists,\" rewarding Ceau§e scu with a visit and econom ic favors . So matters continue d until the tyrant was ove rthrow n—by Rom anians, as in the case of ot her ki llers and t orturers in the Re agan-Bus h entoura ge. As soon as its favori te \"good Com munist\" was eliminated, Washington announc ed that a \"terrible burde n\" had been lifted from Rom ania, while at the same time lifting its ban on loans to Sadda m Hussein in orde r to achieve the \"goa l of increasing US export s and put us in a better pos ition to deal with Iraq regarding its hum an rights record,\" the State Department explained with a straight face.9 As always, the US leadership can confi dently take credit for the ove rthrow of the tyrants it support ed until the very end. Sadda m Hussein has joined \"the pantheon of failed brut al dictators\" whom the US has depos ed, Dona ld Rum sfeld proudl y announc ed, including Ceau-§e scu in the pantheon. On the same day as Rum sfeld's declaration, Paul Wolfow itz explained that his love of democracy was hone d \"duri ng his form ative years in the Reagan administration, when he was the State Department's chief Asia hand,\" praising the mons trous Suha rto and support ing the brut al and corrupt Marcos, whos e fall, he now claims, show s that democracy \"ne eds the proddi ng of the US\"10— which backed Marcos until he could no longe r be sustained in the face of popul ar oppos ition joined even by the bus iness classes and the army.

Grow th ove rwhelmingly benefited the very rich, unlike the \"gol den age\" of the fifties and sixties, when it was evenly spread across the popul ation. During the Reagan-Bus h years real wages stagna ted or declined along with benefits; worki ng hours increased; and employe rs were given free rein to ignore prot ection for l abor orga nizing. T he pol icies were, na turally, unpopul ar. A s the Bus h I administration re ached its final days, Re agan w as ranke d alongs ide Nixon a s the least popul ar living ex-pre sident.12 It is not easy, unde r such condi tions , to maintain political pow er. Only one good method is know n: inspire fear. That tactic was employe d throughout the Reagan-Bus h years, as the leadership conjured up one devil after another to fri ghten the popul ace into obe dience. The threats to Americans duri ng the first war on terror were immense. By Nove mber 1981, Libya n hit men were roaming the streets of Washington to assassinate the president, who coura geous ly faced dow n the scoundre l Qadda fi. From the first moment, the administration recogni zed Libya to be a defenseless punc hing bag, and therefore set up confront ations in which many Libya ns could be killed, hopi ng for a Libya n re spons e that could be exploited to induc e fear. Before Americans could breathe a sigh of relief ove r the president's lucky escape from the Libya n hit men, Qadda fi was on the march again, this time inva ding Suda n across 600 miles of desert, with the air forc es of the US and its allies standing by helplessly. Qadaffi also allegedly conc octed a plot to ove rthrow the gove rnm ent of Suda n so subtle that Suda nese and Egypt ian intelligence kne w nothing about it, as discove red by the few US report ers who took the troubl e to inve stigate. The subs eque nt US show of forc e enabled Secretary of State Shultz to announc e that Qadda fi \"is back in his box where he belongs \" because Reagan acted \"qui ckly and decisively,\" demons trating \"the strength of the cowboy\" that so entranced worshipful intellectuals (Paul Johns on, in this case). The episode was qui ckly re legated to obl ivion onc e its purpos es had be en served.13 Just as the early Libya n threats subs ided, another even more dange rous one appe ared: an air base in Noam Chom sky 63 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Grenada that the Rus sians could use to bom b us.

The offi cial stance was that Article 51 of the UN Cha rter accords us the right to use violence \"in self- defense against future attack.\" That was perhaps the first explicit form ulation of the doc trine of \"pre ventive war,\" and the end of any hope s of a world of orde r and law, if taken at all serious ly.

The Europe an touri st indus try went into periodic decline, as Americans were too frightened to travel to Europe an cities because they might be attacked by crazed Arabs or other demons . Grave threats were conc octed at hom e as well. Crime in the US is not very different from other indus trial count ries. Fear of crime, how ever, is much highe r. The same is true of drugs : a probl em in other societies, an imminent dange r to our very existence in the US. It is easy for political leaders to use the media to whip up fear of these and other menaces. Campaigns are mount ed periodically, when required by dom estic political needs. Bus h I's racist Willie Horton escapade in the 1988 e lection c ampaign i s a famous example. The September 1989 redeclaration of the \"drug war\" was another striking illustration. In the face of subs tantial evidence to the contrary, the administration dramatically proc laimed that Hispanic narcotraffickers were a menace to our society. Officials could be confi dent that the tactic would succeed, as explained by journa list and editor Hoddi ng Carter, form er assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration. It's a \"lead-pi pe cinch,\" he wrote, that \"the mass media in America have an ove rwhelming tende ncy to jump up and dow n and bark in conc ert whenever the White Hous e— any W hite Hous e—s naps its finge rs.\" The campaign was a grand success—a part from affecting drug use. Fear of drugs instantly shot to the lead of publ ic conc erns. The stage was set for escalating the campaign to remove supe rfluous people from city streets to the new prisons that were rapidly being built; and to go on to Operation Just Cause, the glorious inva sion of Panama on grounds of Noriega's invol vement with drug trafficking, among other reasons . At the same time, the Bus h administration was threatening Thailand with severe sanctions if it placed barriers on import of a far more lethal US-produc ed subs tance, toba cco. But all this passed in silence. In the case of Panama, too, there was a knoc kdow n legal argum ent for inva sion. UN ambassador Thom as Pickering instructed the Security Counc il that Article 51 of the UN Cha rter \"provi des for the use of armed forc e to defend a count ry, to defend our interests and our people,\" and to prevent \"its territory from being used to smuggl e drugs into the US\"—i n this case, by reinstating the white Noam Chom sky 64 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"elite of banke rs and bus inessmen, many of whom were themselves suspected of narcotrafficking and mone y launde ring and who soon lived up to their reputation, US gove rnm ent agencies report ed.17 Throughout , the legal argum ents keep to a principle enunc iated by the distingui shed Israeli statesman Abba Eban: in \"de termining the legal basis\" for some intende d action, \"one might work backward from the action one wished to take to fi nd a legal justification.\"18 The script has been followed fairly closely as much the same elements gained a hold on political pow er in the 2000 election. In 1981 they had combined a vast increase in military spending with tax cuts, calculating \"that grow ing hys teria ove r the ensuing deficit would create pow erful pressures to cut federal [social] spending, and thus , perhaps, enable the Administration to accomplish its goa l of rolling back the New Deal.\" Bus h II followed the pattern with tax cuts ove rwhelmingly benefiting the very rich, and \"the bigge st surge in federal spending in twenty years,\"19 largely military, hence indirectly hi gh-t ech indus try. Gove rnm ent deficits require \"fiscal discipline,\" which translates into cutbacks for services for the general popul ation.

Their study was to be include d in the annua l budge t report publ ished in Februa ry 2003 but was remove d, perhaps because it fore cast that closing the gap would require a huge tax increase and Bus h was trying to ram through another tax reduc tion, again benefiting mainly the rich. \"President Bus h is worki ng ove rtime to deepen our fiscal trap,\" econom ists Laurence Kotlikoff and Jeffre y Sachs obs erve, report ing the enorm ous anticipated fiscal gap. Among the results, they contend, will be \"massive cuts in future Social Security and Medicare benefits.\" White Hous e spoke sperson Ari Fleischer agreed with the $44 trillion estimate and implicitly conc eded the accuracy of the analysis as well: \"There is no que stion that Social Security and Medicare are going to present [fut ure] generations with a crushing debt burde n unless policymakers work serious ly to reform thos e progra ms\"—w hich doe s not mean fundi ng them by progre ssive taxation.

Social Security, publ ic school s, and other such deviations from the \"right way\" that US military pow er is to impos e on the world, as frankly declared, are based on evil doc trines, among them the pernicious belief that we shoul d care, as a community, w hether the disabled w idow on t he other side of town can make it through the day, or the child next door shoul d have a chance for a decent future. These evil doc trines derive from the principle of sympathy that was taken to be the core of hum an nature by Adam Smith and David Hume, a principle that must be driven from the mind. Privatization has other benefits. If worki ng people depend on the stock market for their pensions , health care, and other means of survi val, they have a stake in unde rmining their own interests: oppos ing wage increases, health and safety regulations , and other measures that might cut into profi ts that flow to the benefactors on whom they must rely, in a manne r reminiscent of feuda lism. After a surge of presidential popul arity following 9-11, polls revealed increasing discontent with the social and econom ic policies of the administration. If there was to be any hope of maintaining political pow er, the Bus h forc es were virtually compelled to adopt what Anatol Lieven calls \"the Noam Chom sky 65 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"classic mode rn strategy of an enda nge red right-wing oligarchy, which is to divert mass discontent into nationa lism,\"22 a strategy which is second nature to them in any event, having worke d so well duri ng their first twelve years in offi ce. The strategy was outlined by Karl Rove , the chief political adviser: Republ icans must \"go to the count ry on the issue of nationa l security\" in Nove mber 2002, because voters \"trust the Republ ican Party\" for \"prot ecting America.\" Similarly, he explained, Bus h will have to be port rayed as a wartime leader for the 2004 presidential campaign. \"As long as dom estic issues were dom inating ne ws cove rage and pol itical battles ove r the summer, Bus h and hi s Republ icans lost ground,\" the chief internationa l analyst for UPI pointed out. But the \"imminent threat\" of Iraq was conjured up just in time, in September 2002. Recogni zing its vulnerability on dom estic issues, \"the administration is campaigning to sustain and increase its pow er on a policy of internationa l adve nturism, new radical preemptive military strategies, and a hunge r for a politically conve nient and pe rfectly timed confront ation w ith Ira q.\"23 For the midterm electoral campaign, the tactic worke d—j ust. Even though voters \"be lieve that Republ icans are more conc erned about large corpora tions than about ordi nary Americans,\" they trust the Re publ icans on na tiona l security.24 In S eptember, the Nationa l Security Strategy w as announc ed. Manufa ctured fear provi ded enough of a popul ar base for the inva sion of Iraq, instituting the new norm of aggre ssive war at will, and afforde d the administration enough of a hold on political pow er so that it could proc eed with a harsh and unpopul ar dom estic agenda . Again, the script of the first tenure in pow er is being followed closely, though now with greater fervor, fewer external cons traints, and c ons iderably gre ater threats to pe ace. Insignificant Risks The war with Iraq was unde rtaken with the recogni tion that it might well lead to prol iferation of WMD and terror, risks cons idered insignificant compared with the pros pect of gaining control ove r Iraq, fi rmly establishing t he norm of pre ventive war, and s trengthening t he hol d on dom estic pow er. Evidence as to how serious ly real security threats ranke d on the priority list was provi ded immediately after the announc ement of the imperial grand strategy on September 17, 2002. The administration at onc e publ icly \"abandone d an internationa l effort to strengthen the Biological Weapons Conve ntion against germ warfare,\" advising allies that furt her discussions would have to be delayed for four years.25 As noted, in mid-O ctobe r it was learned that duri ng an earlier episode of playing with fire, the world was brought ominous ly close to nuc lear war. Ten days later, on Octobe r 23, the UN Disarmament Com mittee adopt ed two crucial resolutions . The first called for stronge r measures to prevent the militarization of space and thereby to \"avert a grave dange r for internationa l peace and security.\" The second reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol \"prohi biting the use of poisonous gases and bacteriological methods of warfare.\" Bot h passed una nimous ly, with two abstentions : the US and Israel. US abstention amount s to a veto: typically, a doubl e veto, banning the events from report ing and history. In the mainstream media, there was no mention of these failed attempts by t he rest of t he world to pre vent serious threats to survi val. The meager press cove rage of the startling revelations at the Havana retrospective in Octobe r 2002 had little to say about the highly topical issues of internationa l terrori sm and forc eful regime change , or about the Iraq conne ction, which was very much in the minds of the participants. On their way to Havana, they had surely read the letter sent by CIA director George Tenet to the Senate Intelligence Com mittee chair, Senator Bob Graham, report ing that although there was little likelihood that Sadda m would initiate a terrori st ope ration with conve ntiona l weapons or any Noam Chom sky 66 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"chemical or biological weapons he might have, the proba bility would rise to \"pre tty high\" in the event of US attack. The FBI also report ed conc erns \"that a war with Iraq could trigge r new dom estic terrori sm risks,\" as did the head of Homeland Security. The leading internationa l military- intelligence journa l and allied intelligence agencies drew the same conc lusions , adding the furt her obs ervation that a US attack could \"globa lize anti-American and anti-Western sentiment... . Attacking Iraq would intensify Islamic terrori sm, not reduc e it\": \"a war in Iraq threatens to fuel unre st and create new terrori st threats, Europe an security and police offi cials are warning their gove rnm ents,\" re cruiting ne w young pe ople \"to the evergrow ing a nti-US stand.\"26 Conc urri ng, Richard Betts, a specialist on surpri se attack and nuc lear blackmail, wrote that in the event of a US inva sion \"Sadda m will have no reason to withhol d his best parting shot—w hich could be the use of [WMD] inside the United States\"—t hat is, activating networks already in place. \"The odds may be low,\" he obs erved: \"pe rhaps as low\" as what took place on 9-11.27 Thos e who have any conc ern for the safety and security of the people of the United States and other likely targets would not , of c ours e, dismiss the odds as negligible. Mainstream expe rts agreed that an attack by the most pow erful military forc e in history against a defenseless enemy might well stimulate the que st for revenge or deterrence. Prom inent internationa l relations scholars have pointed out that potential targets of US adve nturism \"know that the United States can be held at bay only by deterrence,\" primarily by WMD (Kenne th Waltz). In this way, \"American policies stimulate the vertical prol iferation of nuc lear weapons and prom ote their spreading from one count ry to another.\" The same policies stimulate terrori sm: \"Unsurpri singly, ... weak states and disaffected people ... lash out at the United States as the agent or symbol of their suffe ring,\" and if no effort s are made to addre ss their grievances, they are likely to react with the means available to them, including terror. US intelligence adde d that the \"de epening econom ic stagna tion\" c aused by W ashington's version of gl oba lization w as likely to ha ve similar effects.28 These warnings were not new. It had been recogni zed for some time that the indus trial pow ers were likely to lose their virtual monopol y of violence, retaining only an enorm ous preponde rance. Well before 9-11, technical studies had conc lude d that \"a well-planne d ope ration to smuggl e WMD into the United States would have at least a 90 percent proba bility of success.\" This has become \"America's Achilles' Heel,\" a study with that title conc lude d, reviewing the many options available to terrori sts. The Counc il on Foreign Relations Task Force study adds others. The imminence of the dange r was evident after the 1993 attempt to blow up the World Trade Center, which, with better planning, m ight have killed tens of t hous ands of pe ople, the WTC bui lding e ngineers report ed.29 It was also anticipated that an attack on Iraq might stimulate prol iferation in more direct ways. Terrori sm specialist Daniel Benjamin (no dove ) obs erved that an inva sion might cause \"the greatest prol iferation disaster in history.\" Sadda m Hussein had prove n himself to be a brut al tyrant, but a rationa l one . If he had chemical and biological weapons , they were kept unde r tight control and \"subjected to a prope r chain of command.\" He would surely not put them in the hands of the Osama bin Ladens of the world, a terrible threat to Sadda m himself. But unde r attack, Iraqi society might collapse, and with it the controls ove r WMD, which might be offe red to the huge \"market for unc onve ntiona l weapons \"—a \"nightmare scenario\" from every point of view. Postwar inve stigation reveals that Be njamin's conc erns may ha ve been re alized w ith the looting of nuc lear sites.30 This prewar establishment critique had a num ber of import ant features. First, it echoe d conc erns in the same circles about the pos ture of a \"rogue supe rpow er\" that much of the world regards as the greatest threat to world peace and \"the single greatest external threat to their societies.\" Second, it encompassed an unus ually broa d spectrum of voices: the comments cited above come from US and world intelligence agencies; the world's leading military journa l; the Janua ry 2003 issues of the two Noam Chom sky 67 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"major nationa l fore ign policy journa ls; an unus ual publ ication of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; some of the most respected specialists on internationa l affairs, terrori sm, and strategic analysis; and e ven the \"w izards of D avos \" w ho dom inate the world's econom y. W hatever one thinks of their judgm ents, it would not be easy to find a historical precedent for such a critique of a planne d war, just as there was no precedent at all for popul ar oppos ition to a war prior to its being offi cially launc hed. Third, though this critique originated in the establishment, it was ignore d. The administration made no effort to count er it, inde ed hardly seemed to notice it, which makes sense. From a propa ganda point of view, the most pow erful state in history needs no justification or serious argum ent for its actions : declaration of nobl e intent shoul d suffi ce. Just as the UN is inform ed that it can be \"relevant\" and authori ze what we are going to do or suffe r the cons eque nces, so the world shoul d be put on notice that the hegemonic pow er bears no burde n of proof for its resort to violence, or any other action. It would be a deroga tion of authori ty to acknow ledge , let alone refute, \"critical noises\" (to borrow McGeorge Bundy' s derisive phra se). The critics are right that the supe rpow er stance might lead to self-de struction, but such conc erns have commonly not been a high pri ority of l eaders. In the present case, the administration was surely aware, even without warnings from respected authori ties, that its planne d war against Iraq and other related actions were likely to increase the risks of prol iferation of WMD and terror against the US and its allies. But evidently it assigns low priority to such threats compared with other goa ls. Furthermore, though planne rs of cours e do not welcome the prol iferation of WMD and terrori sm, they know that they can exploit such developm ents for their own purpos es, both globa l and dom estic. Even the fear they elicit throughout the world is quite acceptable: they are not trying to be love d, but obe yed, and if this is achieved by fear, that is fine—a nother contribution t o \"m aintaining c redibility.\" As for the goa ls, senior Middle East corre sponde nt and analyst Yous sef Ibra him was no doubt ove rsimplifying when he identified them as \"bol stering the president's popul arity\" for short -term political gain and \"turni ng a 'friendly' Iraq into a private American oil pum ping station.\"31 But there is good reason to believe that his obs ervations at least point in the right direction. Maintaining a hold on political pow er and enha ncing US control of the world's primary energy sourc es are major steps toward the twin goa ls that have been declared with cons iderable clarity: to institutiona lize a radical restructuring of dom estic society that will roll back the progre ssive reform s of a century, and to establish an imperial grand strategy of permanent world dom ination. Com pared with such ends , the risks may w ell seem insignificant. The Wild Men in the Wings Establishment critics and the White Hous e tende d to focus on the same issues as the Security Counc il debates and the inspections : the Iraqi threat, WMD, and the subc ategory of terror that enters the canon. None of the debates gave more than a passing nod to \"de mocratization\" or \"liberation\" or any other issues that lie beyond the potential threat to the US and its allies. There was little discussion, for example, of the pos sible effects of war on the popul ation of Iraq, except among \"the wild men in the wings ,\" to borrow the term used by McGeorge Bundy to refer to thos e who felt that more was invol ved in the Vietnam War than military success and its cost to the inva ders. As Washington marched resolutely to war against Iraq, the wild men and women were again looki ng be yond t he narrow que stion of t he costs to themselves. With the Iraqi people at the edge of survi val after a decade of destructive sanctions , internationa l aid and medical agencies warned that a war might lead to a serious hum anitarian catastrophe .

Two hawkish military analysts obs erve that \"econom ic sanctions may well have been a necessary [sic] cause of the deaths of more people in Iraq than have been slain by all so- called weapons of mass destruction throughout history,\" in the hundre ds of thous ands accordi ng to cons ervative estimates.35 No Westerners know Iraq better than Denis Halliday and Hans von Spone ck, the respected UN diplomats who were the chief UN hum anitarian coordi nators, with an internationa l staff of hundre ds of inve stigators traveling daily through the count ry. Bot h resigne d in prot est at what Halliday described as the \"ge noc idal\" character of the US-UK sanctions regime. Bot h reject claims that food and medicine were being withhe ld by the authori ties. Their successor, Tun Myat, backed their view, describing the Iraqi system \"as the best distribution system that he had ever seen in his life, as a World Food Progra m offi cial.\" The senior UN World Food Progra m offi cial report ed that the WFP had conduc ted more than a million inspections of the system and \"unc ove red no significant evidence of fraud or favori tism.\" He adde d that there was \"no way we could create something else that would work half as well\" as the Iraqi system, which is \"the most efficient in the world,\" and that \"the risk of a large-scale hum anitarian crisis\" would increase if anything happe ned to disrupt it.36 As Halliday, von Spone ck, and others had pointed out for years, the sanctions devastated the popul ation while strengthening Sadda m Hussein and his clique , also increasing the depende ncy of the Iraqi people on the tyrant for their survi val. Von Spone ck, who resigne d in 2000, report ed that the US and UK \"systematically tried to prevent [him and Halliday] from briefing the Security Counc il... because they didn't want to hear what we had to say\" about the savagery of the sanctions .37 The US media appa rently agree. Though the expe rt know ledge of the UN coordi nators is without parallel, Americans have had to turn elsewhere to hear what they had to say, even at a moment of laserlike fixation on Iraq. Discussion of the effects of the sanctions has been minimal and a pologe tic, the usual proc edure with re gard t o the crimes of one 's ow n state. Academic researcher Joy Gordon found that even the inform ation that doe s reach the Security Counc il \"is kept from publ ic scrutiny,\" though she learned enough, as have others, to reveal a Noam Chom sky 69 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"shameful record of deliberate cruelty and effort s purs ued \"aggre ssively throughout the last decade to purpos efully minimize the hum anitarian goods that enter the count ry ... in the face of enorm ous hum an suffe ring, including massive increases in child mortality and widespread epidemics.\" The US blocked water tanke rs from reaching Iraq on grounds so spuri ous that they were rejected by the UN arms expe rts, \"this duri ng a time when the major cause of child deaths was lack of access to clean drinking water, and when the count ry was in the midst of a drought .\" Washington insisted that vaccines for infant diseases be withhe ld until it was compelled to back dow n in the face of vigorous prot est by UNICE F and the World Health Organization, support ed by Europe an biological-weapons expe rts, who c harged that the dua l-use claims of t he US were \"flatly impos sible.\"38 The Internationa l Red Cros s, drawing on its own intimate familiarity with the count ry, conc lude d in 1999 that after a decade of sanctions , \"the Iraqi econom y lies in tatters\" and \"the 'oil-for-food' progra mme, introduc ed by UN Resolution 986 in 1995, has not halted the collapse of the health system and the deterioration of water suppl ies, which toge ther pos e one of the gravest threats to the health and well-being of the civilian popul ation.\" Aid agencies \"can only hope to mitigate some of the worst effects of the sanctions [and] cannot nearly cove r the ove rwhelming needs of twenty-two million pe ople,\" the ICRC re port ed.39 Defende rs of the sanctions regime argue d that the appa lling situation was Sadda m's fault, because of his refusal to comply fully with UN resolutions and his cons truction of palaces and monum ents to himself, and so on (funde d by mone y diverted from smuggl ing and other illegal ope rations , accordi ng to the testimony of UN hum anitarian coordi nators and the World Food Progra m). The argum ent, then, was that we had to puni sh Sadda m for his crimes by crushing his victims and strengthening their torturer. By similar logic, if a criminal hijacks a school bus , we shoul d blow it up and murde r the passenge rs, but rescue and reward the hijacker, justifying the actions on grounds that it was his fault.40 \"Studied lack of interest\" in the likely cons eque nces of war for the popul ation of the count ry to be inva ded is conve ntiona l. The same was true when, five days after 9-11, Washington demande d that Pakistan eliminate \"truck convoys that provi de much of the food and other suppl ies to Afgha nistan's civilian popul ation,\" and caused the withdra wal of aid worke rs along with severe reduc tion in food suppl ies, thereby leaving \"millions of Afgha ns ... at grave risk of starvation\"41—ri sk of what shoul d prope rly have been termed \"silent genoc ide.\" Estimates of the num bers \"at grave risk of starvation\" rose from 5 million before 9-11 to 7.5 million a month later. The threat and then reality of bom bing elicited sharp prot ests from aid orga nizations and warnings of what might ensue, which received onl y scattered and ve ry pa rtial attention, a nd l ittle reaction. Perhaps it's worth repeating the obvi ous . One always hope s that worst-case scenarios will not materialize, and every effort shoul d always be dedicated to that end. But exactly as in the case of Khrus hchev's dispatch of missiles to Cuba , which could have led to nuc lear war but didn't, it is the range of likely pos sibilities that determines the evaluation of policy choices that are made, at least for thos e capable of entertaining elementary moral standa rds. Trivially, that judgm ent remains true whatever the outcome, a truism we unde rstand well enough when applied to offi cial enemies but find m uch ha rder to apply to ours elves.

They scarcely made reference to liberation, democratization of the Middle East, and other matters that would rende r irrelevant the inspections and inde ed everything that took place at the Security Counc il or within gove rnm ental dom ains. The reason, perhaps, is that they recogni zed that lofty rhetoric is the obligatory accompaniment of virtually any resort to forc e and therefore carries no inform ation. The rhetoric is doubl y hard to take serious ly in the light of the display of contempt for de mocracy that accompanied it, not to speak of t he past record a nd c urre nt pra ctices. Critics are also aware that nothing has been heard from the present incumbents—w ith their alleged conc ern for Iraqi democracy—t o indicate that they have any regrets for their previous support for Sadda m Hussein (or others like him, still continuing) nor have they show n any signs of contrition for having helped him develop WMD when he really was a serious dange r. Nor has the curre nt leadership explained when, or why, they abandone d their 1991 view that \"the best of all worlds\" would be \"an iron-fi sted Iraqi junta without Sadda m Hussein\" that would rule as Sadda m did but not make the error of j udgm ent in A ugus t 1990 t hat rui ned Sadda m's record.42 At the time, the incumbents' British allies were in the oppos ition and therefore more free than the Thatcherites to speak out against Sadda m's British-ba cked crimes. Their names are noteworthy by their absence from the parliamentary record of prot ests against these crimes, including Tony Blair, Jack Straw, Geoff Hoon, and other leading figure s of New Labour. In December 2002, Jack Straw, then fore ign minister, released a dos sier of Sadda m's crimes. It was drawn almost entirely from the period of firm US-UK support , a fact ove rlooke d with the usual display of moral integrity. The timing and qua lity of the dos sier raised many que stions , but thos e aside, Straw failed to provi de an explanation for his very recent conve rsion to skepticism about Sadda m Hussein's good character and be havior. W hen Straw was hom e secretary i n 2001, a n Ira qi who fl ed to E ngland a fter de tention and torture reque sted asylum. Straw denied his reque st. The Home Office explained that Straw \"is aware that Iraq, and in particular the Iraqi security forc es, would only convi ct and sentence a person in the court s with the provi sion of prope r jurisdiction,\" so that \"you could expe ct to receive a fair trial unde r an inde pende nt and prope rly cons tituted judiciary.\" Straw's conve rsion must, then, have been rather similar to President Clinton's discove ry, sometime between September 8 and 11, 1999, that Indone sia had done some unpl easant things in East Timor in the past twenty-fi ve years when it enjoye d de cisive support from the US and Bri tain.43 Attitude s toward democracy were revealed with unus ual clarity duri ng the mobilization for war in the fall of 2002, as it became necessary to deal somehow with the ove rwhelming popul ar oppos ition. Within the \"coalition of the willing,\" the US publ ic was at least partially controlled by the propa ganda campaign unl eashed in September. In Bri tain, the popul ation w as split roughl y fi fty- fifty on the war, but the gove rnm ent maintained the stance of \"junior partner\" it had accepted reluctantly after World War II and had kept to even in the face of the contemptuous dismissal of British conc erns by U S leaders at moments when the count ry's very s urvi val was at stake. Outside the two full members of the coalition, probl ems were more serious . In the two major Europe an count ries, Germany and France, the offi cial gove rnm ent stands corre sponde d to the views of the large majority of their popul ations , which une quivoc ally oppos ed the war. That led to bitter conde mnation by Washington and many commentators. Dona ld Rum sfeld dismissed the offe nding nations as just the \"Old Europe ,\" of no conc ern because of their reluctance to toe Washington's line. The \"New Europe \" is symbolized by Italy, whos e prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, was visiting the White Hous e. It was, evidently, unprobl ematic that publ ic opinion in Italy was ove rwhelmingly oppos ed to the war.

Recall that the self-appoi nted rulers of the world—Bus h, Powell, and the rest—ha d declared fort hrightly that they intende d to carry out their war whether or not the UN or anyone else \"catches up\" and \"be comes relevant.\" Old Europe , mired in irrelevance, did not catch up. Neither did New Europe , at least if people are part of their count ries. Poll results available from Gallup Internationa l, as well as local sourc es for most of Europe , West and East, show ed that support for a war carried out \"uni laterally by America and its allies\" did not rise above 11 percent in any count ry. Support for a war if manda ted by the UN range d from 13 pe rcent (Spain) t o 51 pe rcent (Netherlands ). Particularly interesting are the eight count ries whos e leaders declared themselves to be the New Europe , to much acclaim for their coura ge and integrity. Their declaration took the form of a statement calling on the Security Counc il to ensure \"ful l compliance with its resolutions ,\" without specifying the means. Their announc ement threatened \"to isolate the Germans and French,\" the press report ed triumpha ntly, though the pos itions of New and Old Europe were in fact scarcely different. To ensure that Germany and France would be \"isolated,\" they were not invited to sign the bold pronounc ement of New Europe —a ppa rently for fear that they would do so, it was later quietly indicated.44 The standa rd interpre tation is that the exciting and prom ising New Europe stood behind Washington, thus demons trating that \"many Europe ans support ed the United States' view, even if France and Germany did not.\"45 Who were these \"many Europe ans\"? Che cking polls, we find that in New Europe , oppos ition to \"the United States' view\" was for the most part even highe r than in France and Germany, particularly in Italy and Spain, which were singled out for praise for their leadership of N ew Europe . Happily for W ashington, form er communist count ries too j oined N ew Europe . W ithin them, support for the \"United States' view,\" as defined by Powell—na mely, war by the \"coalition of the willing\" without UN authori zation—ra nge d from 4 percent (Macedoni a) to 11 percent (Rom ania). Support for a war even with a UN manda te was also very low. Latvia's form er fore ign minister explained that we have to \"salute and shout , 'Yes sir.' ... We have to please America no matter what the cost.\"46 In brief, in journa ls that regard democracy as a significant value, headlines would have read that Old Europe in fact include d the vast majority of Europe ans, East and West, while New Europe cons isted of a few leaders who chos e to line up (ambiguous ly) with Washington, disregarding the ove rwhelming opinion of their own popul ations . But actual report ing was mostly scattered and oblique , de picting oppos ition t o the war as a marketing probl em for W ashington. Toward the liberal end of the spectrum , Richard Holbrooke stressed the \"ve ry import ant point [that] if you add up the popul ation of [the eight count ries of the original New Europe ], it was larger than the popul ation of thos e count ries not signing the letter.\" True enough, though something is omitted: the popul ations were ove rwhelmingly oppos ed to the war, mostly even more so than in thos e count ries dismissed as Old Europe .47 At the other extreme of the spectrum , the editors of the Wall Street Journa l applaude d the statement of the eight original signe rs for \"expos ing as fraudul ent the conve ntiona l wisdom that France and Germany speak for all of Europe , and that all of Europe is now anti-American.\" The eight honora ble New Europe an leaders show ed that \"the views of the Cont inent's pro-A merican majority weren't being heard,\" apart from the editorial pages of the Journa l, now vindicated.

But perhaps they are not really dupl icates of Churc hill and FDR standing up to Hitler; rather of President Bus h, whos e \"moral rectitude \" derives from his \"evange lical zeal,\" as prove n by the fact that his PR agents tell us so.50 There are many other illustrations . When Gerhard Schroe der dared to take the pos ition of the ove rwhelming majority of German voters in the 2002 election, he was bitterly conde mned for his shoc king failure of leadership, one illustration of a serious probl em—\"t he gove rnm ent lives in fear of i ts vot ers\"—t hat Germany m ust ove rcome if it wants to be accepted in the civilized w orld.51 The case of Turke y is particularly revealing. Like others throughout the region, Turks despised Sadda m Hussein but did not fear him. They also strongl y oppos ed the war: about 90 percent in Janua ry 2003, when effort s were peaking to ensure that political leaders, if not their popul ations , would join Washington's enterpri se. The gove rnm ent acted in accord with the will of the people. That show s that the elected gove rnm ent lacks \"de mocratic credentials,\" w e learned on the day the polls were released, in a commentary by form er ambassador to Turke y Morton Abramowitz, now a distingui shed senior statesman and commentator. Ten years ago, he explained, \"most of Turke y, like toda y, was against any invol vement in a war with Iraq.\" But there was \"one notable exception\": President Turgut Ozal, a true democrat who \"ove rrode his count rym en's pronounc ed preference to stay out of the Gulf war.\" Sadly, how ever, the curre nt leadership is now \"fol lowing the people when it comes to participating in another Iraq war,\" rather than succumbing to intense pressures from Washington. \"Re grettably,\" Abramowitz sighe d, \"for the US there is no true democrat around,\" a s there was ten ye ars ago.52 Demons trating still more clearly the lack of democratic credentials of the gove rning party, its unoffi cial leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo-ga n, not only criticized Washington's rush to war but took a Noam Chom sky 73 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"step into truly forbi dde n territory, criticizing \"count ries—the US include d—t hat built up their own weapons of m ass destruction w hile trying t o forc e others to ge t rid of t heirs.\"53 As US pressures mount ed, Turke y's democracy began to improve .

That is why Thursday's parliamentary session was closed to the public and balloting was secret. Headlines were stinging in their criticism of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party on Friday. The front page of the respected daily Radikal said \"the parliament ran away from the people.\" With near una nimity, Turks oppos ed Washington's orde rs, but it was unde rstood that the leadership must obe y, and Turke y joined New Europe .54 Or so it appe ared. In the end, the Turks proc eeded to teach a lesson in democracy to the West. Parliament finally refused to allow US troops to be deploye d ful ly in T urke y. T o form ulate the out come within the conve ntiona l fra mework: The ground war has been hampered because Turke y did not accept its role as hos t of the nort hern front forc es, again for political reasons . Its gove rnm ent was too weak in the face of antiwar feeling.55 The presuppos itions are clear. Strong gove rnm ents disregard their popul ations and \"accept the role\" assigne d to them by the globa l ruler; weak gove rnm ents succumb to the will of 95 percent of their popul ation. The crucial point was expre ssed clearly by Pentagon planne r Paul Wolfow itz. He too berated the Turki sh gove rnm ent for i ts misbehavior, but went on t o conde mn the military, w ho \"di d not play the strong leadership role that we would have expe cted\" but betrayed weakne ss in permitting the gove rnm ent to honor near-una nimous publ ic opinion. Turke y, he argue d, had therefore to step up and say, \"W e made a mistake... . Let's figure out how we can be as helpful as pos sible to the Americans.\" Wolfow itz's stand is particularly instructive because he is presented as the leading visiona ry i n the crusade to de mocratize the Middle East.S6 The pronounc ements about the Old and New Europe , and the hys teria that often accompanied them, provi de some inform ative lessons about prevailing attitude s toward democracy among political and intellectual elites. Dislike of democracy is nothing new. For obvi ous reasons , it is a traditiona l stance of thos e who have a share in pow er and privilege. But it is rarely so starkly illuminated. That may help explain why establishment critics scarcely refer to the democratization rhetoric that accompanies the political leadership's dramatic display of contempt for democracy, evidently widely shared, to judge by c ommentary. Know ledge able commentators have pointed to the \"unc omfort able dua lism\" in Bus h's fore ign policy, with \"Bus h the neo-Re aganite\" making \"ringing calls for a vigorous new democracy campaign in the Middle East,\" while policy imperatives tempt \"W ashington to put aside its democratic scrupl es and seek closer ties with autocracies\"— as in the past, with remarkable cons istency. Reviewing this \"dua lism\" and the continuing support for brut al and repressive regimes, Thom as Carothers expre ssed his hope that Bus h would shift to \"the true spirit of President Rona ld Reagan's fore ign pol icy\" w ith its \"attempts to spread de mocracy.\"57 Noam Chom sky 74 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"These hope s are particularly interesting because of their sourc e. Carothers has done some of the most careful work elucidating the \"true spirit\" of Reaganite dedication to democracy. He combines the standpoi nt of a scholar with that of an insider, having been a participant in the Reagan State Department's Democracy Enha ncement proj ects in Latin America. He regards these progra ms as \"sincere [but a] failure.\" Where Washington's influence was least, in the southern cone of Latin America, there was progre ss toward democracy, which the Reagan administration sought to impede but finally accepted. Where Washington's influence was greatest, success was least. The reason, Carothers explains, is that the Reaganite yearning for democracy was restricted to \"limited, top- dow n form s of democratic change that did not risk ups etting the traditiona l structures of pow er with which the United States has long been allied.\" Washington sought to maintain \"the basic orde r of... quite unde mocratic societies\" and to avoid \"popul ist-based change .\" Carothers recogni zes that there is a liberal critique of the Reaganite approa ch, but he rejects it because of its \"pe rennial weak spot\": it offe rs no alternative. The option of allowing the popul ation a meaningful voice in runni ng their own affairs is not an alternative, not even to be dismissed. Carothers also doe s not discuss the dedicated effort s duri ng t hos e years to unde rmine the threat of m ore meaningful democracy w here it arose.58 The targeted popul ations are well aware of the nature of the democracy that is being brought to them. It has been regularly obs erved that the extension of form al democracy in Latin America has been accompanied by increasing disillusionm ent about democracy. One reason, pointed out some years ago by Argentine political scientist Atilio Boron, is that the new wave of democratization in Latin America has coincided with neoliberal econom ic reform s, which unde rmine effective democracy.59 The pos twar Bre tton Woods system was based on capital controls and relatively fixed curre ncies, not only in the expe ctation of econom ic benefit, as prove d to be the case, but also to allow gove rnm ents space to carry out highly popul ar social democratic policies. It was unde rstood that the kind of financial liberalization that ope ned the neoliberal era in the 1970s reduc es the options for democratic choice, transferring decisions to the hands of a \"virtual Senate\" of inve stors and lende rs.60 Gove rnm ents now face a \" 'dua l cons tituency conundrum ,' which pits the interests of voters against fore ign curre ncy traders and hedge fund managers 'who conduc t a moment-to-m oment referendum ' on the econom ic and financial policies of developing and develope d na tions alike,\" a nd t he competition i s highly une qua l. John Mayna rd Keyne s warned seventy years ago \"that nothing less than the democratic expe riment in self-gove rnm ent was enda nge red by the threat of globa l financial market forc es.\" The secretary- general of the Organization of American States, a strong advoc ate of neoliberal globa lization, ope ned the annua l session by warning that free move ment of capital, \"the most unde sirable feature of globa lisation\"—i n fact, its core feature—is the \"gre atest obs tacle\" to democratic gove rnance, just as Keyne s had warned.61 The fears go back to Adam Smith. His sole use of the phra se \"invisible hand\" in Wealth of Nations is in a discussion of the harmful cons eque nces of fore ign inve stment, which England need not fear, he believed, because an \"invisible hand\" will induc e inve stors to keep their capital at hom e. The same is true of other parts of the neoliberal package: privatization, for example, reduc es the arena of potential democratic choice, dramatically in the case of liberalization of \"services,\" which has evoke d enorm ous popul ar oppos ition. Even in narrow econom ic terms, the privatization progra ms were impos ed w ith little if any s olid empirical evidence or t heoretical groundi ng.62 Disillusionm ent with form al democracy has been evident in the US as well, increasing through the neoliberal period. There was much clamor about the \"stolen election\" of Nove mber 2000, and surpri se that the publ ic did not seem to care very much. Likely reasons are sugge sted by publ ic opinion studies, which reveal that on the eve of the election, three-qua rters of the popul ation Noam Chom sky 75 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"regarded it as a game played by large contributors, party leaders, and the PR indus try, which crafted candidates to say \"almost anything to get themselves elected.\" On almost all issues, citizens could not identify the stands of the candidates—a s intende d. Issues on which the publ ic differs from elite opinion are generally off the agenda . Voters were directed to \"pe rsona l qua lities,\" not \"issues.\" Among voters, heavily skewed toward the wealthy, thos e who recogni ze their class interests to be at stake tend to vote to prot ect thos e interests: for the more reactiona ry of the two bus iness parties. But the general publ ic splits its vote in other ways, sometimes, as in 2000, leading to a statistical tie. Among worki ng people, none conom ic issues such as gun ownership and \"religiosity\" were leading factors, so that people often voted against their own primary interests—a ppa rently assuming that they had little choice. In 2000, feelings of \"pow erlessness\" reached the highe st level recorde d, ove r 50 pe rcent.63 What remains of democracy is largely the right to choos e among commodities. Bus iness leaders have long explained the need to impos e on the popul ation a \"phi losophy of futility\" and \"lack of purpos e in life,\" to \"conc entrate hum an attention on the more supe rficial things that comprise much of fashiona ble cons umption.\"64 Deluge d by such propa ganda from infancy, people may then accept their meaningless and subordi nate lives and forge t ridiculous ideas about managing their own affairs. They may abandon their fate to corpora te managers and the PR indus try and, in the political realm, to the self-de scribed \"i ntelligent minori ties\" w ho s erve and a dminister pow er. From this perspective, conve ntiona l in elite opinion, the Nove mber 2000 elections did not reveal a flaw of US democracy, but rather its triumph. And generalizing, it is fair to hail the triumph of democracy throughout the hemisphe re, and elsewhere, even though the popul ations do not see it that way. Liberation from Tyr anny: Constructive Solutions The implausibility of the belief that Washington is sudde nly conc erned with democracy and hum an rights in Iraq, or elsewhere, shoul d not prevent the \"wild men in the wings \" from persisting in their commitment to these ends and, t o the extent pos sible, exerting i nfluence in that direction. In the case of Iraq, there was always good reason to take serious ly the conc lusions of the most know ledge able obs ervers that a \"cons tructive solution\" to regime change in Iraq \"would be to lift the econom ic sanctions that have impove rished society, decimated the Iraqi middle class and eliminated any pos sibility for the emergence of alternative leadership,\" while \"twelve years of sanctions have only strengthened the curre nt regime\" (Hans von Spone ck). Furthermore, the sanctions compelled the popul ation to depend for survi val on the reigning tyranny, reduc ing even more the likelihood of a cons tructive solution. \"W e have sustained [the regime and] denied the opport unities for change ,\" Denis Halliday adde d: \"I believe if the Iraqis had their econom y, had their lives back, and had their way of life restored, they would take care of the form of gove rnance that they w ant, that they be lieve is suitable to their count ry.\"65 Were these illusions ? The historical record hardly sugge sts so. Again, cons ider the fate of the miserable tyrants support ed by the curre nt incumbents until the very end of their bloody rule, all ove rthrow n by internal revolt. The case of Ceau§e scu, only one of many, is particularly instructive because of t he nature of t he internal tyrannies. As priorities shifted in 2002, it was claimed that thos e who shared respons ibility for twenty years of torture of Iraqis were entitled to resort to violence to bring about democracy.

Since such solutions were not even permitted in the case of Iraq, it can hardly be maintained that the stage of last resort had been reached.

To paraphra se Lisa Marlowe, if this is to be the mode l for the hegemonic supe rpow er, he aven he lp us all. Since the Reagan-Bus h I years (in fact before ), Washington had support ed Sadda m Hussein in varying ways. After he steppe d out of line in Augus t 1990, policies and pretexts varied, but one element remained cons tant: the people of Iraq must not control their count ry. To repeat, the tyrant was permitted to suppre ss the 1991 upri sing because, we were inform ed, Washington sought a military junta that would rule the count ry with an \"iron fist,\" and if no alternative is available, Sadda m would have to do. The rebels failed because \"ve ry few people outside Iraq wanted them to win\"—m eaning Washington and its local allies, who held the \"strikingly una nimous view\" that \"whatever the sins of the Iraqi leader, he offe red the West and the region a better hope for his count ry's stability than did thos e who have suffe red his repression.\" It was impressive to see how uniform ly all of this was suppre ssed in the shoc ked commentary and report ing on the expos ure of the mass graves of the victims of Sadda m's US-authori zed paroxys m of terror, offe red as justification for the recent war on \"moral grounds \" now that we have seen \"the mass graves and the true extent of Sadda m's genoc idal evil,\" all know n at onc e in 1991 but ignore d because of the imperative of \"s tability.\"66 The upri sing would have left the count ry in the hands of Iraqis who might have been inde pende nt of Washington. The sanctions of the following years unde rcut the pos sibility of the kind of popul ar revolt that had ove rthrow n other mons ters who were also strongl y support ed by the curre nt incumbents. The US sought to instigate coups by groups it controlled, but a popul ar rebellion would not have left the US in charge. At the Azores summit in March 2003, Bus h reiterated that stand, declaring t hat the US would inva de even if Sadda m and hi s cohort s were to leave the count ry. The que stion of who shoul d rule Iraq remains a prime issue of contention. Leading figure s of the US-backed oppos ition demande d at onc e that the UN play a vital role in pos twar Iraq and rejected US control of recons truction or of the pos t-Sadda m gove rnm ent. They strongl y oppos ed \"US hegemony ove r Iraq.\" Even Washington's chos en figure s vigorous ly prot ested the plans to sideline them in favor of a US occupa tion. There were also indications that the Shi'ite majority might support an Islamic Republ ic if given a voice, hardly to the taste of Washington and its plans for the region. There seems little reason to doubt that US policymakers will attempt to follow the cons istent practice elsewhere: form al democracy is fine, but only if it obe ys orde rs, like New Europe , or the \"limited top-dow n\" democracies in Latin America run by \"the traditiona l structures of pow er with which the United States has long been allied\" (Ca rothers). Bre nt Scowcroft , nationa l security adviser for Bus h I, spoke for the mode rates when he obs erved that if there is an election in Iraq and \"the radicals win... . We're surely not going to let them take ove r.\"67 Thus if the Shi'ite majority has a significant voice in pos t-Sadda m Iraq and joins others in the region in trying to improve relations with Iran, they will be \"radicals\" and treated accordi ngly.

Elsewhere, Washington has been happy to transfer respons ibility and costs to others, but in Iraq, it has insisted on runni ng the show itself. There is no incons istency. \"Ira q is not East Timor, Kosovo a nd A fgha nistan,\" Condol eezza Rice rightly stressed.69 She did not spell out the distinction. Perhaps it is too transparent: Iraq is a major prize; the others are cons idered basket cases. Therefore Washington must be in charge, not the UN, not the Ira qi people. Putting aside the crucial que stion of who will be in charge, thos e conc erned with the tragedy of Iraq had three basic goa ls: (1) ove rthrow ing the tyranny, (2) ending the sanctions that were targeting the people, not the rulers, and (3) preserving some semblance of world orde r. There can be no disagreement among decent people on the first two goa ls: achieving them is an occasion for rejoicing, pa rticularly for t hos e who prot ested U S support for S adda m before his inva sion of K uwait and again immediately afterward, and oppos ed the sanctions regime that followed; they can therefore applaud the outcome without hypoc risy.

Im perial controls, especially the Bri tish, w ere to be dismantled while Washington extende d its own regiona l systems in Latin America and the Pacific on the principle, explained by Abe Fortas, that \"what was good for us was good for the world.\" This altruistic conc ern was not appre ciated by the British Foreign Office. Officials recogni zed that Washington, guided by \"the econom ic imperialism of American bus iness interests, [is] attempting to elbow us out,\" but could do little about it. The minister of state at the Foreign Office commented to his cabinet colleague s that Americans believe \"that the United States stands for something in the world—s omething of which the world has need, something which the world is going to like, something, in the final analysis, which the world is going to take, whether it likes it or not.\"8 He was articulating the real-world version of Wilsonian idealism, the version that conform s to the historical record. US planning at the time was sophi sticated and thorough. The highe st priority was to recons truct the indus trial world along lines that would satisfy the requirements of the bus iness interests that dom inate policy form ation: in particular, to absorb US manufa cturing surpl uses, ove rcome the \"dol lar gap,\" and offe r opport unities for inve stment. The outcomes were appre ciated by the dom estic beneficiaries. Reagan's Com merce Department obs erved that the Marshall Plan \"set the stage for large amount s of private U.S. direct inve stment in Europe ,\" laying the groundw ork for multinationa l corpora tions (MNCs). Bus iness Week described MNCs in 1975 as \"the econom ic expre ssion\" of the \"pol itical framework\" established by pos twar policymakers in which \"American bus iness pros pered and expa nde d on ove rseas orde rs ... fueled initially by the dollars of the Marshall Plan\" and prot ected from \"ne gative developm ents\" by \"the umbrella of American pow er.\"9 Other parts of the world were assigne d their \"func tions \" by State Department planne rs. Thus Southeast Asia was to provi de resourc es and raw materials to the form er imperial masters, crucially Britain but also Japan, which was to be granted \"some sort of empire toward the south,\" in the phra se of George Kenna n, head of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff.10 Some areas were of little interest to the planne rs, notably Africa, which Kenna n advised shoul d be hande d ove r to Europe ans to \"exploit\" for their recons truction. A different pos twar Europe -Africa relations hip comes to m ind i n the light of hi story but doe s not seem to ha ve been cons idered. The Middle East, in contrast, was to be taken ove r by the United States. In 1945, State Department offi cials described Saudi Arabian energy resourc es as \"a stupe ndous sourc e of strategic pow er, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history\"; the Gulf region generally was cons idered \"proba bly the richest econom ic prize in the field of fore ign inve stment.\" Eisenhow er later described it as the \"most strategically import ant area of the world.\" Britain agreed. Its planne rs described the resourc es of the region in 1947 as \"a vital prize for any pow er interested in world influence or dom ination.\"11 France was expe lled from the Middle East by legalistic maneuve rs, and Britain declined ove r time to junior pa rtner.

The issue has been the sourc e of continue d confl ict since, with regard to Europe as well, as both Europe and J apan ha ve sought a degree of e nergy i nde pende nce. Meanwhile Asia was changing. A prestigious task forc e, report ing in 2003, described Northeast Asia as \"the epicenter of internationa l commerce and technol ogical innova tion... . the fastest- grow ing econom ic region in the world for much of the past two decades,\" by now account ing \"for nearly 30 percent of globa l GDP, far ahead of the United States,\" and also holding about half of globa l fore ign exchange reserves. These econom ies also \"account for nearly half of globa l inbound fore ign direct inve stment\" and are becoming an increasing sourc e of outbound FDI, flowing within East Asia and to Europe and North America, which now trade more with Northeast Asia than with each ot her.12 The region is, furt hermore, an integrated one . Eastern Rus sia is rich in natural resourc es, for which the indus trial centers of Northeast Asia are the natural market. Integration would be enha nced by econom ic unification of the two Koreas with gas pipelines passing through North Korea and extension of t he trans-Siberian ra ilroad on t he same cours e. North Korea was the most dange rous and ugly member of the \"axis of evil,\" but lowest on the target list. Like Iran, but unlike Iraq, it failed the first of the criteria for a legitimate target: it was not defenseless. Presumably, the Pentagon is worki ng on ways to knoc k out the North Korean deterrent, massed artillery aimed at Seoul and US forc es, which are being withdra wn out of artillery range , arous ing conc erns in Korea about US intentions . Cons idered in isolation, North Korea also fails the second criterion for a target; it is one of the poore st and most miserable count ries in the world. But as part of the Northeast Asia complex, it gains import ance for the reasons indicated by the task forc e. Hence it is not an unlikely target of attack, if the technical probl em of count ering its deterrent can be ove rcome. The task forc e recommends that Washington seek a diplomatic solution to the curre nt crisis. It shoul d continue the proc ess, begun haltingly and une venly unde r Clinton, aimed at \"norm alizing United States econom ic and pol itical relations with N orth K orea, gua ranteeing t he security of a non- nuc lear North Korea, prom oting the reconc iliation of North and South Korea, and drawing North Korea into econom ic enga gement with its neighbors .\" Such interactions could accelerate econom ic reform s already unde r way in North Korea, leading in time \"to a diffus ion of econom ic pow er that would loos en totalitarian political controls and mode rate hum an rights abus es.\" These policies would conform to the regiona l cons ensus, including the North Korean dictatorship, it appe ars.

The threat of potential inde pende nce may prove an impediment to diplomatic settlement. For partially related reasons , Chi na is regarded as a prime potential enemy by Washington hawks, and much military planning is geared to that continge ncy. Recent effort s to strengthen Indi a-US strategic relations are partly motivated by the same conc erns, along with Washington's conc erns about its control ove r the world's largest energy re serves in the Middle East. Washington's approa ch to North Korea resembles its stance on Iran and pre-inva sion Iraq. In all three cases, neighbori ng count ries had been purs uing effort s to ove rcome hos tility and move toward integration, also attempting to lend support to reform ist tende ncies, or at least help lay the basis for them, and thos e effort s continue ! with regard to Iran and North Korea. The US somewhat hesitantl followed a similar approa ch toward North Korea duri ng the Clinton years, with partial success, but apart from that, Washington has preferred confront ation. While the reasons for that preference are not identical in the three cases, there are common threads, which become clearer in the context of the gra nd s trategy. In the early pos twar years, US planne rs sought to fashion East and Southeast Asia into a Japan- centered system within the \"ove rall framework of orde r\" maintained by the US. The basic framework was outlined in the San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT) of 1951, which form ally ende d the war in Asia.14 Apart from the three French colonies in Indoc hina, the only Asian count ries that accepted the SFPT were Pakistan and Ce ylon, bot h re cently fre ed from Bri tish rul e and re mote from the Asian war. Indi a refused to attend the San Francisco confe rence because of the terms of the treaty, among them the US insistence on retaining Okinawa as a military base, as it still doe s, ove r strong prot ests from Okinawans, whos e voi ces barely re gister in the US. Trum an was outraged by Indi a's disobe dience. His reaction, no less elegant than the curre nt reaction to the disobe dience of Old Europe and Turke y, was that Indi a must have \"cons ulted Uncle Joe and Mous ie Dung of Chi na.\" The white man got a name, not just a vulgar epithet. Partly that may be ordi nary racism, or perhaps it is because Trum an genuinely liked and admired \"Old Joe,\" who reminde d him of the Missouri bos s who had launc hed his political career. In the late 1940s , Trum an found Old Joe to be a \"de cent fellow,\" though \"a prisone r of the Politburo\" who \"can't do what he wants to.\" M ous ie Dung, how ever, w as a yellow devil. These distinctions extende d wartime propa ganda . Nazis were evil but merited a certain respect: in the stereotype , at least, they were blond, blue-eyed, orde rly, far more appe aling than the Frogs , whom Trum an particularly disliked, not to speak of the Wops . And they were a wholly different species from the Japs, who were vermin to be crushed, at least onc e they became enemies; before that, the US was ambivalent about Japanese depredations in Asia, as long as US bus iness interests were prot ected. The primary victims of Japanese fascism and its predecessors— Chi na and the Japanese colonies of Korea and Form osa (Taiwan)— did not attend the San Francisco Peace Confe rence and were accorde d no serious conc ern. Koreans and Chi nese received no reparations from Japan; nor did the Philippines, which also did not attend the confe rence. Secretary of State Dulles conde mned Filipinos for the \"emotiona l prejudices\" that kept them from grasping why they would have no relief for the torture they had endure d. Initially, Japan was to pay reparations , but only to the US and other colonial pow ers, despite the fact that the war was a Japanese war of aggre ssion in Asia through the 1930s and only became a US-led Western war with Japan after Pearl Harbor. Japan was also to reimburs e the US for the costs of the occupa tion. For its Asian victims, Japan was to pay \"compensation\" in the form of export of Japanese manufa cturing produc ts using Southeast Asian resourc es, a central part of the arrange ments that, in effect, recons tructed something like the \"New Noam Chom sky 83 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Order in Asia\" that Japan had attempted to cons truct by conque st, but was now gaining unde r US dom ination, s o that it was unprobl ematic. Some Asian victims of Japanese fascism—forc ed labore rs and prisone rs of war—brought suit against Japanese corpora tions with subs idiaries in the US, the legal successors of thos e respons ible for the crimes. On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the SFPT, their suit was dismissed by a Californi a judge , on grounds that their claims were barred by the terms of the SFPT. Relying on an amicus brief filed by the State Department in support of the accused Japanese corpora tions , the court ruled that the SFPT had \"served to sustain U.S. security interests in Asia and to support peace and stability in the region.\" Asia historian John Price described this judgm ent as \"one of the more abys mal moments of denial,\" pointing out that at least ten million people had been killed in wars in the region w hile Asia was enjoying \"pe ace and s tability.\" In May 2003, John Ashcroft 's Justice Department upda ted the stand of Clinton's State Department, subm itting an amicus brief in support of the energy giant UNOCA L that would \"rol l back twenty years of judicial rulings for victims of hum an rights abus e,\" Human Rights Watch warned.

The tripolar orde r that was taking shape from the early 1970s has since become more firm, and with it, the conc ern of US planne rs that not only Europe but also Asia might seek a more inde pende nt cours e. >From a longe r historical perspective, that would not be too surpri sing. In the eighteenth century, Chi na and Indi a were major commercial and indus trial centers. East Asia was far ahead of Europe in publ ic health and proba bly sophi stication of market systems. Life expe ctancy in Japan may have been highe r than in Europe . England was trying to catch up in textiles and other manufa ctures, borrow ing from Indi a in ways that are now called piracy and are banne d in the internationa l trade agreements impos ed by the rich states unde r a cynical pretense of \"fre e trade\"; the US relied heavily on the same mechanisms, as have other states that have develope d. As late as the mid-ni neteenth century, British obs ervers claimed that Indi an iron was as good as or better than British iron, and much cheaper. Col onization and forc ed liberalization conve rted Indi a to a British depende ncy. It only resumed its grow th and ende d murde rous famines after inde pende nce. Chi na was not subjuga ted until the second British opium war 150 years ago, and also only resumed developm ent after inde pende nce. Japan was the only part of Asia to resist colonization successfully, and the only one to develop, along with its colonies. It is not, then, a great surpri se that Asia is returni ng t o a pos ition of c ons iderable wealth and pow er after re gaining s ove reignty. These long-t erm historical proc esses, how ever, extend the probl ems of sustaining the \"ove rall framework of orde r\" in which others must respect their prope r place.

That conve ntion is not obs erved within the uns table belt itself, or even within the US Strategic Com mand (STRA TCO M), which is respons ible for the nuc lear arsenal. General Lee But ler, commande r in chief of STRA TCO M in 1992-94, obs erved that \"it is dange rous in the extreme that in the cauldron of animosities that we call the Middle East, one nation has armed itself, ostensibly, with stockpiles of nuc lear weapons , perhaps num bering in the hundre ds, and that inspires other nations to do so.\" Israel's WMD are of conc ern to the world's second l eading nuc lear pow er as well.2 Similar conc erns were expre ssed, more oblique ly, in Security Counc il Resolution 687, which was selectively invoke d by the Bus h and Blair administrations in their effort s to provi de a qua si-legal basis for their inva sion of Iraq. Neither that nor any other resolution grants such authori zation, but 687 did call for elimination of Iraqi WMD and delivery systems—a s a step toward \"the goa l of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery\" (Article 14). US intelligence and other sourc es assume that Israel has several hundre d nuc lear weapons and ha s been de veloping c hemical and bi ological weapons . Article 14 is commonly ignore d in US commentary, but not elsewhere. Iraq, for example, called on the Security Counc il to apply Article 14. Its motives do not obvi ate the import ance of the issue. General But ler's conc erns are not trivial. Undoubt edly, Israeli military pow er will continue to \"inspire other nations \" to develop WMD, including quite pos sibly even Iraq, if it is granted a modicum of i nde pende nce. The issue addre ssed by Article 14 had arisen before , on the eve of the first Gulf war. After inva ding Kuwait in Augus t 1990, Iraq made a num ber of propos als for withdra wal within the context of a broa der regiona l settlement. These were leaked to the press by US gove rnm ent offi cials who found them \"serious \" and \"ne gotiable.\" How serious they were we cannot judge : the US \"immediately dismissed\" them, accordi ng to the only journa list in the count ry who report ed the matter carefully, Knut Royc e of Newsday. It is of some interest that in the final polls before the bom bing, two thirds of the American publ ic favore d a confe rence on the Israel-Arab confl ict if it would lead to Iraqi withdra wal.3 Doubt less thos e figure s would have been highe r if the publ ic had know n that Iraq had just made a similar propos al, dismissed by Washington. A devastating war and even more destructive aftermath might have been prevented, hundre ds of thous ands of lives saved, and perhaps a basis laid for the ove rthrow of Sadda m's tyranny. It is pos sible that steps might have been taken toward elimination of WMD and delivery systems in the region and beyond, perhaps even extending to the great pow ers, for thirty years in violation of their commitment unde r the Nuclear Nonprol iferation Treaty to take good-fa ith steps toward eliminating nuc lear weapons , matters of no slight significance.

The core of the econom y is a military-l inke d high-t ech indus trial system, with close ties to the US econom y. Not surpri singly, Israel is coming to resemble its patron in other ways as well. A parliamentary (Knesset) inve stigation found that \"Israel is now rated second in the Western world, after the United States, in terms of social gaps in income, prope rty, capital, educ ation and spending, as well as in the extent of pove rty.\" Its form erly quite successful social welfare system has erode d, and s ocial-cultural values have change d significantly as well.4 Like its patron, Israel has military forc es that are off the spectrum of societies comparable in other dimensions .

Israel also has a close military alliance with the other major regiona l military pow er, Turke y. The US-Turke y-Is rael alliance is sometimes called \"the axis of evil,\" in the Middle East.6 The term is unde rstanda ble. There is always plenty of evil to go around, and this axis at least has the merit of existing, unl ike the one conc octed by G eorge Bus h's speechwriters, which cons ists of t wo states that had been at war for twenty years and a third that was presumably throw n in because it is non- Muslim and uni versally re viled.

US-Israel Relations: Origins and Maturation It doe s not take much insight into world affairs to predict that the cauldron of animosities in the Middle East will continue to boil. Internal confl icts have been exacerbated as the indus trial world shifted toward an oil-based econom y from World War I, and the incomparable petroleum resourc es of the Middle East were discove red. After World War II, a high priority of US policy was to ensure its control ove r a region of s uch gre at material wealth and s trategic significance. In its day in the sun, Britain had controlled the region by delegating authori ty to clients, with British forc e in the background. In the terminology of the Foreign Office, local management was to be left to an \"Arab facade\" of weak compliant rulers, while Britain's \"absorpt ion\" of these virtual colonies would be \"ve iled by cons titutiona l fictions ,\" a device cons idered more cost-effective than direct rule. W ith va riations , the device is familiar elsewhere. The popul ation di d not passively subm it. Fortuna tely for i mperial planne rs, air pow er was becoming available to control civilian popul ations , though some, like Winston Churc hill, were enamored of the pos sibilities of using poison gas to subdue \"recalcitrant Arabs\" (mainly Kurds and Afgha ns). In the interwar years, there were attempts to ban or limit war, but Britain made sure these would not interfere with imperial rule, setting a precedent for its successor in world control. Specifically, Britain unde rmined attempts to restrict the use of air pow er against civilians. The reasons were expre ssed succinctly by the distingui shed statesman Lloyd George , who praised the British gove rnm ent for \"re serving t he right to bom b ni gge rs.\"9 Funda mental moral pri nciples tend t o ha ve a long l ife. This one is no e xception. The US took ove r the British framework but adde d another layer of control: periphe ral states, preferably non-A rab, that could serve as \"local cops on the beat,\" in the terminology of the Nixon administration. Police headqua rters would of cours e remain in Washington, with a branch offi ce in London. Turke y was a leading member of the club from the outset, joined by Iran in 1953, when a US-UK military coup restored the shah, ove rthrow ing a cons ervative parliamentary gove rnm ent that was seeking to control its own resourc es. The US has been conc erned more with control than access. After World War II, North America was the world's major oil produc er, though this pos ition was not expe cted to last long. Later, a major export er to the US was Venezuela. Curre nt proj ections of US intelligence are that the US will continue to rely primarily on Atlantic Basin resourc es— thos e in the Western Hemisphe re and West Africa—w hich are more stable and reliable than thos e of the Middle East.10 But as throughout the pos twar period, that doe s not remove the perceived need to re tain control. Cont rol ove r the great material prize of the Gulf ensures that US-UK energy corpora tions will be the main beneficiaries of enorm ous profi ts. The wealth recycles to the US and British econom ies in many other ways as well, including military hardw are (hence high-t ech indus try generally), cons truction proj ects, and treasury securities. The recogni zed \"stupe ndous strategic pow er\" of the region translates into a lever of world dom ination. All of this was unde rstood clearly by thos e who planne d the pos twar world, and retains its forc e.

They sugge sted that Israel might offe r the US means \"to gain strategic adva ntage in the Middle East\" to offs et Britain's declining role. Ten years later, these cons iderations gained some conc rete significance. The year 1958 was highly significant in world affairs. The Eisenhow er administration identified three major crises: Indone sia, North Africa, and the Middle East. All invol ved oil produc ers and Islamic pol itical forc es, which w ere then secular. Eisenhow er and Secretary of State Dulles stressed that there was no Rus sian invol vement in any of these crises. The probl em was the familiar devil: \"radical nationa lism.\" In North Africa, the conc ern was the Algerian struggl e for inde pende nce, which the US wanted quickly settled. In Indone sia, the culprit was Suka rno, w ho w as one of t he leaders of t he despised nona ligne d m ove ment and w as also allowing too much democracy: a popul ar-ba sed party of poor peasants was gaining influence. In the Middle East, the villain was Nasser, described as a \"ne w Hitler\" by panicked US and British leaders. He too was a pillar of the nona ligne d move ment, and his influence, it was feared, might tempt others to purs ue an inde pende nt cours e. Thos e fears appe ared to be realized in 1958 when a coup in Iraq, assumed to be Nasserite in origin, ove rthrew the British-ba cked gove rnm ent. Cons eque nces reverberate to the pre sent. The Iraqi coup led to intense US-UK discussions . Policymakers were conc erned that Kuwait might seek inde pende nce and that even Saudi Arabia might succumb to the disease.

By 2000, Efraim Inba r writes, Israel's relations to Turke y were \"second only to the closeness of Is rael-US ties.\"18 In 1967 the US-Israeli alliance was firmly in place. Israel destroye d Nasser, thus prot ecting the \"facade\" in the Arabian peninsula and also striking a pow erful blow against the nona ligne d move ment. That was cons idered a major contribution to US pow er. There was also a significant effect within the US ideological dom ain, a n import ant topic that I w ill have to put aside.19 Recall the three major crises of 1958. The threat of inde pende nt Arab nationa lism in the Middle East was ove rcome by t he 1967 w ar. T he North A frican crisis ende d w ith A lgerian inde pende nce.20 The crisis in Indone sia was resolved by a huge massacre, mainly of landless peasants, which the CIA described as one of the great mass murde rs of the twentieth century, comparable to thos e of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. This \"stagge ring mass slaught er,\" as the New York Times called it, was greeted with unre strained euphori a in the West. It eliminated the mass-based political party of the poor and ope ned the doors wide to Western inve stors. As in the Middle East, another pillar of the nona ligne d move ment was demolished. Somewhat similar proc esses were unde r way in Latin America and, to a more limited extent, in Indi a, the last major stronghol d of nona lignm ent. Throughout , the US role was significant, sometimes crucially so. The US is a globa l pow er, like England before it. It is often misleading to focus on one region of the world, forge tting that globa l planning i s in W ashington. Keeping nevertheless to the Middle East, in 1970 Israel perform ed another service by deterring pos sible Syrian intervention to prot ect Palestinians who were being massacred in Jorda n. US aid to Israel qua drupl ed. US intelligence, along with such influential figure s conc erned with the Middle East as Senator Henry Jackson, described the tacit alliance of Israel-Ira n-S audi Arabia as a solid basis for U S pow er in the region, w ith T urke y taken for gra nted. In 1979 the shah fell and the Israel-Turke y alliance became even more import ant as a regiona l base. The alliance welcomed a new member, replacing the shah: Sadda m Hussein's Iraq, which the Reagan administration remove d from the offi cial list of terrori st states in 1982 so that the US could freely provi de the tyrant with aid. Israel's choices ove r the past thirty years have reduc ed its options cons iderably; on its present cours e, it has virtually no alternative to serving as a US base in the region and complying with US demands . The options were starkly illuminated in 1971, when President Anwar Sadat of Egypt offe red Israel a full peace treaty in return for Israeli withdra wal from Egypt ian territory. Sadat offe red nothing to the Palestinians and omitted reference to the other occupied territories. In his memoirs, Yitzhak Rabin, then ambassador to the US, refers to the \"famous \" offe r as a \"milestone \" on the path to peace, though it contained \"ba d news\" as well: the condi tion that Israel withdra w from Egypt ian territory, in accord with offi cial US policy and the basic diplomatic doc ument, Security Counc il Re solution 242 of N ove mber 1967.

It chos e the latter cours e, not on grounds of Noam Chom sky 89 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"security but because of a commitment to expa nsion. That is clear in Israeli sourc es. General Haim Bar-Lev, a leading figure in the gove rning Labor Party, expre ssed the common unde rstanding when he wrote in a Labor Party journa l that \"we can have peace, but I think if we continue to hold out we can obtain more.\" The \"more\" that was of primary interest at the time was the nort heastern Sinai, from which the inha bitants were brut ally expe lled into the desert to make way for the establishment of the all-Jewish city of Yamit. In 1972, General Ezer Weizman, later president, adde d that a political settlement without expa nsion would mean that Israel could not \"exist accordi ng to the scale, spirit, and qua lity she now embodi es.\" The crucial que stion was how Washington would react. After internal debate, the gove rnm ent abandone d its offi cial policy in favor of Kissinge r's principle of \"stalemate\": no diplomacy, only forc e. It shoul d be recalled that this was a period of extreme triumpha lism, later greatly regretted in Israel. The US and Israel took it for granted after 1967 that Arabs could pos e no military threat. The Egypt ian peace offe r is not \"famous \" in the US: rather, unknow n, a common fate of events that do not conform to doc trinal requirements. Sadat still hope d to gain US acquiescence, by expe lling his Rus sian advisers and other move s. He also warned that \"Yamit means war.\" He was not taken serious ly. In 1973 he did launc h a war, which was a near disaster for Israel and also led to a nuc lear alert in the US. At that point, Kissinge r realized that Egypt could not simply be dismissed, and launc hed his \"shuttle diplomacy,\" which led finally to the Camp David settlement of 1978-79. At Camp David the US and Israel accepted Sadat's 1971 offe r, but on t erms much less favora ble from their poi nt of vi ew: by t hen the fate of t he Palestinians had become an issue, and Sadat joined most of the rest of the world in insisting on their rights. These events are hailed as a US diplomatic triumph. Jimmy Carter won the Nobe l Peace Prize primarily for the culminating achievement. The entire proc ess was, in reality, a diplomatic catastrophe . The US-Israel rejection of diplomacy led to a terrible war, great suffe ring, and a supe rpow er confront ation that could have gotten out of hand. But one of the preroga tives of pow er is the ability to write history with confi dence that there will be little challenge . The disaster therefore enters history a s a gra nd t riumph of t he US-run \"pe ace proc ess.\" Israel recogni zed at onc e that with the Arab deterrent remove d, it could intensify its expa nsion into the occupied territories and attack its nort hern neighbor, as it proc eeded to do in 1978 and 1982, continuing to occupy parts of Lebanon for almost twenty years. The 1982 inva sion and its immediate aftermath left some 20,000 dead; accordi ng to Lebanese sourc es, the toll in the following years was about 25,000. The topic is of little conc ern in the West, on the principle that crimes for which w e are respons ible require no i nqui ry, l et alone puni shment or re parations . After many bom bings and other provoc ations failed to elicit a pretext for the planne d 1982 inva sion, Israel finally seized upon the attempted assassination of its ambassador in London by the terrori st group headed by Abu Nidal, who had been conde mned to death by the PLO and had been at war with it for years. Resort to this pretext was acceptable to articulate American opinion, which also had no probl em with Israel's immediate respons e: an attack on the Sabra-Shatila Palestinian refuge e camps in Beirut, where 200 people were killed, accordi ng to a reliable American obs erver.21 UN attempts to halt the aggre ssion were blocked by immediate US vetoes. So matters continue d through eighteen bloody years of Israeli atrocities in Lebanon, rarely with even a thin pretext of s elf-de fense.22 Chi ef of Staff Rafael (\"Ra ful\") Eitan echoe d the common unde rstanding in Israel when he at onc e declared the 1982 i nva sion t o be a success because it weakened the \"pol itical status\" of t he PLO and set back its struggl e for a Palestinian state.

New York Times corre sponde nt James Ben-ne t writes that the goa l of the 1982 inva sion \"was to install a friendly regime and destroy Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organization. That, the theory went, would help persuade Palestinians to accept Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\"24 To my know ledge , this is the first report in the American mainstream of what was well know n in Israel and has been publ ished in marginalized dissident circles in the US for twenty years. It is also a textbook illustration of massive internationa l terrori sm, if not the more severe crime of aggre ssion, tracing right back to Washington, which provi ded the requisite econom ic, military, and diplomatic support . Without such authori zation and aid, Israel can do very little. There are many illusions about this in the Arab count ries and elsewhere. Particularly for t he victims, it is not wise to live with illusions . On the diplomatic front , by the mid-1970s US-Israeli isolation increased as the Palestinian issue entered the internationa l agenda . In 1976 the US vetoed a resolution calling for a Palestinian state alongs ide Israel, incorpora ting the basic wordi ng of UN Resolution 242 from 1967. From then to the present the US has blocked the pos sibility of a diplomatic settlement in the terms accepted by virtually the entire world: a two-state settlement on t he internationa l borde r, w ith \"m inor a nd m utual adjustments\"; that was the principle of offi cial, though not actual, US policy until the Clinton administration form ally abandone d the framework of internationa l diplomacy, declaring UN resolutions \"obs olete and anachroni stic.\" It is noteworthy that the US stand is also oppos ed by most of the US popul ation: a large majority support the \"Saudi Plan,\" propos ed in early 2002 and accepted by the Arab League , which offe red full recogni tion and integration of Israel into the region in exchange for withdra wal to the 1967 borde rs, yet another version of the longs tanding internationa l cons ensus that the US has blocked. Large majorities also believe that the US shoul d equa lize aid to Israel and the Palestinians unde r a negotiated settlement, and shoul d cut aid to either party that refuses to negotiate: meaning, at the time of the poll, that it shoul d cut aid to Israel. But few unde rstand w hat any of t his implies, and a lmost not hing i s report ed about it.25 After the first Gulf war, Washington felt that it was in a pos ition to impos e its own preferred solution. Although never fully elabora ted, the 1991 version was to be more fort hcoming than the administration pos ition announc ed in December 1989, which endors ed without qua lifications the Israeli coalition gove rnm ent (Shamir-Peres) plan stipulating that there can be no \"additiona l Palestinian state\" (J orda n already be ing \"a Palestinian state,\" in their conc eption) a nd t hat the fate of the territories will be determined \"in accorda nce with the basic guidelines of the [Israeli] gove rnm ent.\" Washington conve ned the Madrid confe rence, with Rus sian participation to offe r a fig leaf of i nternationa lism. But a probl em arose at the confe rence. The Palestinian delegation was headed by Hayda r 'Abd al- Shafi, a cons ervative nationa list know n for his integrity and one of the most respected Palestinian figure s. The delegation refused to agree to continue d Israeli settlement progra ms in the occupied territories, thus deadlocking the negotiations , because the US and Israel refused to agree to this condi tion, even to cons ider it serious ly. Recogni zing that his publ ic support was collapsing within the territories and the Palestinian diaspora , Yasir Arafat unde rcut the Palestinian delegation by secret negotiations with Israel, leading to the \"Oslo proc ess,\" initiated offi cially with much pom p in September 1993 at the White Hous e. The wordi ng of the Oslo agreements made it clear that they were a manda te for continue d Israeli settlement progra ms, as the Israeli leadership (Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres) took no pains to conc eal. For that reason, 'Abd al-Shafi refused to have anything to do w ith the offi cial peace proc ess.26 Noam Chom sky 91 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"So matters proc eeded through the 1990s , as Israeli settlement and integration of the territories proc eeded steadily, with full US support .

There is a simple way to evaluate these claims: present a map of the territorial settlement propos ed. No map has been found in US media or journa ls, apart from scholarly sourc es and the dissident literature. A look at the maps reveals that the Clinton-Ba rak offe r virtually divided the West Bank into three cantons , effectively separated from one another by two salients cons isting of expa nsive Jewish settlement and infra structure developm ents. The three cantons have only limited access to East Jerusalem—the center of Palestinian commercial, cultural, and pol itical life. And a ll are separated from Gaza. Admittedly, this would have been an improve ment ove r the status quo, with Palestinians in the West Bank confi ned to more than 200 cantons , some a few squa re kilometers, and the situation in the Gaza Strip w as in m any w ays worse.

In Israel, maps did appe ar in the mainstream press, and the propos als are commonly described as mode led on South Africa's Ban-tustans of fort y years ago. Respected commentators report that the South African mode l was cons idered very serious ly in high military and political echelons in the 1970s and 1980s , and is the mode l toda y.28 Israel also cons idered South Africa a valued ally, as did the US, through t he Re agan ye ars. After the failure of Camp David 2000, negotiations continue d. They led to high-l evel (but unoffi cial) meetings at Taba, Egypt , in Janua ry 2001. These appe ared to be making cons iderable progre ss, though the major territorial probl ems remained, in less extreme form s. There is a careful record of the Taba negotiations in a report by the Europe an Union obs erver Migue l Moratinos , approve d by both sides.29 The basic differences were narrow ed but not entirely bridge d. For the West Bank, there was agreement in principle on the long-s tanding internationa l cons ensus honori ng the internationa lly recogni zed borde r, with \"minor and mutual adjustments,\" now not so minor because of the US-backed Israeli settlement and infra structure progra ms that, as noted, rapidly expa nde d as the Oslo proc ess proc eeded on its largely predictable cours e. Palestinian negotiators at Taba agreed to include within Israel the pos t-Oslo settlements established around the vastly expa nde d Jerusalem, but called for a one -to-one territorial swap—w ith the support of some Israeli hawks, who welcome the opport unity to transfer Israeli Arabs out of the count ry, thus relieving the much-fe ared \"de mogra phic probl em\": too many non-J ews in a Jewish state. But the Israeli negotiators insisted on a two-to-one , or larger, swap in their favor, with Palestinians offe red a worthless area adjacent to the Sinai Desert. The primary territorial issue remained the status of the Israeli town of Ma'aleh Adum im to the east of Jerusalem, and the infra structure linking it to the expa nde d areas to be anne xed to Israel, develope d mostly in the 1990s with the clear intent of virtually bisecting the West Bank.

They write that \"the way to get [to the solution] has elude d all sides from the start,\" but while accurate, the statement is misleading. The way has been blocked for twenty- five years by the United States, and Israel continue s to reject it even at the dovi sh extreme of the mainstream pol itical spectrum , as the Moratinos report again doc uments. During the Bus h II-S haron years, the pros pects for a diplomatic solution have declined furt her. Israel has expa nde d its settlement progra ms, with continue d US backing. The Israeli hum an rights orga nization B'Tselem was finally able to obtain offi cial maps indicating Israeli territorial intentions .31 Israeli settlements now control 42 percent of the West Bank. The bounda ries of Ma'aleh Adum im, for example, reach from the area of Greater Jerusalem almost to the isolated Palestinian town of Jericho, a salient that largely isolates the southern region of the West Bank. Another salient to the nort h also remains, partially separating the nort hern from the central sectors. The result is a harsh version of the three-canton arrange ment for the West Bank, all virtually separated from a small part of East Jerusalem, and of cours e from Gaza, how ever its fate is determined. The situation in 2003 is described in the primary US scholarly sourc e on the settlements by its editor, Geoffre y Arons on, after a visit to the southern area.32 \"In virtually every Israeli settlement, colonization effort s are proc eeding apace,\" leading to \"revolutiona ry change s in patterns of transport ation and access\" aimed at \"cons olidating Israel's ability to secure a permanent hold ove r these lands ,\" integrated within the much-expa nde d Israel. \"In contrast, the dyna mic for Palestinians is just the oppos ite—a n ever-increasing network of barricades, obs tacles, patrol roads, and prohi bitions that isolate them from settlements, from each other, and from places of work, comprom ising t heir ability to lead norm al lives and i mpove rishing a n entire nationa l community.\" As for Bus h administration plans in mid-2003, there are two sourc es, rhetoric and action. At the rhetorical level, one reads of Bus h's \"vision\" of a Palestinian state, and the US-inspired \"roa d map.\" In the real world, the Bus h administration repeatedly blocked publ ic release of the road map of the \"qua rtet\" (EU, UN, Rus sia, US), much to the annoya nce of the other members. The vision was left vague , and remained so after the road map was finally released, accompanied by Bus h's mode st announc ement that \"the road map represents a starting point toward achieving the vision of two states... . that I set out in June 24, 2002\"; namely, a pale and indistinct version of the \"vision\" that had be en common c oin for ove r a qua rter-century, but blocked by t he US.33 The first steps on the road map are explicit: Palestinians must immediately terminate resistance to the occupa tion, including attacks on Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories, and Israel must declare its commitment to \"the two-state vision ... expre ssed by President Bus h,\" its nature unc lear. \"As comprehensive security perform ance move s forw ard, I.D.F. withdra ws progre ssively from areas occupied since Sept. 28, 2000, and the two sides restore the status quo that existed\" at that time. Satisfactory perform ance will be determined by Israel and Washington. The \"status quo\" that is to be restored leaves Palestinians confi ned to hundre ds of cantons , surrounde d by the settlements and infra structure cons tructed by the US-backed Israeli military occupa tion. The future of these settlements remains unc lear. Israel \"immediately dismantles settlement outpos ts erected since March 2001,\" something on which all but the ultra-right in Israel agree, and at some time left Noam Chom sky 93 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"uns pecified Israel \"fre ezes all settlement activity (including natural grow th of settlements).\" Until that time, the settlements can continue to expa nd.

Later still there is to be \"implementation of prior agreements, to enha nce maximum territorial contiguity [for the Palestinian state], including furt her action on settlements.\" The \"furt her action\" remains uns pecified. There are no prior agreements that yield meaningful \"territorial contiguity.\" The only serious propos als that have been made are not on the agenda . Whatever Bus h's \"two-state vision\" may be, it is appa rently not the two-state vision support ed by virtually the entire world that the US has blocked since the mid-1970s , nor the Saudi plan ratified by the Arab League and support ed by a majority of t he American popul ation, nor t he solution w hos e out lines \"ha ve basically been unde rstood for some time now \" described by Agha and Malley. There is no hint of any of these ideas.34 Furthermore, although there is immediate (and violent) enforc ement of the road map's condi tions on the Palestinians, there is no enforc ement of condi tions on the US-funde d Israeli settlement and developm ent progra ms. There is a rich record about all of this, and no reason to expe ct any significant change . Though the political road map remains vague with regard to Israel's respons ibilities, other demands are quite specific. The huge US subs idy to Israel is, for the first time, condi tione d on Israel's perform ance: not on its implementation of the terms of the road map but on an econom ic plan that \"will slash publ ic sector jobs and wages and lower taxes,\" measures that have been \"dubbe d an 'econom ic road map.' \" The plan is described by Israel's leading newspaper as a \"ne w theory, ... accordi ng to which the US ope nly intervenes in forc ing a neo-liberal orde r in Israel\"—a theory that is welcome to the Israeli bus iness sector but led immediately to a strike of 700,000 w orke rs.35 Also quite specific are ope rations to create \"facts on the ground\" while talk proc eeds, in the traditiona l manne r. Notable among them is the cons truction of the \"separation wall\" that incorpora tes parts of the West Bank within Israel. The justification offe red for the barrier is security: for Israelis, not Palestinians, whos e security probl ems are far more grave. A barrier with a land swap would provi de no less security. The most security would be given \"by a wall a few miles inside Israel, to allow the IDF to patrol fully on both sides. But such propos als would not incorpora te Palestinian land within Israel, and would disrupt the lives of Israelis rather than Palestinians, and are therefore unthinka ble. World Bank-s pons ored report s conc lude that the wall will leave almost 100,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side, along with \"some of the richest agricultural land in the West Bank.\" The wall also places a good part of the vitally import ant West Bank aquifer unde r Israeli control. One West Bank town, Qalqiiya, is already virtually surrounde d by the wall, cut off from its lands , 30 percent of its water suppl ies, and whatever territories will be assigne d someday to the \"viable\" Palestinian state with \"territorial contiguity.\" More than half of Qalqilya's agricultural lands were report ed to have been confi scated, to be anne xed to Israel, with the munificent offe r of one time compensation e qua l to the market pri ce of one year's harvest.36 Immediately after Col in Powell went to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Sharon and discuss the road map, Sharon inform ed the press that as the wall proc eeded south of Qalqiiya, it would sweep well to the east to enclose the Israeli settlements of Ariel and Emmanue l, thereby partially separating the nort hern Palestinian enclave from the central one by a salient of Israeli settlements and infra structure, as in the Clinton-Ba rak Camp David plan. There can be little doubt that the second and more import ant of the Clinton-Ba rak extensions of Israeli territory, dividing the central enclave from the southern one , will also be incorpora ted, de facto, within Israel, in some manne r.

The very well-inform ed Harvard University scholar Sara Roy, relying on internal sourc es, writes that the World Bank \"estimates that some 232,000 people living in 72 communities will be affected\" by the first, nort hern pha se of the wall's cons truction, \"with 140,000 living on the eastern side of the wall but, in effect, encircled within its winding path\"; and that completion \"could isolate as many as 250,000-300,000 Palestinians while anne xing \"as much as 10% of the West Bank to Israel.\" She sugge sts furt her that \"the wall's design [may be] aimed at carving out and encircling the 42% (or less) of the West Bank that Sharon has said he is prepared to cede to a Palestinian state.\" If so, Sharon may have in mind something like the plan he propos ed in 1992, now recogni zing that the political spectrum has shifted so far toward the extremist-nationa list pole that what seemed auda cious then m ay be port rayed as a dra matic conc ession t oda y.37 \"The facts on the ground,\" Israeli journa list Amira Hass comments, \"are determining—a nd will continue to determine—the area where the road map will be applied, the area where the entity know n as the 'Palestinian state' will be established\": A visit to the [places] where the Public Works Commission, the Defense Ministry, Housing Ministry and the IDF bulldozers are busy at work, makes it possible to see why it's easy for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to talk about a \"Palestinian state.\" ... The massive construction in Jerusalem and its environs, from Bethlehem to Ramallah, and the Dead Sea to Modi'in, has already ruled out any Palestinian urban, industrial or cultural development worthy of the name in the area of East Jerusalem. The southern enclave of the West Bank, from Hebron to Bethlehem, will be cut off from the central enclave of the Ramallah area by an ocean of manicured Israeli settlements, tunnel roads and highway s. The northern enclave, from Jenin to Nablus, will be cut off from the center by the massive settlement bloc of Ariel-Eli-Shiloh.38 As for the \"settlement freeze,\" when Sharon persuaded his extremist cabinet to accept the road map he explained that \"there is no restriction here, and you can build for your children and grandc hildren, a nd I hope for your gre at-gra ndc hildren as well.\"39 At the rhetorical level, the road map appe ars to offe r more to the Palestinians than the Oslo proc ess: it uses such terms as \"Palestinian state,\" \"end to the occupa tion,\" \"fre eze on all settlement activity,\" etc., all phra ses missing from the Oslo prot ocols. But the appe arance is deceptive. Apart from extremist elements, Israel and its spons or have no intention of taking ove r territories beyond useful and desirable limits or of having Israel administer the bulk of the Palestinian popul ation. Cons truction of \"facts on the ground\" has proc eeded suffi ciently to allow the free use of terms that might previous ly have impeded plans that ha been implemented for the past decade and are now being e stablished m ore firmly. Apart from the rhetoric about \"visions ,\" there is a more significant sourc e of inform ation: actions . Keeping just to a few illustrations , in December 2000 the Bus h administration caused some cons ternation abroa d when it vetoed a Security Counc il resolution, adva nced by the Europe an Union, calling for implementation of Washington's Mitchell Plan and effort s to reduc e violence by the dispatch of internationa l monitors, to which Israel strongl y objects: their presence is likely to reduc e Palestinian vi olence but would also impede Israeli repression a nd t error.

The US stance has shifted ove r the years from endors ement of the applicability of the conve ntions to the occupied territories, to abstention duri ng the Clinton years, and fi nally to unde rmining t hem unde r Bus h II. The Bus h administration signa led its tacit endors ement of violent repression in the occupied territories in other ways as well. Thus , while Ariel Sharon was conduc ting his brut al offe nsive in the West Bank in April 2002, Col in Powell was sent to \"bri ng peace.\" He meande red through the Mediterranean, arriving in Israel just as the defende rs of Jenin were runni ng out of food and ammunition; one may presume that State Department intelligence was able to work out that calculation. A Pentagon offi cial stated the obvi ous : \"Powell's itinerary, he said, was designe d 'to give Sharon some more time.' \" A State Department offi cial adde d that \"the Israelis are not listening so much to what we say, but are watching what we do... . And what we're doing is giving them more time to withdra w\"41— when they finished their work: leveling the refuge e camp at Jenin, smashing much of the old city of Nablus, and destroyi ng the institutiona l and cultural infra structure of P alestinian life in Ra mallah w ith the vicious ness that has been ID F pra ctice for m any ye ars. In December 2002, the UN General Assembly reiterated the near-uni versal oppos ition to Israel's effective anne xation of Jerusalem, in defiance of Security Counc il resolutions going back to 1968 (passed with US support ). For the first time, the US voted against the resolution, form ally reversing the long-s tanding offi cial US pos ition on the status of Jerusalem. The US was joined by Israel, several Pacific island depende ncies, and Cos ta Rica. If intende d serious ly, this reversal virtually eliminates the pos sibility of a political settlement. The Bus h administration also continue d to sustain violence by voting against a resolution calling for internationa l effort s \"to halt the deteriorating situation between Israel and the Palestinians, reverse all measures taken on the ground since the latest violence began in September 2000, and pus h for a peace agreement\" (passed 160-4, the US joined by Israel, Microne sia, and the Marshall Islands ). Following the conve ntiona l pattern, none of t his seems to ha ve been re port ed in the US.42 Bus h also declared the archterrori st Sharon a \"man of peace\" and demande d that Arafat be replaced by a prime minister who will meet US-Israeli demands , though \"unl ike Mr. Arafat [he] doe s not have a popul ar following.\"43 All of this provi des furt her illustration of the president's \"vision of Noam Chom sky 96 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"democracy.\" In Februa ry 2003, Bus h delivered what the New York Times called \"his first significant remarks about the Israeli-Palestinian confl ict in eight months,\" in a speech to the far-right American Enterpri se Institute. The speech was mostly vacuous , but it did inde ed contain one significant remark. Bus h declared oblique ly that Israel could continue its progra ms of settlement and developm ent in the occupied territories. The form of his endors ement was the statement that \"as progre ss is made toward peace, settlement activity in the occupied territories must end,\" implying that it can continue until the US determines (uni laterally, as always) that progre ss has been made.44 Again, Bus h's sole \"significant remark\" reverses offi cial gove rnm ent policy. Previous ly the settlement progra ms had been cons idered illegal, or at least \"unhe lpful .\" Now they are implicitly authori zed. In defense of the administration, one may argue that offi cial doc trine has been brought into conform ity w ith ne ar-inva riant pra ctice. Prevailing values are often expre ssed implicitly, as on the first anniversary of 9-11, when the president took the occasion to provi de $200 million in suppl emental fundi ng for the rich count ry of Israel while rejecting $130 million for emergency suppl emental aid to Afgha nistan.45 And not only in the US. Thus form er UK fore ign secretary Dougl as (Lord) Hurd wrote that \"two uns olved probl ems torm ent the Middle East: the dange r from Sadda m Hussein and the insecurity of Israel.\"46 The insecurity of Palestinians in the thirty-sixth year of military occupa tion is not an \"uns olved probl em\"; in fa ct, it remains unm entione d. The steps that unde rmine the pros pects for a peaceful diplomatic settlement are continua lly justified as a respons e to Palestinian terror, which did inde ed escalate, including terrible crimes against Israeli civilians duri ng the al-Aqsa Intifada that broke out at the end of September 2000. The Intifada also brought into the ope n significant change s that had been taking place within Israel. The authori ty of the Israeli military by then reached such levels that military corre sponde nt Ben Kaspit described the count ry a s \"not a state with an army, but an army w ith a state.\"47 Kaspit's analysis is basically confi rmed, and deepened historically, by another prom inent military corre sponde nt, Reuve n Pedatzur, reviewing Israel's \"culture of pow er\" and \"cons istent choice of the military option\" ove r peaceful means, since its foundi ng. In his discussion of a book by military historian Motti Golani, Pedatzur writes that Golani is, \"of cours e, corre ct\" in his \"ba ld denial of the sacrosanct Israeli ethos accordi ng t o w hich Is rael has always aspired to pe ace, whereas its neighbors have cons istently refused to tread the path of peace, choos ing the path of war instead.\" The facts are sharply different, both agree. One prime reason is \"the institution-a lization of pow er and its total transfer to the respons ibility of the political and military establishments.\" The military command intervenes in \"pol itical-diplomatic debate,\" sometimes by threat of forc e, effectively form ulating policy to an extent unknow n in any other democratic society. Guided by this \"military culture,\" \"Israel's political-military leadership uses fear-m onge ring tactics in security issues, ... generating] anxiety in orde r to mobilize Israeli society and to deflect the publ ic's gaze from dom estic probl ems, such as a deteriorating econom ic situation or a grow ing une mploym ent rate.\" The \"form ula\"— familiar enough elsewhere, including the US—w as established by Israel's foundi ng father David Ben-G urion in the earliest days of the state, and \"fear-m onge ring ... would be used in the following decades,\" to the present. Author and reviewer join other Israeli commentators in warning of the \"serious dange r\" of the \"form ation of a cons ensus ... accordi ng to which, in Israel's situation, democratic cons iderations are a luxury,\" w ith \"s igns of fa scism.\"48 Kaspit's obs ervations were motivated by the utter contempt show n by the military command for the orde rs of the civilian gove rnm ent in the early months of the Intifada, a stance that is particularly noteworthy s ince the pri me minister was a form er chief of s taff a nd ot her civilian offi cials were also Noam Chom sky 97 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"from the uppe r military echelons .

Israeli commande rs rely not only on the standa rd military doc trine of thos e who have ove rwhelming forc e at their command but also on their own expe rience. When they orde red massive violence to \"crush\" Palestinians with cruel \"collective puni shment\" in Octobe r 2000, they proba bly did not anticipate that the tactics would arous e the victims to \"bloody revenge .\"54 That did not happe n when Prime Minister Rabin sent his troops to crush the popul ation of the territories by breaking bone s, beatings , torture, and hum iliation duri ng the first Intifada a decade earlier. Then the tactics largely w orke d, a s they ha d in the past.55 In December 1982, after an outburs t of settler and IDF terror and atrocities in the territories that shoc ked even Israeli hawks, a prom inent Israeli academic specialist on military affairs warned of the dange rs to Israeli society when three-qua rters of a million young people who have served in the IDF \"know that the task of the army is not only to defend the state in the battlefield against a fore ign army, but to demolish the rights of innoc ent people just because they are Arabous him living in territories that God prom ised to us.\" The essential principle had been form ulated in the early years of the occupa tion by Moshe Dayan: Israel shoul d tell the Palestinians in the territories that \"we have no solution, you shall continue to live like dogs , and whoe ver wishes may leave, and we will see where this proc ess leads.\"56 But the Palestinians remained \"samidin,\" who endure d but scarcely re taliated. The second Intifada was different. This time the orde rs to crush Palestinians relentlessly and teach them \"not to raise their heads\" escalated the cycle of violence, spilling into Israel itself, which had lost the subs tantial immunity to retaliation from within the territories that had prevailed for more than three decades of military occupa tion. Echoing the conc erns of twenty years earlier, an editorial in Is rael's leading da ily conc lude d that: Two-and-a-hal f years of intense fighting against Palestinian terrorism have turned the Israel Defense Forces into an obdurate and callous army, focused on its mission out of Noam Chom sky 99 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"an indifference to the consequences of its actions.

The first is that actions are evaluated in terms of the range of likely cons eque nces. A second is the principle of universality; we apply to ours elves the same standa rds we apply to others, if not more stringe nt one s. Apart from being the merest truisms, these principles are also the founda tion of just war theory, at least any version of it that deserves to be taken serious ly. The truisms raise an empirical que stion: Are they accepted? Inve stigation will reveal, I believe, that they are rejected almost without exception. The first truism may merit a word of elabora tion. The actual cons eque nces of an action may be highly significant, but they do not bear on the moral evaluation of the action. No one celebrates Khrus hchev's success in placing nuc lear missiles in Cuba because it did not lead to nuc lear war, or conde mns the fear-m onge rs who warned of the threat. Nor do we applaud North Korea's Dear Leader for developing nuc lear weapons and provi ding missile technol ogy to Pakistan, or denounc e thos e who warn of pos sible cons eque nces because they haven't taken place. An apologist for state violence who took such pos itions would be regarded as a moral mons ter or luna tic. That's obvi ous , until it comes time to apply the same criteria to ours elves. Then the stance of the luna tic and moral mons ter is taken to be highly honora ble, inde ed obligatory, and adhe rence to the truisms is conde mned w ith horror. Let us, nevertheless, accept the truisms for what they are: truisms. And then think about a few crucial curre nt cases to w hich they apply. Truisms and Terror Take 9-11. It is widely argue d that the terrori st attacks change d everything dramatically as the world entered a new and frightening \"age of terror\"—t he title of a collection of academic essays by Yale University scholars and others.1 It is also widely held that the term terror is very hard to define. We might ask why the conc ept of terror shoul d be cons idered particularly obs cure. There are offi cial US gove rnm ent definitions that fall well within the range of clarity of other usages that are regarded as unprobl ematic. A US Army m anua l defined terrori sm, as \"the calculated us e of vi olence or threat of violence to attain goa ls that are political, religious , or ideological in nature ... through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.\" The offi cial US Code gave a more elabora te definition, essentially along the same lines. The British gove rnm ent's definition is similar: \"Terrori sm is the use, or threat, of action which is violent, damaging or disrupt ing, and is intende d to influence the gove rnm ent or intimidate the publ ic and is for the purpos e of adva ncing a political, religious , or ideological cause.\"2 These definitions seem fairly clear. They are close enough to ordi nary usage, and a re cons idered appropri ate when di scussing t he terrori sm of e nemies. The offi cial US definitions are the one s I have been using in writing about the topic since the Reagan administration came into offi ce in 1981, declaring that a war on terror would be a centerpiece of its fore ign policy. The reliance on these definitions is particularly appropri ate for our Noam Chom sky 101 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"purpos es because they were form ulated when the first war on terror was declared. But almost no one uses them, and they have been rescinde d, replaced by nothing sensible. The reasons do not seem obs cure: the offi cial definitions of terrori sm are virtually the same as the definitions of count erterror (sometimes called \"low-intensity confl ict,\" or \"count erinsurge ncy\"). But count erterror is offi cial US policy, and it plainly will not do to say that the US is offi cially committed to terrori sm.3 The US is by no means alone in this practice. It is traditiona l for states to call their own terrori sm \"count erterror,\" even the worst mass murde rers: the Nazis, for example. In occupied Europe they claimed to be defending the popul ation and legitimate gove rnm ents from the partisans, terrori sts support ed from abroa d. That was not entirely false; even the most egregious propa ganda rarely is. The partisans were undoubt edly directed from London, and they did enga ge in terror. The US military had some appre ciation of the Nazi perspective: its count erinsurge ncy doc trine was mode led on Nazi manua ls, which were analyzed sympathetically, with the assistance of Wehrm acht offi cers.4 It is this common practice that allows for the conve ntiona l thesis that terror is a weapon of the weak. That is true, by definition, if terror is restricted to their terrori sm. If the doc trinal requirement is lifted, how ever, w e find t hat, like most weapons , terror i s pri marily a weapon of t he pow erful . Another probl em with the offi cial definitions of terror is that it follows from them that the US is a leading terrori st state. That much is hardly controve rsial, at least among thos e who believe that we shoul d pay some attention to such institutions as the Internationa l Court of Justice or the UN Security Counc il, or mainstream scholarship, as the examples of Nicaragua and Cuba une quivoc ally reveal. But that conc lusion won't do either. So we are left with no sensible definition of terrori sm— unless we decide to break ranks and use the offi cial definitions that have been abandone d because of t heir una cceptable cons eque nces. The offi cial definitions do not answer every que stion precisely. They do not, for example, draw a sharp bounda ry between internationa l terrori sm and aggre ssion, or between terror and resistance. These issues have arisen in interesting ways, which have direct bearing on the redeclared war on terror a nd on t oda y's headlines. Take the distinction between terror and resistance. One que stion that arises is the legitimacy of actions to realize \"the right to self-de termination, freedom , and inde pende nce, as derived from the Cha rter of the United Nations , of people forc ibly deprived of that right ... particularly peoples unde r colonial and racist regimes and fore ign occupa tion.\" Do such actions fall unde r terror or resistance} The quot ed words are from the most forc eful denunc iation of the crime of terrori sm by the UN General Assembly, which stated furt her that \"not hing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right\" so defined. The resolution was adopt ed in December 1987, just as offi cially recogni zed internationa l terrori sm reached its peak. It is obvi ous ly import ant. The vote was 153 to 2 (with a single abstention, H ondura s), he nce even m ore import ant.5 The two count ries that voted against the resolution were the usual one s. Their reason, they explained at the UN session, was the paragraph just quot ed. The phra se \"colonial and racist regimes\" was unde rstood to refer to their ally, apartheid South Africa. Evidently the US and Israel could not condone resistance to the apartheid regime, particularly when it was led by Mande la's African Nationa l Congre ss, one of the world's \"more notorious terrori st groups ,\" as Washington determined at the time. The other phra se, \"fore ign occupa tion,\" was unde rstood to refer to Israel's military occupa tion, then in its twentieth year. Evidently, resistance could not be condone d in that case either.

The US-Israeli stand extends beyond the occupied territories. Thus the US and Israel regard Hezbollah, for example, as one of the leading terrori st orga nizations in the world, not because of its terrori st acts (which are real) but because it was form ed to resist the Israeli occupa tion of southern Lebanon, and succeeded in driving out the inva ders after two decades of defiance of Security Counc il orde rs to withdra w. The US even goe s so far as to call people \"terrori sts\" if they resist direct US aggre ssion: the South Vietnamese, for example; or recently, the Iraqis.6 The publ ic know s nothing about the major UN conde mnation of what Reagan called the \"evil scourge of terrori sm\" and its fate, by virtue of the usual doubl e veto. To learn about such matters one has to wande r into forbi dde n territory: the historical and doc umentary record, or marginalized critical literature. Despite the unc larities, and the sharp divide between the US-Israel and the world, the offi cial US definitions of t error s eem fairly adequa te to the purpos es at hand. Let us turn to the belief that 9-11 signa led a sharp change in the cours e of history. That seems que stiona ble. None theless, something dramatically new and different did happe n on that terrible day. The target was not Cuba , or Nicaragua , or Lebanon, or Che chnya , or one of the other traditiona l victims of internationa l terrori sm, but a state with enorm ous pow er to shape the future. For the first time, an attack on the rich and pow erful count ries succeeded on a scale that is, regrettably, not unfa miliar in their traditiona l dom ains. Alongs ide horror at the crime against hum anity and sympathy for the victims, commentators outside the ranks of Western privilege often responde d to the 9-11 atrocities with a \"welcome to the club,\" particularly in Latin America, where it is not so easy to forge t the plague of violence and repression that swept through the region from the early 1960s , or i ts root s. The plague can in part be traced to a decision by the Kenne dy administration in 1962 to change the mission of the Latin American military, effectively, from \"he misphe ric defense\" to \"internal security.\" The effect was a shift from toleration \"of the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin American military\" to \"direct complicity\" in their crimes, to support for \"the methods of Heinrich Himm-ler's extermination squa ds,\" in the words of Cha rles Maechling, who led US count erinsurge ncy and internal defense planning from 1961 to 1966.7 The perception of the victims is similar. To take one case of unus ual curre nt significance, the highly respected president of the Col ombian Permanent Com mittee for Human Rights, Alfredo Vasque z Carrizosa, writes that the Kenne dy administration \"took great pains to transform our regular armies into count erinsurge ncy brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squa ds,\" ushering in \"what is know n in Latin America as the Nationa l Security Doctrine ... not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game [with] the right to combat the internal enemy ... : it is the right to fight and to exterminate social worke rs, trade unionists, men and women who are not support ive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists. And this could mean anyone , including hum an ri ghts activists such as myself.\"8 The \"gre at pains\" to which he refers coincided with the fateful 1962 decision. In that year, Kenne dy sent a Special Forces mission to Col ombia, led by General William Yarborough. Yarborough advised \"pa ramilitary, sabotage and/or terrori st activities against know n communist propone nts,\" to be \"employe d now ...

And \"we won\" the first war, Hill report s triumpha ntly, though the terrori st mons ter was only wounde d, not slain.11 How \"we won\" is someone else's department: the Jesuit intellectuals in Central America, the School of the Americas, truth commissions , serious scholarship, a ctivist and s olidarity literature, and t he memories of t he survi vors . We can learn a good deal about the curre nt war on terror by inqui ring into the first pha se, and how it is now port rayed. One leading academic specialist describes the 1980s as the decade of \"state terrori sm,\" of \"pe rsistent state invol vement, or 'spons orship,' of terrori sm, especially by Libya and Iran.\" The US merely responde d with \"a 'proa ctive' stance toward terrori sm.\" Others recommend the methods by which \"we won\": the ope rations for which the US was conde mned by the World Court and Security Counc il (absent the veto) are a mode l for \"Nicaragua -like support for the Taliban's adve rsaries.\" A prom inent historian of the subject, David Rapoport , finds deep root s for the terrori sm of Osama bin Laden: in South Vietnam, where \"the effectiveness of Vietcong terror against the American Goliath armed with mode rn technol ogy kindled hope s that the Western heartland w as vul nerable too.\"12 The villainy of t he terrori sts attacking us everyw here is awesome inde ed. Keeping to conve ntion, these analyses port ray the US as a benign victim, defending itself from the terror of others: the Vietnamese (in South Vietnam), the Nicaragua ns (in Nicaragua ), Libya ns and Iranians (if they ever suffe red a slight at US hands , it passes unnot iced), and other anti-American forc es worldwide. If not everyone in the world shares that perception of history, then they too are \"anti-American\" a nd c an be safely di smissed. As discussed earlier, the plague of US-backed state terror that spread through Latin America in the 1960s peaked in Central America in the 1980s , as Reagan's \"war on terror\" took its deadly toll.

All these atrocities fall within the category of state-support ed in-ternationa l terrori sm, if not the more severe war crime of aggre ssion. This account ing exclude s many other atrocities, such as the regular kidna ppings and killings on the high seas by Israeli naval forc es attacking ships in transit between Cyprus and nort hern Lebanon, with many of thos e captured brought to Israel and kept in prison without charge as hos tages, and num erous other crimes that are not crimes because they were backed by W ashington.13 In journa lism and scholarship on terrori sm, 1985 is recogni zed to be the peak year of Middle East terrori sm, but not because of these events; rather, because of two terrori st atrocities in which a single person w as murde red, in each case an A merican.14 In the worst of the two terrori st atrocities that passed through the doc trinal filters, a crippled American Jew, Leon Klinghoffe r, was brut ally murde red duri ng the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in Octobe r 1985 by a Palestinian terrori st group led by Abu Abba s. The murde r \"seemed to set a standa rd for remorselessness among terrori sts,\" New York Times corre sponde nt John Burns wrote. Burns described Abu Abba s as the \"ha s-been mons ter\" who may \"finally have to face a day of reckoni ng with American Justice\" for his role in the crime. One of the heralded achievements of the inva sion of Ira q w as the capture of A bu A bba s a few months later.15 The Klinghoffe r murde r remains the most vivid and lasting symbol of the ineradicable evil of Arab terrori sm and the una nswerable proof that there can be no negotiating with these vermin. The atrocity was very real, and is in no way mitigated by the terrori sts' plea that the hijacking was in retaliation for the far more murde rous US-backed Israeli terrori st attack on Tunis a week earlier. But the bom bing of Tunis doe s not enter the canon of terrori sm because it is subject to the wrong- agent fallacy. It remained unm entione d when Abu Abba s was captured. There would of cours e be no difficulty in appre hending the \"mons ters\" Shimon Peres and George Shultz, who are far from \"ha s beens,\" and bringing them to \"a day of reckoni ng with American justice.\" But that is beyond unthinka ble.

The basic dyna mic at work was outlined twenty years ago by one of Israel's most eminent writers and commentators, Boa z Evron, after an ups urge of settler-ID F violence that caused much cons ternation in Israel. Evron wrote a sardoni c account of how to deal with the lower orde rs—the \"Arabous him\" in Israeli slang. Israel shoul d \"ke ep them on a short leash,\" he wrote, so that they recogni ze \"that the whip is held ove r their head.\" As long as not too many people are being visibly killed, then W estern hum anists will \"accept it all peacefully\" a nd e ven ask, \"W hat is so terrible?\"17 The gua rdians of journa listic integrity in the US unde rstand the lesson without Evron' s advice. The most prestigious media watchdog, the Col umbia Journa lism Review, gave its cherished \"laurel\" to the US media for their cove rage of Sharon' s spring 2002 offe nsive in Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, and elsewhere, in the thirty-fi fth year of Israel's occupa tion of the West Bank and Gaza. The recipients earned the laurel, accordi ng to the Review, for ensuring that scrutiny of the offe nsive would focus on one cardinal que stion: Was there a purpos eful massacre of hundre ds of civilians in the Jenin refuge e camp?18 If not, then civilized people can \"accept it all peacefully.\" We might try a thought expe riment. Suppos e that Syria had occupied Israel for thirty-fi ve years, employing the means and measures of Israel's occupa tion, and then proc eeded furt her to dupl icate Sharon' s 2002 offe nsive: rampaging through Jewish towns, leveling large areas with bulldoz ers and tanks , keeping the popul ation unde r siege for weeks without food or water or access to medical care, destroyi ng cultural centers and the institutions of gove rnm ent and archaeological treasures, making it crystal clear to the Yids in every pos sible way that \"the whip is held ove r their head\"—but not slaught ering hundre ds of them at onc e. Accordi ng to the standa rds of the \"laurel,\" only an anti-Arab racist would object—a nd discove ry of the scattered parts of a murde red Jewish cripple in a wheelchair crushed by a Syrian tank w ould m erit no not ice, let alone stern \"A merican Justice.\" Reviewing \"the Jenin story,\" the Review berated the British press for \"embracing Israel's guilt as established fact\" and ridiculed the UN for \"pre paring an inve stigation by a team whos e political sympathies ensured that its conc lusions would be challenge d,\" certainly by the inde pende nt thinke rs of t he Re view. \"A mid all this confoundi ng di n,\" t he editors asked, \"w hat was the world to be lieve?\" Fortuna tely, all was not lost: \"Enter the inde pende nt U.S. news media, on a fact-finding mission of their own,\" which refuted the anti-Israel slande rs and revealed that there was \"no deliberate, coldbloode d murde r of hundre ds\" at Jenin—i n fact, reaching exactly the same conc lusions as the disreputable British media (and others), which, how ever, did not adopt the framework of US-Israeli propa ganda as rigidly as the editors of the Review demand, and scrutinized the Israeli inva sion beyond t hat single que stion. The \"inde pende nt U.S. media\" did not merit the insulting praise of their cheerleader. Careful readers could learn about the crimes that had taken place, though not in the shoc king detail presented in the Israeli and Europe an press. And they were carefully prot ected from the complicity of t heir ow n gove rnm ent, in rout ine fashion. When the \"wrong agents\" are implicated in state-support ed internationa l terrori sm, we sometimes discove r that terrori st atrocities are not fully effaced, but rather praised. An instructive case is the count ry that replaced El Salvador as the leading recipient of US military aid and training: Turke y, where \"state terror\" was practiced on a massive scale through the Clinton years, relying on US support .19 I borrow the term state terror from the Turki sh state minister for hum an rights, referring to the vast atrocities against Kurds in 1994, and from sociologist Ismail Besikci, returne d to prison Noam Chom sky 106 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"after publ ishing his book State Terror in the Near East, having already served fifteen years for recordi ng Turki sh repression of Kurds .

That would be a significant contribution to a general \"war on terror.\" Nevertheless, it would not addre ss the category of terror that passes through the doc trinal filters: their terror against us and our clients, an extremely serious matter, no doubt . Let us put that issue aside for a moment and cons ider a related dom ain in which attention to truisms may have some value. Truisms and Just War Theory The theory of just war has enjoye d a revival in the context of the \"ne w era of hum anitarian intervention\" and internationa l terrori sm. Cons ider the stronge st case put fort h: the bom bing of Afgha nistan, a paradigm example of just war, accordi ng to the Western cons ensus. The respected moral-pol itical philosophe r Jean Bethke Elshtain summarizes received opinion fairly accurately when she writes that \"ne arly everyone , with the exception of absolute pacifists and thos e who seem to think we shoul d let ours elves be slaught ered with impuni ty because so many people out there 'hate' us, agrees\" that the bom bing of Afgha nistan was clearly a just war.22 To mention just one additiona l example, New York Times columnist Bill Keller, now executive editor, remarks that when \"America dispatched soldiers in the cause of 'regime change ' \" in Afgha nistan, \"the oppos ition was mostly limited to the people who are reflexively against the American use of pow er,\" either timid support ers or \"i solationists, the doc trinaire left and t he soft-headed type s Chri stophe r Hitchens described as people who, 'discove ring a viper in the bed of their child, would place the first call to People for t he Ethical Treatment of A nimals.' \"23 These are empirical statements, so despite the near-una nimity of the declarations , we are entitled to ask whether they are true. Let's ignore the fact that \"regime change \" was not \"the cause\" of war in Afgha nistan but rather an afterthought late in the game. Were there oppone nts of the bom bing who were not either absolute pacifists or a bsolute luna tics? It turns out that there were, and the oppone nts form ed an interesting collection. To begin with, they appa rently include d the great majority of the popul ation of the world when the bom bing was announc ed. So we discove r from an internationa l Gallup poll in late September 2001. The lead que stion was this: \"Once the identity of the terrori sts is know n, shoul d the American gove rnm ent launc h a military attack on the count ry or count ries where the terrori sts are based or shoul d the American gove rnm ent seek to extradite the terrori sts to stand trial?\" Whether such diplomatic means could have succeeded is know n only to ideological extremists on both sides; tentative explorations of extradition by the Taliban were instantly rebuffe d by Washington, which also refused to provi de evidence for i ts accusations .

In Europe , support for military action range d from 8 percent in Greece to 29 percent in France. Support was least in Latin America, the region that has the most expe rience with US intervention: it range d from 2 percent in Mexico to 11 percent in Col ombia and Venezuela. The sole exception was Panama, where only 80 percent preferred peaceful means, 16 percent military attack. Support for strikes that include d civilian targets was much less. Even in the two count ries polled that support ed the use of military forc e, Indi a and Israel (where the reasons were parochial), cons iderable majorities oppos ed such attacks. There was, then, ove rwhelming oppos ition to Washington's actual policies, which not only include d civilian targets but even turne d major urba n conc entrations into \"ghos t towns\" from the first moment, the pre ss report ed. The Gallup pol l was not report ed in the US, though i t was elsewhere, including L atin A merica.24 Notice that even this very limited support for the bom bing was based on a crucial presuppos ition: that thos e respons ible for 9-11 were know n. But they were not, as the gove rnm ent quietly inform ed us eight months after the bom bing. In June 2002, FBI director Robe rt Mueller testified before a Senate committee, delivering what the press described as some of \"his most detailed publ ic comments on the origins of the attacks\" of 9-11.25 Mueller inform ed the Senate that \"inve stigators believe the idea of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon came from al Qaeda leaders in Afgha nistan,\" though the plotting and financing may trace to Germany and the United Arab Emirates. \"W e think the masterminds of it were in Afgha nistan, high in the al Qaeda leadership,\" Mueller said. If the indirect respons ibility of Afgha nistan could only be surm ised in June 2002, it evidently could not have been know n eight months before , when President Bus h orde red the bom bing of A fgha nistan. Accordi ng to the FBI, then, the bom bing was a war crime, an act of aggre ssion, based on mere suppos ition. It also follows directly that there was virtually no detectable world support for the policies actually unde rtaken, since even the minimal support recorde d by polls was based on a presuppos ition t hat Washington a nd L ondon kne w to be false. Perhaps the form er director of Human Rights Watch Africa, now a profe ssor of law at Emory University, spoke for many others around the world when he addre ssed the Internationa l Counc il on Human Rights Policy in Geneva in Janua ry 2002, saying that \"I am una ble to appre ciate any moral, political or legal difference between this jihad by the United States against thos e it deems to be its enemies and t he jihad by Is lamic groups against thos e they de em to be their enemies.\"26 What about Afgha n opinion? Inform ation is scanty but not entirely lacking. In late Octobe r 2001, after three weeks of intense bom bing, 1,000 Afgha n leaders gathered in Peshawar, some exiles, some coming from within Afgha nistan, all committed to ove rthrow ing the Taliban regime. It was \"a rare display of unity among tribal elders, Islamic scholars, fractious politicians, and form er gue rrilla commande rs,\" the press report ed. They had many disagreements but una nimous ly \"urge d the US to stop the air raids\" and appe aled to the internationa l media to call for an end to the \"bom bing of innoc ent people.\" They urge d that other means be adopt ed to ove rthrow the hated Taliban regime, a goa l they be lieved could be achieved w ithout furt her de ath and de struction. A similar message was conve yed by Afgha n oppos ition leader Abdul Haq, who was highly regarded in Washington and by Afgha n President Hamid Karzai. Just before he entered Afgha nistan without US support , and was then captured and killed, Haq conde mned the bom bing then unde r way and criticized the US for refusing to back his effort s and thos e of others \"to create a revolt within the Taliban.\" The bom bing was \"a big setback for these effort s,\" he said: The US \"is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don' t care about the suffe ring of the Afgha ns or how many people we will lose.\" The prom inent Afgha n women's Noam Chom sky 108 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"orga nization RA WA, which received some belated recogni tion when it became ideologically serviceable to expre ss conc ern about the fate of women in Afgha nistan, also bitterly conde mned the bom bing.27 Among other oppone nts of the bom bing were the major aid and relief agencies, deeply conc erned ove r the likely effect on the popul ation, agreeing with academic specialists that the bom bing pos ed a \"gra ve risk\" of s tarvation for m illions of pe ople.28 In s hort , the luna tic fringe was not insubs tantial. Let us turn now to the most elementary principle of just war theory, universality. Thos e who cannot accept this pri nciple shoul d ha ve the decency to ke ep silent about matters of ri ght and w rong, or j ust war. If we can rise to this level, some obvi ous que stions arise: for example, have Cuba and Nicaragua been entitled to set off bom bs in Washington, New York, and Miami in self-de fense against ongoi ng terrori st attack? Particularly so when the perpetrators are well know n and act with complete impuni ty, sometimes in brazen defiance of the highe st internationa l authori ties, so that the cases are far clearer than Afgha nistan? If not, why not? Certainly one cannot appe al to the scale of crimes to justify s uch a stand; the merest look a t the factual record ba rs that move . If these que stions are not answered, just war pronounc ements cannot be taken serious ly. I have yet to discove r a single case where the que stions are even raised. That leads to some conc lusions that may not be particularly attractive but that might merit attention and self-examination—a nd serious conc ern about the long-t erm implications of the appa rent inability to accept the principle of universality that unde rlies these failures. Although the critical que stions are not answered, or in fact even raised, related issues occasiona lly do come up, and in a manne r that gives some useful insight into the prevailing moral and intellectual culture. The Latin American corre sponde nt of the New York Times inform s us that Latin American intellectuals have \"reflexively accorde d ... anti-American leaders immunity to the moral standa rds applied to other leaders.\" His evidence is a statement by Latin American intellectuals warning a gainst a pos t-Ira q inva sion of Cuba . He believes a \"psychological explanation\" may be necessary to account for their failure to adopt \"uni versal moral standa rds.\"29 No psychological explanation seems necessary, how ever, when he and hi s associates \"re flexively accord\" t heir leaders \"immunity to the moral standa rds\" they apply to others: specifically, the moral standa rds that would call for severe puni shment for anyone else who dared to carry out terrori st wars comparable to thos e that their leaders have conduc ted against Cuba and N icaragua . Cons ider how Elshtain's argum ent on Afgha nistan fares within her own framework. She form ulates four criteria for just war. First, forc e is justified if it \"prot ects the innoc ent from certain harm\"; her sole example is when a count ry has \"certain know ledge that genoc ide will commence on a certain date\" and the victims have no means of self-de fense. Second, the war \"must be ope nly declared or otherwise authori zed by a legitimate authori ty.\" Third, it \"must begin with the right intentions .\" Fourt h, it \"must be a last resort after other pos sibilities for the redress and defense of the values at stake have been explored.\" The first condi tion is inapplicable to Afgha nistan. The second and third are meaningless: an ope n declaration of war by an aggre ssor confe rs no support whatsoever for a claim of just war; the worst criminals claim \"right intentions ,\" and there are always acolytes to endors e the claims.

Let's bring in some furt her relevant facts. The offi cial motive for the bom bing of Afgha nistan was to forc e the Taliban to ha nd ove r pe ople that the US suspected of i nvol vement in the crimes of 9-11; the US refused, how ever, to provi de any evidence. At the time when Taliban reluctance to comply was the lead story of the day, arous ing much fury, Haiti renewed its reque st for extradition of Emmanue l Cons tant, leader of the paramilitary forc es that had primary respons ibility for the brut al murde r of thous ands of Haitians duri ng the early 1990s , when the military junta was support ed, not so tacitly, by the first Bus h and Clinton administrations . The reque st appa rently did not even merit a respons e, or more than the barest report . Cons tant had been sentenced in absentia in Haiti; it is widely assumed that the US is conc erned that if he testifies, he may reveal contacts between the state terrori sts and Washington.30 Does Haiti therefore have the right to set off bom bs in Washington? Or to try to kidna p or kill Cons tant in New York, where he lives, killing bys tande rs in approve d Is raeli style? If not , why not ? Why i s the que stion not even ra ised in this case, or i n that of other murde rous state terrori sts who enjoy safe haven in the US? And if the que stion is cons idered too absurd even to cons ider (as it is, by elementary moral standa rds), where doe s that leave the cons ensus on t he resort to vi olence by one 's ow n leaders? Referring to 9-11, some argue that the evil of terrori sm is \"absolute\" and merits a \"reciproc ally absolute doc trine\" in respons e: ferocious military assault in accord with the Bus h doc trine that \"If you harbor terrori sts, you' re a terrori st; if you aid and abet terrori sts, you' re a terrori st—a nd you will be treated like one .\"3i It would be hard to find anyone who accepts the doc trine that massive bom bing is a legitimate respons e to terrori st crimes. No sane person would agree that bom bing Washington would be legitimate in accord with the \"reciproc ally absolute doc trine\" on respons e to terrori st atrocities, or a justified and prope rly \"calibrated\" respons e to them. If there is some reason why this obs ervation is inappropri ate, it has yet to be articulated, e ven contemplated, a s far as I ha ve been able to di scove r. Cons ider some of the legal argum ents that have been presented to justify the US-UK bom bing of Afgha nistan. Chri stophe r Greenwood argue s that the US has the right of \"self-de fense\" against \"thos e who caused or threatened... death and destruction,\" appe aling to the World Court ruling in the Nicaragua case. The paragraph he cites applies far more clearly to the US war against Nicaragua than to the Taliban or Al Qaeda, so if it is taken to justify intensive US bom bardm ent and ground attack in Afgha nistan, then Nicaragua shoul d have been entitled to carry out much more severe attacks against the US. Another distingui shed profe ssor of internationa l law, Thom as Franck, support s the US-UK war on grounds that \"a state is respons ible for the cons eque nces of permitting its territory t o be used to injure another state\"; the pri nciple is surely applicable to the US in the case of N icaragua , Cuba , and m any ot her examples.32 Needless to say, in no such case would an appe al to the right of \"self-de fense\" against continuing acts of \"de ath and de struction\" be remotely tolerable: acts, not merely threats. Noam Chom sky 110 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The same holds for more nua nced propos als for an appropri ate respons e to terrori st atrocities. Military historian Michael Howard propos es \"a police ope ration conduc ted unde r the auspices of the United Nations ... against a criminal cons piracy whos e members shoul d be hunt ed dow n and brought before an internationa l court , where they would receive a fair trial and, if found guilty, be awarded an appropri ate sentence.\" Reasona ble enough, though the idea that such measures be applied to the US or Bri tain is unt hinka ble.33 Two Oxford scholars propos e a principle of \"proport iona lity\": \"The magnitude of respons e will be determined by the magnitude with which the aggre ssion interfered with key values in the society attacked\"; in the case of 9-11, \"fre edom to purs ue self-be tterment in a plural society through market econom ics.\" That value was vicious ly attacked on 9-11 by \"aggre ssors ... with a moral orthodoxy divergent from the West.\" Since \"Afgha nistan cons titutes a state that sided with the aggre ssor,\" and refused US demands to turn ove r suspects, \"the United States and its allies, accordi ng to the principle of magnitude of interference, could justifiably and morally resort to forc e against the Taliban gove rnm ent.\"34 If the moral orthodoxy of the West accommoda tes the principle of universality, it follows that Cuba and Nicaragua (in fact, many others) can \"justifiably and morally resort to\" far greater forc e against the US gove rnm ent. Uncontrove rsially, the US terrori st attacks and other illegal actions against Cuba and Nicaragua \"interfered with key values in the society attacked,\" far more dramatically than in the case of 9-11, and were intende d to do so. Furthermore, since Britain \"sided with the aggre ssor,\" O xford t oo s houl d be subject to attack, a t least by N icaragua . We are entitled to ask why the conc lusion cannot even be contemplated (qui te prope rly, of cours e) and w hat that implies about the elite intellectual culture. The conc lusions with re gard t o the pri nciple of uni versality extend fa r be yond t hese cases, including even such minor escapades (by US-UK standa rds) as Clinton's missile attack on the al-Shifa pha rmaceutical plant in Suda n in 1998, which led to \"several tens of thous ands \" of deaths, accordi ng to the only reputable estimates we have, estimates cons istent with the immediate assessment of Human Rights Watch and later report s of know ledge able obs ervers.35 A crime of even a fraction of the scale would elicit fury if the target were the US, Israel, or some other worthy victim, and retaliation of a kind that one hesitates to imagine, which would furt hermore be acclaimed as a paradigm example of just war. The principle of proport iona lity entails that Suda n had every right to carry out massive terror in retaliation, even more so if we adopt the more extreme view that Clinton's missile attack had \"appa lling cons eque nces for the econom y and society\" of Suda n,36 so that the atrocity was much worse than the crimes of 9-11, which were appa lling enough but did not have such cons eque nces. Almost all of the limited commentary on the Suda n bom bing keeps to the que stion of whether the plant was believed to produc e chemical weapons . True or false, that has no bearing at all on the crime; specifically, on \"the magnitude with which the aggre ssion interfered with key values in the society attacked.\" Many point out that the resulting deaths were unintende d, so that the perpetrators, and thos e who disregard the cons eque nces of the attack, are not culpable. The argum ent again illustrates, dramatically, the standa rd rejection of the principle of universality. We would never accept this stand for a moment with regard to others: many of the atrocities we (rightly) denounc e are unintende d, though that is cons idered irrelevant—w hen the perpetrator is someone other than ours elves.

Potential threats are virtually limitless everyw here, even at hom e, as the anthrax attack and t he failed inve stigations of i t illustrate. Not only is the \"war on terror,\" as conc eived, likely to go on for a long time, but it also did not sudde nly become a crucial issue on 9-11. The terrori st attacks of that day were not entirely une xpe cted, yet another reason to que stion the widely held belief that 9-11 signa led a sharp change in the cours e of history. Even readers of newspaper headlines, and surely gove rnm ent planne rs, were well aware years earlier that atrocities of the 9-11 variety might occur. After all, in 1993, one almost did occur. Organizations presumably related to thos e respons ible for 9-11 came perilous ly close to blowing up the World Trade Center and killing perhaps tens of thous ands of people. It was also know n, at onc e, that they had far more ambitious plans that were barely abort ed in time. Even with the hideous cons ummation of these plans on 9-11, risk assessments did not significantly change . Prospects of major terrori st atrocities were publ icly discussed well before 9-11. And there could have been little doubt of the nature of the radical Islamist terrori st orga nizations since at least 1981, when elements that form ed part of the core of Al Qaeda in later years assassinated President Sadat of Egypt ; or a few years later, when groups that may have been loos ely related drove US forc es out of Beirut, killing hundre ds of troops and many civilians in separate attacks. Furthermore, the thinking of thos e invol ved in these and other similar actions was reasona bly well unde rstood, certainly by the US intelligence agencies that had helped to recruit, train, and arm them from 1980 and continue d to work with them even as they were attacking the United States. The Dutch gove rnm ent inqui ry into the Srebrenica massacre revealed that while radical Islamists . were attempting to blow up the World Trade Center, others from the CIA -form ed networks were being flown by the US from Afgha nistan to Bos nia, along with Iranian-ba cked Hezbollah fighters and a subs tantial suppl y of arms. They were being brought to support the US side in the Balkan wars, while Israel (along with Ukraine and Greece) was arming the Serbs (pos sibly with US-suppl ied arms).38 The atrocities of 9-11 serve as a dramatic reminde r of what has long been unde rstood: the rich and pow erful no longe r are assured the near monopol y of violence that has largely prevailed throughout history; and with mode rn technol ogy, the pros pects are horre ndous inde ed. Though terrori sm is rightly feared everyw here and is inde ed an intolerable \"return to barbarism,\" it is not surpri sing that perceptions about its nature differ rather sharply at oppos ite ends of the guns , a fact that is ignore d at their peril by thos e whom history has accustomed to immunity while they perpetrate terrible crimes, qui te apart from the moral cowardice so starkly re vealed.

They will also distingui sh carefully between the terrori st networks themselves and the larger community that provi des a reservoi r from which radical terrori st cells can sometimes draw. That community include s the poor and oppre ssed, who are of no conc ern to the terrori st groups and suffe r from their crimes, as well as wealthy and secular elements, who are bitter about US policies and quietly expre ss support for bin Laden, whom they detest and fear, as \"the cons cience of Islam,\" because at least he reacts to these policies, even if in horri fying a nd di sastrous ways.41 The distinction is elementary. Among thos e who wish to mitigate terrori st threats, it is unde rstood that \"unl ess the social, political, and econom ic condi tions that spawned Al Qaeda and other associated groups are addre ssed, the United States and its allies in Western Europe and elsewhere will continue to be targeted by Islamist terrori sts.\" Accordi ngly, \"the US shoul d, for its own self- prot ection, expa nd effort s to reduc e the pathology of hatred before it mutates into even greater dange r,\" seeking to \"mode rate ... condi tions that breed violence and terrori sm.\" The \"ke y to strategically weakening al-Qaeda is to erode its fledgling support base—to wean away its support ers and potential support ers.\" Washington planne r Paul Wolfow itz adds that it is crucial to eliminate pol icies that have been \"a huge recruiting de vice for a l Qaeda.\"42 Nothing can appe ase thos e \"who believe a 'clash of civilisations ' with the west will restore Islam as a world pow er,\" the editors of the Financial Times write. But to \"crush them ... successfully they must be separated from their widening c ons tituency.\" T hey add: \"Put another way, w hile onl y m ight can destroy al-Qaeda, its expa nding support base can be erode d only by policies Arabs and Muslims see as just.\" Even destruction of Al Qaeda will do little if \"the unde rlying condi tions that facilitated the group' s emergence and popul arity—pol itical oppre ssion and econom ic marginalization— will persist.\" Corre spondi ngly, continua tion of Washington's backing for \"sordi d gove rnm ents\" can only \"bol ster al-Qaeda's claims that the US support s the oppre ssion of Muslims and props up brut al gove rnm ents.\"43 That is quite aside from specific policies regarding Palestine and Iraq and others, which have conve rted \"a generation of Arabs wooe d by the United States and persuaded by its principles [to] among the most voc iferous critics of America's world view, [including] affluent bus inessmen w ith ties to the West, U.S.-educ ated intellectuals and l iberal activists.\"44 Terrori st networks can be severely weakened.

Their goa l, in their terms, is to dri ve the infidels from Muslim lands , to ove rthrow the corrupt and brut al gove rnm ents impos ed and sustained by the infidels, and to institute an extremist version of Islam. They despise the Rus sians with passion but ceased their terrori st attacks against Rus sia based in Afgha nistan when Rus sia withdre w, though these continue from Che chnya . And as bin Laden announc ed in 1998, \"the call to wage war against America was made [when it sent] tens of thous ands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosque s ove r and above ... its support of the oppre ssive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control. These are the reasons for the singling out of America as a target.\"49 But their goa ls may well become more ambitious , and their recruiting base more expa nsive as well, if the enthus iasts for a \"clash of civilizations \" prefer to try to \" 'missile' delicate social and political probl ems out of existence\" rather than addre ss the probl ems and t hus infri nge on pow er and pri vilege.

If the que stion is prope rly form ulated, answers to it are not hard to find. In the critical year 1958, President Eisenhow er and his staff discussed what he called the \"campaign of hatred against us\" in the Arab world, \"not by the gove rnm ents but by the people.\" The basic reason, the Nationa l Security Counc il advised, was the perception that the US support s corrupt and brut al gove rnm ents and is \"oppos ing political or econom ic progre ss\" in orde r \"to prot ect its interest in N ear East oil.\"54 The Wall Street Journa l and others found much the same when they inve stigated attitude s of westernized \"Mone yed Muslims\" after 9-11: banke rs, profe ssiona ls, managers of multinationa ls, and so on. They strongl y support US policies in general but are bitter about US support for corrupt and repressive regimes that unde rmine democracy and developm ent, and the more specific and recent issues conc erning Is rael-Palestine and Ira q sanctions .55 These are attitude s of people who like Americans and admire much about the United States, including its freedom s.

A much more grave threat to biology' s only expe riment with highe r intelligence is pos ed by weapons of mass destruction.

US intelligence predicts that any American deploym ent will impel Chi na to develop new nuc lear-armed missiles, expa nding its arsenal tenfol d, proba bly with multiple warheads (MIRV ), \"prom pting Indi a and Pakistan to respond with their own buildups ,\" with a likely ripple effect to the Middle East.

For similar reasons , Clinton negotiators had encoura ged Rus sia to adopt a launc h-on-w arning strategy, a propos al that nuc lear expe rts regarded as \"pre tty bizarre\" because we know that Rus sia's deteriorating warning systems are \"ful l of holes\" and prone to false alerts, increasing the \"threat of Rus sian una uthori zed, accidental, and errone ous launc hes.\" Chi nese resumption of nuc lear testing was also being quietly endors ed, it was report ed. Strategic analysts pointed out that this change of policy would encoura ge Chi na to aim more nuc lear-armed missiles at the US and Japan, with the expe cted effect on Japanese and Taiwanese progra ms. At the same time, the press report ed that the US would impos e sanctions on Chi na for allowing the transfer to Pakistan of \"missile parts and technol ogy that are essentially for weapons that can carry nuc lear warheads.\"7 All \"pre tty bizarre,\" if security is a highly valued conc ern.

Missile defense alone received more fundi ng than the entire State Department, and four times as much as \"progra ms to safegua rd dange rous weapons and materials in the form er Soviet Union.\" Maintaining the US nuc lear arsenal and preparing for resumption of nuc lear tests received almost five times as much fundi ng a s initiatives to control \"loos e nuke s\" and fi ssile materials.11 Even before the Nationa l Security Strategy was announc ed, Bus h had called for progra ms for offe nsive use of nuc lear arms.

Militarization of space, including such progra ms as ballistic missile defense (BM D), increases the dange r of destruction for the US, as for others. But that is nothing new: history provi des many examples of policy choices that increase security threats, cons cious ly. More ominous is the fact that the choices make some sense within prevailing va lue systems. Bot h topics merit some thought . Cons ider a few crucial stages of the Col d War arms race. At mid-twentieth century, the main threat to US security—t hen only a potential threat—w as Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM s). Rus sia might have accepted a treaty banning these delivery systems, know ing that it was far behind. In his authori tative history of the arms race, McGeorge Bundy report s that he could find no record of a ny i nterest in purs uing t his pos sibility.16 Recently released Rus sian archives yield some new unde rstanding of these matters, though also leaving \"unre solved mysteries,\" the bitterly anti-Com munist Soviet scholar Adam Ulam obs erved. One such mystery is whether Stalin was serious in a March 1952 propos al that appe ared to allow unification of Germany, as long as Germany did not join a military alliance directed against the Soviet Union—ha rdly an extreme condi tion a few years after Germany had, onc e again, virtually destroye d Rus sia. Washington \"wasted little effort in flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative,\" Ulam commented, on grounds that \"were embarrassingly unc onvi ncing,\" leaving ope n \"the basic que stion\": \"W as Stalin genuinely ready to sacrifice the newly created German Democratic Republ ic (GDR) on the altar of real democracy,\" with cons eque nces for world peace that could have been enorm ous ? Recent archival research surpri sed many scholars, Melvyn Leffler writes, by revealing that after Stalin's death, \"[L avrenti] Beria—the sinister, brut al head of the secret police— propos [ed] that the Kremlin offe r the West a deal on the unification and neutralization of Germany,\" appa rently agreeing \"to sacrifice the East German communist regime to reduc e East- West tensions \" and improve internal political and econom ic condi tions in Rus sia. That such opport unities existed, and were squa nde red in favor of securing German participation in NATO, was strongl y argue d by the noted political analyst James Warburg right at the time, but the sugge stion w as ignore d or ri diculed.17 The archives do, how ever, shed light on other Soviet propos als that were quickly rejected in favor of a risk-fi lled military buildup. They reveal that after Stalin's death, Khrus hchev called for mutual reduc tion of offe nsive military forc es and, when these initiatives were ignore d by the Eisenhow er administration, implemented them unilaterally ove r the objections of his own military command, in orde r to conc entrate on econom ic grow th.

Similar conc lusions were drawn by the prom inent strategic analysts Raymond Garthoff and William Kaufm ann, who obs erved these proc esses from inside US intelligence and t he Pentagon.19 The reaction of the Soviet military to the US buildup, influenced also by the demons tration of Soviet weakne ss in the Cuba n Missile Crisis, effectively terminated Khrus hchev's reform ist proj ect.

Throughout history, aggre ssive and provoc ative measures have been justified in terms of defense against merciless foes; in Kenne dy's case, defense against what he termed \"the monol ithic and ruthless cons piracy\" dedicated to world conque st. That is another claim that carries little or no inform ation, because it is so predictable, whatever the circumstances, whoe ver may be the sourc e. To comprehend the unde rlying logic, it is well to recall a doc trinal truism: it is conve ntiona l for controve rsial initiatives, particularly when hazardous , to be called \"de fense.\" Curre nt progra ms are no e xception. Missile defense is only a small compone nt of much more ambitious progra ms for militarization of space, with the intent to achieve a monopol y on the use of space for offe nsive military purpos es. The plans have been available in publ ic doc uments of the US Space Com mand and other gove rnm ent agencies for some years.20 The proj ects outlined have been unde r developm ent with varying intensity since the Reagan administration propos ed the \"Star Wars\" (Strategic Defense Initiative) progra ms. SDI appe ars to have been largely an effort to \"disarm BM D oppone nts\"—by then a huge internationa l antinuc lear popul ar move ment—by \"stealing their langua ge and cause,\" invoki ng the terms peace and disarmament, while proc eeding to cons truct a more adva nced offe nsive military system.21 The SDI progra m was in clear violation of the Anti-Ba llistic Missile (ABM ) Treaty signe d in 1972, accordi ng to Raymond Garthoff and others. The Reagan administration sought to suppre ss their objections . State Department legal adviser Judge Abraham Sofaer even threatened legal action to block Garthoff from publ ishing his book on the topic, a book that, in Garthoff' s words , refutes the flagrant effort s by Paul Nitze and other Reaganite enthus iasts for SDI \"to distort the historical record and unde rcut U.S. legal commitment.\" They were later to claim that SDI was instrum ental in ending the Col d War by forc ing the USSR into heavy defense spending— a claim that has little merit, accordi ng to Garthoff' s well-inform ed account .22 A case can be made, how ever, that the Kenne dy administration's rejection of opport unities for mutual reduc tion of armaments, and its general aggre ssiveness and arms buildup, may have had such an effect, at gre at cost and w ith the threat of fa r worse.

Chi nese authori ties are also surely aware that the US maintains the right of first use of nuc lear weapons . And they know as well as US military analysts that \"flights by U.S. EP-3 planes near Chi na,\" such as the one shot dow n in early 2001, enge nde ring a mini-crisis, \"are not just for passive surve illance; the aircraft also collect inform ation us ed to de velop nuc lear war pl ans.\"25 Chi na's interpre tation of BM D is shared by US strategic analysts, in virtually the same words : BM D \"is not simply a shield but an enabler of U.S. action,\" a Rand Corpora tion study obs erved. Others agree. BM D \"will facilitate the more effective application of U.S. military pow er abroa d,\" Andre w Bacevich writes in the cons ervative Nationa l Interest: \"by insulating the hom eland from reprisal— albeit in a limited way—m issile defense will unde rwrite the capacity and willingne ss of the United States to 'shape' the environm ent elsewhere.\" He cites approvi ngly the conc lusion of Lawrence Kaplan in the liberal New Republ ic that \"missile defense isn't really meant to prot ect America. It's a tool for globa l dom inance.\" In Kaplan's own words , missile defense is \"not about defense. It's about offe nse. And that's exactly why we need it.\"26 BM D will provi de the US with \"absolute freedom in using or threatening to use forc e in internationa l relations \" (Chi na's complaint, which Kaplan quot es approvi ngly). It will \"cement U.S. he gemony a nd m ake Americans 'masters of t he world.' \" The background assumption is the contempora ry version of Wil-sonian idealism, a doc trine taken to be \"so authori tative as to be virtually immune from challenge \": America is the \"historical vangua rd\" and must therefore maintain its globa l dom inance and military supre macy fore ver and without challenge , for the benefit of all.27 It also follows that \"the absolute freedom in using or threatening to use forc e\" to be confe rred on the US by BM D is a precious gift we offe r to mankind. Who can fail to pe rceive the impeccable logic? It is well unde rstood that BM D, even if technically feasible, must rely on satellite communication, and destroyi ng satellites is far easier than shoot ing dow n missiles. Antisatellite weapons , banne d by treaties that the Bus h administration is dismantling, are readily available even to lesser pow ers.

Advoc ates of BM D place their faith in \"ful l spectrum dom inance,\" such ove rwhelming control of space (and the world in general) that even the poor man's weapons will be of no use to an adve rsary. That requires offe nsive space-based capacities, including immensely destructive weapons , \"de ath stars\" as they are sometimes called, pos sibly nuc lear- pow ered, ready for launc h with computer-controlled reaction.

Even more fanciful ideas are being explored by the Pentagon' s adva nced research agency, DARPA, including technol ogies to interface brain and machine, leading eventually, it is hope d, to brain-to- brain communication.

The Space Com mand's Clinton-e ra broc hure Vision for 2020 announc ed the primary goa l prom inently on the front cove r: \"dom inating the space dimension of military ope rations to prot ect U.S. interests and inve stment.\" This is presented as the next pha se of the historic task of military forc es. Armies were needed \"duri ng the westward expa nsion of the continental United States\"—i n self-de fense. Nations also built navies, the Space Com mand continue s, \"to prot ect and enha nce their commercial interests.\" The next logical step is space forc es to prot ect \"U.S. nationa l interests [military and commercial] and inve stments,\" including missile defense, as well as \"space-based strike weapons \" enabling \"the application of precision forc e from , to, a nd t hrough s pace.\" US space forc es, how ever, will be unlike navies in earlier eras. This time there will be a sole hegemon. The British Navy could be count ered by Germany, with cons eque nces we need not discuss. But the US will remain immune —e xcept to the developm ent of WMD by rogue elements, and the narrow ly circumscribed category of \"terrori sm\" that is permitted to enter the canon: their terrori sm against us and our c lients. The need for full-spectrum dom inance will increase as a result of the \"globa lization of the world econom y,\" the Space Com mand explains. The reason is that \"globa lization\" is expe cted to bring about \"a widening between 'haves' and 'have-not s.' \" Like the Nationa l Intelligence Counc il,32 military planne rs recogni ze that the \"widening econom ic divide\" that they too anticipate, with its \"de epening econom ic stagna tion, political instability, and cultural alienation,\" will lead to unre st Noam Chom sky 124 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"and violence among the \"ha ve-not s,\" much of it directed against the US.

These have played a prom inent role in technol ogical and indus trial developm ent throughout the mode rn era. That include s major adva nces in metallurgy, electroni cs, machine tools, and manufa cturing proc esses, including the American system of mass produc tion that astounde d nineteenth-century competitors and set the stage for the automotive indus try and other manufa cturing achievements, based on many years of inve stment, R& D, and expe rience in weapons produc tion within US Army arsenals. There was a qua litative leap forw ard after World War II, this time primarily in the US, as the military provi ded a cove r for creation of the core of the mode rn high-t ech econom y: computers and e lectroni cs generally, telecommunications and the Internet, automation, lasers, the commercial aviation indus try, and much else, now extending to nanotechnol ogy, biotechnol ogy, neuroe ngineering, and other new front iers. Econom ic historians have pointed out that the technical probl ems of naval armament a century ago were roughl y comparable to manufa cture of space vehicles, and the enorm ous impact on the civilian econom y might be dupl icated as well, enha nced by the space militarization proj ects. One effect of incorpora ting nationa l security exemptions in the mislabeled \"fre e trade agreements\" is that the leading indus trial societies, primarily the US, can maintain the state sector on which the econom y subs tantially re lies to socialize cost and ri sk w hile pri vatizing profi t. Others unde rstand this as well. Retreating from his earlier critical stance regarding BM D, German chancellor Gerhard Schroe der obs erved that Germany has a \"vital econom ic interest\" in developing missile defense technol ogy, and must be sure it is \"not exclude d\" from technol ogical and scientific work in the field. Participation in BM D progra ms is expe cted to strengthen the dom estic indus trial base generally in Europe . Similarly, the US BM D Organization advised Japanese offi cials in 1995 that Theater Missile Defense is \"the last military bus iness opport unity for this century.\" Japan is being dra wn in not onl y to exploit its manufa cturing e xpe rtise but also to de epen the commitment of the indus trial world to the militarization of space, \"locking the progra ms in,\" to borrow a standa rd phra se of pol icy-m akers and a nalysts.33 Throughout history it has been recogni zed that such steps are dange rous . By now the dange r has reached the level of a threat to hum an survi val. But as obs erved earlier, it is rationa l to proc eed none theless on the assumptions of the prevailing value system, which are deeply root ed in existing institutions . The basic principle is that hegemony is more import ant than survi val. Hardly nove l, the principle has been amply illustrated in the past half-century. For such reasons , the US has refused to join the rest of the world in reaffirming and strengthening the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 to reserve space for peaceful purpos es. The conc ern for such action, articulated in UN resolutions calling for \"Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space,\" is motivated by widespread recogni tion that Washington intends to breach this barrier, so far maintained. The US was joined in its abstention in 1999 by Israel, in 2000 by Microne sia as well. As noted earlier, immediately after it was learned that the world had barely been saved from a war that might have \"de stroye d the Northern Hemisphe re,\" the Bus h administration effectively vetoed yet another internationa l effort to pre vent the militarization of s pace.

In June , Chi na again called for banning of weapons in outer space, but the US again bl ocked ne gotiations .34 Again, that makes good sense if hegemony, with its short -term benefits to elite interests, is ranke d above survi val in the scale of ope rative values, in accord with the historical standa rd for dom inant states and ot her systems of c onc entrated pow er. Much the same can be said about the breakdow n of effort s to ban chemical and biological weapons . That they pos e significant threats is not serious ly in doubt , but highe r priorities stand in the way of banning them. In April 2001, arms control expe rts report ed that internationa l verification of the ban on chemical weapons would have to be sharply curtailed \"be cause the United States and other key parties to the treaty [mentioning Rus sia] have not paid their way.\" A specialist at the Henry Stimson Center in Washington commented that the Clinton administration had \"made a mockery\" of the treaty by establishing \"a separate set of rules for the United States,\" with unilateral exemptions . The US was the only count ry to insist on exemption from certain inspections and tests when the Senate ratified the Che mical Weapons Conve ntion in 1997. The Bus h administration decided to withdra w from negotiations to institute verification measures for the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Conve ntion, effectively terminating them. The US had previous ly \"worke d to limit the scope of the visits by fore ign inspectors in orde r to prot ect American pha rmaceutical and biotechnol ogy companies, which dom inate the worldwide indus try and are conc erned with prot ecting their trade secrets.\" The Bus h administration proc eeded to reject any form of verification on the grounds that mechanisms would be ineffective and \"would simply raise the risk to legitimate United States activities,\" a pos ition conde mned as \"completely una cceptable\" by a senior Europe an diplomat. Short ly after, other likely motives surfa ced beyond prot ecting US corpora te interests, when it was revealed that the US \"ha s three clande stine defensive proj ects that mimic a complete bioweapons progra m,\" violating the spirit and perhaps the letter of the verification prot ocols that the US later offi cially rejected. Even before , Washington had argue d that \"access to American bio-de fense installations \" m ight reveal military s ecrets—w hich is the purpos e of e nforc ement mechanisms.35 Bioweapons specialists expre ss conc erns that the US \"may have rejected the bioweapons prot ocol because it is committed to continuing and expa nding its secret progra ms,\" in violation of treaties, pointing out that \"W ashington appe ars to have had no interest in developing a prot ocol acceptable to the pha rmaceutical indus try.\" Among the suspected plans is genetic engineering of vaccine- resistant anthrax, which the Rus sians may already have develope d. The US \"appe ars to have embarked on a largely classified study, across several agencies, of biotech applications for the developm ent of new bioweapons ,\" appa rently ignori ng treaties. Therefore \"the rest of the world will be obliged to follow suit,\" perhaps sparking \"a globa l bioweapons arms race.\" Proliferation of these technol ogies would also \"dra matically increase the chances that terrori sts would become capable of mass-casualty attacks using chemical or bioweapons ,\" a threat also discussed in the 2002 Hart- Rudm an re port on t errori st threats to the United States.36 The Bus h administration also announc ed that it \"no longe r support s] some of the Article VI conc lusions \" of the 1970 Nuclear Non-P roliferation Treaty (NPT), the major internationa l agreement on control of nuc lear weapons , which has had some success, though far from complete: Noam Chom sky 126 Hegemony or Survival"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"in particular, the five major nuc lear pow ers have not abided by their commitments. Article VI is the primary element of the NPT applying to the nuc lear pow ers: it commits them to \"ne gotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuc lear arms race at an early date and to nuc lear disarmament.\" The Bus h administration went on to declare its oppos ition to the ABM Treaty (since revoke d) and the Com prehensive Test Ban Treaty. It also unde rmined the first UN confe rence attempting to control the lethal internationa l black market in small arms, while Bus h point man John Bol ton inform ed the confe rence that the US oppos ed \"the prom otion of internationa l advoc acy activity by internationa l or nongove rnm ental orga nizations .\"37 It is not difficult to de tect the unde rlying l ogic or t o pe rceive the likely cons eque nces. As it announc ed its imperial grand strategy in September 2002, the Bus h administration move d to unde rmine continuing effort s to add enforc ement mechanisms to the Biological Weapons Conve ntion against germ warfare, preventing any furt her discussions for four years, and short ly after effectively barred reaffirmation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohi biting the use of poisonous gases and ba cteriological methods of w arfare.38 To move to another dom ain, the Bus h administration has been widely criticized for unde rmining the Kyoto Protocol on grounds that to conform would harm the US econom y. The criticisms are in a sense odd, because the decision is not irrationa l within the frame-work of existing ideology. We are instructed daily to be firm believers in neoclassical markets, in which isolated individua ls are rationa l wealth maximizers. If distortions are eliminated, the market shoul d respond perfectly to their \"vot es,\" expre ssed in dollars or some count erpart. The value of a person's interests is measured the same way. In particular, the interests of thos e with no votes are valued at zero: future generations , for example. It is therefore rationa l to destroy the pos sibility for decent survi val for our grandc hildren, if by so doing we can maximize our own \"wealth\"—w hich means a particular perception of self-interest cons tructed by vast indus tries devoted to implanting and reinforc ing it. The threats to survi val are curre ntly being enha nced by dedicated effort s not only to weaken the institutiona l structures that have been develope d to mitigate the harsh cons eque nces of market funda mentalism, but also to unde rmine the culture of sympathy and solidarity that sustains these institutions . All of this is another prescription for disaster, perhaps in the not very distant future. But again, it has a certain ra tiona lity w ithin pre vailing s tructures of doc trine and i nstitutions . It would be a great error to conc lude that the pros pects are uniform ly bleak. Far from it. One very prom ising developm ent is the slow evolution of a hum an rights culture among the general popul ation, a tende ncy that accelerated in the 1960s , when popul ar activism had a notable civilizing effect in many dom ains, extending significantly in the years that followed. One encoura ging feature has been a greatly heightened conc ern for civil and hum an rights, including rights of minori ties, women, and future generations , the latter the driving conc ern of the environm ental move ment, which has become a pow erful forc e. For the first time in American history, there was some willingne ss to look hone stly at the conque st of the nationa l territory and the fate of its inha bitants. The solidarity move ments that develope d in mainstream America in the 1980s , conc erning Central America in particular, broke new ground in the history of imperialism; never before had subs tantial num bers of people from the imperial society gone to live with the victims of vicious attack to help them and offe r some measure of prot ection. The internationa l solidarity orga nizations that evolved from these root s now func tion very effectively in many parts of the world, arous ing fear and ange r in repressive states and sometimes expos ing participants to serious dange r, even death.39 The globa l justice move ments that have since taken shape, meeting at the World Social Forum annua lly, are an entirely new and unpre cedented phe nom enon in character and scale.

The harmful effects of the corpora te globa lization proj ect have led to mass popul ar prot est and activism in the South, later joined by major sectors of the rich indus trial societies, hence becoming harder to ignore . For the first time, conc rete alliances have been taking shape at the grassroot s level. These are impressive developm ents, rich in opport unity. And they have had effects, in rhetorical and sometimes policy change s. There has been at least a restraining influence on state violence, though nothing like the \"hum an rights revolution\" in state pra ctice that has been proc laimed by i ntellectual opi nion i n the West. These various developm ents could prove very import ant if momentum can be sustained in ways that deepen the emerging globa l bonds of sympathy and solidarity. It is fair to say, I think, that the future of our enda nge red species may be determined in no small measure by how these popul ar forc es evolve.
