Despite the fact that America is the best-informed country of the world, our enemies have succeeded in camoufl aging the real facts and forces which led to the Second World War. The purpose of this short book is to remove some of this camouflage and prevent our enemies from exploiting the war- in-peace strategy which they developed and found us eful in interwar years and which they are using against us now. They are constantly perfecting it and will continue to a pply it after the end of World War II. The social, military and e conomic struggle will be fully as fierce as the military, n aval and air battles we have witnessed. The German battalions of war-in- peace are at work.

My war experience includes shrapnel injuries sustained in the first British air raid over Berlin and a long bout with t he usually deadly spotted war typhus, not to mention clashes w ith the Gestapo. Through a chain of lucky circumstances I was able t o gather a great deal of inside knowledge, some of wh ich has been put down in this eyewitness report, in the hop e of making those who read it get a clearer picture of the diff iculties con- fronting us now and in the future. I know Europe well. My father was a portrait painte r who, in my childhood, reversed the usual procedure of ar tists—he went from America to Europe to paint portraits of t he wealthy, the important or the beautiful. We lived m ostly in Paris but my father did a great number of portraits in Eng- land, Egypt and Germany. When he painted the King a nd Queen of Wurttemberg, there was quite a storm in th e little court of Stuttgart because this painter Schultz was not of Ger- man birth but of Norwegian origin. In later years, when I be- came a reporter, my father's acquaintances provided me with valuable contacts usually barred to foreigners. World War I broke out when we happened to be in my father's Berlin studio. We were supposed to return home, but illness detained my parents and I could not leave w ithout them. I managed to go to Berlin University and atte nd courses in history and international law. After the United States en- tered the war, the Schultz family had to report to the local police as \"enemy aliens\" at least once a day. I witnessed World War I and the Revolution in Berli n.

We travelled through many parts of Germany in that cru cial year. Dick Little taught me to let facts speak for themse lves. I have tried to do this in the following chapters. I knew, interviewed and respected most of the leade rs of the German republic. When I was made chief of the B erlin bureau of the Chicago Tribune, nobody in the new Ge rmany seemed surprised to find a woman in charge. The onl y one to worry occasionally about my status was the Chief of Protocol. What to do with a woman at the launching of Germany 's spec- tacular first ten-thousand-ton battleship when men were re- quired to wear either their military uniforms or to p hats had been quite a serious subject of debate to judge by the fact that years later he told me of the negotiations between his office and the Navy about the clothes the lone woman corre spondent was to wear. By that time, infinitely more serious problems confronted us. In 1930 I realized that the Nazis would play a deci sive role in European history and I began studying them most closely. Until then they could have been defeated by a milit ant democ- racy. In the first interview I had with Hitler he s taggered me by asserting, at the top of his voice: \"My will sha ll be done,\" and by showing very clearly that he felt he had the right to speak in religious terms. At a dinner at my house t he presi- dent of the Reichstag, a certain Captain Hermann Go ering, gave me an insight into Nazi mentality by describin g in de- tail the joy he had felt in 1914 when his sword had cracked through the bones of his first French adversary. I interviewed Hitler's chieftains and I know leaders of Germany's under- ground movements, who I hope will be able to escape the per- secutions of their Nazi tormentors and live to see their coun- try and their families free of Nazi fetters.

In the flush of Blitz victories in 1939 and 1940, t he real leaders of Germany, who had willed the Second World War, cast aside all caution. They boasted of their past activities and their future plans, these Nazis, industrialists , professors and militarists. Suddenly, as they talked, the full picture of the past quarter of a century came into perfect foc us, the pieces of the German puzzle clicked into place, eve n for one who had spent the past quarter of a century studyin g it. No one who has witnessed the triumphant joy of the vas t majority of Germans in their conquests and in the loot of th eir soldiers and their businessmen can ever consider them free o f guilt. No one who has heard them expound their plans for t he future and seen evidence of their preparations, can remain quiet in the face of the countrywide campaigns unleashed on America in an attempt to make us believe that once we have defeated the Nazis we can again live in peace. This is not t rue. Nobody sympathizes more deeply than I do with the G er- mans who had no part in preparing World War II, but their number was heartbreakingly small. We shall not be a ble to help them or ourselves if we allow false sentimenta lity to befuddle our minds. Men and women who knew the old Ger- many, before the lust for conquests was turned into her na- tional credo, seem to be indulging in a certain nos talgia for the dim past and they are allowing it to color thei r thinking. Even German refugees who suffered at the hands of t he Nazis try to ignore the tremendous changes German mentali ty has undergone and the real nature of the present-day Ge rman. In their fondness for their native country they, and t hose whose spiritual roots are in Germany, cast about for an a libi for their countrymen, just like the relatives of a man who sud- X"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"denly turns criminal. They meet with a certain resp onse from Americans who are desperately eager to be fair and who have not seen the new German in action. Those in quest o f an alibi for Germany find it in the claim of the German Nati onalists that the Versailles Treaty is the root of all evil. The Treaty, they say, was responsible for the new German aggres siveness, therefore probably also for the crimes committed in the name of the German people by their Hitler Guards and by their soldateska. The facts of the past quarter of a cent ury show this to be untrue. We should allow nobody's sentime ntal nos- talgia to blind us to the hard realities of the pre sent and of the future. I had hoped to sidestep the temptation of writing a book, but I have seen at work again the same forces which started preparing World War II when Germany laid down her a rms in 1918 determined to deprive the fighters for peac e and freedom of the just reward for their sacrifices. I felt it my duty to write what I know of these forces and their activities in the hope of helping our country, and those fight ing at our side, to avoid the traps being set for us now by Ge rmany's experts in the war-in-peace.

It was not declared, nor would it ever be, for this was a secret war, a war within a war. The men and women who fight it are both soldiers an d civil- ians. They take their orders from military and civi lian lead- ers of daring and vision, with wide knowledge of hu man beings and the world, and an utter contempt for any thing that does not serve their common cause—German world su- premacy. These leaders include military experts, he ads of industry and business, scientists, artists, influen tial clergy- men, women, professors, and key men in foreign coun tries.

It knows that the lethal power of the new weapons i s confirm- ing the rest of the world in a horrified determinat ion to out- law war. It plans to exploit our hunger after peace for its own ends. The new secret war dates from October of 1940. I wa s then correspondent in chief for Central Europe of the bi g morning paper of my native Chicago, the Chicago Tribune, an d the Berlin commentator for the Mutual Broadcasting Syst em. I had many old friends and confidential contacts amon g the German underground. As soon as the secret orders we re is- sued, they saw to it that I was quietly informed. During that period, one of my most trusted informan ts ar- rived many hours late for our appointment. He had t hat evening survived his third Gestapo-contrived automo bile ac- cident within a week. He told me of the summons sent out by Heinrich Himm ler, chief of the Gestapo, to every agent who had worked in Aus- tria, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Denmark, and France. From them the most successful were to be trained for new cam- paigns in new countries. Added to his information c ame other details, each fitting neatly into the jigsaw. I lea rned of the school in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which specialized in train- ing agents for Africa. Aside from these there were the law professors, who had their orders to examine the old Chinese penal codes , to pre- pare a \"scientific work to be used as a propaganda tool in Asia.\" Trusted Berlin lawyers, called into conferen ce with Himmler, were requested to develop cases and busine ss con- nections for good alibis in traveling to still neut ral countries; they were promised special plane transportation to Spain and South America. If they could find plausible excuses , they would be sent to Mexico and the United States. 2"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Insurance companies, moving firms, travel agencies, and artists' bureaus, which had already been useful in Southeast- ern Europe, worked out detailed reports on their pr actical experience. These were submitted in turn to propaga nda experts in the liaison staff of Rudolf Hess, and to the for- eign-service staff of Heinrich Himmler. Field Marsh al von Brauchitsch ordered his military espionage service to get ready to \"branch out beyond the countries assigned to them,\" and to \"report on political and economic possibilit ies.\" Great rivalry spurred on the three groups to write the re port which would win Hitler's approval. There was no doubt abo ut the importance of these various memoranda—they were to guide picked experts in the kind of warfare in which the Germans excel: war-in-peace. That was the word swiftly relayed to the selected m en in all the requisite departments of the nation's life, and to key men throughout the world. In the preceding June, the British had incredibly s natched their trapped armies off the bloody beach of Dunker que. The unexpected rescue disconcerted the Germans. But not as much as what followed. For weeks the strategy officers of the German High Com- mand, the air and navy experts of the general staff , conferred on French soil along the Channel, plotting their co urse: their next invasion should give them England, the giant a ircraft carrier from which German's planes would complete h er con- quest of the world. While they were polishing up their new Blitz, Briti sh planes dared the long flight from London to Berlin to bomb the German capital. It was a comparatively small ra id, but the German tacticians knew that if England were giv en time her air power would grow, and with it her raiding s trength. Further, not only would the German people see the e mptiness 3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of Goering's boast that England could never bomb Ge rmany, but for the first time in more than one hundred yea rs, densely populated Central Germany would be made to feel the devas- tation of war on its own soil. This would never do, for the German people might become permanently pacifist. Miraculously, England secured the time she needed, through the heroism of her people—and through the w atch- fulness of her navy. In the dense fog of a dark Sep tember night, fully manned barges of a trial German invasi on fleet set out from France, destination England. Nearly al l of them went up in flames. One of the few survivors, who wa s brought to Berlin, told his relatives that eighty per cent of the assault force perished. According to his account, his barge was in the rear, and so escaped. For the British had flooded t he sea around the barges with oil. Then they set fire to t he oil. The evacuation from Dunkerque, the bombing of Berli n, the loss of their preliminary invasion force—three blows in succession at the army, the air force, the navy—gav e pause to the German High Command. The generals suddenly remembered that other day, in 1914, when the Kaiser's troops were turned back from the gates of Paris by the battle of the Marne. At the time, rank ing gen- erals had warned the Imperial High Command that Ger many could not hope to win. And that war had been lost. Might not this one, too, be lost? Then make ready, far in advance. Prepare for the ba ttles- in-peace before the open war can fail.

The plan was simple. The militarists had worked it be- fore. They had won the peace, with double-edged sec ret weapons of their own perfecting—propaganda, penetra tion, economic sleight of hand, political intimidation. To the small number of Americans who watched and worked among the Germans from the Kaiser's time thr ough the days of the Republic, through the coming of Hit ler and of World War II, the realization came slowly that i t was not Germany, as we had always been told by the Germans, but the Allies who had been tricked in the peace. It wa s hard to believe, after the hardships the German people had endured in World War I and the spectacular recovery they ha d achieved by 1928, that a large proportion of the na tion could be laboring systematically, ruthlessly and, to a gr eat extent, selflessly, to get ready for a new war. The trend began early enough. The Nationalist vote steadily increased during the early Republican years, althou gh re- actionary leaders like Alfred Hugenberg did not eve n try to conceal their martial spirit; they were proud of it . By 1930 their rowdy brothers, the Nazis, had rolled up a vo te of almost 6.5 millions. Altogether—counting the Nationalists, the Junk- ers, their sympathizers in variously labeled kindre d groups, and the army officers directing the work of experts in German industrial plants and universities—it is safe to as sume that 10 million Germans, or approximately one-fourth of the elec- torate, were imbued with military aspirations. This was the situation even before the big Nazi campaigns of int imidation and terror. And the Nationalists of all camps forme d the aggressive element of the population. Therefore the ir influ- ence far exceeded their numerical strength. Further , many of 5"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"them belonged to the moneyed classes and were able to use the pressure of their wealth for political purposes . But they did so quietly, surreptitiously. Even those of us whose job it was to observe, to ha ve con- tact with all groups and to watch the changes they underwent, could learn only slowly; a hint here, an indication there, a piling up of intangibles, to weave carefully into a ladder over the wall of official secrecy. Thus, through the information which came into my ha nds during nearly a quarter of a century as second and then head of the Tribune bureau, it gradually became clear to me that months before the provisions of the Versailles Trea ty were known, an organized, small, and powerful group unde r Gen- eral Ludendorff determined to utilize the period af ter the in- evitable surrender of the German forces to prepare a new attack and seize the military victory so nearly won . There was a time limit goading on the men determine d to make a second try for world mastery within one g eneration, and that was the age of their fighters. General von Reichenau admitted this fact freely when victory seemed near in the sum- mer of 1940. \"This war had to be fought,\" he said, \"while the men who learned the warrior's trade in the Firs t World War were still young enough to make full use of the ir knowl- edge in forming the strategy of World War II.\" There is, however, no time limit on the will-to-con quer which animates the German militarists. They looked ahead to a new war as long ago as the fall of 1918 when they sacrificed the Kaiser to allay the suspicions of the Allies. T hey also looked ahead to a contrived armistice when they sta rted their new war-in-peace preparations in October, 1940. The first peace emissary to emerge from Germany in World War II, Rudolf Hess, insisted on German supremacy i n Eu- rope when he landed in England in May, 1941. Little more 6"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"than a year later, leaders who were determined to s ave Ger- man armed strength let it be known—in diplomatic, b anking, and business circles in neutral centers in Europe a s well as in England and in the United States—that they were ready to sacrifice Hitler for peace. These men belonged t o the same school of power politics as the men who sued for an armistice in 1918. The analogy is unmistakable. As the Kaiser was thro wn to the lion, the eagle, and the Gallic coq, Hitler was to be thrown to the lion, the eagle, and the bear. The negotiato rs failed. They did not paint a thick enough camouflage over t heir de- sign for conquest. But they'll try again. They have been per- fecting booby traps disguised with olive branches e ver since they saw that they could not invade England. The German experts laboring overtime on the new war -in- peace strategies are clever and ingenious. They can draw again on the deceptions which worked quite well eno ugh between 1918 and 1939. They have devised innumerabl e new ones, banking on the credulity, the tolerance, the love of peace among their democratic enemies and the fanaticism o f their own followers in Germany and abroad. The broad outline of the campaign aims at a \"scient ifically provoked and directed chaos,\" with which they feel certain to win ultimate victory. Such an idea perches uneasily in the mind of the av erage American, prodding his protesting, easy-going spiri t to con- stant watchfulness and caution. But however unwelco me, it is true. I saw us lose the last peace. I saw our ow n reluctance to face just such unpleasant truths trick us into b etraying our own dead. For the men and women now gone forth to w ar, the women condemned to barren lives, are our genera tion's victims as well as the enemy's—because we let the p eace which our soldiers had won for us slip through our fingers. 7"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"If in spite of all our brave planning for it we are not to lose the next peace, if we are not to betray our ne w war dead, we must be wiser than we were before. We can be wiser—but only if we uproot from our mind s every notion planted there by fecund German propaga nda, well watered and tended by Germany's dupes, by her ac- complices, and by some of our kindest and best-inte ntioned citizens; only if we set ourselves to a cool and di spassionate appraisal of the last twenty-five years; only if we seek out the bypaths we followed in an effort to be \"fair\" to th e Germans, which ended in the most monstrous injustice to ours elves. THE U N I T E D S T A T E S IS MY WORST E N E M Y , SAYS H I T L E R We do know, and we should never forget, that the Ge r- man militarists consider us Germany's principal ene my. Not only Hitler, but his General Staff as well, have le ft no doubt of this in conversations with men whose word I trus t. Our democracy is a symbol of hope to the oppressed. As long as it survives, the nations the Germans are determined to subdue will never resign themselves to German domination. Complete subjugation of Europe, conquest of the rest of the world, is impossible as long as we retain our freedom. Consequently, Hitler's friends ceaselessly attack o ur de- mocracy from within as well as from without. We wil l con- stantly remind ourselves of this fact. And we must draw the logical conclusions from our k nowl- edge, calmly but quickly. As late as the summer of 1943, German propaganda still triumphed in the belief of an ap- palling number of Americans and Britishers that the mis- takes of the Versailles Treaty fathered the German aggressive spirit which brought about the Second World War. Certainly the Treaty of Versailles was far from per fect. 8"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Certainly, too, the sufferings of the German people were in- tense. But only a small fraction of that suffering came from the terms of the Treaty. A great part of it came as an after- math of the war itself and from the German militari sts' de- termination to bootleg Germany a new army. But the Germans blamed us, and our peace treaty. Th e more sentimental of us echoed the plaint. If we had not been so unkind to the poor Germans at Versailles, we sai d, they would not have felt the need to rearm, they would n ot have fallen prey to a demagogue like Hitler. On such lop sided, lit- erally Jerry-built logic, we based a whole theory o f war guilt, in which we were both judge and villain. The truth is that German militarism never meant to give up the fight when the German army sued for armistice i n 1918. It only went under cover to lick its wounds. Our al leged un- kindness at Versailles had nothing whatever to do w ith Ger- many's dedication to another war and, should that w ar fail, to still another. The truth is that in August and September of 1918, when they were privately told by General Ludendorff that defeat was imminent, Germany's cleverest, most ruthless me n, the German General staff, the top-ranking industrialist s, and some of the most astute university professors, came together with a strong common purpose: to form a cabal power ful and fanatic enough to make ready a new army and to swee p Ger- many to victory after a short armistice. Long before they could know the provisions of the V er- sailles Treaty, hence before they could feel any sp ecial re- sentment over its terms, several dynamic groups in Germany were preparing the battle of the future. I give you five representative witnesses: the soldi er, the sailor, the pastor-politician, the industrialist, a nd the gen- eralissimo. 9"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE S O L D I E R Many of the soldiers and sailors of the Kaiser's ar my and navy were eager for peace in the days of 1918, when victory had fled the German colors. They had only one thoug ht in mind—to get home to their families for Christmas. Yet side by side with them were many others, men wh o had enjoyed the adventure, the kill. Among them was the Austrian corporal who on Armistice Day lay in a hospital nea r Berlin and whose name was Adolf Hitler. In his book, Mein Kampf, which later became the political Bible of Germany, Hitler speaks at length of his disgust with the revolution , and the sudden peace. He expresses his determination to fig ht it, born on Armistice Day, in the laconic words: \"I, however , resolved now to become a politician.\" To Hitler, the World War which he precipitated in 1 939 was the same war in which he had fought as a young man. He proved this, in the Reichstag at dawn of September 1, 1939, while his troops were invading Poland. Attired in f ield gray, he pointed to the coat he was wearing and said, \"I have put on again my old soldier's coat, and I shall not tak e it off until ultimate victory is won.\" The same coat, and for it s wearer the same goal as in 1914—German world domination. It has been said that if life had been easier for s uch as Hitler in the transition months after the Armistice , the Ger- man militaristic spirit might not have thrown aside its shroud and struck out for Greater Germany. But Hitler coul d never have stamped his armies out of the ground if German mili- tarism had been dead. The martial fanaticism of the tens of thousands who packed the secret military and semimi litary organizations created for them immediately after th e war showed that at least this large body of voters want ed no truck with peace. 10"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"And the Worker's Party, which later became the Nazi Party, was founded on January 5, 1919, long before its founders knew what would be in the Versailles Treat y. Ac- cording to the Party records, the seventh inscribed member was Adolf Hitler. THE S A I L O R During the early months of 1919 Richard Henry Littl e, of the Tribune and I interviewed literally dozens of G erman of- ficers. None was more truculent than Admiral von Ti rpitz or Admiral Scheer, who absolutely refused to accept th e defeat as final. And their attitude was identical with tha t of nearly every naval officer we met. The most outspoken of them was a sour, disagreeable little man in navy blue, whose name was Raeder. \"You Ameri cans need not feel proud of yourselves,\" he rasped at us . \"Within twenty-five years at the latest, your country and m y country will be at war again. And this time we shall win, b ecause we will be better prepared than you will be.\" Raeder was a good prophet as to time. And there is no doubt that he and his fellow officers devoted the i nterval be- tween 1919 and 1939 to providing Germany with as po werful a navy as they could devise. I well remember how, on that day in 1919, we felt s orry for vengeful little Raeder. He was taking defeat so hard. He was, we felt, simply consuming himself with hatred. When, almost twenty-two years later, Adolf Hitler d eclared war on the United States, the man commanding the Ge rman navy was Grand Admiral Dr. Erich Raeder. THE P A S T O R - P O L I T I C I A N Friedrich Naumann was accounted one of the foremost leaders in German liberal thought from the turn of the cen- 11"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tury until long after World War I. In his Mitteleur opa, or Middle Europe, a best seller in 1915, Naumann advoc ated the creation of a central Europe, combining Austria -Hungary and the surrounding states under a German continent al hege- mony. His ideas woke a tremendous echo in Germany, as did his challenge: \"If we are only half victorious, the n we shall be obliged to fight again.\" In one voice with the German High Command, Naumann proclaimed that \"Everything has to be made subservi ent to preparations for the next war!\" Since this frank Na umann dictum antedates the Armistice by three years, it t estifies, loud and clear, that the German will to wage a second wa r for German expansion could not have been the ill-begott en child of the Versailles Treaty. THE I N D U S T R I A L I S T As I traveled around Germany in the raw early sprin g of 1919 it was evident that German industry rebelled a t the loss of the war even more bitterly than the army or the navy. Dur- ing the half century before World War I, the coloss us of industry had begun to shoulder the German sky. It h ad counted on the conquests of the Kaiser's armies for new room, new markets. Logically, then, when the High Command was actually forced to acknowledge defeat, German indus try turned about to save what could be saved of Germany 's war machine, for the sake of future conquests. Every co ncern that had ever had a state order co-operated, so tha t their num- ber was legion. I shall mention only one. In the spring of 1919, German armament plants were sup- posed to have stopped war production. A few English and American newspaper correspondents managed to arrang e a tour of Germany's formidable war plant, the Krupp w orks in Essen. The newsmen returned, to report a gratifying German 12"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"compliance with disarmament orders. Then indignant German pacifists came to us and insisted that although the newsmen had passed close to parts of the plant where guns w ere still being manufactured, they were too innocent of indus trial processes to recognize what was going on. All Berli n laughed at the unsuspecting correspondents. Years later, I met and talked with the very Krupp o fficial who had chaperoned the correspondents on their insp ection tour. His name was Hohmann. \"I sweated agonies,\" he said reminiscently. \"There they were, those sharp-nosed news hawks. What if one of them should see that we were really still at work on a war job, finishing the models to be stored away in case of need? But they did not pry much. Th e war was won, and there the thing ended.\" He paused, and then added, \"But it was not ended for us.\" THE G E N E R A L I S S I M O Historians have debated hotly for years as to wheth er the German master strategist of World War I was Field M arshal von Hindenburg, Field Marshal von Mackensen, Genera l Hoffmann, or General Erich von Ludendorff. Whoever they eventually decide on, what is important here is tha t Luden- dorff was the master strategist of the war-in-peace which be- gan in 1918, that his brain conceived the nightmare now known as total war. It was not only that he early r ealized the war had been lost. Others did, too. What singled Lu dendorff out from his fellows was that he had the vision to prepare a viciously clever plan against the day when the Germ an forces should have to surrender. In August, 1918, Ludendorff tendered his resignatio n as quartermaster-general to the Kaiser. The Kaiser ref used to accept it. Ludendorff was not a coward. Only one th ing could 13"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"have induced him to leave his post while his troops were in difficulty: he felt he had a higher duty. The German financial councillor, Dr. Paul Bang, a L uden- dorff intimate, emphatically repeated to me on seve ral oc- casions that in 1918, \"Ludendorff felt it imperativ e to concentrate on preparations for the war to be fough t when Germany had regained her strength.\" That last phrase is significant. The peace was neve r in- tended to be permanent, but merely an interval duri ng which Germany \"regained her strength.\" There was a later period in which Ludendorff violen tly de- nounced those who had not fought to the finish, but he was a responsible general staff man who knew when his tro ops had cracked. He would not have led such troops into a n ew battle. The call for resistance to the end, however, salvag ed the prestige of the German army safely enough, since th e Armis- tice was already in view. If the framework of the army was to be saved, there was much for Ludendorff to do in those last weeks, and the gen- eral was tied to his post. Secretly he went ahead a s quickly as possible within the galling limitations of time and distance, summoning key men to confer with him at his headqua rters on immediate steps to set the conspiracy in motion. Despite the gravity of the front-line situation, he also ma naged to get to Berlin for long enough to see, as he said, \"a gr eat many people.\" Always the message was the same. Ludendorff warned every discreet and powerful friend in the army, amo ng the diplomatic, political, and industrial leaders, that Germany would have to ask for an armistice. He urged that t hey \"pre- pare for all eventualities.\" Thus, under the pressure of impending defeat on the field, disaffection on the home front, and the conviction that on the 14"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"success of his plan depended the future ambitions o f Ger- many, months before the Versailles Treaty was known , Gen- eral Ludendorff laid the foundations for what I cal l the Ger- man Secret General Staff. 2 THE GERMAN S E C R E T GENERAL STAFF EVERY MAN in Ludendorff's group had to possess cer- tain special values of use to the others and to the ir common purpose. He must have attained prominence in the ar my or the navy, in industry, banking, business, science, lett ers, or teach- ing—and he must ruthlessly exert every ounce of his power to the re-creation of a mighty, armed Germany. So that while Ludendorff did not, and indeed could not, build a well-defined, set organization with a forma l title, the members of the secret general staff were inexorably bound together by their mutual interest. For each man wan ted per- sonal power, and only in a Germany both strong and militant could he have it. Ludendorff was crystal clear as to the direction he and his associates must take, marked out many years before by von Clausewitz, when he wrote in his Vom Krieg that \"Ev en the final decision of a war is not to be regarded as ab solute. The conquered nation often sees it as only a passing ev il, to be re- paired in after times by political combinations.\" All around Ludendorff in that tense autumn of 1918, how- 15"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ever, there was indescribable national confusion. T he various cliques seethed in a ferment; the cabinet members d espairing of favorable armistice terms if the Kaiser did not withdraw; the old-time, feudally trained men among the army o fficers supporting the Kaiser's defiance; and the Kaiser hi mself swaying from one bewilderment to another as the pop ular dis- content became too apparent to be ignored. For the people had learned that it was the Kaiser's refusal to abd icate that was keeping the longed-for peace dangling just out of their reach. The press maintained careful discretion with obliqu e ref- erences in influential papers like the Frankfurter Zeitung to the \"question of the Kaiser.\" But discretion gave w ay to pres- sure from the radical Independent Socialists in suc h blunt statements as \"Germany is risking destruction for t he sake of one man.\" The moderate Social Democrats, however, while they fa- vored a republican form of government, joined the d emand for abdication only when Wilson's various notes str essed Allied rejection of the Kaiser as the representativ e of the Ger- man nation. Then they advocated a regency which wou ld be strong enough to weather the crisis. It is not impossible that the dynasty might have sa ved itself if the Kaiser's son, Prince August Wilhelm of Hohen zollern, \"Prince Auwi,\" had been just a little brighter. Whe n the chancellor, Prince Max von Baden, conferred with hi m on a projected joint regency, Prince Auwi, already set i n patterns of arrogance and stupidity, \"failed to understand.\" As a ma- ture man he later allowed himself to be used by the Nazis with a startling lack of dignity. The Nazis rewarde d him with the wartime job of distributing fish in Potsdam. In any case, Prince Max von Baden had to abandon Pr ince 16"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Auwi as regency timber, and he hadn't the courage t o take on the job himself. During all these hazardous days the industrialists, who had always actively but discreetly directed the governm ent, kept themselves far in the background. But they were bus y. All the men whom Ludendorff had tipped off as to a possible German defeat used what private pressure they could to bri ng about the abdication. Konrad Haussmann, secretary of stat e under Prince Max, wrote to his daughter on October 15, 19 18: \"The chief representatives of German industry and financ e all hold that the only hope for the state and the dynasty is renuncia- tion of the throne by the Kaiser and the Crown Prin ce.\" Friedrich von Peyer, vice-chancellor under both Cha ncel- lors von Hertling and Prince Max, also speaks of th e agitation in favor of the abdication by \"German man ufactur- ing interests.\" Conversations with numerous industrialists in the c ourse of many years have confirmed this historical fact. Their un- characteristic modesty was an important element in the secret general staff scheme, nebulous as yet, to allow the erection of a papier mache Republic, use it as a facade, the n to erode even its slender underpinnings until it perforce co llapsed. Nor did General Ludendorff share openly in the deci sive drama preceding the Kaiser's abdication. His activi ties dur- ing the months of August and September had aroused the distrust of both the Kaiser and the chancellor, who knew, of course, nothing of his plans. After the Kaiser sent for Luden- dorff on October 25 and summarily dismissed him on a pre- text, there were two alternatives open to the gener al. He could attempt to seize dictatorial power. Or he could eff ace himself to work full time on the perfection of his secret s taff plan. The choice was an easy one. The differences between the closing days of World W ar I 17"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and World War II are bound to be many. One of the f unda- mental dissimilarities lies in the persons of the h eads of state. As king and emperor, the Kaiser automatically comma nded the absolute loyalty of his officers, just as his f orebears had commanded the loyalty of their ancestors. But, in t he eyes of the master-powers of Germany, who has Hitler ever b een? Just a rather vulgar little man who was useful, who se daring, whose visionary qualities and extraordinary insight embold- ened him to take steps which the more respectable i f equally ruthless military commanders feared to take. Furthe r, being a commoner, he could reach the mind of the masses. Separat- ing from the Kaiser was a hard wrench, like parting from a close family member—getting rid of Hitler, only a p leasure to many of the key men who have followed him obedie ntly enough, but with murder in their hearts. Many as the differences must be, in circumstances a nd in background, the one great similarity remains the sa me: the reason for making the change—to despoil the victors of the fruits of victory. When finally, in the dense morning fog of November 10, the Kaiser fled, Prince Max von Baden, back in Berl in, hur- riedly thrust the leadership of the state into the hands of the Social Democrat, Friedrich Ebert. With tears in his eyes, Prince Max begged him to \"Do whatever you can for t he Ger- man Reich.\" To this Ebert replied, \"I have already given it two sons.\" Both Ludendorff and his friends hoped that the four teen- point program of President Wilson would soften the terms imposed on Germany. But they took no chances. Every thing within reach that could be of use in future war was effectively hidden: blueprints for new arms, models, materials, and molds suddenly vanished. Ludendorff himself supervi sed the removal of part of the general staff files from the red brick 18"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"staff building near the Victory Column. He also won the heart of his industrialist friends by ordering the remova l of most of the documents of the Kriegsamt, the War Office b ranch responsible for the manufacture of German war equip ment. These files contained proof of the profiteering whi ch had made the rich industrialists richer, indignantly co llected and compiled by General Groener while he was in charge. Once the Kaiser had fled, Ludendorff felt he could move more freely, for the high officers on whom so much of his plan depended were no longer divided between their obedi ence to him and their allegiance to their king or emperor. MEN WHO WORKED W I T H L U D E N D O R F F General Ludendorff took stock of the situation, of what had been accomplished and what steps had yet to be take n. Among the efficient staff secretly enrolled were officers , some of them from his own quartermaster staff, leading industria lists, and reactionary politicians. They included Colonel Walt er Nico- lai, chief of the German secret service; Colonel Ma x Bauer, High Command artillery expert; Colonel Wilhelm von Faupel —the same Faupel who proved so valuable to the Nazi s in Spain; Colonel Heye; and a young, very energetic ma jor, Kurt von Schleicher. Among the industrialists were Hugo Stinnes, August Thyssen, Albert Voegler, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, and the future Nationalist leader, Alf red Hu- genberg. The politicians included many Junkers, amo ng them Herr von Oldenburg-Januschau. Then there were the f anatic pan-German leaders, Dr. Heinrich Class, Financial C ouncil- lor Paul Bang, and the race theorist Albrecht von G raefe. Ludendorff's connections with the universities were close, and before long some of the most influential professors and scien- tists, like Karl Haushofer and Ewald Banse, were to join the ranks. 19"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"These men formed a kernel of leaders whose self-cho sen work was to save the German officer corps so that i t could train new troops when the time came; and to make Ge rman industry strong enough to survive, so that in turn it could arm the new forces. The stage was set, the broad outline of the program worked out. The malnourished, spindly Republic was gallant ly fight- ing for life under sincere and hard-working men. Bu t Luden- dorff had seen how handicapped those same men had b een when suddenly given the task of creating the state for which they had nothing ready but idealistic concepts. He resolved to be ready when his time should come. He managed a spectacular \"flight\" to Scandinavia, d is- guised with a beard and smoked glasses. Actually he left with the approval of the new government head, Fried rich Ebert, and was accompanied by a young German office r os- tensibly on an official mission to Denmark. He had, of course, arranged to keep in contact with the men who remain ed in Berlin—through the young Major Kurt von Schleicher. From Sweden, where he found a refuge, Ludendorff ca u- tiously wrote his wife, \"I want to write and write. \" What he wrote piled up on his desk into voluminous notes fo r a book called Total Warfare, a masterly, detailed outline for the war loosed by his pupil, Adolf Hitler. Everything is th ere—the theory of mobilizing and regimenting every aspect o f life for war, the preliminary work for the Blitzkriegs—nothi ng was overlooked. Ludendorff and his friends met first problems first . How could they stir up the people to fight again after a lost war? The answer was astonishingly simple. Make them beli eve that the war was not lost, that they had just missed vic tory by their refusal to fight on to the end. This deception, which almost out-hitlers Hitler, wa s made 20"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"possible by the Allied failure to carry the war ont o German soil. The German masses, who hated having lost anyw ay, were glad to believe, and the deception made it eas ier for the secret staff to revive their martial spirit. That was luck. But most of the successes of the Ger man secret general staff were the immutable results of calculation. Thus, the first deliberate victory of the military group came from a clever sort of blind-man's-buff, by which a member of the fledgling Republican government, Dr. Matthia s Erz- berger, was compelled to sign the Armistice in the name of the German government instead of a military leader. This maneuver accomplished, the militarists promptly sta rted spreading the word that \"the Republic had stabbed t he Ger- man army in the back.\" To be able to keep the reins of government in hand behind the back of the Republic, the reactionary forces de cided they must keep useful men in useful places. While the ma sses were still rioting in the streets of Berlin, they prevai led upon the Republican leaders to \"act for German unity\" by inv iting the former imperial officials to stay on in office. Onl y a few re- fused the invitation. The most trusted secret staff members, who held strategic positions in the Reichsbank, the Finance Ministry and, naturally, the War Office, took care to keep their jobs. By one stratagem or another, the leading Republican s had by the end of the year been led to entrust the prot ection of the new government to imperial officers who were ei ther secretly or openly disloyal. One thing that made it relatively easy for the secr et staff to save the German army was the eagerness of the Repub lic's heads to retain a strong military force. Their reas on was that to them an army symbolized law and order, infinitel y neces- sary after four years of war and the disorders of r evolution. 21"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"But their motives were unimportant; their attitude was wel- comed. Because of the Republic's faith in the army leaders , in the two short months before the end of the year, the so lidly en- trenched secret staff had acquired a military whiph and. Knowing that the best of general staffs, though but tressed by the best of economic organizers, is relatively p owerless unless it has behind it the weight of a vast body o f men to be manipulated according to the needs of the moment, t he junta now turned its attention to assembling just such a force. Its members had early induced the Republicans to ru le that soldiers returning from foreign battlefields could re-enlist as volunteers. They thus escaped demobilization. And f rom the seeds of this innocent-looking measure grew the Fre e Corps, and later the Black Reichswehr, both of which heavi ly weighted the whip already in the hands of the milit arists. Under the provisions of the Versailles Treaty large num- bers of officers were demobilized. The demobilizati on looked like a peace move. Actually it made it easier for t he secret staff to remobilize them without detection. Many of the high- est ranking men received pensions adequate for a de cent if not luxurious living. Many officers went into posts esp ecially created for them in industry or big business. Where ver they were, however, all the officers remained instantly available for assignments on the multiple problems of the com ing war. Their contact man was Ludendorff's crack undercover liai- son officer, Major Kurt von Schleicher. His chief i n the War Ministry, the superefficient organizer, General Han s von Seeckt, could not risk being too prominently seen i n confer- ence with the \"former\" officers. And the young majo r pos- sessed an unusual and valuable quality—he was a bor n politician. By the time he had finished telling a g eneral what 22"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"the War Office wanted of him, the general would be convinced that he had thought up the idea himself. This arrangement worked well enough for a time. The n Ludendorff and his co-workers decided centralizatio n and a more rigid organization would speed the intricate w ork. They must find a headquarters, a kind of glorified beehi ve. R E I C H A R C H I V E S IN P O T S D A M They selected the Potsdam Reich Archives, an extrem ely subtle choice, since the Archives had been enormous ly en- larged by the unsuspecting Republic to \"simplify th e study of the World War.\" From then on, historians and officers from all part s of the world who flocked to the Reich Archives for researc h were hospitably received. And why not? They furnished ex cellent protective coloration. I myself interviewed many officers there from time to time on some phase of the war, but not until the full ti de of the Second World War could I confirm the true importanc e of the Archives. Discussing the thorough planning of the G erman campaigns with the Berlin correspondent of Goering' s paper, the Essener National Zeitung, I pumped him systemat ically. His usual line was to extol Nazi efficiency over th at of other, mere Germans. But today he said, \"After all, the strat- egy experts working in the Reich Archives ever sinc e the end of World War I have had plenty of time to work out problems from all angles.\" I tried to feel my way. \"They certainly did remarka ble general staff work in the Archives,\" I said. \"Why shouldn't they?\" he replied testily. \"They wer e members of the general staff.\" On the same trains that carried the millions of war -weary German troops back from the fronts in 1918, men who wildly 23"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"cheered the slogan \"Nie wieder Krieg\" (no more war) , were other soldiers who felt quite differently. Officers who refused to accept the defeat went among these others, picki ng the toughest and the most aggressive. Some of them spok e elo- quently of defending the Fatherland against the \"Re d rabble that had caused the revolution.\" Some promised expe ditions to the eastern border, to push the Poles back out o f their newly reconquered territory. In this way they assembled t he first units of what soon came to be called the Free Corps , whose actual strength was never known. The soldiers who longed for peace hurried home—\"Hei m zu Muttern zu Weihnachten\" (home to mother for Chri st- mas), as the Prussians put it. The adventurous ones had to be quartered somewhere, and in hiding. At first they s tayed in improvised barracks, on troop trains with their she pherding officers, or in country homes of officers' relative s. During this interval the Ludendorff group utilized its Junker m embers. For the Republic had generously allowed them to ret ain their estates. Some of these vast holdings sagged under h eavy mort- gages, but they were still secluded and big enough to shelter large numbers of men. Every old-time regiment disbanded by order of the V er- sailles Treaty had its \"tradition company\" in the R eichswehr (which legally numbered no more than 100,000 men, b ut was never in fact reduced to that treaty figure). The t radition com- panies were like green trunks, which could quickly branch out in full regimental leaf, ready for war. With the formal demobilization, the War Office crea ted a new, elaborate separate office which Major von Schl eicher dominated, to \"take charge of veterans' welfare,\" w ith com- plete files listing every man in need of help. Comp lete? They were exhaustive, indexing and cross-indexing the pe rsonal 24"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"data of every individual male who could in the futu re swell the ranks of a reconstructed German Army. Officers banded together in their old Deutsche Offi ziers- bund, maintaining their own welfare funds and court s of honor. Every regiment had its club, and noncommissi oned officers their separate associations. Thus each gro up could arrange meetings to formulate martial policies and to receive necessary directives without arousing suspicion. Fo r most of the Socialists in the Government were against war, and yet were very much needed to deal with the victorious A llies. Still, what could they say against old soldiers for egathering for a social evening now and then? Secret societies of various descriptions suddenly s prang up all over the country to \"carry on the sacred milita ry tradi- tions of Germany.\" Some of the societies were not s ecret, but centered apparently about some cultural or civic en terprise with no semblance of military connection. Respectab le burgh- ers in small towns and cities formed themselves int o patrol services. Their laudable purpose was said to be pro tection of their homes and families from the criminals who alw ays spring up from nowhere in the wake of wars and revo lutions. Perfectly innocent, one would say. But such groups were ac- tually utilized for the formation of military cells . V E T E R A N S WORK TO S A V E WAR S P I R I T A proposed veterans' organization took shape. But t he mili- tarists were too wise to head it with one of their own men. Officers who lived near Magdeburg, a district teemi ng with disgruntled Junkers and \"retired\" General Staff mem bers, found the ideal person for the job: Franz Seldte, a compara- tively wealthy soda-pop and liquor manufacturer. Ma gdeburg Was convenient enough to Berlin for the officers to run up to the capital for conferences whenever they wanted to , and for 25"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"their War Office friends to pay them protracted wee k-end visits. Seldte typified the reserve officer, dear t o Germany's middle classes, who is so grateful at being taken i nto the of- ficer clique that he tries to be more militaristic than the pro- fessional soldier. And so, under Seldte, the powerful Steel Helmet soc iety went into action. Like the Kyffhaeuserbund and its hundreds of smaller imitators, it was designed to embarrass and under- mine the Republic. All these things came to pass quickly. By Christmas of 1918 the Ludendorff group felt so sure of themselve s that Seldte was permitted to issue his first proclamatio n. It char- acterized the revolution as \"swinish.\" Nobody prote sted this insult to the legal government, the Republic which the revo- lution had brought to life. Apparently only the arm y jeal- ously guarded its prestige. Every one of the thousands of new societies, from t he Steel Helmets to the most innocuous-sounding social club, consist- ently urged the German people to cherish and foster their precious military spirit—the same spirit which late r was said to have risen, phoenixlike, from the ashes of Germa n humilia- tion at Versailles. In the meantime, a considerable number of German so l- diers had, instead of going home, stayed on in the Baltic states, in eastern Europe, and in Finland, to carry on their own private campaigns, in open defiance of the Repu blican government. Their many leaders there had almost as many aims; some wanted to wipe out Bolshevism, some want ed to join forces with the Russians. Still others planned to establish a German realm around the Baltic in memory of the T eutonic Knights. Nothing could be more convenient for anybody with p an- German ambitions than those ubiquitous Knights. Whe never 26"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"an up-and-coming army commander decided to \"reclaim \" a place for Germany, anywhere from Finland to the Bla ck Sea, he could always unearth some professor to testify t hat that particular spot had been \"won to civilization\" by t he Knights of the Teutonic Order. In any case, even their memory was still potent in 1918, as was the lure of campfires, secret plots, and sud den forays. Arms and ammunition from Germany kept the Free Corp s men well supplied. A friend of mine, talking with G eneral Ludendorff in his study in the spring of 1919, hear d him give orders to the commander of Koenigsberg to rush guns to the Iron Division in the Baltic states. Again, a certai n deputy Haase of the German National Assembly asked in open ses- sion how it was possible that troops, war equipment , and field kitchens were traveling through Memel to German uni ts in the Baltic districts, when the men were supposed to be at home demobilized and disarmed? It happened that the Free Corps men, doing as they pleased in eastern Europe, were behaving exactly as the sec ret staff wanted them to. The Allies were just as worried abo ut them as the German Republican government, for nobody kne w what it would please them to do next. Finally the A llies lost patience. Under their pressure, the government call ed them home on September 28, 1919. One of the returned adventurers told me condescendi ngly that it was a good thing for the Republic that it h ad ordered them home in the fall. It was getting cold and the men had begun to worry about supplies for the winter. Had t he recall come in the spring, he said, nobody would have paid the slightest attention to it. Once home, the newcomers made their presence felt. Whether formally demobilized or not, they gravitate d toward the local Free Corps camps, swelling their numbers danger- 27"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ously, and adding to the already seething unrest al l over Ger- many. R E A C T I O N A R I E S H E L P F E H M E M U R D E R E R S The Fehme rituals, with their concomitant brutal mu rders, contributed strongly toward keeping the secret soci eties secret, and the Free Corps free. Anyone who purpose ly or accidentally betrayed any information about the ass ociations forfeited his life. Many a man working for a peacef ul Ger- many, who came up against the network of Free Corps , also died at their hands. Years after the Corps were sup posedly disbanded, details of ruthless executions kept leak ing out. The Reichstag appointed a special committee to inve stigate. But, with a few exceptions, those criminals who wer e caught fared relatively well with the reactionary German j udiciary which the Republic had allowed to remain in office. The Free Corps have had many apologists. Their chie f poet, Ernst von Salomon, declared to me that their rule of iron was necessary \"to save the men from becoming d emo- cratic weaklings.\" \"What, in your opinion, is a democratic weakling?\" I asked. \"Why, any German,\" he answered scornfully, \"who for - gets that his sole duty is to fight for Greater Ger many.\" One of the Free Corps, the Organization Consul, spe cial- ized in political murders. Its members killed Dr. M atthias Erzberger in August, 1921, and Foreign Minister Dr. Walter Rathenau in June of the following year. Erzberger w as dis- patched because he had signed the Armistice, althou gh at von Hindenburg's request; Rathenau was a Jew, albeit a very nationalistic one. Ironically enough, Rathenau was just about to announce his new conviction that another war wit h the 28"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Allies seemed unavoidable. So the Free Corps murder ers de- prived themselves of a prominent spokesman. The purely military value of the Free Corps was neg li- gible. The secret general staff knew well enough th at they were not crack units. On the half-a-loaf theory, ho wever, they felt the rough and tumble military discipline served the men better than no training at all. Second, merely to quarter one of their groups in a region was to create a center of unrest. The political lea ders within the secret staff established and dispersed these ce nters at will. Third, the Free Corps furnished, by their very natu re, a vast pool for the secret staff to draw on for any n ew military venture. And fourth, Free Corps men were invaluable from the very beginning in spiriting away the active and reserve German armaments. Thanks to them, perhaps the most effecti ve bit of juggling in the whole secret staff scheme was also probably the easiest to accomplish—the vanishing act of the German military machine. A large percentage of the guns tu rned in to the authorities were outmoded. The Free Corps men c ached parts of guns, so that an even bigger percentage of the mod- ern ones surrendered were incomplete. Whenever a cache had been discovered and its guardi ans warned in time, members of the nearest Free Corps w ould be rushed to the spot to carry away everything of impo rtance before the Interallied representatives could get th ere. The Dutchman, Fokker, in his book, The Flying Dutchman, tells how his whole airplane factory was furtively disman tled, loaded on special trains, and shipped out to Hollan d almost under the noses of the Interallied Control Commissi oners. The secret staff saw to it that the Free Corps rema ined in a ferment as a means of pressure against the Republic . For a long period all they had to do, to keep both the Re publican 29"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"leaders and the Allies in line, was to threaten a r ising of the Free Corps, by the truculent Reds, or by both. It w orked very well, indeed. Naturally the Free Corps men and their leaders had to be financed. This task was comparatively easy. M O N E Y FOR T H E FREE C O R P S Before World War I, German industry had made heavy contributions to the various organizations devoted to arousing the necessary patriotic war frenzy. Ruhr industrial ists called their special fund the Niebelungen Hort, or Niebelu ngen treasure. Lesser-ranking Germans made regular donat ions to the sundry nationalist associations. The many \"frie nds\" on whom Ludendorff's men could call were all neatly ca talogued on these membership lists. There was the Flotten Verein, with five thousand br anches all over Germany, which had worked with Admiral von Tir- pitz to promote a huge navy. The Wehr Verein had pe r- formed the same service for the army. The Kolonial Gesell- schaft agitated for more and better colonies. This trio were the most powerful and all three were closely tied i n with the Pan-German Association, whose avowed purpose was \"t o bring to life the German nationalistic creed throug hout the world.\" During the war, von Tirpitz had sought to unite all these groups into the single Party of the Fatherland. It disbanded hurriedly with the revolution, fearing action again st its branch leaders. All financial records \"disappeared. \" In real- ity they were well hidden. Shortly after the Armist ice one branch reopened—the Munich German Workers' Party, which later became the Nazi Party. The Ludendorff secret circle diverted these members hip lists to their own use. All they needed was a new s logan. This 30"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"time it was \"the danger of Bolshevism,\" which, with its twin, \"the danger of chaos,\" sprung the locks on the indu strialists' coffers. On January 15, 1919, five million marks su bscribed for an anti-Bolshevist fund made at least a beginni ng toward supporting the Free Corps. Later a sort of inverted checkoff system insured a regu- lated flow of money. Each employer paid so much for each worker in his plant. Recalcitrant employers had \"la bor\" trouble. Labor then still dreamed of socialization. Many wor kers made barely enough to support their families in the meager- est fashion. Agitators sent out to organize sabotag e or a strike had no difficulty at all. And whatever happened, it could plausibly be blamed on Communists. The Communists t hem- selves created enough trouble on their own to be su spected of guilt even in disturbances about which they knew no thing. All the employer had to do to regain peace was to p ay up. Sometimes Reichswehr soldiers or Free Corps men wer e sent in to restore quiet. After one such visitation, the employer usually learned his lesson. From then on either he or an asso- ciate paid promptly. The importance of the labor agitators hired by the secret general staff cannot be overestimated. I knew sever al German liberals who had cautiously gathered together bulky files on their activities and on the agitators sent abroad. One collec- tion was entrusted to me for some weeks during Worl d War II. Its owner wouldn't allow me to copy or photogra ph the documents but promised, when he came to retrieve th em, to let me have copies \"at the propitious moment.\" A mo nth or so later he committed suicide. The porter at his ho use told me that the shot had come \"just as the Gestapo were coming up the stairs to arrest him.\" Once in a while the Republicans succeeded in catchi ng an 31"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"agent provocateur—with a War Ministry pass in his p ocket. A protest would fly to the War Office. The officers responsible would simply evade. Further protest was acknowledge d only with an icy silence. In the end nothing would come of it. In this way, with the utmost secrecy, every industr ial plant in Germany developed its own plant cells which co-o perated directly with the militaristic German leaders behin d the backs of the labor unions. Thorough as was the system of voluntary and forced levy- ing of money from the industrialists, its plan and execution constituted but one phase of the economic preparati ons for war organized by experts working with General Luden dorff and his reactionary associates. ECONOMIC B R A I N TRUST FOR F U T U R E WAR It was, oddly enough, Air Minister Goering who inad vert- ently dropped the crumbs along the trail I later fo llowed. We sat at lunch at a party given for him and his fianc ee, Emmy Sonneman, by the Foreign Press Club of Berlin. Goer ing was full of his plans for the new German air force, who se exist- ence he had publicly revealed only a few days befor e. \"From now on,\" he said, \"you in America will never be able to catch up with us. You build a plane. If it is not satis- factory, you scrap the whole thing. We have all our parts carefully standardized. And what does that mean?\" h e went on. \"Why, when we find something wrong in a plane, we just remove that part and design a new one, which is als o stand- ardized. Gradually we reach the point where our sta ndardiza- tion speeds up production at a terrific rate. Again , we don't store away whole planes. We check the parts and sto re them separately.

Goering's manner had indicated that ign orance of such an important topic was rather shameful. I s tarted to enquire, not guessing that the woods on both sides of that path were full of danger. An officer, who had been remov ed from the War Office on the charge of being a Freemason, warned me off. \"You'd better stop asking about standardiza tion plans,\" he said. \"Those are purely military matters , and you might come to grief.\" But I found out. Der Normen Ausschuss der Deutschen Industrie, or the Standardization Committee of Germ an In- dustry, known as Dinorm, dated from the days of Wor ld War I, when German generals and economic specialists li ke Wal- ter Rathenau sought an all-out mobilization of Germ an re- sources. Firms working for the War Ministry, gradua lly increasing their power, reaching into new fields wi th their \"vertical expansion,\" agreed that to standardize th e norms of German industry would help them and speed up pro duc- tion. When the Versailles Treaty came along with its rest rictions on German armament manufacture, the standardization com- mittee didn't shut up shop. On the contrary, it spe cialized and expanded. Its job was to co-ordinate the blueprints for future German weapons and for the gauges, machines, materi als and plants required for their production. The process o f mobiliz- ing Germans plants was one of the numerous long-ran ge schemes that General Ludendorff and his associates developed step by step. Dinorm's offices occupied number 40 Dorotheenstrass e, close to the old German War Office. Under pressure of vastly increased secret work it spread out from there in a chain, each link of which shaped itself to the same end, t he perfec- tion of war preparations. One of the statistical of fices, on the Luetzow Ufer near to the present War Office, was a link. 33"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Dinorm and this statistical department were in turn joined to the Heereswaffenamt, or Arms Office for Weapons. Th e Arms Office for Weapons regulated German domestic and fo reign manufacture of munitions, the latter notably in Rus sia. Another link connected the Heereswaffenamt with the Ber- lin Technical High School, where some of the most i mportant German Research laboratories were kept running full out. I passed the Technical High School in 1940 after a big British air raid. An unobtrusive cordon of police k ept me from going near. A British dud had landed in the ne ighbor- hood and was expected momentarily to go off. That wasn't all the story. The next day I met a man who was one of the Heereswaffenamt officials, working a t the Tech- nical High School. He kept looking over his shoulde r nerv- ously, the way people do when the Gestapo is on the ir trail. His trouble was different. A sample bomb of a brand -new type, more viciously explosive than any other known and sen- sitive to the slighest shock, had been delivered to a Heeres- waffenamt building for a formal viewing by Herr Hit ler. The British dud had picked out the courtyard of the sam e building to fall in. If the thing had chosen to explode, tha t whole sec- tion of Berlin would have disappeared. But it didn' t; it was 1940 and the Germans were still playing in luck. They were after the First World War, too. To the Ge rman layman there was nothing extraordinary about a stan dardiza- tion committee being called into his neighborhood f actory to increase the working efficiency of the men and mach ines, to reduce production and repair costs.

It controlled the unofficial armed veterans of the Free Corps, who were spoiling for a fight. It controlled key positions in all universities and govern- ment offices.

Both suspected that there must be some secret obstructive group, but there was never any p roof. That is, not until it was too late. Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann, men of cou r- age and integrity, had been part of a last-minute p seudopar- liamentary cabinet with which the Kaiser had hoped to de- ceive the Allies into believing Germany a democracy . Now, they and the Socialists they headed needed time to organize a government program; but there was no time. Up unt il the last moment they were kept in ignorance of the seri ousness of the German army's plight. Meanwhile, the secret staff had three whole months in which to plan. When the time came, it was diabolically easy for the Ludendorff group to e xploit Republican unpreparedness in any way they chose. An d the time came on November 9, 1918. On that day, in their Party room in the Reichstag b uilding, the head men among the Social Democrats had been cl oseted for hours in earnest debate as to what they should do. The world had just watched the overthrow of the Tsar, h ad seen what a real, bloody revolution could be. Such a ter ror must not come to Germany. On the other hand, the Allied troops were steadily pressing the German army back, ever c loser to 36"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the German border. The Social Democrats knew, there fore, that if they did not quickly restore order, the All ies would certainly invade. But how to go about it? The Party leader, Friedrich Ebert, who had started life humbly enough as a saddlemaker, still groped for so me solu- tion combining democracy and monarchy, not dissimil ar to the British pattern. Compounding the unbearable tension among the Social ists in the Reichstag building was the knowledge that no t far away, in the Kaiser's palace, the Independent Socia lists, under Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, were maki ng the walls ring with calls for a Bolshevik Germany. In the street below, the bewildered leaders could s ee the anxious, angry crowd, now muttering, now shouting i n a ris- ing crescendo for action, but always in ceaseless m otion from the Reichstag to the palace and back again. Suddenly, secretly, word reached Philip Scheidemann that in a matter of minutes, Karl Liebknecht would appea r on the historic balcony of the Kaiser's palace and proclai m to the waiting masses the rule of a Soviet Germany. R E P U B L I C P R O C L A I M E D TO F O R E S T A L L B O L S H E V I K S Without taking time either to inform or consult his col- leagues, Scheidemann strode to the window, flung it open and hailed the surging crowd. Raising his hand for sile nce, he shouted a long exhortation to his countrymen, endin g with the cry, \"Long live the Republic!\" Thus, abortively, was the Republic born. The leaders of Imperial Germany were shocked. Or so they said. Actually, those in the inner ring were reliev ed. At least Bolshevism had been avoided. The Social Democrats were truly stunned. They had n o 37"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"tools of government ready. The difficulties facing them loomed terrifyingly large. Perhaps the most immedia te was the danger of Communism, which was quite real and n ot faked as it was later, when Hitler had to have some thing from which to \"save\" the country. Anyone who went about Berlin in November of 1918 kn ows how close the Soviets came to proclaiming their rul e in Ger- many. In the period of prerevolutionary unrest in R ussia, German agents there had been as thick as raisins in a pud- ding. They had plenty of money to spend. Russia ret urned the compliment in 1918. The Soviet agents had just as much money and a much smaller country to cover. The diff erence was that the Russians, unlike Ludendorff, failed to find a Lenin. They did find, however, the radical Independ ent So- cialists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who, w orking together, came pretty near to success. I saw Communist agitators haranguing the desperate masses in the streets of Berlin. And the people had every rea- son to be desperate. They were cold and hungry and their soldiers had fought in vain. I saw a ravenous mob s laughter a starving horse where it fell, and carry away drip ping slabs of meat. I saw half-grown rowdies attack uniformed officers, and hysterical women try to yank off their mustache s or beards. I hurried through the Berlin streets under a crossfire of Red guns on one side and Republican soldiery on the other. The workers were weary of war, rebellious at furthe r pri- vations. They wanted speedy and energetic action. T hey were promised both by the radical speakers. Friedrich Ebert realized that if the Republic were to crush the Red menace and restore law and order, he needed help. Where to find it? There was still the German army. On the night of November 10, he telephoned from his new of fice in the Chancellery to General Groener over the private wire to 38"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"High Command headquarters. The two men made a solem n compact by which Ebert promised to co-operate close ly with the High Command, and Groener pledged himself to ra nge the strength of the army back of the Republic. Confronted by famine and inflation, fighting Commun ists with the left hand and reactionaries with the right , trying to comply with Allied demands and, at the same time, t o stabi- lize the economy of a country exhausted, disrupted by four years of war, with the upper classes offering at th eir best a passive resistance, the German Republican leaders h ad every reason to be awed by the problems ahead. In solving most of them as well as they did, in even surviving as long as they did, the Republicans achieved a near-miracle. Most of them realized, even at the beginning, that it was foolhardy to continue in office men of the former a utocratic imperial regime. But they had no men trained to rep lace them. So the old appointees stayed on: in the judic iary, the judges who interpreted the law to the Republic's di sfavor; in the Reichsbank, the men who intensified and manipul ated the inflation to their own purposes; in the Finance Min istry, among others, a young man called Count von Schwerin -Kro- sigk, who later juggled the Republic's budget to pa y for secret German rearmament; in the War and Navy Offices, ene mies of the Republic too numerous to mention. Altogether the rul- ing on officials was as signal a victory for the re actionaries as the signing of the Armistice by a Republican, or Luden- dorff's \"flight\" to Sweden. Certainly, the Republicans felt, they could rely on their well-organized labor unions and their consumer and other groups. But, just as the Republicans had hesitated—question ing and apprehensive of the real strength of the pro-Bo lshevist radical elements in the country—so likewise had the domi- 39"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"nating groups in the army, navy, and industry. And what of the soldiers' and workers' Soviets growing stronger all over the country? More, which way would labor swing? The y had to find out. Hugo Stinnes, Ludendorff's friend, too k the lead. By means of careful, lengthy negotiations, he prepa red a pivotal industry-labor conference. The meeting took place on November 11, 1918, while the revolution still threa tened to engulf the country. Albert Voegler, of the United S teel Works, an arch-reactionary, and the oleaginous Alfr ed Hu- genberg, representing the Krupp works, flanked Stin nes when he received Carl Legien, the leader of the German l abor unions, and his companions. By the end of the conference, Stinnes, Voegler, and Hugen- berg knew that neither they nor their army and Junk er friends need fear the mass of German workers. Of that day's decisions which have become known, tw o are extremely interesting here. The labor leaders assured the industrialists that t hey would do everything in their power to defeat the radicals , whom they hated. The industrialists, whose war profits had mounted s o high by 1916 that General Groener had demanded their inv estiga- tion, now claimed that unless the new government pa id all the bills of the Empire quickly and in full, they could not carry on. It was a patriotic duty, the industrialists poi nted out, to provide industy with ample funds for the reconstruc tion of Germany—and before the Allies could formulate their finan- cial demands. The labor leaders were able men, sincerely proud to show what they could do to help their country. In \"recon struction,\" the industrialists had unerringly selected the perf ect psycho- logical approach. Trustingly, the labor men promise d their help. 40"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The bulk of the German people have never known that in 1918, 1920, and 1921, the Republican government had to pay out 300 million gold dollars to settle the lega l bills left owing by the army to German business concerns. This stag- gering figure is vouched for by Albert Grzesinski i n his Inside Germany. Grzesinski was, during those very years, R eich commissioner in charge of \"Liquidation of Military Affairs.\" The Republic was always overmodest, and this inform ation was tactfully mentioned only in a murmur so as not to offend the monarchists. There again the Republicans unwittingly aided the s ecret general staff conspiracy. Out of idealism, out of e agerness to consolidate their government, they tried always to conciliate the various classes in caste-ridden Germany. But th ey followed the method least likely to impress the German mind. There had been, they knew, much too much flagrant boastin g under the Kaiser's regime. Instead of making public the l amentable mess which the Imperial Government had grandly left the country as its royal legacy, the Republicans felt t hat if they concentrated on their work, the results would speak elo- quently for themselves. Instead, the result was a seeming uncertainty, a la ck of the proper self-confidence. It has often been said that had we sup- ported the Republic more strongly, it would not hav e been so timid. But I doubt whether further concessions, bey ond the considerable ones which were made, would have avail ed with the internal forces massed against the Republic.

It is, of course, dangerous to generalize about lar ge num- bers of people. There are always the exceptions, pe ace-loving German officers, industrialists, Junkers, ministers and profes- sors. Yet, on the whole, from what I saw and experi enced, I am convinced that the active elements in these sect ions of the population automatically co-operated with the secre t general staff, either openly or secretly, knowingly or unkn owingly, to prepare for a new war. The groups which sincerely hated all that the Repub lic stood for had two other things in common. First, th ey were upper-class Germans. The caste system has been brea king down gradually in more recent years, but in 1918 an d 1919, its imprint could be seen wherever one went. Most o f the Re- publican leaders were men and women of the lower or upper middle classes. Their knowledge of the minds of upp er-class Germans was limited. That was one reason why they c ould be fooled by the men supposed to be working with them. Second, most members of the inimical groups had had ac- cess to higher education, which made them part and parcel of the pan-Germanic order. To non-Germans the medieval symbolism of German uni - versities even then seemed old-fashioned and slight ly ridicu- lous. But their hold on the national mind had not l oosened, because to Germans they spoke of a Greater Germany. Both teachers and students believed fiercely in Germany' s right to rule the world. And it was certainly no part of the secret staff plan to relax the indoctrination of German youth, b ut rather to intensify it.

Not only in scholastic confines was the word spread and embellished. Many ordained men of God did everythin g they could to discredit the Republic. During its brief l ifetime, I never heard a Protestant sermon that did not contai n either a sly or an open insult to the Republic, coupled wi th a glori- fication of \"the old days, when Germany was strong. \" Through both the school and the church, then, the h ome was contaminated with a hatred of the Republic. Hat red is contagious, and when women start to hate, they do a thorough job. They also infect their children. Always after wars, when the people have lost many o f their loved ones, belief in the mystic encourages a mushr oom growth of astrologists, fortune-tellers and what ha ve you. Superstition can be an ally, and the German militar ists made it one, lining up the soothsayers as their unoffici al prophets. Everywhere one heard of the impending collapse of t he Allies, often from relatives of officers, who nearly as oft en were the mildest looking old ladies. The Germans are nothing if not logical, no matter how unsound their premises. So, the Allies divided, England tottering and on the brink of disi ntegration, logically what then?

For word-of-mouth propaganda spr eads fast, and who doesn't want to belong to a master race? Despite their need for a strong army to back them u p and to maintain law and order, some of the most promine nt Re- publicans voiced their fear of the military drift v isible in the country. They were unheeded: partly because of the dexterity of the men working with the secret staff, men like General von Seeckt and Major von Schleicher, who later also bec ame a general; and partly for a more important reason—the pan- Germanism of the vast majority of the people. R E P U B L I C U N D E R E S T I M A T E S P A N - G E R M A N D A N G E R The credo of pan-Germanism—that Germany has not merely the right but the duty to rule the world—had per- meated the nation much more thoroughly than the Rep ubli- cans knew. Whereas before World War I pan-Germanism en- joyed its main strength among the upper classes, it now had seeped down through the humbler folk, leavening the ir lot with a feeling of at least racial superiority. Among the few papers which the Gestapo allowed me t o take out of Germany in 1941 is a reprint of the by- laws of the Pan-German Association of May, 1898. Reading th em, one can hardly tell them from Nazi pamphlets. Even some archaic words which are used in the by-laws reappea r in Nazi terminology: the word Gau, meaning district, for on e. And the Pan-German Association was no local affair. It had branches in a great number of cities throughout the world, for the purpose of seeing that Germans abroa d re- mained useful to the Fatherland. This network had o nly to be enlarged and perfected by the Nazis when they came to power. Within Republican Germany, pan-Germanism was the ab ra- cadabra of the secret general staff.

Then, the militarist s on the secret staff belonged to a caste which still exerci sed very special prerogatives, enforced by its own tradition s. And even before the war, close friendships had spru ng up between many of the ranking officers and their coun terparts in industry and politics. It is no secret that the Reichsverband der deutschen Industrie (National Association of Ge rman In- dustry) has long been fully as pan-German as the Ge rman army or the Nazi Party. In 1918, therefore, these same men easily drew clos er to- gether, tied sometimes by common background, oftene r by common education, common aspirations, common creed, com- mon hopes, and common disappointments. Together the y had pulled through many a tight place during the course of the war. With the war lost, there was no need for lengt hy meet- ings to decide what they should do. Their minds ran in the same channels. Comparatively few plans and instruct ions con- firmed each man in his place and function. This identity of purpose extended far outside the a ctual membership of the secret general staff, and resulte d in many bizarre situations. Perhaps the strangest concerned one activ- ity of the reactionary judiciary. When a man report ed to the authorities the discovery of a cache of arms, as wa s his duty as a citizen, who was brought to trial, the man who found the arms? Or the lawbreaker who had hidden them? Why, t he informer! Furthermore, he was often tried for treas on to the state. Always the coloring of the joint purpose was milita ry.

President Ebert and his fellow government heads had forced through a vote calling for the election of a German Constituent Assembly on January 19, 1919. But there was an impasse. Soldiers' and workers' Soviets had sprung up in the army, navy, and all over Germany to try to direct t he course of the revolution along more radical lines. In Hamb urg, a soldiers' Soviet demanded that the army and navy be con- trolled by peoples' deputies under the Executive Co uncil; further, that as proof of the end of militarism, of ficers be \"forbidden to wear epaulettes and the old insignia of rank.\" SHOWDOWN B E T W E E N HIGH COMMAND AND S O L D I E R S ' S O V I E T S The High Command welcomed the chance of a showdown with the soldiers' Soviets. At von Hindenburg's ord er Gen- eral Groener and Major von Schleicher, in full regi mental regalia, went to Berlin. They were hissed as they a lighted at the station, and again when they stood before the g ates of the War Ministry demanding entry. The sentry barred the ir way. A few civilians detached themselves from the crowd. Major von Schleicher shouted at them, \"Arrest this man!\" The plain-clothes men arrested the sentry for \"resi sting orders\"! The army already had power enough to maint ain secret-service men on duty to protect its officers. In the Chancellery, General Groener and Major von Schleicher confronted the leaders of the Republic. They threatened that unless the Republic supported their right to wear their insignia and epaulettes, they would with draw the communications officers directing the return of the troops from all parts of Europe. It was December 20, 1918. What man in Germany would want to be blamed for a single sol- 46"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"dier failing to arrive home for Christmas? The thre at worked; the epaulettes were forgotten. Years later, Groener told me he thought such marks of rank were unimportant. \"And I thought so in 1918,\" he said. \"But in those days we could not allow anything to w eaken our prestige. We had to keep the Germans aware of t he im- portance of officers and their rights.\" Groener, however, was an honest man whose sincerity in co-operating with the Republic he later demonstrate d beyond question. But his aide, Major Kurt von Schleicher b elonged to Ludendorff's secret general staff. Von Schleiche r utilized the time he spent in Berlin as Groener's aide in lo ng confer- ences with former comrades in key positions, organi zing the whole set-up by which the military leaders could di rect the nation's affairs right from the Chancellery, withou t the Re- publicans knowing. He arranged that some of these m en be- came liaison workers between the Chancellery and th e War Office. One of them was Oberleutnant Plank, who lat er be- came a power in the president's office. Von Schleicher saw too much evidence of growing Rep ub- lican strength in Berlin for his own peace of mind. Trainloads of sailors from Kiel had established themselves in a big building called the Marstall, near the Kaiser's Pal ace, grimly determined to guard the Republic they had helped to create and for which so many of their comrades had lost th eir lives. THE B A T T L E OF C H R I S T M A S It was not for nothing that the secret staff had ke pt key men in all the ministries. Without Ebert's knowledg e, von Schleicher arranged to have the sailors' pay stoppe d. The sailors had earned their pay and they meant to have it.

At the same time a Socialist dep uty named Wels was taken to the Marstall as hostage. Ebert's group negotiated with the leader of the sailors, while in a back room a minor official rushed to the secret telephone lin e, still undis- covered, by which Ebert had reached the High Comman d wherever it had happened to be. Now, in Kassel, General Groener took the frantic ca lls and, in no more than a few seconds, had ordered the Berl in gar- rison to free the President and his government from the hands of the Naval Division. The officers of the Corps Le quis, hid- den in secret quarters about Berlin, were delighted . This was their chance to crush the Republic's forces and to resume command in the German capital. Equipped with flame- throwers and heavy guns, the Corps Lequis moved eag erly through the Tiergarten toward the Chancellery. The sailors saw them coming, through the library wi ndows, saw that the field-gray troops far outnumbered them . They be- came alarmed. Ebert promised he would hold the Corp s men in check, and the sailors withdrew from the Chancel lery. But the deputy, Wels, was still a hostage in the Ma rstall. All through the night the government leaders confer red. Gen- eral von Scheuch, the former war minister, still he ld the job. He stood there now like a figure carved of stone, w aiting for orders to storm the Marstall, for restoration of mi litary power in Berlin depended on the decision made that night. Ebert knew that if he gave the order for the attack , there would be much loss of life and the masses would fee l he had betrayed them. But how could he forsake Wels?

General von Scheuch was to storm the Marstall in the morning. A few hours later, other Socialists rushed to the C hancel- lery to say that a compromise with the sailors was possible.

At eight o'clock in the morning, December 24, an ar my lieutenant stood before the Marstall with his troop s, demand- ing surrender. His demand was rejected. The battle was joined. The sound of the guns could be heard all ov er Ber- lin. Heavy artillery was brought up and used agains t the Marstall.

The High Command an d the militarists had scored their first military victory over the Re- public—on Christmas Eve. The soldiers had fought badly, however, and Major v on Harbou rushed to Kassel to report to headquarters. When he had finished, one of the officers said, \"There's no use going on. Let us dissolve the High Command and go home to our families, as our soldiers are doing.\" From among the group a young major jumped to his fe et \"The fight has just begun!\" he shouted. \"From now o n we shall have new, devoted troops in our hands—the vol unteers.

He finis hed with an impassioned protest: \"It would be a disgrac e to give up because of one setback!\" His comrades, electrifi ed, jumped to their feet and gave him an ovation.

General von Ludendorff was back' in Germany by Febr u- ary, 1919, although no one except his cronies knew his where- abouts. He was discovered to be playing possum in t he Adlon Hotel, in the same building with most of the Allied diplomats and officers on duty in Germany, all of whom were a nxious to find him. The Ludendorffs had tucked themselves away in a sui te of a separate wing with its own private entrance on th e Wilhelm- strasse, which was guarded by heavy iron doors and manned by detectives and porters. More than once I bribed my way into this wing. A can of sardines or a few American cigarettes would induce a friendly porter to look the other wa y while I slipped inside and sped toward the Ludendorff salon . I cor- nered the general several times but he was determin ed not to talk. An onlooker would have been amused to see me firing questions at the stony-faced general while he tried to walk away as fast as possible without actually breaking into a trot. It wasn't funny to me. Everybody knew Ludendorff wa s up to something, but what? I recognized a lot of his v isitors, however.

They would s tride along to one of the little Weinstuben in Berlin to meet o ther \"friends\" who, for some reason, did not dare go to the Adlon —high and minor officials, professors, and presiden ts of every kind of club, all eager for instructions. I had lived in Berlin for quite a while, and there would always be someone to report the general's mysteriou s meet- ings to me. THE F I R S T S K I R M I S H In order to know the enemy's approximate strength, one must test it. The militarists found the young Repub lic stronger than they had expected in their first skirmish—over the sign- ing of the Versailles Treaty. Some of the militarists still held that—with luck a nd a few weeks of rest—the German forces could stand up agai nst the Allies on Germany's western border. Field Marshal v on Hin- denburg sided with them against the Treaty; he went on to advocate a fight to the finish in the face of certa in defeat, rather than accept a dishonoring peace. The militar y realists knew that indeed they must lose, and losing, suffer annihila- tion of the officer corps and the framework of the army, both of which must be saved if Germany was to remain a b ig power. At a stormy session of the commanding officers of t he army, General Groener stood up in the midst of the icy hatred of his fellow officers, reminding them that the gov ernment's failure to sign the Treaty would certainly entail f urther loss of life, and that Germany needed the whole of her r emaining manpower to found the army of the future. General von Luettwitz, chief of the Berlin garrison and sev- eral Free Corps, who headed the movement against ac cepting 52"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the Treaty, presented an ultimatum to the governmen t, de- manding among other things that the officer corps b e given a voice in matters of state. But the parliamentary sy stem was beginning to work in Germany, better than many had ex- pected, and the leaders of the young Republic had t he courage to stand firm. In July, 1919, after the signature of the Versaille s Treaty, General von Luettwitz and his sympathizers tried to seize power. He made a rabble-rousing speech, calling for a levee en masse, a general rising of the people against th e govern- ment. His fellow officers and his soldiers cheered. The popu- lation just ignored him. The German people didn't l ike the Versailles Treaty, but they wanted war even less. Any militarist, any pan-German, retreats when the r esist- ance against him is found to be too strong. General von Luett- witz accordingly called back his plotters and decid ed to bide his time. And he could afford to wait. For the Reichswehr, cr eated by the Republic, was run by reactionary officers un der the extraordinarily efficient General Hans von Seeckt. Theoreti- cally, von Seeckt took his orders from the Defense Minister, Gustav Noske, but von Seeckt managed him with an ad roit combination of flattery and trickery. By the beginning of 1920, when Germany still had a con- siderable unofficial army hidden away here and ther e, the Ludendorffs had moved just around the corner from t he War Office, to the elegant, discreet Victoriastrasse. T his was a con- venient rendezvous for the officers of the Reichswe hr Ministry —including General von Seeckt. The Ludendorff house , con- sequently, bulged with conspirators. Frau Ludendorf f objected strenuously to the number of ladies who came to see her hus- band, but he explained that they were all \"working for the German cause.\" 53"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Meanwhile, the Republican police had begun to grow sus- picious of Ludendorff. When von Seeckt became his i ntimate, it was clear that they would both bear watching. Bu t, for the time being, all that the police could do was watch. They couldn't prevent the reactionaries from launch ing a campaign of anti-Semitism, flooding the country wit h leaflets demanding, \"Germans, are you happy, are you free?\" And answering, \"Only the Jew is free and the German is his fet- tered servant!\" One group published a biweekly anti -Semitic paper, the Voelkischer Beobachter. The monarchists and the pan-Germans found the Jews convenient scapegoats fo r all past and present wrongs. By February, 1920, the militarists in the Defense M inistry were all set for a declared war on the Allies. The United States, France and England, they felt sure, would n ot dare send troops into Germany because of possible contam ination by the well-advertised Bolshevism. General von Seec kt had sent special emissaries to Moscow and thought that the Soviets would prove \"friendly\" to Germany. But he left the active leadership to Ludendorff, von Luettwitz, and Captai n Ehr- hardt of the famous Ehrhardt Brigade. He did not da re endanger his position in the Reichswehr and give th e govern- ment an excuse to supplant him with a loyal Republi can. THE K A P P P U T S C H During the night of March 12, the Republic found ou t how few of its ranking military collaborators could be depended on. Ehrhardt's Brigade, in Camp Doeberitz, had been ordered to disband. They had responded with an ultimatum. O n that March night, there was a conclave of Republican lea ders and army chiefs. The High Command, which had been at such pains to i n- gratiate itself with Gustav Noske, froze into Pruss ian stiffness 54"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"when Noske requested the army to step in and crush the mutiny. \"There can be no question of making men of the Reic hs- wehr fight against men of the Reichswehr,\" said Gen eral von Seeckt in his harsh voice, thus in one sentence inc orporating the Ehrhardt Free Corps into the Republican army. V on Seeckt's fellow officers rallied to his support and glared at Noske. All but two, kindly General Reinhardt and Ma jor von Gilsa. In his ultimatum Captain Ehrhardt stated that his t roops would be at the Victory Column in the Tiergarten at five o'clock that morning to accept the government's cap itulation. At five o'clock Ehrhardt and his men were there. Ge neral Ludendorff stood on a corner near the Victory Colum n and watched them march through the gray dawn into the h eart of the city. But the government had gone. A few hours earlier, t aking labor union leaders with them, they had left the ci ty by car for a secret destination. For a whole day Ludendorff, Ehrhardt, and the \"dict ator\" they had picked out thought they had won. With a mi litary government, possibly recognized by the Allies, they could start a new war. Troops filled the streets around t he govern- ment buildings. Most of us who were in Berlin in those days were so used to seeing guns drawn up Unter den Linden that we th ought there had been just one more of the many minor revo lts. Then a soldier in field gray thrust a proclamation into my hands. It was a bold announcement of the conquest o f power in Germany by a Generallandschaftsdirektor, a provi ncial district director by the name of Kapp. Kapp was a nobody from East Prussia, plucked out of the air by General Ludendorff as a front man. Despite t he assur- 55"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ances of peace in the proclamation, I felt sure the re was trouble ahead. I tried to turn into the Wilhelmstrasse to find out what was going on. Grim-faced sentries stopped me. They poin ted to signs behind barbed-wire entanglements that read, \" Whoever goes farther will be shot.\" The soldiers sneered at my passes. I insisted on se eing one of their superiors. It was my job to get behind tha t barbed wire as fast as I could. The officer was affable. C ertainly the American press was welcome. Could he escort me to t he new press chief? We walked toward the Chancellery throu gh a street full of tents and field kitchens, like a mil itary camp. Opposite the Chancellery, the Palais Prince Leopold , which later became the Propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goeb bels, looked like an ant hill, with men in field gray, ci vilians, and women of the Junker classes scurrying about. The press chief's room was quiet enough. A dark man , who introduced himself as Trebitsch-Lincoln, was pl eased to announce the birth of the new Germany. I was assure d of cable service for whatever I cared to send—as long as it met with his approval. Trebitsch-Lincoln, I learned, ha d been a star spy in the war. I went back to our office in t he Adlon. I found the Hotel Adlon in an uproar. I had a tip t hat the labor unions were on the verge of calling a general strike. From the office I managed to get in touch with a fe w Republi- can leaders. They confirmed it. A general strike wo uld \"show the world how strong the German Republicans are.\" A nd it did. The Republican workers saw to it that the gas and elec- tricity, the water services, the street cars, and t he railroads stopped functioning. All the shops and factories cl osed. No food could be found. Hotel service ceased. The tele phones went dead all over Germany. To get my calls through , I cooked up a mysterious disease, making it necessary to con- 56"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"sult various doctors to save my life. Everybody I c alled an- swered to \"Herr Doktor\" and exchanged bulletins wit h me in a wonderful mumbo-jumbo of medical terms. But it wasn't long before Kapp and his backer, Gene ral Ludendorff, were the patients, and very sick men th ey were. for their friends in the Defense Ministry—who had b een so warmly encouraging before the putsch—now coldly ref used to co-operate. The realistic von Seeckt had seen th e whole Ger- man people back the government's call for a general strike. Obviously, no man can send out a few squads and sho ot the ringleaders if it is the whole nation in rebellion. He retreated from the responsibility of arch-conspirator, to wai t for an- other day. But Ludendorff and his pathetic figurehead, Kapp, s tub- bornly continued to believe the Allies would streng then their position. The very clique which had so passionately de- nounced the \"abysmal wickedness\" of the Treaty now just as passionately hoped for succor from its perpetrators . Rumors, bulletins, and reports filled the air. The National- ists intensified their anti-Jewish pressure; the Co mmunists added to the general turmoil by a mighty effort to overthrow Friedrich Ebert and the Socialist labor unions, whi ch to them symbolized bourgeois conservatism. \"Rise to arms!\" they cried, \"Fight for dictatorship of the Soviets!\" Som e workers obeyed: the Red groups and the Free Corps clashed a ll over Germany. Those stormy days of early 1920 thus contained an o dd paradox. In February, General von Seeckt was ready to go to war against the Allies, hoping to have Russia fo r a partner. In March the Kapp Putsch, which von Seeckt's collea gues had brought about, placed men in the Chancellery who ne eded support from those same infamous Allies to stay in power. It took a great many years and infinite patience to establish 57"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"the background of these strange events. I could not take the account of just one man, no matter how much he was sup- posed to know, but talked to many men who had parti cipated, and pieced all their stories together in relation o ne to the other. Following this method, comparing notes with intimates of von Seeckt and of Ludendorff, with Republicans o f the dif- ferent factions, I arrived at the conclusion that b oth attempts were the work of the same militaristic groups, alar med at in- creasing Republican strength. For if the Republic w as al- lowed to bring them peace and prosperity, the peopl e would refuse to go to war again. Where Ludendorff and Kapp got the idea that the All ies would side with them is a mystery. Of course, the E nglishmen and Americans on official duty in Germany at the ti me con- sorted with a great many of the conservatives who p layed the international society game. Therefore Ludendorff's group un- doubtedly felt that the Allies would prefer to deal with con- servative (reactionary) leaders than with the \"prol etarians of Ebert's government.\" And they gave fulsome promi ses to better the reparations payments. But the Allies wer e not im- pressed. Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, who had been German f or- eign minister during the Versailles negotiations, h ad the courage to break the news. He told me later that he had cor- nered Kapp in the Chancellery, where Ludendorff was beg- ging the little man to order out the soldiers again st the strik- ers endangering the regime. \"It will cost some live s,\" said Ludendorff, \"but the end justifies the means. And w e can count on our friends in England.\" Brockdorff-Rantzau interrupted. The English were no t be- hind them, he said, and added that the British char ge d'af- faires in Berlin, Lord Kilmarnock, had just told hi m that any 58"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"such claim was a \"sacre mensonge,\" in other words a damned lie. That got the two gentlemen. Kapp fled to Sweden. Lu den- dorff fled too, but only to Bavaria, hoping that th e Republic would again be generous. He was right. When President Ebert and his associates returned fr om Stuttgart, where they had spent the days of the Kap p Putsch in the tower of the new railroad station guarded by volunteer soldiers, they relied once again on the golden rule . This was all very well as a matter of personal virt ue. By refusing to punish the conspirators, they hoped to restore harmony to the country. But what they actually acco mplished was to arouse resentment in the masses of Germany, who had suffered great hardships in the general strike. Onl y a few officers were cashiered. Furthermore, in many parts of Ger- many, officers persecuted the soldiers who had resi sted the Putsch. Protests in the Reichstag proved vain. Noth ing was done to protect the loyal Republican soldiers. The confidence of the masses in their leaders waned, along with th e prestige of the government. Both the officers and the men of the Free Corps fel t their contempt for the Republic doubly justified. What so rt of weaklings were these, anyway, who sought to rule Ge rmany? I saw one demonstration of that contempt on the par t of the frustrated troops under Captain Ehrhardt, as shocki ng an example of ruthlessness as can be imagined. The Ehrhardt Brigade, with its commander, was allow ed to march out of the city after the Kapp Putsch in r egular mili- tary formation. I hung out of a window in the Hotel Adlon to watch them go by. As the rearguard rounded the c orner from Wilhelmstrasse into Unter den Linden, they rai sed their rifles and without hesitation fired point blank int o the hun- dreds of unarmed civilians on the sidewalks. As a r esult of 59"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"that action which took, in time, only a few minutes , the Adlon lobby was filled with the dead and the wounded. The next day I was alone in the office when a dark man with a beard came in. He took off his hat and removed th e beard and asked if I recognized him. It was Trebitsch-Lin coln. I had seen notices in all the papers stating that he was to be arrested on sight. He asked me to tell one of my co lleagues to meet him at the Fuerstenhof Kaffeehaus during the n ext hour. He had hardly left when a police detective arrived, pulled out his badge, and demanded to know where I had hid den Herr Trebitsch-Lincoln. I told him to look around. Would money help me to remember where the gentleman might be found? I told the man to get out, fast. He made up for it some months later with a tip on a story we were investigating, \"to apologize for his insult .\" It was also a hint as to how closely the authorities obser ved our ac- tivities. As for Trebitsch-Lincoln, he eventually escaped; th e last I heard, he had become a monk in a Buddhist monaste ry in China. Somebody has suggested that he might be ther e as an advance agent for the German fifth column. The Kapp Putsch of 1920 provided an important dress re- hearsal for the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, and for t he men who were to become notorious as Nazis. While the Kapp Putsch had collapsed and had taken w ith it as an aftermath a measure of the government's pr estige, the secret general staff realized the need for greater steps really to undermine the Republic. The financial section of the staff decided to speed up inflation. Then the propaganda wing could direct the people's resentment over their mou nting dis- tress against the Republic and the victorious Allie s. 60"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"D I V I D E ET I M P E R A One of the reasons why General Groener had insisted that Germany accept the Versailles Treaty in 1919 rather than risk another war was the fear of the French wish to split Germany into small states, along the old Habsburg p rinciple of \"divide and rule.\" To lose a fight-to-the-finish war would certainly mean the secession of the Rhineland and t he Catho- lic states, which had their own separatists. But as month after month of inflation aggravated th e suffer- ing of the people, the country seemed almost ready to disinte- grate of itself, without any pressure from outside. If the peo- ple were to find unity again, it must be the magic unity of facing a common foe. Why not, the secret circle wondered, entice France into do- ing something that to the German people would make her appear their common national enemy? England and the United States were already following the German pro pa- ganda red herring: that France was insisting on unr easonable demands to crush poor, helpless Germany. Reliable w itnesses have since stated that German industrialists delibe rately cur- tailed their reparations deliveries of coal and woo d to France, precisely in order to goad the French to action. Ge rmany had plenty of both materials; she just didn't send what she owed. Like so many German ruses, this one worked to perfe ction. The exasperated French and Belgians marched into th e Ruhr. Their Allies grew cool, the German factional fricti ons dis- solved in the need for a solid front. With the Soci alists and the nationalists pulling together on the same team, the Free Corps achieved the dignity of open recruitment and of joint training with the Reichswehr to point the men for a ctive com- bat with the French. Then came the compromise, reac hed through the clever negotiations of Chancellor and F oreign 61"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Minister Gustav Stresemann and the wide esteem he e njoyed among the Allies. The German militarists found themselves, however, w ith trained troops on their hands at the peak of a well -cultivated patriotic frenzy. What to do with them? There were a few Communist outbursts to fight in Hamburg, in Thuring ia, in Saxony, but not enough to keep all the troops busy. To some of the leaders it seemed like a fine time to get ri d of the hated Republic, especially to the Black Reichswehr groups in Ba- varia (which was then run by a reactionary governme nt any- way), to General Ludendorff, and to his pupil, Adol f Hitler. Moving in the nimbus of the general, the former lan ce cor- poral had succeeded in welding together the three b iggest, most militant nationalistic organizations into one body under his orders. On September 25, 1923, they had proclai med him their \"Fuehrer.\" Now they were ready to strike. Neither Ludendorff: nor Hitler realized at the time , how- ever, that the Ruhr crisis had strengthened the Rep ublican government, not weakened it. General von Seeckt had seen how zealously the Republican leaders had labored fo r Ger- man unity, and how the labor unions had fought the French in the Ruhr as fiercely as had the Nationalists. Th ere was henceforth no reason why he and his associates coul d not work with the Republicans. Then, too, the Bavarian authorities had compelled t he local Reichswehr to transfer its allegiance from the nati onal gov- ernment to the Bavarian state. As a result of this and the general Bavarian unrest, the Republicans had come t o the point of empowering von Seeckt to declare martial l aw. The High Command would then openly control direction of all military forces. It would be able to discard useles s elements and build the rest into a healthy foundation for th e future German Army. In addition, the Fehme murders and the other 62"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"unsavory scandals implicating the Free Corps had mo re and more often assailed the nostrils of the old-school, meticulous military leaders. So when Hitler and the lesser Mun ich plot- ters sought support from army headquarters in Berli n, they got cold-shouldered. THE B E E R H A L L P U T S C H This rejection made General Ludendorff and his prot ege, Adolf Hitler, all the more frantic to act. Under th e pretense of organizing \"field exercises,\" they summoned their s oldiery to Munich for November 10. Two days before, Hitler sen sed a certain distrust among the Bavarian conservatives. He de- cided not to wait for his reserves to arrive from t he Bavarian mountains and the small town beerhalls, but to seiz e power in a surprise-and-bluff attack. State Commissioner von Kahr had called the small businessmen of the district togeth er in the Buergerbraeukeller, a Munich beer hall, for a lectu re on eco- nomics. What could be easier, thought Hitler, than to sur- round the place with the available Storm Troopers, win over the men inside and move on to the government buildi ngs, pursuing the Kapp Putsch technique? That is what happened, or almost. Hitler, attired i n a Prince Albert coat, brandishing a pistol, proclaime d the rev- olution to the three thousand astonished burghers, and took State Commissioner von Kahr, General von Lossow, an d the police chief, von Seisser into an anteroom. There, while Goering soothed the crowd in the main hall, Hitler outlined the form of the new government in which each of the m was to have a fat job under his orders. They remained impa ssive. Then he started to plead with them for their co-ope ration and ended, to their disgust, with an hysterical threat to commit suicide if he failed. In the meantime, General Ludendorff, who hadn't kno wn 63"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"of the change in schedule, was hastily summoned fro m his villa in near-by Ludwigshoehe. And while he tried t o per- suade Commissioner von Kahr and General von Lossow to join forces with Hitler, Reichswehr officers on dut y in Munich heard about what they called the \"Wild West scene\" in the Buergerbraeukeller. They promptly reported to Gener al von Seeckt in Berlin. The general entertained quite different feelings ab out the Munich putsch and the Kapp affair. After all, the e arlier ef- fort had been the work of fellow officers, of gentl emen. Who was Hitler, except a rather dubious political frien d of Luden- dorff's? Besides, the Republic had just given von S eeckt the power to proclaim martial law, had entrusted, in ef fect, its safety into his hands. General von Seeckt informed the Mu- nich Reichswehr officers that he could not tolerate insubordi- nation of any kind. Back in Munich, in his beer hall, Hitler was told t hat Reichswehr soldiers had refused to surrender to his men. He rushed off to the barracks. Immediately Commissione r von Kahr and General von Lossow clicked their heels, sa luted General Ludendorff, and went off to fight the Putsc h. Hitler and Ludendorff waited desperately for Berlin to order the Reichswehr to support them. It was nearly dawn. Emissaries were rushed to the barracks; they were a ll im- prisoned. However, the provincial reinforcements wo uld soon begin pouring into town. The Nazi chiefs deter mined to go ahead and take over the government buildings. Ge neral Ludendorff volunteered to lead the Storm Troopers. His pop- ularity with the Reichswehr men and with the police , he felt, would keep them from firing, induce them to join hi s side, and allow the coup to succeed. But the police did fire. The brave Nazis scattered in all directions. The one hero of the moment was Ludendor ff's 64"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"orderly, who, by throwing himself in front of the g eneral, died of the bullet meant for his superior. Ludendor ff marched straight ahead, and in the end was arrested by the police. Hitler, who had talked so glibly about heroism and suicide only the night before, rushed to one of the Nazi ca rs and fled to the suburban home of the American-born mother of his friend Ernst Hanfstaengel. While Hitler and company had failed in their Putsch , they had actually won a significant victory in having ke pt them- selves all in one piece. The militarists, of course , had gained immeasurably by preserving the Republic in the cris is. By running the country under martial law for five m onths, they were able to camouflage their military centers more care- fully. They utilized their new power to weed out Re publicans they distrusted from the army. The pacifists carrie d on a press campaign denouncing the machinations of the m ilitary. Their warnings were not believed. General von Seeck t suc- ceeded in re-establishing quiet, partly because inf lation had ended, and partly because even the enemies of the R epublic were eager to show the Dawes committee how deservin g and trustworthy they were. Most important, the German people were once again r e- minded of the value and power of the army. So, indeed, was the Republic. When President Ebert asked General von Seeckt if the Reichswehr were loyal to the Re- public, the general replied, \"The Reichswehr is loy al to me.\" I admit that I didn't hear him say those words, but later when I asked him about the truth of the report, he said, \"Yes, it is true. And I would be ashamed of my ability as a lea der if it Were not.\" 65"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"I N F L A T I O N ON THE HOME F R O N T After the failure of the Kapp Putsch, when General Luden- dorff said to Karl Helfferich of the Finance Minist ry that he feared the German people wouldn't fight another war , Helf- ferich gave him a typically cynical reply. \"Let the m suffer a little longer,\" he said. \"When they feel the full brunt of inflation, they will start hating. And we shall see to it that their hatred is concentrated on the Republic, on th e Jews, and on the foreigners.\" This conversation was related to me by a witness to it, the Secretary for State in the Reichsbank, Herr Brinkma nn. Dur- ing the inflation he had sworn all kinds of oaths t hat only wicked foreign forces and speculators were breaking German currency. But during the Hitler regime, Herr Brinkm ann proudly stated at a reception for some American bus inessmen that he and his official colleagues had deliberatel y accele- rated inflation. He told us what a thrill it had be en to smuggle currency into the Rhineland, from where it automati cally spread to foreign countries. But to the leaders of the Republic, the financial e xperts leagued with the secret general staff said that inf lation need not necessarily be disastrous, it could in fact be eminently beneficial. Controlled inflation, they pointed out, would wipe out the huge internal debt left behind by the imper ial govern- ment. This goal was achieved. While the Allied nati ons stag- gered under the load of war debts, Germany freed he rself of them—at the expense of her people. The British member of the Interallied Council, Gene ral J. H. Morgan, in his book The Present State of Germ any, pub- lished in 1923, speaks of the economic-military man ipula- tion of inflation in Germany. He characterizes it a s \"utter callousness to the suffering of the individual,\" an d continues, 66"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"\"Never since the worship of Moloch have so many vic tims been sacrified on that altar of 'the state' which G erman phi- losophers have sought to idealize as a kind of myst ic expres- sion of the 'general will.' There is a mark fodder, just as there is a cannon fodder.\" Turning the financial security of the German people into \"mark fodder\" achieved many aims desired by the sec ret general staff. They used inflation both as a foreig n political weapon and as a weapon on the home front. Inside Germany itself, inflation, by wiping out the care- fully accumulated savings of the lower and middle c lasses, destroyed their faith in the Republic. The rich suf fered less, but even among them, the individuals who had no cha nce to speculate, or no talent for it, or who did not belo ng to the group possessing inside information, saw their safe ty swept away just as did the widow of the little greengroce r who had relied on her life's savings. Inflation wiped out Germany's wealth, but enabled t he inner ring to become richer and richer at the expen se of the people. Inflation brought disorders that discredited the Re public and made it appear unable to cope with its own popu lation. Inflation brought work to the factories that were d umping their goods on foreign markets—but the worker himse lf was paid in paper marks, and the price of essentials co ntinued to rise almost out of reach. Inflation furnished funds for the secret general st aff, since the industrialists had to ante up out of the profit s for the Free Corps and other secret military groups. Inflation made it easy for the chosen few to gain c ontrol of any industry they wanted. Hugo Stinnes, for instanc e, would pick out some promising concern and would offer a g enerous price. Say the deal went through. Stinnes would go to his 67"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"bank, mortgage some of his own property, and sign n otes for the money. Sixty or ninety days later he would pay them off in marks which, in the meantime, had depreciated in value. It was a good trick, and with it Stinnes acquired a n industrial empire before the majority of the other boys caught on. Such deals conformed to the letter of the law, but they were bound to raise the devil with the economy of the country. It wasn't long before the people of Germany, who ha dn't really had enough to eat since the middle of the wa r, found it almost impossible to buy the barest necessities. Th ey sold their shares, their mortgages or small holdings, th eir precious heirlooms. They received in return paper money whic h, within a few hours, became worthless. At one time i t took mil- lions of paper marks to buy a loaf of bad bread. Wh ile the decent Germans who had no resources beyond their wo rk or their savings were harassed by anxiety, the shady d ealers, the speculators, indulged themselves in an orgy of lice ntiousness and hysterical spending. Destruction of Germany's moral fiber, completed in Hit- ler's time, began during inflation, when mothers ha d not enough money and food to keep their children at hom e, when the aged had to beg on the streets for scraps of br ead. Yet despite their daily sufferings, the masses in G ermany clung to the hope that the Republic would bring the m better times if only they worked hard enough. And it did. But en- joyment of the prosperity which the people and the Republic achieved was to be denied them by the small compact band of conspirators who deliberately aggravated the econom ic, so- cial, and political difficulties confronting German y. Thus in 1924, after the people had resisted the Bee r Hall Putsch, after the attempt to precipitate a war over the Ruhr occupation had met with firm resistance from both t he Repub- 68"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"lic and the Allies, the militarists were compelled to make a strategic retreat. Despite the humiliation of a treaty which had prove d to everyone but the Germans that they had lost the war , despite five years of steadily accelerated inflation; despi te, further, the calculated agitation of the militaristic leader s, the people wanted no new war. 5 H I T L E R ' S S Y S T E M \"I KNOW the mistakes I made. I had to pay dearly fo r the lesson,\" a much-subdued Adolf Hitler told Gener al Lu- dendorff after his release from Landsberg, when he called on the general. Then he added quickly, \"Never mind, Mu ssolini did not succeed until his fifth try.\" This was Hitl er acting the chastened pupil to the former master—who still had his uses. Despite the difficulties confronting him, including the re- bellion of some of his followers, Hitler knew that he was infinitely stronger and better equipped than when h e had engineered the Beer Hall Putsch. During their stay in the fortress at the expense of the state, he and his fe llow pris- oners had worked hard and well, polishing up their plan to seize power from that state. Hitler's system always followed the same fundamenta l course. That system enabled him to advance in Munic h and in Bavaria, served him well in his rise to national po wer in Ger- 69"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"many, in the conquest of Austria, and on the intern ational front—where he played the big and small powers of t he world against each other and exploited their weaknesses. If we are to protect ourselves from Hitler's system we must thoroughly know his technique. There cannot be the slightest doubt that in the period of unrest and revolution f ollowing World War II, imitators of Hitler will spring up li ke toad- stools all over the globe. His method seems almost a fool- proof way to success for the man who can create eno ugh un- certainty and chaos to make a bewildered people los e all sense of responsibility and initiative. Soon after the Armistice of 1918, Hitler went to Ba varia to rejoin his regiment, possibly to be demobilized. His first step toward becoming a politician made him that low est of political tools, an agent provocateur. The army group to which Hitler returned was in a pr e- carious position. The Red Soviets (not to be confus ed with the soldiers' and workers' Soviets) were in power in Mu nich. Death and terror ruled the Bavarian capital. The ar my offi- cers had been caught unprepared, for the revolution came to Munich a few days earlier than to North Germany. Th ey had been unable to grasp the secret reins as quickly as their com- rades in Prussia, who had been better informed by G eneral Ludendorff. No officer dared show himself in Munich for fear of appre- hension or execution by the Red Soviets. Yet, if th ey were to regain power, the officers had to know what was hap pening. They picked soldiers whom they trusted, who had fri ends in the revolutionary mob—Adolf Hitler among them—and s ent these men out with orders to report. Witnesses who knew Hit- ler in those days have testified that he was in the thick of the struggle, first fraternizing with Reds, then denoun cing them. One of the officers who investigated Hitler's backg round 70"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"when General Ludendorff saw in him a potential lead er of the people, later confessed to me, \"I am one of the cri minals who made it possible for Adolf Hitler to become the mas ter of Germany. I helped whitewash him and his evil-smelli ng early activities!\" Certainly without the gratitude of the officers who used him, Hitler could not have made the jump from in- former to minor politician. As a spy, Hitler first went to the little Bierstube where the Workers' Party met. Munich, the capital of the beer -drinkers of the world, with big and little saloons all over the city, had at least one political faction in every Bierstube. All the fac- tions felt certain that they knew how to handle the problems of the day better than anyone in Berlin—a city to b e dis- trusted anyhow, since it was inhabited by Prussians , whom every stout-hearted Bavarian hates. Each little faction jockeyed for position with its neighbors, while the local leaders of the German army watched closely, intent on picking the winner for their support. One of their most gifted and daring officers, Captain Ernst Roeh m, was in Munich. With the funds of his old regimental purse, which anti-Republican industrialists replenished whenever neces- sary, Captain Roehm wanted to finance the most prom ising of the new parties to help him build up a new secret a rmy, a Black Reichswehr. In an army training course for speakers, Captain Ro ehm found Adolf Hitler. Spouting his hatred of Jews and Marx- ists, Hitler scored an instant success with his sup eriors and his comrades. He was less lucky with the Munich cit izenry, until he worked out a technique of promising everyt hing to everybody. That secured him a regular following and the springboard he needed. Already Hitler had developed what might be called h is Nietzschean technique, although he probably knew li ttle about 71"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Nietzsche. In German initiated circles, it is known as his \"als ob\" or \"as if\" formula, based on the theory that yo u must act as if you already had what you wanted. Hitler spoke to the Munich mob as if he were a great political leader. In 1940, he boasted to his aides that he had successfully us ed this tech- nique all his life. Then he ordered them to take al l necessary measures as if Germany were at war with the United States. When Hitler started out as an orator, anti-Semitism was the fashion of the day in Munich. Russian Communist s, em- ploying Russian Jews among their agitators for thei r knowl- edge of German, had made it possible for the anti-S emites to claim that all Jews in Germany were Communists. Non e was more deeply convinced than General Ludendorff, who was then directing the enemies of the Republic througho ut Ger- many. Under the influence of one of his women admir ers, Dr. Mathilde von Kemnitz (whom he later married) Ludend orff had swung from friendship with a number of prominen t Jews, Albert Ballin for example, to fierce hatred of both Jews and Freemasons. When Hitler ranted against \"Jewish Marxists,\" his s upe- riors decided that he would please General Ludendor ff. They gave him special assignments that could be used to build up a future career. The German Workers' Party assignment was one of the se. A branch of the wartime pan-German Fatherland Party , it had risen from dissolution during the revolution to resume active work in January, 1919. Adolf Hitler went the re to spy, and remained to lead. The German Workers' Party bef ore very long became the hothouse of National Socialism . It was also the proving ground for the Hitler system. 72"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE H I T L E R S Y S T E M Step One: Reconnaissance. Who had money? Who had power? Captain Ernst Roehm controlled the funds of the Black Reichswehr. The G erman Workers' Party contained a dynamic force malleable to Hit- ler's purpose. How to impose his will on the Party? Hitler was an Austrian. Austrians know all about flattery. Flattery was to be his weapon. Step Two: Flattery. The little men who ran the Workers' Party welcomed Hit- ler as a member, but they naturally wanted to keep leader- ship in their own hands. He flattered this one and that, telling them what great men they could be, if they just gav e him a little more power. He had taken care to learn thing s about each one, and used the information to alienate them from each other in his own interest. Hitler also pursued Captain Roehm with flattery. An d Roehm responded to his glowing admiration. He liked the young soldier's \"patriotic fervor and his eloquence , which, even when the grammar was faulty, stirred his liste ners.\" At first the other officers suspected that Hitler was just another homosexual friend of the captain. Then they decided he had merely enlisted the \"womanish technique\" of all-out flattery. Hitler didn't mind what they thought, as long as he got what he wanted from the most notorious homosexual in Mun ich. For Roehm possessed a keen military mind, a generou s sense of comradeship and a genius for organizing—all of w hich Hitler bent to his own advantage. Step Three: Promises. Hitler lavished promises both on the Workers' Party and on Captain Roehm. He made himself bold to create th e vast secret army and the political machine his protector wanted. 73"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"To the Workers' Party, Hitler promised many new mem bers. He kept the promise, thanks to Captain Roehm, who o rdered the soldiers and officers of his and other units to join the Party, with instructions always to side with Hitler . At first the Party leaders were delighted by the influx of new m embers. By the time they discovered the newcomers were to b e used against them, it was too late. Captain Roehm, confident that he would be able to c ontrol his protege, found Hitler's stratagem amusing. Hitl er saw to it that the Captain remained confident, at least as long as he was useful. Step Four: Intimidation. Control of the Party was not to be had cheaply. It entailed endless quarreling and threats of both political an d physical violence. Hitler united the huskiest of his friends in strong- arm squads, with orders to beat up anyone in the wa y, from hecklers in public meetings to politicians who fail ed to come to heel quickly enough. Such brutality was called \" virility.\" Sometimes denunciations and calumnies made physical vio- lence unnecessary. Even Captain Roehm, on whom Hitler built his career , learned early that his protege could become dangero us. Their first row developed over the Storm Troopers who had been recruited as part of the Reichswehr. Naturally, Roe hm wanted them under his orders. Hitler wanted them un der his own command, as a political weapon. A sufficient nu mber of stormy scenes won Hitler's point for him. Even then one of Hitler's favorite mottoes, \"Terrify them, and you r ule them,\" served him well, as it did all through his career, both at home and on the international front. Step Five: Barrage before Attack. As he wormed his way forward, Hitler was bothered b y his inability to launch the huge propaganda barrage of his 74"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"dreams. He scoured Munich until he found the poet-n ews- paperman, Dietrich Eckart, who knew all about propa ganda. He, too, longed for a Greater Germany and a man who could bring it about. When he saw Hitler entranced by his own vision of himself as a great political leader, the poet Eckart was the first to address him as \"mein Fuehrer,\" my leader. Dietrich Eckart went to work to improve the grammar , the oratory, and the education of his Fuehrer. It was a n advan- tage to the newspaper man in the little town of Mun ich to be close to an intimate of a Black Reichswehr leader w ho had enough money to procure him a newspaper of his own, as Roehm did. The paper was a weekly by the name of th e Voelkischer Beobachter. Hitler bought it a short wh ile later, partly with American dollars loaned to him by his h alf- American follower, Ernst Hanfstaengel. By March, 1920, Hitler had advanced far enough for Cap- tain Roehm to send him to Berlin by military plane together with Dietrich Eckart, to report on the Kapp putsch. The gen- eral strike had cut Berlin off from the rest of the world and the Black Reichswehr in Munich desperately needed i nstruc- tions from the secret general staff. Hitler and Eck art arrived at the Chancellery after Kapp had fled. But they me t Tre- bitsch-Lincoln, Kapp's press chief, who was scurryi ng out of town in the wake of General Ludendorff, with whom h e was to co-operate in Bavaria. Thus Trebitsch-Lincoln en tered the anti-Semitic camp—the Jew who had been a rabbi, who then impersonated a Protestant minister, who had stood f or the English House of Commons, who was last reported a B ud- dhist monk in the Bubbling Well monastery in Shangh ai. Hitler's and Eckart's propaganda campaign worked. B y July, 1921, they had succeeded in getting their fir st hold on a German group outside of Germany, by accepting the name of the Austrian anti-Semitic National Socialist Par ty. Hitler 75"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"became its Fuehrer. Most of the original members ha d either resigned or had accepted minor posts. But Hitler ha d sur- rounded himself with friends: the student Rudolf He ss, the poet Dietrich Eckart, the officer Ernst Roehm, the organizer Gregor Strasser. The Nazis worked out a Party ritual and Party histr ionics, to give the masses the circus performance which the Republic was too proud to provide. Finding bread for the mas ses, rather than circuses, demanded the Republic's whole atten- tion. While his Storm Troopers paraded, Hitler cont inued his boring from within, going from one rival factio n to the next, picking the members' brains and leaving seeds of ambi- tion and distrust. Watching his success, Captain Ro ehm took him to General Ludendorff as a potential successor to Kapp. The general followed Napoleon's principle: \"I canno t create men; I must use those I find.\" Hitler had already used the first step of his syste m on Ludendorff, by studying everything written or said about him. Using step two, he (again) glowed with admirat ion for \"the greatest man in the Fatherland.\" Hitler's awkw ardness and shyness won both the general and his wife. Step three: Hitler knew how the general deplored the lack of di scipline in Germany. He dwelt on the subject, promising that he, Adolf Hitler, would know how to restore discipline to the country. It was not yet time for the other steps. Moving up to the final stage, Hitler used every sec ret he had ferreted out of his victim in a very effective form of black- mail. He divided the man from his own friends by cl ever intrigue, malicious gossip, or sheer trickery. Ofte n the spirit of adventure, or the victim's cupidity was played u pon. If he rose to the bait, he was lost. Then Hitler moved in to take whatever he wanted. 76"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Step Six: Open Attack. Hitler first attempted his sixth step on a big scal e in No- vember, 1923, when he ordered his henchmen to seize power and compelled General Ludendorff to support him in the crisis, using him as a bludgeon against his friends . Ludendorff never recovered the prestige lost during the Beer Hall Putsch and the subsequent trial. His incr easing racial fanaticism further weakened him, until many observers forgot the tremendous work he had done to entrench his mili- taristic and industrialist associates in impregnabl e positions. But Hitler gained by both the Beer Hall Putsch and the subsequent trial. True enough, the Putsch had faile d, but it also removed Ludendorff, his potential rival, into the back- ground. Turning failure into a kind of victory, Hit ler utilized the trial to gain not merely national but world-wid e publicity. When the trial took place in 1924, the general situ ation had quieted down in Germany, following a time when every other day had provided a sensation—the marriage of the Kaiser in his miniature court in Holland, or arson, or a plot, or a minor war which threatened the peace of the wo rld. The Dawes Committee was getting under way, the speculat ors felt there was nothing more to be gained through inflati on, while the Republican leaders had steadily improved condit ions. But the story of constructive achievements always d raws less attention than accounts of freak events. To see General Erich von Ludendorff, one-time quart er- master general of the Imperial German army, forced to de- fend himself in a Republican court, together with a half- illiterate agitator, foaming at the mouth in a cold , calculated fury—this spectacle was a sensation indeed. Some of the pa- pers which were known as the \"Jewish-controlled\" se ction of the German press gave it the amplest possible space . Most of them were democratic organs, and many of their writ ers were 77"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"gifted German, Austrian, or Hungarian intellectuals of Jew- ish origin. They believed that if they reported the statements of the accused verbatim, including the exaggeration s and the boasts, they would compromise the prisoners in the eyes of the German reader. To a sensible observer, these sp eeches sounded like the ravings of madmen. These men greatly misjudged German reaction, as man y of them have done ever since, out of loyalty to German y. They entirely misunderstood German character. They under esti- mated Germany's love for her army. Ludendorff had b een one of the people's wartime heroes. Hitler stood in cou rt as the symbol of the common soldier in field gray who had fought bravely for his country. The general and the soldie r deserved to be punished for their plot against the state. A dignified ju- diciary and a perceptive press could have convinced the peo- ple of this necessity. But irony and jeers only aro used their protective instincts and intensified their latent a nti-Semitism. And the judge, who twisted every rule and law for t he benefit of Hitler, made him seem almost worthy of protectio n in the eyes of the bewildered citizens. General Ludendorff had exulted to his wife in 1918 that the Republic was already lost because it had failed to execute him and his associates. Hitler had an equal right t o triumph during the Munich trial. The judge, who was in the pay of the Republic, who had taken an oath to the Republic, di splayed such utter servility to Hitler that a Reichswehr of ficer, who had been called in as a witness, left the court in protest. And it took a great deal to make an officer resent anyt hing done in favor of any nationalist. The people's response showed the depth of their fee ling, for the fortress of Landsberg-on-Lech, where Hitler was sen- tenced as an \"honorable political prisoner,\" was fl ooded with flowers and gifts. It was a remote place, but Hitle r had a con- 78"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"stant stream of prominent visitors both from German y and from abroad. H I T L E R ' S \" U N I V E R S I T Y \" AT LANDSBERG - ON - LECH With his fellow plotters, the Fuehrer-prisoner deci ded to write down and analyze his experiences; then to wor k out in detail methods of carrying on their plan. For this latter pur- pose he summoned to Landsberg all the experts eager to co- operate in supplying the learning and technical kno wledge the conspirators needed. Gibing at Hitler's knowledge of geography years lat er, Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, \"He must hav e been very loosely educated.\" Indeed, Hitler had the litt le man's profound admiration for higher education, and his l ack of university training always ate into his soul like a canker. Strangely enough, it was probably an asset. His min d had not been submitted to the rigid teachings of German uni versities, which drill the students along prescribed channels. So Hitler was able to face every problem with a fresh mind. W hen he wanted technical or scientific knowledge, he select ed the best available man to give it to him. Then he would pick out what suited his own purposes, what could be brought into line with his own practical knowledge. After World War II had started with a triumphant se ries of German successes, the Nazi leaders who had been clo se to Hitler and the others in Landsberg talked more free ly about the work done there. Hitler, they said, had mapped out a gigantic progra m of study, starting with the world and going down the l ine to con- tinents, races, states, nations, minorities, religi ons, political parties, organizations, clubs, schools, factories, and finally reaching the individual—the male, the female, and t he child. The individual was nothing, the state was all, and they meant 79"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"to be the state. But the individual ciphers add up to the sum of the state; therefore they must learn the manipul ation of the ciphers, how they reacted to given situations, to different varieties of propaganda. Every human emotion that c ould be exploited to political advantage, from the lowest t o the finest, was to be brought into play. Meanwhile there were the other lessons Hitler had l earned, to be reviewed and applied. THE LAW Hitler had seen the canons of the law adroitly perv erted to help him during the Munich trial. If he were clever enough, therefore, he could win his victory legally. Plucki ng the ripest and biggest legal brains he could reach, Hitler acc umulated in time quite an impressive staff of lawyers, Jew a nd Gentile. Hitler didn't mind the Jews being Jewish as long as they were useful; and the Jews did not believe the Nazis real ly meant to disfranchise them—that was just \"election talk.\" Part of the blueprint for domination perfected in L ands- berg called for calculated vilification and calumny of the Re- public in the persons of its leaders. Then there wa s the money check-off from the industrialists and bribes presse d out of Jews trying to buy their future safety. How far cou ld the Nazis go without being charged with libel, blackmai l, and extortion? They needed expert legal advice. D I S C I P L I N E From Ludendorff Hitler had learned the necessity of strik- ing with a small, closely knit, well-disciplined gr oup. He learned that even a small party, if blindly obedien t to its leader, can undermine bigger factions that lack uni ty and aggressiveness. But how could he extend that obedie nce to a whole nation? 80"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Rudolf Hess, the former officer and student who wor ked with Professor Karl Haushofer at the Munich Univers ity, had induced his teacher to go to Landsberg with him and meet Adolf Hitler. The professor was rather apprehensive and so were his hosts. But Hitler had lost some of his shy ness. He started propounding his theory that \"by compelling even the hesitant to become accomplices in acts of violence, you auto- matically make them your slaves.\" Emil Maurice, the n acting as Hitler's secretary, later told of the incident. \"After Hitler had spoken, the professor got up and looked at him for a moment,\" Maurice said; \"then he smiled . We knew that from then on there was nothing the profes sor would not do for our Fuehrer.\" Developing this technique, Hitler was to involve th e entire German nation of sixty-five million people as his a ccomplices in crime. The Nazis never denied the existence of c oncentra- tion camps on their own soil; they made no secret o f crimes committed in countries conquered by the Germans—in the name of the German people. A subtler form of coerci on can hardly be conceived. It brings with it a terrifying fear of re- taliation which, in turn, acts as an incentive to f ight. Haus- hofer, the master of geopolitics, became one of Hit ler's original partners. G E O P O L I T I C S Since the Nazis would be content with nothing less than the world, geopolitics was a vital subject in the curri culum at Landsberg. For hours on end, Professor Haushofer le ctured the \"students.\" He brought other professors to help formulate new plans for the conquest of the world in peace an d in war. As Hitler's knowledge of geography enlarged, he wou ld call for Germans or nationals from the different countri es under 81"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"study, to sound out local possibilities for his fut ure expan- sion. Many of Hitler's lieutenants had been born abroad; others had useful family connections outside Germany. They pooled their news of developments. Rudolf Hess, born in Al exandria, had not reached Germany until he was in his teens; the Ger- man Balt, Alfred Rosenberg, pointed to the riches o f Russia, to the vast stretches of land that could be opened up to Ger- man exploitation; Ernst Hanfstaengel, the half-Amer ican, had studied at Harvard. He became Hitler's expert f or the United States. Incidentally, Hanfstaengel used to o ffer inter- views with Hitler at ten cents a word when the part y funds ran low. Hanfstaengel kept up a wide acquaintanceship in Ame ri- can diplomatic and artistic circles. G E R M A N S A B R O A D Rudolf Hess built up the whole organization of Germ ans living abroad. He utilized some of the branches and the ex- periences of the Pan-German Association of prewar d ays, and developed them into powerful units to further the N azi cause. Even in the early days, plenty of Germans abroad se nt in checks and presents, although at that time they cou ld have known very little about the Nazi creed. This showed the close- ness of the tie between Germany and many Germans wh o lived abroad before the Nazis started swinging them into line. R A C E Naturally, since the question of race ranked high i n the Nazi dogma, it also figured prominently in the Land sberg dis- cussions.

And questions of race or nationality cannot be sepa rated from the Jewish problem. A N T I - S E M I T I S M Anti-Semitism had provided Adolf Hitler with his fi rst real success in the barracks outside of Munich. His cosm opolitan associates remembered that just as they had met Ger mans wherever they traveled, they also met Jews. The Naz is early chose the anti-Semitic platform because, as Hitler' s first press chief, Adolf-Viktor von Koerber put it after he had separated from the Fuehrer, \"It furnishes an excellent intern ational vehicle. There is a certain measure of anti-Semitis m in almost every country of the world. By assuming leadership over the anti-Semitic movement, Hitler intended to get his f inger into every national pie throughout the world. And he was right.\" Hitler even deceived his anti-Semitic followers. Fo r many years a number of Jews held important posts in Nazi Ger- many. To mention only one—Robert Ley, in a book cir cu- lated in 1933, frankly admitted that his original n ame had been Levy, but that in view of the great services h e had rendered to the Nazi Party, the Fuehrer had allowed him to retain both the name of Ley and his post. As chief of the Labor Front, Robert Ley controlled the fate of 26,0 00,000 Germans. The book admitting Ley's racial origin van ished from circulation when the more rigid anti-Semitic l aws were issued. Professor Haushofer has a Jewish or partly Jewish w ife. If the Nazis were really as anti-Semitic as they claim , he would have been ousted. Their use of Jews does not in the least re- duce the Nazi inhumanity against Jews whom they do not consider \"useful.\" 83"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"There is another angle to anti-Semitism which the N azis have worked overtime: cupidity. By promising the sm all dealer, the unsuccessful doctor, that Jewish-contro lled de- partment stores and Jewish doctors would disappear under Nazi rule, they won the allegiance of the mediocre dealer or doctor whether his lack of success had anything to do with Jewish competition or not. P R E P A R E D N E S S When Hitler went to Landsberg, he could not know wh ether his followers and his party organization would rema in loyal to him. But he planned as if power would be his to grasp on his release. The men under his orders began the cre ation of a Nazi constitution, so framed that it included the b ones of a skeleton government able to function at a moment's notice. Special committees were formed which were to be the nuclei of future ministries, organizations and poli cing bodies, built around the key men already picked by the secr et general staff. At first all military problems were reserved for General Ludendorff and Captain Roehm. Later, as more and mo re officers secretly joined the Party, the military st aff increased. The Republic attempted to prevent the creation of N azi cells in the Reichswehr, and tried a few officers for Naz i activities, but it was too late. The Nazis had dug themselves s olidly into key positions. Hitler did not have enough specialists to fill all the of- fices of the Party government which was to become t he state. But he prepared as carefully as if he had, giving t he govern- mental plan almost as much energy as he used in wor king out his huge octopuslike propaganda campaign. 34"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"P R O P A G A N D A During his rapid rise from paid informer in 1919 to leader of a party that was winning seats in parliamentary elections only four years later, Hitler had fully realized th e astonishing power that words have over men. With this realizati on came his craving for publicity—for propaganda. He seized greed- ily on the studies of psychologists submitted to hi m in Lands- berg; on them he based his mammoth campaigns to win control, first of Germany, then of the world. The psychologists talked much about the dissatisfie d ele- ments. Hitler knew them well. He himself had been t ortured with dissatisfaction in his days of poverty. But he knew that conditions other than poverty alone bred unhappy re stless- ness. His propaganda must reach every dissatisfied person in Germany and magnify his frustrations, whatever the cause. Women seemed more brittle, more imaginative than me n. Openly the Nazis excluded them from politics, cover tly they elaborated schemes with which to exploit women. The Nazis had won the lower middle-class women of Bavaria by pledg- ing to respect the \"sanctity of family and religiou s life.\" (Their men had succumbed to promises of spoils from the future expropriation of Jews.) In their thorough qu est of dissatisfaction, they sought out young women artist s, not quite good enough to succeed alone, but glad to listen to men who told them of future wealth—when the Nazis seized po wer. They went after idle rich women, harnessed them to their evil- smelling cart of slander and intrigue, and found th em docile and useful. \"We had to reach all the dissatisfied elements,\" Go ttfried Feder, one of the fathers of the Nazi Party, told m e once. Then he realized his indiscretion and tried to cove r it up. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that among the dissatisfied there must be a 85"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"great deal of genuine talent and efficiency that ha d no chance under the Republic.\" He added sanctimoniously, \"We want every German to have a fair chance,\" He failed to s ay, \"Pro- vided he is useful to the Nazi Party.\" P E R V E R S I O N While some Nazis traded on sentimentality, others d eliber- ately turned male and female perverts into agents f or the Nazi cause. The fact that many homosexuals held high pos ts in Hitler's Party, Captain Roehm for example, made the Nazis popular with abnormal elements in other countries. Hitler was fully aware that the captain was a notor ious per- vert. I have seen photostats of letters addressed t o Hitler in 1923 warning him that co-operation with Roehm and h is clique endangered the national cause. Sworn stateme nts at- tached to the photostats said that Hitler had shrug ged off the warning as \"old stuff.\" His opponents tried to use the perver- sion in the Party against him in the early 1930's. But Hitler needed Roehm to coerce and intimidate the Reichsweh r leaders who turned refractory. By 1934, however, Hitler realized that Captain Roeh m had secured a dangerous hold on the Storm Troops and on many members of the Party. He knew himself strong enough to come to terms with the Reichswehr leaders on his ow n. So he suddenly remembered Roehm's perversion. On June 30 of that same year, Hitler personally arrested the man who had befriended him when he was penniless, to whom he ow ed much of his career, had him thrown into jail and ex ecuted. Nor was that enough. The chancellor of the German R eich ordered his propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels, publ icly to revile Captain Roehm as a pervert, broadcasting som e of the most unsavory details ever heard over a radio. 86"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"O C C U L T I S M Being convinced that he himself had strong occult p owers, Hitler directed the activities of astrologers and f ortune tellers as Nazi propaganda tools. Soon after the Putschists swag- gered out of Landsberg fortress, all sorts of small magazines cropped up on German newsstands, purporting to reve al the message of the stars, forecasting happiness for Ger many, pro- vided of course, that the local Nazi chieftains won whatever point they were fighting for at the moment. Hitler learned to draw up horoscopes and interpret them and, early in his career, he tried hypnotism very s uccessfully on the little-minded men turned Storm Troopers. Mos t of the correspondents saw him demonstrate his technique at mass meetings at the Sports Palace in Berlin. After some fulmi- nating speech, he would descend into the audience w here the Storm Troopers stood lined up w r ith their swastika flags. He would go from one to the other, grasping the hand o f each man in both of his, staring into his eyes for secon ds on end. When he moved on, the young man would stand there a s in a trance. By 1932, after a series of great internal victories , Hitler decided to try out his powers on some foreigners. I was one of twelve American and English correspondents who r eceived a telephone call from Ernst Hanfstaengel, then Hitl er's press chief, inviting us to hear some vitally important s tatement from the Fuehrer at the Kaiserhof. Hanfstaengel ush ered us into a small room and arranged us along three sides of it, carefully spaced so that we couldn't nudge each oth er. I was placed pretty far down the line, possibly because I was the only woman present, probably because I had made fun of Hanfstaengel's air of mystery. Hitler came in. Hanfstaengel introduced him to the man 87"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"just opposite me. Hitler gave him the big act, clut ching both his hands and staring into his eyes. My colleague w as a good Anglo-Saxon and he merely squirmed. I wondered what tech- nique he would use on me. All I got was a brief, ma nly hand- shake, with no fancy trimmings. Then Hitler reached one of the correspondents who w as known for his caustic wit. I stepped out of line to get a good view of the expected explosion. I could see the man 's face as Hitler went into his routine and, to my horror, tho se usually cynical eyes responded adoringly to whatever messag e Hitler was giving out. This incident is interesting in the light of the common opinion that hypnotism requires the subject' s co- operation. The Fuehrer's remarks, which had been heralded as \"vital,\" turned out to be unimportant and not worth making us rush to the Kaiserhof. Perhaps there were too ma ny skep- tics in the gathering for Hitler to become inspired . But per- haps it was worth it to him, if he gained one conve rt. Shortly afterward I asked Goering about the scene. He sighed. \"You people try to understand us with your heads,\" he said. \"We must be understood with the heart.\" I wondered how many in Germany wished that they hadn't thought \"with their hearts\" when they entrusted their lives to th e Nazis. Hitler, like the Kaiser, was certain that his missi on came from God. He made that quite clear in another inter view I had with him, when he stepped forward and proclaime d loudly, \"My will shall be done.\" I glanced quickly at Hess and Hanfstaengel, both of whom stood near by. They gazed at Hitler raptly, as though indeed the Deity had sp oken. Hitler repeated, \"My will shall be done,\" and I had no doubt that the sacrilege was deliberate.

My will shall be done.\" There have been many others who felt they were clos er to God than anyone else. The insane asylums are said t o be full of them. But these sacrileges were uttered with ful l knowl- edge by a powerful politician who commanded the loy alty of grown men of experience and standing, including Ger man officers. For quite a while General Ludendorff hims elf was impressed by Hitler's \"mission.\" During World War I I, men like General Keitel and Admiral Raeder said, with s hining eyes, \"He has a sixth sense, and it is a military s ense.\" On more than one occasion I have seen big husky men like Ernst Hanfstaengel, who dwarfs six-footers, and Cap tain Her- mann Goering, whose weight must be around 250 pound s, tremble at the mere thought of angering Hitler. Tha t was in 1932, before he was dictator of Germany. The idea o f these two specimens of masculine strength quailing before Hitler struck me as funny. \"You're so much bigger and heavier than Hitler,\" I said, \"why are you actually scared of the man?\" \"You don't understand,\" was the answer, \"he is our Fuehrer. And besides, you've never seen him in one of his attacks of fury. Anything can happen then.\" FOUR K I N D S OF REARMAMENT All through the time devoted to laying the groundwo rk for Nazi domination, Hitler worked tirelessly, strictly adhering to the counsel of the German scientists who were co aching him and his friends for the job designed by the sec ret general staff. The military experts concentrated on their p rofessional tasks. Hitler did most of the political work. To ac hieve a 89"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Greater Germany in four giant steps, that was their goal. (1) Psychological rearmament, to be followed by (2) politi- cal rearmament, carried out simultaneously with (3) eco- nomic rearmament, the whole to be topped by (4) ope n military rearmament when the time should be ripe. The Nazi cells in every factory, in every office, i n every school, reported regularly to their Party superiors , working like termites to undermine the Republic. Storm Troo pers or- ganized the men for training and auxiliary Party wo rk, while the stronger men were enrolled in the Schutz Staffe l. Training courses for future political leaders, for subleader s, for youth groups, for women, for informers; health services, cabarets, press and propaganda services, all spread the Nazi creed of German superiority to the rest of humanity and of N azis to the rest of the Germans. Superiority is indeed a gl orious feel- ing and the Germans relished it. The reasonableness of the Republic held no appeal for them. Lusty hatred dire cted against the Republic made them \"different\" and supe rior. Authority vested in Nazi Party officials, however l ow their rank, secret instructions handed down the line, mad e all of them feel the conspiratorial lure of political intr igue. Al- though conditions in Germany in the late 1920's wer e better than they had ever been, the slogans about \"fake\" p rosperity, the threats of \"imminent chaos,\" kept dissatisfacti on at fever pitch.

That was the system through which the Nazis came to domi- nate Germany—the Hitler system. NAZI F O R E I G N R E S E R V E S How was the Hitler system applied in foreign countr ies? Through many channels. There were: (1) Germans or hyphenated Germans living abroad who could be coerced into working for the Nazis. (2) Groups won to Nazi thinking by anti-Semitism. (3) Groups which fell for the Nazi claim that Nazism wa s a protection against Communism. They forgot the sto ry about the difference between Communism and Nazism, betwee n Moscow and Berlin. Answer: Moscow is colder. Add to this another, a difference in training. The Germans are more sys- tematic and less conspicuous than the Russians, the refore the danger of infiltration is greater. (4) Groups believing they could gain bigger profits by co- operating with the Germans. Juggling the currency a nd prof- fering advantageous deals to businessmen who could be use- ful helped enormously to put over Nazi propaganda. (5) Occupational groups hoping for success through Nazism. In Germany, Nazi decrees gave the state pre cedence over the individual. Abroad, they reversed the prop aganda. A mouthpiece in each group complained about the way the government sabotaged their professional interests. If they would co-operate with some (camouflaged) Nazi group , it would find means of compelling the local state to f avor them. \"You must organize,\" they were told, of course unde r some unsuspected Nazi agent. The peasants and farmers of every European country with- 91"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"in reach heard much about the superiority of the so il tiller and how under the Nazis he got his just dues in Ger many. The French farmer, for instance, is known to be a m an who never travels if he can help it. But as soon as the Nazis took over Germany, we suddenly saw French farmers' deleg ates turning up at the annual Peasants' Congress in Gosl ar. These men merely claimed to be farmers. Most of them were shady little politicians, bought for fifth-column work lo ng before the war started. Norwegians, Swedes, Arabs, Rumania ns, Yugoslavs, Dutchmen, were Pied Pipered to Germany t o the tune of \"Farmers of the World, Unite!\" Many of them either succumbed to Nazi oratory, or became paid agents of the Nazis. (6) The World War I veterans, in all countries of t he world. The veterans wanted no more wars; they wanted a las ting peace. At their conventions in the important Europe an cities, they fraternized, and they rejoiced when friendly G ermans assured them that Hitler's monumental architectural projects would take several generations to complete. Veteran s con- vened in Germany fell as hard for the German myth a s any of the starry-eyed \"Peace is wonderful\" boys and girls who traveled around dispensing fine thoughts. If one went to the trouble of pointing out indicati ons of imminent Nazi aggression, many of them would burst out, \"But the Nazis all say they love peace.\" French friends of my childhood came to Berlin in 19 38 from the veterans' meetings in Nuremburg full of ha ppiness that their sons would not have to go to war as had the previ- ous generation. I spent three days trying to convin ce them that the Germans only talked peace, that they wante d war. My friends left, sadly warning me against unwarrant ed dis- trust. Their eldest son, by far the handsomest youn g man I 92"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"have ever seen, was an officer in the Chasseurs Alp ins. He died fighting with the Free French in the first bat tle of Bir-el- Hakim. Very many veterans and professional soldiers were a t- tracted and impressed by the superlative efficiency of the German army and its officers. Then, to see an offic er corps get what it wanted without being vivisected by a parlia ment, made the Nazi system seem quite appealing to many a fore ign of- ficer whose superiors were compelled to fight for e very cent needed for maintenance, not to speak of rearming. THE N A Z I CLUB Germany has always been the country of innumerable clubs and Vereins. As soon as the Nazis assumed power eve ry single club, association, or institution in the country, w ithout ex- ception, was forced to accept Nazi supervisors or d irectors. This move was not purely a local one, for many of t hese or- ganizations had foreign connections. An example of the way the Nazi muscled in on foreig n commercial groups forms the subject of Nazis in the Wood- pile, by Egon Glesinger. He speaks in this case of the lumber business, where their tricks were only partly succe ssful. The details are revealing, for the technique applied to other trades followed the same Nazi pattern. Since it succeeded in a num- ber of instances, undoubtedly the Germans are all s et to try it again. Regularly the Germans organized big congresses to b e held in Berlin or in some famous city or spa. The m embers were superbly dined and wined. The women had their hands kissed by barons and counts, the men were pursued b y countesses and princesses apparently smitten with t heir mas- culine superiority.

But we did try to tip off our own countrymen. The result was often di sastrous. Many of those who branded us killjoys or cranks hav e since seen their sons go off to battle. The Nazis naturally did not always stand in the rec eiving line; they went to other people's parties, too. The ir delegates traveled to congresses abroad, increasing their kno wledge of foreign layouts. They were as affable guests as the y were lav- ish hosts. The bulky files of inside information procured by N azi agents cannot all be destroyed by British, American , and Rus- sian bombs. The agents can't all be killed in actio n. Nor will the pan-Germans give up the dream of German expansi on just because Germany will have suffered \"one more s etback.\" Hitler surely has more than one set of files and on e set of spies. Once you start with agents and agitators, yo u have to have others to check on them, and ultimately a whol e network of secret services. The Nazi plan has been carried out or furthered abroad by people in at least twelve major classifi- cations : (1) Organizations of Germans living abroad and affili- ated local German clubs; colonial associations. (2) Official German diplomatic representatives, consuls , military, air, and naval attaches. (3) Nazi Party representatives among the diplomats, the special espionage services of Foreign Minister von Ribben- trop, of Hitler, of Goering, of Goebbels.

Y O U ' R E IT The average American may say, \"That's very nice for the Nazis, but what has it got to do with me?\" It has everything to do with him, because the syste m has already been worked on him, and succeeded only too well— up to a certain point. The factory worker might be surprised to learn that Ger- mans employed by the German secret staff know as mu ch about his plant as he does, what machines make what , and even perhaps where he keeps his tools, or that his liking for beer can be exploited to serve the Nazi cause. At the time when unemployment ran high in this coun try, many workers were lured into taking jobs in Germany through German consulates and fraternal organizatio ns on the promise of big wages and ideal working conditions. Natu- rally, people of German origin or birth were the fi rst to accept. A lot of them came to us in Berlin for help in gett ing back to the United States—because, they said, they were unh appy, or because the German promises had been so much air. W e could do nothing for them. There was no way to know which people were being sent back by the Nazis as spies a nd sabo- teurs. Intimate knowledge of American plants and plant man age- ment has been of vital importance to the war planne rs; that's reconnoitering.

Some of the less critical Americans whom our averag e man knows very likely snapped up the lucrative contract s prof- fered by Nazi business interests. Sometimes the com mission was more than liberal. The director of an American adver- tising agency told me after the Advertising Congres s that he had never gotten such commissions anywhere, nor pro mises of such contracts. The Germans did things in a big way, he said—yes, sir! But the Nazis expected a certain \"co-operation\" for those extra profitable deals, those astonishing commissio ns. If it was not subsequently forthcoming in the way of poli tical fa- vors and friendly propaganda, they didn't hesitate to apply intimidation. Threat of arrest or exposure of the \" deals\" sometimes worked. If not, there was harsher intimid ation. All the undercover Nazi sympathizers, from Gestapo agen ts to prominent citizens, would go to work to exert disgu ised pres- sure to prepare for the next blow. Suppose our American is an investor who has loaned money to German firms. Or a small shareholder in a corpora- tion which has made loans. Whether he has ever set foot in Germany himself or not, he was certainly affected b y the numerous concessions we made to the Germans on what they owed us. The Nazis proclaimed a moratorium. Then we had to make more concessions to get any of our money ba ck. Our American had to do without a new car, or even w ithout a new roof for his home, but the Germans used the m oney gained through concessions to go into the world mar kets and buy raw materials for war. 97"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The last step of Hitler's system—the kill—didn't co me off. But the average American could not help his whole l ife being turned inside out, perhaps losing his own or his so n's life, simply because the Germans were sure that one of th ree things would happen when they declared war on us. Either w e would simply collapse, or we would burst into civil war, or we would sue for a negotiated peace. In any case, they'd hav e us. Professor Karl Boemer, foreign press chief for Jose ph Goebbels, told me, \"If America does go to war, ther e will be the bloodiest revolution the world has ever seen. T he vast majority of Americans do not want to fight.\" \"How do you know?\" I asked. \"I know,\" he said, \"because I toured the whole of t he United States.\" Boemer went on to prove his point. We were a democratic nation, weren't we? Then we must be afra id of war. Further, the Nazis were convinced that racial frictions and class hatred could be so intensified by their m en on the spot that even without war we were on the verge of blowing up. Boemer said, \"The discrepancy there between the poor and the rich is much too great. It is bound to make for an ex- plosion. And when I toured the country, especially the South, the people just loved our racial theories. When Ame rica starts slaughtering the Jews and the Negroes, the little p ogroms we had in Germany will look like nothing. The true pat riots of America feel just as we do.\" That is one time we fooled the Nazis; we didn't hav e a civil war or sue for a negotiated peace. But the Nazis ha ve fooled us for a long time.

The habit of political intrig ue is like a drug—once a man becomes addicted to it, the habit i s hard to break. No matter who is master of Germany after World War II, Hitler's Nazi ideas will still live on in some gree dy hearts within Germany and without.

We had w on; we must be generous. A lack of generosity would mean t hat we were vindictive. Quite a number of observers in Ger many warned that a new war was in the making. But the Al lies felt that since they had won, their victory was both com plete and permanent. They were also war-weary and haunted wit h hor- ror at the thought of a new conflict. Meanwhile the Germans searched out the chinks in our armor. Where they sa w weak- nesses, they made use of them. Whereas victory lull ed the vic- tors, defeat only sharpened the wits of the vanquis hed. They found weaknesses in our eagerness to forget an d make up, in our embarassment about our war hatred, in our disregard of the letter of the treaty law, which we made our- selves, in the distrust that always springs up betw een Allies, in our sympathy for themselves because we believed them to be underdogs, and above all, in our yearning for \"b etter busi- ness than usual.\" \"Hang the Kaiser,\" we had said, and with our Allies solemnly included clauses in the Versailles Treaty calling for the punishment of German war criminals. But when th e Ger- mans protested and their officers rattled their swo rds, we changed the subject. We accepted a trial of war cri minals that was no more than a farce. Our own indifference to these clauses convinced the Ger- mans that given time and a little help from their f oreign sympathizers the whole treaty could be scrapped. Un til then, they would emasculate it as quickly as possible. An d they determined that we should help them. \"Hang Hitler\" has not been heard often from us in W orld War II, yet the future will depend greatly on our c are in en- forcing punishment of the new war criminals.

But since I witnessed our mad scr amble from hate to sentimentality at the end of the last war, I am hopeful that in the long run the absence of excess emotion may advance the cause of justice. To shield a crimi nal is not Christian; it is merely to become an accessory afte r the fact. But we shall be asked to shield criminals. Hardly h ad the first tentative signs of a United Nations victory s hown them- selves when the arguments in favor of forgiveness a nd leni- ency to the still undefeated enemy assailed at the same time our eyes, our ears, and our hearts. We can scarcely avoid a concerted sympathy-offensive with the new peace tre aty. It will be much more powerful than the one to which we were subjected last time. And that was effective en ough. The minute we laid down our arms in 1918, the friends o f Ger- many and the Germans themselves went to work on our re- spect and affection for the old-fashioned, nonmilit aristic Ger- man, which he deserved, trading on our belief in th e peaceful intentions of those other Germans who deserved neit her. To atone for our days of hatred, we went in passionate ly for good works. So did the English, whose Labor groups had a n added incentive since they believed that their friends, t he Social- Democrats, were the real masters of the German Gove rnment.

O R G A N I Z E D SYMPATHY Our soldiers, diplomats, businessmen and newspaperm en in Germany in 1919 could see with their own eyes ho w thin the people were, how shabbily clad. All the Germans we met blamed the Allied blockade f or their misery. That saddled us with a feeling of gui lt, although 101"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"a blockade is a war weapon like any other, and when were war weapons ever pleasant? The Germans had done all the blockading they could, with their U-boats and their raiders indiscriminately sinking ships. That blockade wasn' t men- tioned. We were busy being tactful. But there were other causes for the German plight. In those cold winters of World War I, when Americans i n Ber- lin learned to eat crow (and the young birds are re ally not bad), the Germans were diverting quantities of thei r staples, potatoes and grain, to the manufacture of alcohol a nd other military synthetics. The population got whatever po tatoes were left over, often frozen and half rotten becaus e of the breakdown of transportation. What rolling stock rem ained in working shape was used to carry troops wherever the High Command wanted them, from Brussels to Kiev, from Ri ga to Bagdad. Strangely enough, the Imperial government h ad de- veloped railroad reserves and repair facilities aga inst war strain as little as did the Nazis later. Then there were the black markets. People who had m oney and who knew a farmer or two in the country could b uy what- ever they wanted. The rich hoarded, and so reduced every- body's rations. Much of the hoarded food spoiled fr om im- proper storage. But the German people were hungry a nd had been hungry for years. It was easier to blame outsi ders than to look for the real cause. The Jews came in for an unjust share of abuse, and above all, the \"criminal blocka de.\" Not until the late 1920's did American officers, studyi ng at the Berlin Technical High School, become aware of the e xtent to which foodstuffs had gone into industrial war ex ploitation. Then it was too late. We had already enjoyed being \"Chris- tian\" to the full.

The old-ti mers remem- bered the prophecy of serious medical experts in an d after 1919 that the generation born near the end of the w ar would forever be puny because of malnutrition in their yo uth.

Tho se that survived, largely because of food rushed to them fr om foreign donors, became the superwarriors of 1939, men who s howed only contempt and cruelty toward nations which had distin- guished themselves in their humanitarian attitude t oward Germany. We know the Germans now too well to believe that ha d they been victorious in World War II they would have suc cored the children of the defeated. They have systematica lly turned malnutrition into a sadistic weapon, used to wipe o ut the chil- dren of the vanquished countries and to destroy the stamina of the adults. A R M I E S OF O C C U P A T I O N : F I R S T - L I N E P R O P A G A N D A TARGETS Unlike present-day Germans, who have gone through N azi courses regardless of their age, sex, or trade, the German population of 1918 had not been trained in propagan da. They, nevertheless, immediately realized the import ance of winning sympathy from the Allied armies of occupati on in the Rhineland. They concentrated on the Americans. We were happy. We had won, and were ready to be friends. Th e Ger- mans were unhappy. They needed new friends. Our sol diers there furnished ready-made targets conveniently clo se to home-made propaganda. Their commander, General Allen, has referred repeat edly to the way the Rhineland Germans tried to make frie nds with our troops. He added that \"their overzealous attemp ts to gain the good will of Americans often accomplished the o pposite,\" 103"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"since the soldiers felt that \"this mode of receptio n had been instigated by the German army.\" By nature, the Rhinelanders are the most friendly G er- mans. Americans are friendly, too. And besides they were good business, lavish in rewards for services and h ospitality, distributing luxuries like soap or chocolate, corne d beef or coffee, and bestowing an occasional wedding ring. The presence of Allied troops in the Rhineland prov ided the Germans with an excellent opportunity to arouse friction in their ranks, and through them, in their homeland s. Once the Versailles Treaty was signed we no longer prese nted a united front. The French and the Belgians, who had suffered the most from the Germans, advocated energetic meas ures against them. The English were less bitter, and as for us, no German shells or bombs had fallen on our homes. Our sol- diers loved to be told, as they were in the Rhinela nd, that they formed the model occupation force. They also liked hearing that it was they who had actually defeated the Germ an army. The Germans knew all about the strains and stresses in- evitable between Allies. There was a time in 1918 w hen they had threatened to fire on the Austrians to force th em to fight on. They knew there had been some discord between t he Allied countries. Now that the emergency had ended, they proposed to make more. Subtle tricks were worked in several ways, tricks too small to be exposed, too insidious to be for- gotten. There was, for instance, the pinprick affair of the toy soldier in the Cologne Cathedral. Herr von Heintze, who had worked in Coblenz on occupation problems, told me t his ver- sion. Cologne was occupied by the British. Tommies on a sightseeing tour saw a small model of a mouse and a toy American soldier on a side altar. The guide said th at in olden days Cologne had been overrun by rats, and the sain t whose 104"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"altar contained the mouse had delivered the city fr om them. That explained the model mouse. \"And what about the American soldier?\" asked the Tommy. \"Coblenz women dedicated that toy soldier to the sa int,\" was the reply, \"hoping he would rid them of the Ame ricans.\" When Americans visited the Cathedral, the soldier w ore an English uniform and the story was turned against the Tommies. Then the Allied soldiers got to comparing notes in some Weinstube. This led to plenty of name-calling and fist fights. The Germans delighted in both. Herr von Hei ntz thought it a fine illustration of typical Cologne h umor. No expedient was too small for the nationalists and pan- Germans if it would create bad blood between the En glish, the French, and the Americans. Behind the backs of our soldiers, the Germans sland ered them. In the late 1920's, long after our troops had left, I went to the Rhineland to do a story on occupation f orces in general, since the day approached for the last of t he French to return home. From what I saw, I concluded that o ccupation is extremely hard on the occupiers, especially if t heir stay is lengthy. In Coblenz I talked with German officials who had dealt with American occupation problems. \"Americans like to think that their army behaved especially well in Germany,\" said Dr. Knoch of the Foreign Office, with a sneer. \"We don't think so.\" I felt this was an insult to our military honor. I bristled. The gentleman bristled too, and claimed that the sl ums of Coblenz were full of little American bastards. I re torted that I didn't believe it, but that if it were true it mi ght have im- proved the blood-strain. Then I went to the Coblenz Town Hall to see the old -fash- ioned local officials. They could speak of illegiti macy only in 105"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"bated breath. Instantly they discerned the source o f the cal- umny. That rumor had been started, they said, by Ge rman Nationalists to smear the poorer classes of Coblenz who had no interest in joining the secret military campaign of various organizations. \"Then, of course,\" they added, \"it s erves to discredit the Americans with whom the population wa s friendly.\" My informant admitted that an occasional loose lady , when she got into trouble, claimed that the child was ha lf Ameri- can. \"But,\" he said, \"it kept right on happening to them long after the Americans had left.\" I N F L A T I O N AS AN I N T E R N A T I O N A L WEAPON The disarmament of Germany, which was never complet ed, began while our soldiers were still in the Rhinelan d. In- flation gathered momentum and the Germans groaned e ver more loudly that never could they pay the huge, the fantastic sums demanded from them in reparations. Returned Am eri- can occupation soldiers told at home of the sufferi ngs they had seen. Many Americans, eager to be fair, concede d that the figure of 90 billion marks seemed astronomical. They could not know that Germany was hiding her resource s, that her wealthy classes had smuggled billions out of Ge rmany to safety in Switzerland. Kindly people throughout the world brought pressure to bear on the Allies to reduce th e repara- tions payments. Nor could they know that only six years after Hitle r be- came Germany's master he would have spent the exact sum for rearmament which the postwar Germans had declar ed would enslave them for generations—90 billion marks . In- stead of paying up, the financial experts allied wi th the secret general staff speeded up inflation for use as a pol itical and economic weapon on the international front. 106"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"With the mark toppling in Germany and on foreign ma r- kets as well, going up in smoke under the very eyes of the Allies, how could they expect Germany to pay repara tions? Everybody from politician to industrialist wept cro codile tears over Germany's poverty. And, with each paroxy sm of grief, succeeded in getting big slices slashed from the repara- tions demands. Six months after the Allied represen tatives met in Boulogne in 1920, and agreed on a reparation s de- mand of 85 billion marks, the amount was reduced to 53 billion, then to 50 billion. Meanwhile, the industrialists had regained entry fo r their goods on foreign markets and, making use of inflati on, were accumulating foreign cash abroad, spending it to bu y busi- nesses, to start key men picked by the secret gener al staff in companies placed strategically throughout the world . And, as German businessmen went abroad to consolida te their profits, foreigners came to Germany to look f or business openings. Inflation had translated the purchase pri ce of Ger- man property and shares into fabulous bargains in f oreign currency. And the many speculators who took a fling on the German stock market automatically acquired with the ir divi- dends a personal interest in German enterprises. Th ey could be relied on to use their influence in favor of Ger many. Later the Germans were to complain about the \"sell out\" o f Ger- man plants, but not until the foreign investors—amo ng them 300,000 Americans—had done their bit. On the street corners of London and other cities, d ealers sold German paper marks.

The finances of Czechoslovakia, newly r eleased from centuries of Habsburg oppression, were still t ied to a certain extent with Austrian economy. The Czech fin ancial expert, Dr. Rasin, decided to stop the flood at the borders. Alone and in secrecy he prepared his plan. He went late one evening to the Czechoslovak General Staff and deman ded that all borders be closed and a cordon be thrown around the country to prevent the entrance of smugglers. Simul taneously he called in all the old Austrian banknotes in circ ulation. From then on, the only legal tender was money beari ng the official Czechoslovak stamp. But in Germany, the inner circle had a good reason to pro- mote inflation. It made them richer. Hugo Stinnes, for in- stance, who had been one of the busiest of the men smuggling out German currency to foreign countries, built up an in- dustrial empire, with enterprises in Switzerland, s hipping lines in Sweden, Dutch colonial companies, factorie s in China, Austrian-Alpine mining interests, Bosnian co al mines, the big combination of Bismarckshuette and Kattowit z Berg- bau foundries, and many others, including South Ame rican holdings.

The businessmen among the wester n powers were terrified that chaos might engulf Germa ny and deprive them of that vast Central European market j ust then beginning to open up. The Russian market had alread y been lost through the revolution. The businessmen agreed that one could not jeopardize the German market just for the sake of reparations. Who would get the money anyhow? The French were admittedly entitled to reparations, but weren't they being too insistent? The people who as ked that question came from countries which had not been rav aged by the Germans. Clever propaganda had inclined them to sym- pathy with the German plaint. With the United State s and the British Empire willing to forget the war, anxious t o get on with business, and the French insisting on repaymen t for their losses, it was easy for the Germans to drive a wedge be- tween the former Allies. Their story was that stron g, power- ful France was persecuting poor helpless, upright G ermany. And wasn't France, whispered the Germans, becoming so strong that she was endangering British supremacy? When the rest of us realized that Germany had dodge d her reparations payments, that she had not disarmed, th at on the contrary she was bootlegging herself a new army, th e British were charged with failing to co-operate with the Fr ench in en- forcing the Versailles Treaty. England had clung, i t was said, to the old balance-of-power formula, preferring a s trong Ger- many to an overbearing France. There is no doubt that some among the English upper classes had many ties in Germany.

And every foreign convert won to German sympathy wa s an ally of the German secret general staff. It was finally agreed that only businessmen could s traighten out the gigantic problems involved. Under the leade rship of General Charles Dawes, they set the new reparations figure at 41 billion gold marks—less than half the money i nvested by Germany in rearmament under Hitler, not to menti on the vast sums spent for military purposes before his ad vent. To make sure the Germans would not compromise the busi ness- men immediately by defaulting, the Dawes Commission pro- vided ample loans for Germany. The slogan of \"recon struc- tion\" attracted international businessmen and inves tors as it had appealed to the labor-union leaders. Promptly foreign bankers descended on Berlin in dro ves, offering whatever sums the Germans wanted at profit able rates of interest. The Germans didn't mind the high rates. They didn't intend to pay up anyway. Experts don't quite agree on the exact amounts loan ed to Germany and invested in that country. Some of them, like George Creel, put the total up to the end of the 19 20's at $6,436,000,000 against which Germany paid only $4,4 62,- 976,000 in reparations.

Naturally, most bankers protest that many of the lo ans were purely business transactions with no military signifi- cance as far as they knew. Indeed they did not know : the Germans don't tell. The Germans went to a lot of tr ouble to camouflage their intentions. But the world was warned. Many an observer in Germa ny raised an alarmed voice. Nobody, however, seemed to care. As early as 1923, General J. H. Morgan pointed to the pattern of Germany's economic rearmament. \"Germany's recons truc- tion is the name for the vastest, the most far-seei ng enterprise ever undertaken even by the nation which in Lord Bi rken- head's memorable words 'thinks of everything,'\" Gen eral Morgan wrote. He added that the subsidizing of key indus- tries, \"the development of interior lines of commun ication, the reduction of railway rates, the promotion of st ate fac- tories and aluminum manufacture, the contribution t o vast electric power stations, all these are but a few of the under- takings upon which public moneys have been lavishly ex- pended, and all of them, be it remarked, have a mil itary use- fulness.\" General Morgan was the British representa tive on the Interallied Military Council.

In the years between the revolution and the world d epression Germany became a totally revitalized country. Despi te the obstacles put in their way, men like Friedrich Eber t and Gustav Stresemann had labored successfully to impro ve in- ternal conditions and had solidified German relatio ns with the former Allies. There are many examples of German achievement. Look at the railroads. Under the provisions of the Versa illes Treaty, Germany was made to hand over 8,000 locomot ives and 230,000 cars. By 1923, with government subsidie s, she had 8,400 new, modern locomotives and 247,000 new, first- class cars. These and other facts did not prevent D r. Hjalmar Schacht from traveling around the United States say ing that while England and France could and should be made t o pay their war debts, Germany couldn't, not possibly. Between 1924 and 1930, the standard of living of th e Ger- man masses rose until the individual income was 15. 5 per cent higher than in 1913, and only Scandinavia had a higher level of real wages.

Yet, under the gen- 112"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"eral pan-German influence and the secret general st aff's agita- tors, dissatisfaction spread like a cancer through the body of the people.

There were the milita nt Ger- man industrialists and Junkers, too, making their w eight felt in all the important clubs and meetings. One of our wisest diplomats, Consul General Hathawa y in Munich, who knew Germany well, summed up the questi on of the \"nice\" Germans. \"The Germans are very nice p eople,\" he said. \"The only trouble is that they always end up by doing what the wicked Germans want them to.\" There continued to be unemployment, of course, and the agrarian situation did not improve. The bulk of the people didn't know why, they only knew it was so. Food was scarce because the Junkers found it cheaper to demand gove rnment subsidies than to develop adequate farm production.

The world further shut its eyes to the facts of lif e by wel- coming Germany into the League of Nations like a lo ng-lost friend. Before she could get in, according to the b y-laws, Ger- many should have presented evidence that she had fu lfilled all her contractual obligations. What about reparat ions? Why be small about reparations? eloquently asked Ar istide Briand, successor to the hard-fisted, clear-thinkin g Poincare. Wasn't the Dawes Plan taking care of all such matte rs? Then how about rearmament? The Interallied Military Council furnished a report . It showed that Germany was in the process of rearming. That was unpleasant.

While in Americ a, von Seeckt and his aides had been struck by one phase o f Ameri- can mobilization for the World War I—the speed of i ndus- trial conversion. We ourselves had been somewhat cr itical of the cost of the switch from peace to war product ion, but then we were not war-minded. General von Seeckt went home and immediately ordere d the economic section of his staff to concentrate on production and business problems.

Men who described themsel ves as Front Fighters of World War I controlled the helm o f the government under Chancellor Bruening, assisted by a mbi- tious von Treviranus, General von Schleicher's frie nd. Germany, too, felt the crash. Crisis followed upon crisis. Was it purely by accident that Bruening's governmen t sud- denly organized autarchy in Germany? Or were the me n directing him remembering the principle of the famo us von Clausewitz, that autarchy is of great importance in wartime? By this time, even before Hitler assumed power, the as- cendancy of the militarists in Germany was so compl ete that the country's military expenditures surpassed those of France, whose army was supposedly five times greater. Meanw hile the German masses were being driven to despair by unemp loy- ment. Bruening's cabinet of front fighters was succeeded by the cabinet of barons, under Franz von Papen, responsib le to the executive alone. This cabinet, which included Gener al von Schleicher, allowed itself to be moved about like p uppets by Adolf Hitler.

The Junkers and Nazis had become too strong. By their combined forces, he was overth rown and, on June 30, 1934, Hitler had him assassinated. He k new too much. Four years before, Germany's most eloquent spokesma n to the businessmen of other countries about Germany's poverty and imminent chaos, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, had resign ed from his post in the Reichsbank, abandoning the Young Pl an, which he had helped formulate. At the time Schacht an- nounced that he was through with politics. He inten ded to be- come a gentleman farmer and raise pigs. He promptly began extensive secret conferences with Adolf Hitler. Schacht went to the United States. To all of his nu merous friends he talked persuasively about the Nazis. The y were not, it seemed, nearly as bad as the wicked newspap ermen made them out. The Nazis would not interfere with o ur doing business. On the contrary, business would be just a s good as usual. He reconnoitered the circle of his acquainta nces for co-operative spirits.

They froze and unfroze the foreign balances in their banks to suit their political pur poses. They were too poor to pay their debts, but they had plen ty of money to buy raw materials for war. And they bought freely, on the world markets. Why not? The world let them. The former Allies hear d Goering proclaim \"guns instead of butter,\" and appa rently did not wonder if perhaps they were not meant to be the targets for those guns. They saw, almost overnight, the Ger- man wonder-factories into which their own money had gone, converted into model plants for war production. It occurred to few that the transformation came so rapidly and with such ease because the plants had been designed that way. The Nazis also got huge reserves of supplies by bar ter ar- rangements with neighboring countries. They even to ok in ex- change goods that they didn't need; these they sold on the world markets for gold—with which they bought more raw materials. And, in the meantime, Germany was willin g to send on barter only the manufactured articles or ma chinery which kept her factories busy, whether the recipien t country could use them or not—radios, cameras, mouth organs , aspirin, for instance, to agrarian lands—she manage d it so that she was always a clearing debtor. The credit f or think- ing up this ingenious racket goes to the same Dr. H jalmar Schacht who had \"retired.\" Dr. Schacht's reasoning was simple. If Germany always imported more than she ex ported, and therefore always owed clearing balances, she co uld de- lay paying up for months, even years. During that t ime she would enjoy extensive credit, without interest. The n if, rarely, she paid in cash, the payment would be made in Germ any, in Reichsmarks, so that the creditor could use it o nly to pur- chase more German goods. 118"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Quite often she settled, at length, by altering the clearing rate of the Reichsmark to her own advantage.

Internally, the vastly enlarged economic section of the War Office steered German companies toward producing fo r the new total war. The American, the British, the average businessman of the United Nations, thinks of his office, or his enterp rises in rela- tion to his competitors and the general market. The Germans have been taught to consider their enterprises as v ehicles for the aggrandizement of Germany. They have been train ed to use their foreign connections for economic, then po litical, ends, toward the greater end—permanent German conqu ests. During the Hitler regime all the business barons of Germany used to meet once a year at Nuremburg to plan the n ational economic strategy at home and to co-ordinate it wit h the strat- egy abroad. In the days of the Republic, the indust rialists were fully as systematic in their planning and co-o rdination, working at it in confidential meetings of their own social clubs and professional associations, both in the Ge rman capi- tal and in Germany's main industrial centers. The Germans stole a march on the rest of the world in using economic legerdemain to bemuse their victims. They have had twenty-five years of successful practice. Their lan d conquests in World War II gave them, even if temporarily, new re- sources—raw materials, factories, foundries, and fi nishing plants for industrial exploitation.

But in her case, the meekness was only a m ask. Just as the wives of the typical middle-class reserve of ficer, like Franz Seldte of the Steel Helmets, are prone to be even more proudly militaristic than their husbands, so they a nd the other nationalistic-minded women were often more fanatica lly pan- German than their menfolk. The smallest children le arned at their grandmother's knee that some day red-bearded Emperor Frederick Barbarossa would come out of his cave in the Harz mountains and restore Germany to her rightful great ness. In these tales the ambition of an early German imperia list still lived, for Frederick led countless expeditions of c onquest to re-create the Roman Empire for his people. When the child reached school, the dogma of all-enc om- passing German superiority received intensive culti vation. Before World War I, pleasant German spas were fille d with finishing schools for the butcher's and the town cl erk's off- spring, and with swank academies where the student' s blood- line counted for more than her I.Q. The more advanc ed girls of prewar days attended the same high schools and u niversi- ties as the boys; they were the exception. Richer p arents sent their daughters to be \"finished\" in Switzerland, En gland, or Northern Italy. But no school, domestic or foreign, received German patronage unless it taught German superiorit y.

Any foreigner who failed to be dazzled and humbled by G erman Kultur or efficiency was, at best, an object of pit y. Naturally, chauvinism and racial conceit exist in a ll coun- tries. But I spent most of my school days at a Iyce e and a uni- versity in France. There I saw the youth of that co untry brought up to feel that France had been wronged by Prussia in 1871 and would some day have to reconquer Alsace -Lor- raine. They were ready for that fight. But as long as France was left alone within her rightful borders to enjoy her pleas- ant pattern of life, she would be content. The youn g French people had no national ambitions involving the rest of the world. The imagination and aspirations of German youth str etched far beyond the German borders.

Early twentieth-century educators, like their succe ssors, concentrated on developing mental and physical disc ipline among the Germans. They neglected the faculty of se lf-criti- cism to a certain extent before 1914, and during th e Nazi regime sought to stifle it. The first World War gen eration showed infinitely greater civic courage than their children. For instance, German women's associations protested the de- portation of Belgian and French women to Germany du ring the first war, but did nothing to counteract the br utality of the Schutz Staffel in the second. This change in the attitude of the German women lar gely came about through such leaders as General von Lude ndorff, who for years perverted the truth to prove that the Allies had determined to annihilate the German people. The bel ief grew during the inflation. Under the Nazis it was encour aged to the point of obession. From it grew resentment of forei gn nations. When Germany attacked, they felt she was justified in strik- ing first. Nothing else explains why so many women were ready to believe Germany to be waging a \"defensive\" war. And since they were being \"persecuted,\" they rejoic ed in the prior destruction of their enemies. It was the women who protested most loudly in 1940 when the first bombs fell on Germany. The raiders were \" inhu- man,\" they said, ignoring completely the inhumanity of Ger- man bombing raids which had preceded them. This tim e the women will know what war in the homeland means. In World War I, East Prussia and a few western strips of lan d experi- enced it, but the bulk of the Germans were spared b attles on their own soil.

At the least on e was branded a Bolshevik—and who wanted to be called a B ol- shevik in 1919? Although the ruling classes of the Kaiser's era were officially out of power, they still ruled through the General Staff and through their womenfolk. The wome n of the upper classes showed infinitely more viciousness in slander- ing the Republican leaders than did the men. By des troying respect of the persons heading the Republic, they d estroyed respect for their offices. I often remember their a ctivities when I hear people in the United States repeating o ff-color stories about American statesmen without bothering to sub- stantiate them. Sometimes one can distinctly see th e Nazi earmarks. Upper-class German women in particular decided to u se their new franchise to defeat the Republic which ha d given it to them. Their first thought was to impress every f oreigner within their reach with the importance and justific ation of Germany's grievances against the Versailles Treaty and 126"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"against the Republic. American correspondents and m ilitary representatives were besieged with invitations—of a ll varie- ties. Dual-nationality gals, part-Russian, part-Pol ish, part- French, part-Rumanian or part-Scandinavian, exploit ed their foreign connections—the vanguard of the half-foreig ners later used to such effect by the more systematic Na zis. I never heard anyone talk more glowingly about the beau- ties of peace than the leaders of Berlin society in front of foreign diplomats. The instant the foreigners had l eft, they would burst out in orgies of hatred and fierce, war like speeches. They forgot me, because they had known me for years as the daughter of a popular foreign portrait painter who was not interested in politics. When I proteste d, the ladies would gang up on me. Since, however, I was neither a poli- tician nor a diplomat who needed their good will, I could afford a first-class verbal battle. Sometimes they would try to cover themselves and insist that I had \"misunder stood.\" But to this day the mere mention of Wilson's Fourte en Points will make me rise up ready for a fight, in memory o f those clashes. A WOMAN OF C O U R A G E The dignified and courageous Frau Ebert, wife of Ge r- many's first president, stood in sharp contrast to these aspir- ing conspirators. I met Frau Ebert first at a tea given by a Chicago friend, Mrs. Robert Kohlhamer, who had come to Berlin with funds for charities. German aristocrats gathered there pu t on a show to display their social advantages, talking fo r one thing about art. It was a joy to discover that Frau Ebert knew a great deal more about it than they did. One of the \"ladies\" asked her sharply how she came to be informed on su ch mat- ters. Without embarrassment, the president's wife r eplied that 127"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"before her marriage she had worked in Italy and had spent all her free time in Italian museums trying to impr ove her education. When the conversation swung to peace Fra u Ebert's voice was the only sincere one among the Ge rman women present. As I filed this story I stressed the simplicity of the presi- dent's wife, knowing that the Americans who were co ntribu- ting generously to collections for the distressed G ermans would be interested. I mentioned that Frau Ebert ha d arrived at the party on foot. Less than a week later, Frau Meissner, wife of the secretary of state in the Chancellery (who has since turned N azi), tele- phoned me and staged a superlative scene, charging that I had insulted German dignity. How could I dare to say th at the wife of the German president had walked to a party! Later, Frau Ebert spoke of the incident and of how hard it was to make people realize the dignity of simplicity. Frau Ebert's life exemplifies the fate of the best element among German women. Her husband suffered slander an d abuse, and finally died before his time because he had given all his strength to the cause of peace in Germany. Under the Nazis, Frau Ebert herself endured persecution. Two sons had died in World War I. The third was arrested and tor tured in one concentration camp after another. Kurt Luedecke tells of these tortures in I Knew Hitler, Young Ebert never mentioned them. After his release he could not get work—any kind of work—and when he did find a tiny job, the Gestapo hounded him until his young wife committed suicide. The Nazis stopped Frau Ebert's p ension and confiscated the modest little house she had bou ght. I last saw her on the street, shortly before I sail ed for home. Proud, erect, and quiet, she went her way. I tried to smile quickly as I passed. If I had stopped and spo ken, the 128"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Gestapo could not have done anything to me. But the re was no way of knowing what they would do to her if she had been seen even greeting a foreigner. I G N O R E G E R M A N G U I L T When, after the other World War, the first meeting between German, French, Belgian, English, and American wome n took place in Geneva, the German delegation vehemently d enied that their soldiers had committed any atrocities. T hat charge was, they said, part of the war-guilt lie. They wer e, however, confronted with irrefutable evidence of a number of crimes, which the French and Belgian women had collected an d brought along. The German woman leader, deeply shak en, apologized in the name of her countrymen. But in order to save the German contingent from emb ar- rassment when they went back home, no publicity was given the incident. At that time such tactful silence was a victory for the German militarists. Thus, although a few Ge rman liberals knew the facts, the vast majority of Germa n women are still convinced that any reference to atrocitie s in World War I is slander. They have instilled this convicti on in all their friends in other countries. Their present cal lousness to wholesale bestialities since 1939 shows that they w ouldn't care any more. One of the finest of the German liberals, a tiny sl ip of a gray-haired woman named Regine Deutsch, worked ener get- ically for civic betterment. She had, in fact, help ed draft the Republican Constitution. She was in her seventies w hen the Nazis came to power. She was not even allowed to si t on a park bench to warm her old bones in the sun. The on ly bench Jews were permitted to use stood far from the small room al- lowed her, much too far for her to reach it on foot . The liberal women deserved better of Germany than t hat 129"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Yet many of them came to share with the pan-Germans the desire for national power. As ardent a democrat as Dr. Elis- abeth Lueders, member of the Reichstag, vowed passi onately at the time of the French Ruhr invasion that German y would avenge herself on France \"even if it costs the live s of a whole German generation.\" She repeated that statement in front of foreign correspondents. While most Republican women were trying to make the ir sisters appreciate the democratic privileges confer red on them by the Weimar Constitution, Adolf Hitler, in Munich , was talking so as to win support from the womenfolk of the re- turned soldiery. Everything he said showed that he under- stood their worries about their families. Many of t he women had reason for concern in the new restlessness of t heir sons and husbands, irritable in the unaccustomed quiet o f home life after the excitements of the war. To all women , Hitler said that the family was the kernel around which th e new, the all-powerful Germany would be built by him and his friends. He was the man who would save Christianity from the on- slaught of the wicked, godless Reds and Republicans . The bewildered middle-class women, who felt they were t oo fine to join the workers in the Socialist Party, who dis trusted the democrats and got few new ideas from their old cler ical Centrist Party, flocked to Herr Hitler. So did the frustrated, restless spinsters—after Hit ler or- ganized the Storm Troopers and paraded them up and down the streets, plainly spoiling for a fight or for a romance. With the shortage of some four million men of marriageab le age, the women loved to hear the Nazis promise a husband for every German woman—when they became masters of Ger- many. Women, said Hitler, were too sacred to the real he- men of Germany, the Nazis, to be allowed to sully their so uls with 130"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"such lowly matters as politics. To permit a woman t o run for parliament was a desecration of womanhood—and the m il- lions of women who could not make the parliamentary grade thought there must be something in it. They didn't even resent it when the Nazis talked about the inferiority of t he female brain. Instead, forbidden politics, the German woma n quite naturally broke her neck to get into the Nazi polit ical Party, working twice as hard to prove herself. Before long a certain prestige attached to consorti ng with Nazis. Frau v. Ludendorff invited Hitler to her hou se, and through the aristocratic leaders of anti-Semitism, Hitler made the acquaintance of many society women. He spo ke less of the sanctity of family life for their entertainm ent, but ap- pealed to their pan-German prejudices, to their cra ving for new sensations, to their ambition, and strangely en ough, to their maternal instinct. There are today a score or so of aged women in various places, each of whom thinks she wa s the one who really made Hitler's success possible. Ther e is the American-born Frau Hanfstaengel, nee Sedgwick, who was a great admirer of the budding Fuehrer. In Berlin t here is also Frau von Dirksen, who feels certain that witho ut her in- troductions to the wealthy men who financed Hitler, he would never have prospered. Frau von Dirksen had a number of mediocre diplomats in her family, who could benefit by her co-operation with Hitler. As one of Hitler's feminine sponsors in Berlin put it, \"It was really touching, the way he clicked his heels a nd kissed his hostess's hand. He was feeling his way then, an d was so grateful for any help we could give him.\" When Hitler toured Germany in the early 1930's by p lane, or raced by car from one rally to the other, women would fight for the privilege of touching his mustard-col ored rain- coat, some would even try to kiss its hem. Eva Brau n, the 131"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"young woman who was closer to him than any other, a sserted that Hitler loathed these performances but that he and his friends decided they had \"political value.\" If you ever tune in on a radio broadcast of a polit ical speech and hear only the hysterical shrieks of wome n; if you ever go to a rally where women have just one though t in mind, to touch the coat of their political idol—then plea se for the sake of your country remember the example of what t his same hysteria did to Germany. Step back, take a cool loo k at the orator, and at your fellow listeners, lest you too be engulfed in their mass excitement. Adolf Hitler, the lady's man, remained a shrewd pol itician. When Dietrich Eckart took him to Bayreuth to commun e at the shrine of Richard Wagner, Hitler became the gre at friend of the younger members of the family. After Siegfri ed Wag- ner died there was a great deal of talk about a pos sible marriage between Hitler and Siegfried's English wid ow, Winifred. It reached the point where a venturesome diplo- matic attache asked one of her daughters, \"Is it tr ue that your mother is having a romance with Hitler?\" The young daughter replied moodily, \"He isn't havin g any.\" Later Hitler invited this same girl, then grown, to luncheon so frequently that a new wave of talk started. But ever since 1929 Eva Braun has been at Hitler's side. After the war broke out she moved into the Chancell ery. This caused the rumor that the Fuehrer had married her. It has been said that Hitler promised her good middle-clas s mother that he would marry her \"after securing victory for Ger- many.\" Eva became involved with Hitler as a very yo ung girl when she studied photography with Heinrich Hoffman, Hit- ler's court photographer. She is as lonely and unha ppy a woman as ever lived in the shadow of an all-powerfu l tyrant. 132"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Hitler, convinced that he is an artist at heart, al ways sur- rounded himself with artists.

H E just sat on it!\" Margarete Slezak was one of the two dozen artists who received from Herr Hitler , for Christmas, 1940, \"tastefully wrapped\" packages cont aining real coffee. Leni Riefenstahl, the movie star, worked very hard to prove that she was the light in Hitler's life. Her pull g ot her ap- pointed official photographic recorder of the Nurem berg Party rallies.

Quite a number of the measures envi saged by the Nazis for the improvement of national health an d national cohesion contained excellent possibilities. But by twisting them all to serve a single purpose, the aggrandizem ent of their own power in Germany and the world, the Nazis nulli- fied much of their worth. They removed the Jewish women who had been active i n social work and many of the democratic women, repla cing 133"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"them with Nazi women, whose principal interest lay in their own advancement within the Party hierarchy. The Naz is covered the whole of Germany with a network of Part y or- ganizations run by women under direction of Nazi me n. Frau Scholz-Klink, who called herself Reichsfrauenfuehre rin, or the Reich's leader of women, took orders from Dr. E rich Hilgenfeldt, the chief of all welfare organizations . Frau Scholz-Klink was a woman whose ruthlessness and dri ving ambition were surpassed only by the unsavoriness of her reputation among her own collaborators. She worked very closely with the Gestapo. She appointed a woman rep resenta- tive to each one of the 92,696 cells and 481,875 bl ocks which formed part of the vast chain in which Germany was bound by the Labor Front leader, Robert Ley, and Heinrich Himm- ler of the Gestapo. With the outbreak of the war, c ell lead- ers got keys to every flat in their districts. Theo retically, they were to be used in case of bombings. Nazi women's organizations supervised the life of t he Ger- man woman from the cradle to the grave. Expectant m others received \"mental and political training.\" A represe ntative of the Frauenschaft called upon the young wife who had no baby to find out why she was remiss in her duty to the Father- land. I once heard two Nazi women at a meeting argu e vio- lently about the effect of prenatal political train ing on the minds of future young Germans. In the first years of Hitler's reign, women of Nazi organi- zations displayed extraordinary activity, descendin g on every foreigner they could reach in a concerted campaign of con- version to the wonders of the Nazi Party and of den unciation of the \"immoral\" life under the Republic.

It quickly became known th at a married man had a better chance of getting a job th rough the Nazi Party than a single one. Then the government i ntroduced a bachelor tax for both men and women. A system of state dowries was perfected with a doub le pur- pose—to make marriages easier and to get girls out of jobs which young Nazis coveted. If a girl could prove th at she had a prospective husband, and if she promised to resig n her posi- tion and not take another, the couple could obtain loans totaling a maximum of $400, repayable in ten years, with a big rebate for each child. In view of German prices , state dowries barely bought minimum requirements for a ne w home. And on a small salary the young couple could hardly pay their expenses. Whenever an emergency arose, th ey had perforce to turn to the Nazi welfare organizations. However, the government profited greatly. The syste m made jobs for unemployed men and it raised the nati onal birth rate. When the population failed to increase as much as the Nazis expected, the rebates for babies went up from time to time. More important still, the program created a whole new lower middle class which had to rely entirely u pon the good will of Nazi administrators. It provided a sol id block of enslaved voters who had to be loyal to the Party for the sake of their daily bread. Though it was obvious that the Nazis were not in th e least keeping their pledge to protect the sanctity of fam ily life, but were systematically destroying the moral fiber of G ermany, they commanded a hysterical fanaticism among some f oreign women, Americans included. 135"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"F O R E I G N WOMEN We used to see such women—and foreign men, too—join in the raucous cheers of \"Heil Hitler.\" I remember Elizabeth Dilling. I might not have, except that during one N uremberg caucus she wore a bright red hat and went from tabl e to table in the dining room where the foreign press ate with the rest of the multitude, pointing to us and doing a lot of agitated whispering. It was amusing after that to see how si lent certain groups would fall when any of us came near. Then su ddenly I observed another woman, a youngster who very ofte n ac- companied Mrs. Dilling, going through the same perf orm- ance. I went after her and asked point-blank what t he game was. \"You are an enemy of Germany,\" she said, \"and we must see that our friends do not speak in front of you.\" \"And what makes you think I am an enemy of Germany? \" I asked. \"Because of the reports you write against us.\" Yes, this young woman used the word \"us.\" A few hours later Rolf Hoffmann, the Nazi in charge of the Munich propaganda office, came to me and apolog ized. \"These foreign sympathizers are so swept away by th eir emotions, they don't know how to express their enth usiasm,\" he said, smiling. \"When Mrs. Dilling got here, she told us that you and Wallace Deuel of the Chicago Daily New s should both be thrown out of Germany.

No one could smoke in his august presence. Whether Unity Mitford is hysterical or not, she has been an excellent Nazi agent, agitating in England and i n Czecho- slovakia. By carrying messages to the Sudeten Germa n cliques she conveyed the impression that England wa s in sympathy with the Nazi cause. Foreign women married to Germans often became ferve nt Nazis. One American-born countess refused to be int roduced to me because I \"maligned Nazi Germany.\" Later, aft er the war had started, she cultivated Americans in Berlin . She was \"homesick,\" she said. Her husband held a high Nazi post, and he would never have allowed his exceedingly bea utiful and charming wife to spend so much time with foreig ners unless she could be useful. Of course, she told all Americans that she and her husband were really anti-Nazi. But after the United States entered the war, she left Germany for Switzer- land—and nobody can leave Germany without Nazi perm is- sion. The American Women's Club, which I regret to say I helped to found, became a regular rendezvous for Am erican women married to Germans and for their Nazi intimat es. Any visitor heard wonderful stories about the joys of life under Nazi rule. I resigned from the club some time before the war because it had turned into a hot-bed of Naz i propa- ganda.

For years the Propaganda Ministry issued periodical calls to its officials asking for the names of any attrac tive women who could speak foreign languages and would go abro ad on a trip. Wives of officials were eligible, too, at l east those who were beautiful or intelligent enough. All these wom en re- ceived intensive training for their assignments. D E S T R O Y F A M I L Y LIFE One of the hardest blows struck against the German fam- ily was the mobilization of labor, forcing thousand s of work- ers to leave their homes and families and accept jo bs on Hitler's highways and later on the fortifications w hich were to become known as the Siegfried Line. Occasionally the men would go home A.W.O.L. The Nazis fixed that difficu lty by rounding up the streetwalkers from all the German c ities and establishing them in the Rhineland for the entertai nment of the Siegfried Line workers. With the war, the men joined their military units. The streetwalkers were shipped to districts where Czech and Polish workers toiled at forced labor. Two German o fficials openly talked about the deliberate purpose of this measure. It was on the Berlin-Basle train as I was leaving G ermany. A Luftwaffe colonel and a Nazi Party official, spor ting the big gold Nazi button meaning that he ranked very high, shared my compartment. When we reached Mannheim, the offic ial was moved to remark on the number of Poles and Czec hs brought to that city to replace German workers beca use of the bombings. He laughed. \"Those men won't be any good to their families if they ever get back,\" he remarked. \"Why won't they?\" the colonel asked. \"All the diseased women who worked the Siegfried Li ne 138"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"are on their trail,\" the official replied, with a s mirk. The colonel was shocked—not at the idea, but that the o fficial should speak so freely in front of a foreigner. The y were both able to see the labels on my luggage, and moreover I had told them that I was an American correspondent on my way home on leave. I took this precaution because if either man should be too indiscreet and start worrying about it, he m ight have me held up at the border. Their conversation touched on home life. \"I love my wife and my children,\" said the air-force colonel, \"but when we soldiers get home, all our families can talk about is how many potatoes they get and what kinds of sandwiches other people have in the air-raid shelters. Most of us jo ined the Party,\" he went on, \"because we felt the Nazis woul d protect family life. But now we're being sent all over the map, and we no longer have anything in common with our famil ies. I'll be glad to get back to France and the thrill of ser vice.\" The Party official had his own interpretation of th e officer's words. He said that French women weren't in it comp ared to Rumanians—there you found both looks and temperamen t. I was reminded of a talk with a clever little Germa n woman surgeon a few weeks before. She came to me, l ooking very prosperous, with a message for some people in Chicago. I knew that women get very little chance at surgery in Ger- man hospitals and asked her some questions. \"I do w ar work. I am a plastic surgeon,\" she said. \"I ought to be p rosperous; I'm working hard enough beautifying bustlines.\" \"What have bustlines got to do with the war?\" \"Why, when the German men come home from France and the Balkans, they criticize the figures of their wi ves. All the Nazis have money, you know, so I operate.\" It was Hitler who was responsible for the beauty op era- tions.

And we have use for it .\" B E A U T Y AS A P O L I T I C A L WEAPON So German female beauty is not regarded as belongin g necessarily to the German home. Few plain women can suc- ceed as agents or spies. And the Nazis have plenty of candi- dates for such work. Alfred Rosenberg, the quisling trainer, once said to me, \"It seems incomprehensible that so many women should want to be political agents—nice women , women we consider ladies. We tell them the job is o ften far from ladylike and they still want to take it on. Ma ny of them are aristocrats. They live up to the old tradition that nothing is too good for the Fatherland. That's real heroism for you.\" They have to work hard, these women agents training for the war-in-peace. They must watch their weight, imp rove their looks and style, study the backgrounds of the jobs assigned them, learn the details of each task. While they're being groomed, they have every possible aid. But forever after, their lives are rigidly supervised, especially as t o their choice of intimates. One of the inducements to German women to join up a s agents is undoubtedly the amount of money at the di sposal of any accepted candidate. Carte blanche at the big Pa ris dress- makers, coaching in any interesting subject, and sw anky cars —all these are perquisites.

These girls made a deep impression on the members o f the diverse congresses in Berlin, especially at those f or which Herr Goebbels entertained at what was formerly the royal Island of Peacocks.

A diplo- mat of a Latin nation, who had gone to many functio ns at which the young ladies had appeared, squealed with delight when I told him of our vain attempt. He left no sha dow of a doubt as to the freedom they were allowed in dating foreign delegates, nor about their efforts to obtain inform ation from their dates. Every girl spoke some foreign language ; many of them had been born or brought up abroad.

The Nazi Party has always made a great point of the viril- ity of its members. I have seen the sex instinct de liberately 142"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"aroused in many ways. At mass meetings, speeches dw elling on the copulative prowess of the Nazi male would se nd the Storm Troopers marching out of the hall all set for a demon- stration. They never had to look far for a partner. German women would wait outside the meeting places. Very l ittle preliminary courting was then required. At the movies, I have seen pictures whose only purp ose could have been to turn the spectator's thoughts to ward pro- creation, with long love passages and subsequent sc enes de- picting the joys of parenthood. Hence, besides the large number of women who joined the Nazi forces out of mistaken patriotism, or from rea ctionary instincts, or from greed, or out of craving for adv enture, there arose another sizable group—the women who clu ng to Nazism because only the Nazi Party would protect th eir il- legitimate children. Theoretically, the fathers are the \"young German heroes\" who have been fighting Hitler's war. Ac- tually, they are often the married bosses of little secretaries, filing clerks, and saleswomen. There was the young unmarried woman working in the Propaganda Ministry who frankly talked about her ne wborn child to the foreign correspondents. She had been a way for a few weeks. On her return she told us of the confine ment and of the fine new German. She was only one of a large number. Usually such women tried to brazen out the situatio n, making fun of the \"old-fashioned, backward Christians.\" Of ten enough this little set speech would be accompanied by abuse of the wives who would not give divorces to the men who had fathered the concubine's un-Christian children. If the fathers could have got divorces, the thought ran, then the unmarried mothers could marry and start new families.

F rau Dr. Elisabeth Lueders, the former democrat, became one of the labor experts of the German army, moving from facto ry to factory studying the possibilities of employing wom en work- ers. She became, in fact, so important that Frau Sc holz-Klink jealously denounced her potential rival to the Gest apo. It was reported that Dr. Lueders had been arrested, but af ter a while the High Command succeeded in obtaining her release . She never mentioned her experiences. With all their prating about the German home, the N azis have systematically destroyed its security, increas ing thereby their hold on the population. No one realized this contradic- tion more bittterly than the decent women who saw t heir ideals degraded every day, sometimes by their own d aughters. Yet a great deal of the blame rests with the decent women, too. For they had their chance to vote, to do somet hing about Hitler before Hitler came to power, and even therea fter for some time, until the Gestapo attained its all-power ful position. But the glittering mirage of Nazi conquests blinded many of these women to the danger to themselves and to thei r country. T H R O U G H S T R E N G T H TO JOY Early in World War II it was quite common to hear w omen who had been anti-Nazi say that, \"in view of these victories, I can see now that we had to go through the Nazi re gime to acquire the greatness that belongs to us.\" The lust for conquest is there, deep in the heart o f the Ger- man woman. The wife of a professor I knew was a vio lent anti-Nazi. She resisted for a long time before yiel ding to her son's desire to enter the Hitler Youth. Afterwards he ad- vanced rapidly with the organization until he got t o be seven- teen. Then, late one night, the parents came runnin g to me for advice. Their boy had not come home from the Pa rty 144"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"meeting, but one of his pals had told them of his a rrest by the Gestapo for homosexuality and misleading minors. I urged them to find a prominent Nazi lawyer and to try to save the boy by huge fees and promises of genero us Party donations. I also mobilized one of our Nazi contact s, a man not averse to making a little extra cash. He invite d the Nazi boss to a superlative dinner at Horcher's and talke d about the Nazi fervor of the boy who would \"do anything f or his Fuehrer.\" The boss promised to do what he could, be cause \"The concentration camp for discredited Party membe rs is truly an inferno.\" Then casually he asked, \"By the way, the father, the professor, is a Nazi, is he not?\" My emissary said that the father was only too anxio us to become a Party member. By dint of perjury and bribe s, the boy was released. He had had a row with another you th who resented his \"friendship\" with his immediate superi or. His mother quite naturally hated the people who had led her son into perversion. Yet, during the invasion of Norway, she called on m e, ju- bilantly excited over the German successes. My Schu ltz fam- ily hails from Norway, so that I felt more than the average indignation at the newest German violation of inter national law. This same woman who had seen her son turned in to a pervert by the Nazis, whose husband had been blackm ailed into joining the Party, said calmly, \"Maybe it was meant for us to go through Nazism—it has made us strong. It h as brought us great military victories, and it will br ing us more.\" How will such women react after the German victorie s have become merely a memory? Many of them will be d isil- lusioned. But not with Nazism—only with its failure . They will be eager advocates of the next cult that promi ses them success. They will be bitter. But not at themselves , for making 145"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Nazism possible—only that once more the \"conspiracy \" against Germany has given the Germans another \"setb ack.'* To us they will swear that they have always been an ti-Nazi. Not because they will be ashamed of having been pro -Nazi. But because they will insist on standing for someth ing which the rest of the world esteems, and which will disar m sus- picion. Being thought an anti-Nazi will give them t he feeling of superiority that being a Nazi once did. And, they will be convinced, the next time it will work. Germany will win her rightful place as master of th e world. Then it won't matter what we think of them. They kn ow that still greater plans are being worked out for the fu ture, plans for German domination, if not to be won by open war , then by hidden war. AMAZON BATTALIONS The young German women who have been brought up in the Nazi creed, the older women who spent twenty ye ars pre- paring for the second World War will not give up th e fight. Besides their own determination, they have years of indoc- trination and schooling behind them in special cour ses con- ducted by the Propaganda Ministry, the War Office, the Labor Front, the Gestapo, the Association of Germans Livi ng Abroad, Alfred Rosenberg's school for hyphenated an d other Germans, the Colonial Schools of General von Epp; s chools directed by the various women's organizations, in t he cultural groups, in university classes. They have taken cour ses in countries under German domination, some of them lea rning how to impersonate nationals of those countries, ot hers to ex- ploit special values there for German benefit. Groups of Amazons have been graduated from athletic academies, from art schools, and from business acad emies. For athletes and artists are supposed to be nonpoli tical, and 146"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"a woman in business does not yet arouse the suspici on that a man might. Whatever her specialty, each Amazon has been trained to organize other women and men. The experienced women who may have become too well known to foreigners through past activity, or who a re begin- ning to fade, coach the young sisters. Sometimes th ey are withdrawn into innocent-seeming commercial enterpri ses— with foreign connections. THE WOMAN WHO C O N Q U E R E D R U M A N I A By far the most dexterous graduate \"representative\" who ever worked for the Nazis was the petite, gentle, b lond Edit von Coler, Himmler's cousin and an intimate friend of Prince Auwi, the Kaiser's son. Edit was undoubtedly as clo se to the secret general staff as any woman. One of Edit's husbands had, in the early days, been in- volved in Reichswehr attempts to procure money by s taging fake business enterprises. These businesses had a w ay of fail- ing after the capital had been absorbed. The office rs responsi- ble would be dismissed in disgrace; the money liste d as lost through their peculations or irresponsibility; and another few million marks would be available for hidden rearmam ent operations. Apparently no sacrifice was too great f or a true member of the secret general staff, not even being branded a crook. After a series of jobs in various Nazi organization s and ministries, Edit von Coler was sent to Bucharest as a journal- ist, although she knew no Rumanian. Through a propa ganda minister in Bucharest, Edit launched into business in a big way. She was perfectly willing to let the minister use his friendship with her as Himmler's cousin to cloak hi s mixed ancestry (he was partly Jewish); he made it possibl e for her to reach into every circle and align all the elemen ts that could 147"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"be useful to Germany. She succeeded in bringing tog ether a great number of foreign and part-German women whom she trained as expert Nazi agents against the time of h er own departure. They worked in Rumania and radiated all over the Balkans; they went to Turkey, to Iran, to North Africa, even to South America. Rumanian patriots discovered the Nazi plot to conve rt Ru- mania into a German vassal and tried to assassinate Edit. Even had they done so, it would have been too late. Edit von Coler had already welded together all the forces th at could be used to prepare German rule. She escaped the cou ntry, taking with her fabulous gifts of jewelry and furs. Edit had now become too well known, however, for an other foreign assignment. She received an executive post in an in- surance company specializing in deals with South Am erica and Spain. There is not the slightest doubt that th is gifted woman was one of the key workers mobilized in 1940 for the war within a war. As foreigners begin again to visit Germany, it will be ar- ranged that they meet women trained by Edit von Col er and her like, women especially picked out to appeal to the tabu- lated preferences of prominent men from every count ry. Synthetic or natural blonds have always been on tap for the pleasure and proselytizing of Latins or Balkanites. On Mus- solini's first trip to Germany, for instance, whole trainloads of movie actresses were conveyed to Munich for his triumphal reception, then whisked back to Berlin under superv ision of propaganda officials to work on the Italians at the festivities in the capital. But the bigger job, because of its wider scope, has been the preparation of thousands of attractive women to win the hearts and sympathy of the foreign soldiers expecte d to in- vade the European continent. The French poilu is no t likely 148"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"to forget the third invasion of his homeland, the c alculated theft of almost all food from fertile France. But t he British and United States soldiers, who are characterized b y kindness and chivalry and whose countries have not suffered bodily invasion—they are the targets at which the Amazons will aim. Knowing the extent to which women have been used in the past in Nazi work, it is unthinkable that they shou ld not have been enlisted and set to work readying themselves f or ingen- ious assaults upon the generosity of the invading a nd occupy- ing forces. U N I N H I B I T E D G E N E R A T I O N TO THE FORE In 1918 it was not quite correct to talk about sex. The Ger- man women who lost their husbands and sweethearts i n the war resigned themselves as well as they could to lo neliness, to church activities, and to social-welfare work. T hey were still Christian. But after years of Hitler-encourag ed pagan licentiousness and political mysticism, the situati on differs radically today. It has not been an uncommon sight around Berchtesgaden to see German women pluck the grass o n which Hitler had walked and kiss it. They were not even a bashed to be seen. Great numbers of German women have lost their men d ur- ing World War II. But where is the religion to cons ole them? They have no religion, except their \"duty to the st ate.\" Women of other countries will also have to face celibacy. But they will not have been taught that their sole function is to per- petuate the race. Other societies still prize Chris tian restraint. Hysteria will strike the German woman twice as hard as the women with traditions of emotional control. Any United Nations soldiers who cross the German bo rders must be prepared to experience determined feminine attack. The German woman who can go to a United Nations cou ntry 149"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"as the wife of a returned soldier can carry on ther e, with im- punity, the work of the secret general staff. And s he will con- sider her children German. The woman who cannot help produce the next German g en- eration will find other ways to serve the nation, i n business and in politics, fighting with woman's weapons for Germanic world domination. And countless organizations alrea dy set up to utilize their desperate energies will provide whatever help is needed to facilitate their conquests. There is always the possibility that the women and the young people who have now experienced the real horr ors of war on their home soil will come to protest against war. They may even teach their children to hate it, as the mo thers of young Americans, Englishmen, and Frenchmen taught t heir children to hate war after 1918. But there remains the war within a war, toward which the efforts of the polit ical organ- izers in the German nation have been directed ever since 1940. Only when the women realize that the old sex and sy m- pathy appeals no longer get them anywhere, that the ammuni- tion for the secret war-in-peace is powerless, then —and only then—will they change. With the help of the small m inority of good women among them, and paralyzed by lack of re- sponse from the outside world, they can be made slo wly to revert to the standards of their decent forebears o f long ago, the old-time Germans, not yet poisoned with the vir us of pan-Germanism. 150"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"8 G E R M A N AND R U S S I A N R E A R M A M E N T IF EVER HYPOCRISY profited by gullibility on a gi- gantic scale, German hypocrisy did in rearming behi nd the general, blinding fear of Communism in the rest of the world. Behind, too, the Allied fear that if pushed too far , the de- feated colossus of Germany would join with the revo lutionary colossus of Soviet Russia. Back of this curtain of fear, the Germans worked wi th impunity. The German secret general staff evolved four campai gns in one, to circumvent the restrictions imposed by t he Ver- sailles Treaty: (1) Improvement in design and perform- ance of the weapons, and exploration of the military possibilities allowed by the Treaty clauses. (2) Methods of nullifying the clauses by rearmament at home. (3) Utilizing foreign countries as German rearmament bases. (4) Co-operation with Russia in joint re- armament, to train officers and soldiers, to evolve new war weapons, to secure new markets for German goods, to obtain new sup-"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ply sources, and to use trade and diplomatic relations with the Soviets as heavy artillery on the international battlefield. All four campaigns went forward simultaneously. Loopholes in the Versailles clauses furnished oppor tunities for cheating within Germany, but not enough to prep are for a full-fledged total war. Since undoubtedly the All ies would do some checking, there was but one thing to do—fin d sanctu- ary for German war industry in foreign countries. W ithin a few months billions of marks had been smuggled out of Ger- many. The reliable Neue Zuercher Zeitung set the fi gure of this \"emigrated capital\" cached in Switzerland at 3 5 billion marks, in June, 1919, when the mark was approximate ly fif- teen to the dollar. Even if the amount is exaggerat ed, sub- tracting a few billions still leaves a tremendous c apital. The many German companies started outside of Germany in the first years after the war proved the existence of f oreign re- sources, and quite a number of them were open or ma sked armament concerns. The Dornier Airplane Company, wi th headquarters near the Zeppelin works in Friedrichsh afen, simply moved across Lake Constance to Switzerland. The Rohrbach plant transferred to Denmark, Heinkel and Junkers established themselves in Sweden and Russia, all wi th the help of the German army. The Dutchman, Fokker, retu rned to Holland. Germany had been forbidden submarines—her submarine experts went abroad. Captain Canaris, now of the Ge rman secret military service, worked with shipyards and plants in Vigo, Spain. Captain Manfred von Killinger, who had justi- fied his name as a Free Corps leader, founded a com pany in 1924 in Echevarria, in Spain, to experiment with su bmarines. Other men went to Russia. In 1939 the German High C om- 152"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"mand expected to receive from its Russian treaty pa rtner sub- marines built in Russian docks established by Germa ns, at great expense, during the time when they were alleg edly too poor to pay reparations. Wherever the Interallied Commissions, appointed to super- vise German disarmament, went in postwar Germany, t hey met opposition. General John H. Morgan put it this way: \"For three years the Interallied Commissions, engaged in the invid- ious task of disarming Germany, met with every kind of re- sistance that German ingenuity could devise, and ev ery kind of excuse German naivete could invent. Obstruction there was always, duplicity often, and evasion not seldom.\" The Commission, which had no American members, trie d to find all the hidden weapons, but generally it re ceived as- sistance only from some of the Republican authoriti es and from individual pacifists. By the time it became known that Germany was actual ly rearming, many foreigners had already picked up the Ger- man propaganda line that the Treaty of Versailles h ad been forced on Germany, and that no self-respecting nati on would fulfill obligations it had not accepted of its own free will. The new thought was: work out something agreeable to ev erybody, even to Germany. That would at least keep her from a coali- tion with Russia. At the Genoa conference the same Germans who had pr o- claimed themselves the only bulwark against Communi sm stepped forth arm in arm with Chicherin and Litvino v, and announced the signing of the Russo-German Treaty of Ra- pallo of April, 1922. Faith in the Germans survived the blow so well that in 1925 the powers accepted as Germany's new president her wartime Field Marshal, Paul von Hindenburg, and his reac- tionary associates: the rabid Oldenburg-Januschau; the presi- 153"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"dent's son, the colorless but dangerous schemer, Ma jor Oscar von Hindenburg; and Oscar's closest friend, Kurt vo n Schleicher of the Reichswehr and War Office. And th e follow- ing October they signed the Locarno Treaty with the Germans. The next year, instead of being grateful for admitt ance to the League, Germany insisted that being restricted as to arma- ments, she could not agree to clause XVI of the Cov enant, which provided for military co-operation in case of sanctions, nor would she allow transit rights to foreign troop s. This res- ervation was a reassurance to Russia, with whom Ger many's ties had been strengthened by new, additional treat ies and agreements. Germany made her arguments sound convin cing enough, but even then the Allies knew she was not a dhering to the \"restrictions,\" and allowed her thus complet ely to emasculate the League. The hope of peace, it seems, dies hard. R U S S O - G E R M A N R E A R M A M E N T R E V E A L E D IN R E I C H S T A G On September 26, 1926, Philip Scheidemann rose in t he Reichstag and gave to his country and the rest of t he world a solemn, authenticated warning of the German militar istic con- spiracy with Soviet Russia. Scheidemann, the same S ocial- Democrat who had proclaimed the Republic, provided names, figures, and dates. He based part of his accusation on a mem- orandum of the Junkers Works, builders of all-steel planes. It showed that agreement had been reached with the Russians (through Ludendorff's associates, Nicolai and Schle icher), for the manufacture of German planes in Russia, of which the Russians were to retain part. \"According to this memorandum,\" Scheidemann said, \" the Reichswehr Ministry has a section known as Special Group, or SG.\" He then listed the names of the men in the group. 154"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"\"Since 1923, the SG has disposed of sums amounting to 70 million gold marks [$16,666,666 gold] per year,\" he con- tinued. \"One of Berlin's big banks holds a certain account under the name of Oscar Buchold. The signatures for the ac- count are certified by the War Office, the army Hig h Com- mand, the Arms and Ammunition section of the War Of fice.\" New firms had been created to carry out the numerou s trans- actions involved, Scheidemann revealed, known under alpha- betical names (GEFU and, later, WIKO). \"Their purpo se is to organize armament industries abroad, especially in Rus- sia.\" Referring to the Reichswehr's secret plans to incre ase Ger- man military strength, Scheidemann quoted from a sp eech of General von Tschichwitz in December, 1924: \"Our peo ple must again become soldiers. The training cannot be carried out in anybody's part time. Therefore one must find courses that will devote to it full time.\" Scheidemann stated that as a result of private coll ections to finance the work, for example, more than forty o fficers were working in Silesia as instructors in two small govern- mental districts, and in Pomerania thirty-six offic ers; in Halle, the Reichswehr maintained intimate connections with reaction- ary organizations; in Hanover, one Oberleutnant Voi gt, an ex- Putschist, conducted sports courses; in Kiel, the t rustee of the Naval Station, an officer named Lieder, had once di rected the Organization Consul in Schleswig-Holstein (the Orga nization Consul trained Free Corps men for political murder) ; Cap- tain Ehrhardt's Organization Consul had been given machine guns for target practice. Everyone who knew anythin g about the situation knew that Scheidemann's accusations w ere only a small part of the truth. The Rightists cried treason. Chancellor Wilhelm Mar x, a Centrist, promised to investigate. 155"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"In March 1927, the Executive of the Social-Democrat ic Party published a brochure, Soviet Shells. The writ er quoted from the Manchester Guardian sensational revelation s of mil- itary relations between Germany and Soviet Russia, naming German munitions plants in the Soviet and chemical factories manufacturing poison gas. Further, it cited the arr ival in Stet- tin in November, 1926, of Russian ships loaded with arms and ammunition for the German Army. The Social-Democrats found ample substantiation. Th ey published details of the poison-gas factory in Trot sk, built by the Hamburg firm of Dr. Hugo Stolzenberg through GE FU. A Social-Democratic deputy named Kuenstler intervie wed a number of men who had worked there. They had been c om- pelled to sign contracts pledging secrecy. Some of them went to the GEFU office at Keithstrasse 11 in Berlin abo ut a wage delay. The man in charge there was General von Borr ies, for- merly a ranking officer, and a member of the Reich Archives secret general staff. Deputy Kuenstler confirmed the report of Russian sh ip- ments of munitions to Stettin by interviewing Stett in dock workers. The pamphlet quoted a letter of General von Seeckt' s about GEFU, addressed to the Junkers Works, and saying th at von Seeckt approved of its behavior \"in every part.\" A further letter dated October 10, 1925, and signed by Lieute nant Colonel Senftleben states that the GEFU represented \"the in- terests of the Reichswehr Ministry.\" Note the dates. They show that while Germany was si gning peace pledges with the Allies, her army was already circum- venting them. The Scheidemann speech and the pamphlet were two re - sponsible warnings.

There wa s a flurry of excitement. A German officer on duty in Russia? When questioned in the Reichstag the War Ministry lied c lumsily and only attracted more attention. It was further l earned that Captain Amlinger was but one of many German officer s who had taken part in Russian army maneuvers. What lay behind these events? There are certain similarities between the Germans and the Russians. Both are endowed with extraordinary vital ity. Both talk much about social justice. Both accept regimen tation more easily than other nations. The rest of the wor ld has long been afraid that these two dynamic forces will merg e to con- trol the earth. Perhaps this is a hangover from the period when the wild Germanic tribes descended on western Europe from the vast East. Whatever the reason for the fea r, there it is. The German secret general staff made use of it. THE B A C K G R O U N D Chancellor Otto von Bismarck early advocated co-ope ra- tion between Germany and Russia. Together they coul d thumb their noses at the French Second Empire or Third Re public, at the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as well as at Great Britain and her empire. Although the Kaiser disliked Bismarck's pro-Russian pol- icy, many groups of Germans, like the Socialists, s ympa- thized with the masses \"suffering under the knout o f the Czar.\" Whenever unrest appeared in Russia, these me n rushed money to the revolutionaries. Germany's Intelligenc e Service, according to Colonel Nicolai, maintained a great ma ny opera- tives in Russia. Certainly without German help the Bolshevik revolution could not have succeeded; it was the Ger man High Command, in the person of General Ludendorff, which trans- 157"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ported Lenin through Germany to Russia in a sealed train. This service was not philanthropy—the High Command mis- takenly believed Lenin would be their puppet. Relations between the two countries were naturally strained after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but Lenin figure d that if the Germans could pave the way for his revolution in Ru ssia, Russian agents could prepare a revolution in German y. For that he must be on correct terms with Berlin. Conse quently he appointed a diplomatic representative, Joffe, a man close to the German Independent Socialists. Soon, however, the secret police in Berlin became s us- picious of the big cases of \"food\" Joffe received f rom Russia. One of them \"accidentally\" tumbled down the steps o f the railroad station. It disgorged piles of Communist p ropaganda. The German Government asked the diplomat to go home . Before he could get there, the German revolution br oke out. He returned to Berlin, claiming to have contributed vast sums to promote the revolution. Such statements delighted the German Nationalists. They angered the Socialists, with the implication that t he founders of the Republic had been bought. During a session of the German Constituent Assembly in Weimar, it was stated by a Socialist that investiga tion showed the Soviet donations rather unimportant. Anyone who lived in Germany in those days knows that there was no ne ed of foreign money to provoke the revolution. There was enough of hunger, cold, disappointment, and enough resentm ent over the lost war to start a dozen revolutions. The victorious Allies seemed to be mesmerized by th e Rus- sian sphinx. On looking over the files of my paper I find that on November 15, 1918, America felt deep uneasiness about reports of an impending alliance between the German Junk- kers and the Bolsheviks. A month later eleven Russi an divi- 158"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"sions were reported marching toward Germany along t he Gulf of Finland and the Dnieper. What was coming, a Russo- German alliance? In March, 1919, President Ebert's cabinet considere d a proposal by some German leaders that Germany, as th e Ger- man Soviets, ally herself with Russia. They rejecte d it be- cause of the probable resistance of the labor union s and con- sequent loss of life. Communists and Socialists hat e each other as only brothers can. In the East, from what was to be reborn Poland, Gen eral Max Hoffman, ordered to withdraw his troops, kept i n con- stant touch with the Russian military leaders. One point on which both the German and the Russian generals agre ed was their dislike of the Poles. The Germans suggested t hat if they could draw the Russians along with them as they gra dually moved homeward, it would be difficult for any Polis h state to spring up between them. In February, 1919, the Russ ians, on the heels of the Germans, had reached the line runn ing through Vilna-Baranovichi-Pinsk, close to the posit ion they occupied in 1939 by agreement with the Germans. The Allies suddenly woke up to the trick. They comp elled the Germans to leave enough space for the Poles to rebuild their state. The Germans obeyed. But by 1920 the Ru ssians had again pushed westward and fought the Russo-Poli sh war. The Germans pretended to be neutral and smuggled ar ms to the Russians. With French help, the Poles won. Afte r their defeat, the Russians asked German assistance in rea rming and training their forces. Nothing could have suite d the secret general staff better. They instantly envisioned the possibilities —a foothold in Russia, with as many production and training bases out of reach of the Allies as they could fina nce. 159"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"GERMAN P R E P A R A T I O N IN R U S S I A And while the co-operation between the German milit arists and the Russians became ever closer, General Ludend orff talked extensively with the British military repres entatives in Berlin about the Bolshevik menace. The only way to meet it, said the Kaiser's former chief of staff, was to all ow him to head an army of Germans, Englishmen, and Frenchmen in a campaign against the Soviets. Ludendorff was too in telligent a man to believe that the Allies would place their defeated adversary in command of a big armed force at the sa me time when they wanted peace—nothing but peace. His effor ts added to the general confusion which helped to camo uflage Germany's rearmament schemes. General Ludendorff's allies, the same German nation alists who sent their officers and engineers to Russia for military purposes, encouraged Adolf Hitler and his group in their violent anti-Communist campaigns. Pitched battles b etween the Republican forces or the Nazis and the Reds in numerous German centers somehow only rarely interrupted the cordial- ity of German and Russian relations. Both Moscow an d Ber- lin found their economic and military co-operation too valuable to disturb. And what did the Germans get from co-operation with Rus- sia? Just what they will get from any nation willin g to further Germany's imperialist purposes after World War II. In Russia she had factories scattered all over the cou ntry—in Leningrad, Moscow, Kuibyshev, the Don Basin, the Ke rch Peninsula, Perm, Sverdlovsh, Kherson, Kazan on the river Kama, Lipeck, Tambov, Luga, near Leningrad, Borisog lebsk —these are the names of only a few of the regions i n which German industries established themselves.

This close partnership was dissolved by mutual agre ement in the middle 1930's—but the factories, mines and a gricul- tural plantations which the Germans hoped to exploi t at some future date remained in existence. The Germans subs equently took great care to obtain as much information as po ssible about the plants they had helped to start in Russia , as well as about enterprises begun without their help. In the crucial mo- ment their knowledge proved defective, but not beca use of any lack of industry on the part of their economic intelli- gence service, or because of any laxity on the part of the government. In addition to the Krupps, the German Dye Trust, th e Hugo Stinnes organization, and other concerns directed o r owned plants in Russia.

Trade between the two countries flourished. It has since been revealed that Germany opened up credits for Ru ssia totaling 250 million dollars, partly with the help of English and American financiers who shied at the idea of de aling di- rectly with the Russians.

From the days of the Republi c down to the reclamation of Germany from the \"Bolshevik m enace\" by the Nazis, the Russian embassy was one of the mo st active and interesting centers in Berlin. In 1937, after the execution of the eight Soviet of ficers, including Marshal Tukhachevski, charged with conspi ring with a \"foreign power\" (Germany), a coolness became per- ceptible between the two countries. If the former A llies had been realistic then, they could have won Russia as their ally. As it was, by the spring of 1939 we knew that negot iations had been started between Russia and Germany. With t he sign- ing of the treaty in August, Nazi officials and Ger man officers were exultant. Herr Dr. Paul Schmidt of the Foreign Office pointed to a map of the world with his pudgy finger s, \"Our Minister simply took a big map,\" he said, \"and drew one long line all across the continent of Europe from N arvik to the Black Sea. East of the line is the Russian sphe re; west of the line is the German sphere.\" Despite this grandiose simplicity which, as Schmidt put it, \"shows that Hitler and Stalin think only in great t erms,\" there were Nazi leaders who feared the implications of the Russo-German treaty. Although it secured the German east- ern front, Rudolf Hess and Professor Haushofer took their courage in hand and remonstrated with the Fuehrer. Hitler told them not to worry, that he had a whole branch of the general staff working out details for the conquest of the Soviet Union—when he deemed the time ripe for attack. Toward the end of 1940 men in the Berlin Propaganda Ministry were full of an imminent Russian revolutio n. \"We have key men in every Ministry,\" they said, \"and wh en the time comes, they'll overthrow the Soviets and procl aim the government we have prepared for them.\" Some of the officials who traveled back and forth between Moscow and Berl in 162"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"were certain of success. Karl Boemer, Herr Goebbels ' foreign press chief, said, \"Then the world will see what Ge rman power really is. Just imagine what we can do with R ussia's resources. She squanders them almost as badly as Am erica does hers.\" He was so carried away that when I aske d him if Germany expected to take over the United States' re sources, too, he replied, \"Why, yes.\" The Nazis, who had worked hard to reduce the influe nce of the church in Germany, suddenly negotiated a church agree- ment with Moscow. They proclaimed an access of deep grief at the lack of Christian ministers in centers popul ated by descendants of the Germans who emigrated to Russia in past centuries. Moscow was not taken in. It knew well en ough that Berlin would send in stalwart, trained Nazi agents, in the guise of men of God. It allowed the new \"ministers\" to enter Russia, figuring that it would be easier to keep an eye on newly arrived, easily recognizable agents than on t hose al- ready at work in the country. Judging by the entici ng misin- formation with which the Germans were armed when th ey invaded their ally's territory, Russia must have ou t-smarted the confident Nazis. There came a strange period in the fall of 1940 whe n Nazi officials would tell us, as though imparting a stat e secret, \"The Russian system must have its good points. Othe rwise it would not have survived so long.\" Soviet Premier Mo lotov was in town, straightening out a few differences. It seemed that Germany had failed to deliver goods as per her trade agreements. She was trying to work the sa me old trick, delay deliveries until she had everything sh e wanted, letting her partner whistle for German goods. Then Germany would invade, wipe out the balance she owed, and he lp her- self to whatever was in reach. Comrade Molotov had come to Berlin to tell the Germ ans 163"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"they could not get away with such schemes with Russ ia. While he was there the Russian N.K.V.D. [the Cheka] and t he Ges- tapo were both on duty, getting in each other's way and itch- ing to arrest one another. Right in the middle of the Russian visit, the Briti sh made one of their biggest air raids of 1940. We were in the lobby of the Esplanade Hotel, where we had our office, an d I rec- ognized several Gestapo men. They were all green wi th fright. The Russians simply eyed them with cold contempt. In that same winter, the old die-hard conservatives did a great deal of worrying. Wasn't Russia getting too s trong? The story went, \"In sports, when both players lose three games, the score is even. In this war, when Germany loses three planes and England loses three, it is six to nothing for Russia.\" Just how far the Soviets trusted the Germans, I don 't know. But the Finnish campaign must have shown them where they stood. At its beginning a German officer, who happe ned to be an anti-Nazi, said to me, \"Germany is completely di shonored. We, the Germans, the old friends of the Finns, have given the plans of the Finnish fortifications to the Russians . Our engi- neers helped to build them, so we had the plans.\" H e added, \"I don't think it is possible for a country to sink any lower.\" The next time I saw him, his mood was much happier. \"My government is not as bad as I thought,\" he said. \"W e gave the Russians false plans. This is bound to give them a lot of trouble.\" Shortly before I left the German capital, this same man came to me with information. He had just come back to Ber- lin from protracted conferences with Hitler and sev eral gen- erals. They had warned Hitler that Stalin had been heard to say, before witnesses in German pay, \"Within two ye ars we shall be strong enough to take up the fight against Germany.\" 164"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"My informant was terrifically impressed with Hitler 's re- sponse. The Fuehrer had slapped his thigh in high s pirits. \"Calm yourselves, gentlemen,\" he said. \"I shall not give Stalin the two years he wants!\" The German officer went on to describe the coming campaign against Russia. \"He is a real military genius,\" the man said, \"his plan is full o f simplicity and grandeur.\" I asked him why Hitler should send h is crack motorized units to Rumania and establish them along the Black Sea. \"I can tell you,\" said my man. \"It is so simple, on ly a genius could have thought of it. From Rumania, our motor- ized units can push right through to the Russian oi l fields and occupy them. Russia has not enough oil reserves in the rest of the country, and what she does have will be fire d by our agents. Then the big Russian motorized army will be power- less. Besides, a campaign against Russia will enabl e Germany to reconquer the popularity she lost through her al liance with that country. All the capitalists of England and Am erica will be on our side.\" A number of factors contributed to Hitler's decisio n to in- vade Russia. He had long marked off part of the Ukr aine for the German supermen, and the claim to western Russi a was a heritage from the pan-German Mitteleuropa teachers. Then, the German larder was running low. Looted foo d from blitzed countries enabled the Germans to get t hrough the winter of 1941, but Food Minister Darre had mad e it emphatically clear that more resources must be acqu ired. Even the conquest of fertile Yugoslavia was to prov e insuffi- cient. There was the need for motor fuel. When I called on the German charge d'affaires in Washington in July, 194 1, for a return visa to Germany, I asked him outright why Hi tler had invaded Russia. One rarely gets an honest answer fr om a 165"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Nazi diplomat, but often an interesting one. I had known Dr. Hans Thomsen since the early days of the Republic. He said just one word: \"Oil.\" Naturally the Nazis coveted the Russian oil fields. But since they had large synthetic reserves and had tak en over the Rumanian output, there must have been some more imp elling motive than just a general need for oil to make Hit ler under- take the big push into the Soviet Union, to disrega rd the one great German fear—a two-front war. Even knowing tha t to begin with the Rumanian yield was small, amounting to only 6.5 million tons a year compared to the Caucasus fl ow of 24 million tons for Russia, knowing also that the dryi ng Ru- manian wells produce less each year, that Rumanian patriots consistently sabotaged production for the hated Ger mans and the Antonescu clique, Hitler must have wanted oil, lots of it, for a specific purpose. Early, in the flush of summer victories of 1940, Hi tler had instructed certain officers of his staff to prepare as if war with the United States were imminent. Germany could not carry out raids against America without astronomica l re- serves of oil. Her failure to capture the Caucasus fields has prevented the big raids against the United States o n which Hitler and his chieftains counted. And what kept them from it? Therein lies a story. At the end of 1940, the German agents in Russia, wh om Boemer had mentioned, sent word that they and their under- ground were ready to rise and overthrow Stalin. Hit ler had won many triumphs through traitors, from the beginn ing of his crooked political climb to the big humiliation of the French at Compiegne. Now he felt himself on the cre st of another tidal wave. Shortly after the Germans had attacked Russia, ther e came a week end when both Hitler's press chief, Dr. Otto Dietrich, 166"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"and Propaganda Minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels forecas t an- nouncements of \"overwhelming importance.\" The Germa n radio blared martial music for hours on end, as it always did before spectacular victory reports. Foreign corresp ondents were told to be ready to \"go on a sensational trip. \" No news came, either good or bad. The radio fell si lent. The foreign reporters were sheepishly told to stay home. Then messages that leaked out from Russia through Sweden reported the arrest by the Russian secret po lice of a number of men suspected of sympathizing with the Ge rmans. There would be no new Russian revolution. If Hitler had not believed a German coup attainable in Russia, he would not have changed his plan of attac k, and he might have succeeded. Instead of throwing the whole of his offensive forces eastward in a drive on the Caucasu s, he had split them, sending part of them north toward the c apitals of Leningrad and Moscow, counting on quisling aid. The re were no Russian traitors. And the German forces in the C aucasus were too weak to break through. This was not the only error Hitler had made. But th e secret general staff also miscalculated. They had co-opera ted with Russia and located indispensable plants on Russian soil be- cause they counted on dictating to the Kremlin in c ase of war. With Russia passive or neutral, Germany could wipe out all other countries in the path of her world supremacy. But to keep Russia on their side, the General Staff must c ontrol the man it had made master of Germany. And Hitler would not be controlled. Instead he succeeded in dividing the High Command i nto two clearly defined factions: officers of his own p ersonal gen- eral staff and the regular General Staff men.

Both sides were stubborn. Ranking army officers disapproved violently of some of Hitler's strategies. General von Hammerstein, Germa ny's foremost expert on Russia, who had worked in that c ountry in the 1920's developing German and Russian rearmam ent, was no longer on active duty when Hitler started pr eparing his invasion of Russia. He was one of the few leadi ng officers of Germany who absolutely refused to take orders fr om Hit- ler. He resigned and withdrew to his country estate , where incidentally, the Nazis tried to assassinate him on a number of occasions. Despite these experiences, General vo n Ham- merstein emerged from retirement and asked for an a udience when he heard that Hitler was planning to attack Ru ssia. The Nazis were delighted. They thought he had come to c limb on the bandwagon. Instead, von Hammerstein said in icy tones, \"I came to you because as a German officer, I felt it my duty to w arn you.\" He went on to insist that Hitler must not be deceiv ed by the Russian showing in Finland; that if any power invad ed Rus- sia, it might win initial victories, but that the a rmy and the people would eventually annihilate the invader. The n he left. General von Hammerstein has since died. Nobody outs ide Germany knows whether he died a natural death or no t. The old army man had estimated correctly the great hear t and spirit of sacrifice of the Russian people. Hitler w as blind to them both, as he was to the endurance of the Britis h and the patriotism of the United States.

As the creator of the Reichswehr, and consequently of the Wehrmacht, General von Seeckt put it, \"We know how to make the best of the situation.\" In the early 1920' s ranking German officers told my father, while sitting for t heir por- traits, that they had evolved a perfect system of t raining men for two years and then sending them out to other pa rts of the country to drill recruits. The Allies had stipulate d that Reichswehr soldiers must serve twelve years, in ord er to pre- vent the short-term enlistments which the Prussians had intro- duced to raise the army with which they chased Napo leon out of their territory. But making a rule and enforcing it are two different things. By the end of the 1920's, there s hould have been a great number of men in the Reichswehr nearin g or over thirty. Nobody watching a Reichswehr parade ev er saw more than a few. The Allies had also forbidden Germ any an air force, big guns, antiaircraft guns, tanks, armo red cars, or heavy mine throwers. Only a few heavy guns were all owed to remain in fortifications and on ships. The Germans used every loophole they could find in the Versailles Treaty and, where there was none, they c ould al- ways make use of the lack of unity among the Allies . Before long the restrictions on the construction of German planes, on their speed and power, were dropped. The y had to be commercial planes, of course. But the most casua l traveler in Europe soon knew that Germany flew passenger pla nes without any passengers, to innumerable towns where there could be no air freight, so that the crews could ga in experi- ence. When commercial planes got to Russia and were re- outfitted, they became good experimental military s hips.

Nobody needs reminding of the importance of the gli ders which German \"enthusiasts\" took up to compensate fo r lack of regular planes with engines. We know how their u se was co-ordinated with powered planes for war transport. By means of lavish subsidies to airplane manufacturers , the in- dustry speedily centralized itself, with the main f irms pooling their discoveries and accelerating production. Often at army maneuvers I saw odd little cardboard con- traptions bearing huge signs, \" TANKS ,\" they said. The Germans pointed to them indignantly as symbols of t he hu- miliation and shackles of Versailles. This complain t was fine propaganda to stir up German resentment. In reality German tank builders circumvented those restrictions, too. In 1920, in the note of Boulogne, the Allies allowe d the Germans to build a number of small armored cars for the police. The next year they gave them permission to construct small armored troop-transport cars for the Reichswe hr—not a large quantity, but adequate for experimental use . Allied inspectors could not visit all the plants in German y to make sure that she was keeping her promises. And, of cou rse, many factories were hidden. But building armored cars an d ar- mored transport cars made it possible for the Germa ns to experiment also with tanks. During the 1920's we saw huge busses on German city streets, with six- and eight-wheel chassis. The aut horities as- sured us that they had no military significance. Bu t those undercarriages had been designed for war trucks and were developed and so used after 1939. The Germans never meant to remain satisfied only wi th the heavy guns they built in Russia.

The Allies were not fussy about what we did with our ve ssels. We made many trips,\" he said, \"to try out our guns. It was on our ships that we perfected our antiaircraft artill ery.\" The Rheinmetall-Borsig works always kept a skeleton staff of experts, who were, while the Interallied Commiss ions stayed on duty, very cagey. The Voelkischer Beobachter of April 15, 1943, quote s a speech given by Dr. Karl Waninger to members of the Tech- nisch-Literarische Gesellschaft on his experiences as an arma- ment manufacturer with the Rheinmetall-Borsig Compa ny. \"The prohibition of development of any new guns in Ger- many led to a cautious and farsighted measure when in July, 1921, at the demand of the Reich Naval Command, the firm opened a construction branch on the Friedrichstrass e in Ber- lin disguised as a transfer office. Because of an a nonymous denunciation,\" Dr. Waninger said, \"the Interallied Military Control Commission attempted to locate the artiller y con- struction office. This naturally met with no succes s.\" In 1922 the office moved to Duesseldorf and continued, \"und er the very eyes of the French occupation authorities.\" Fr om there, headquarters transferred to \"our artillery range in Unter- luess, in the Lueneburger Heide (a vast almost unin habited heath near Hanover), where it divided into two sect ions, one for naval construction and the other for manufactur e of army guns.\" Then, \"A new and small gun factory was set up and s tarted work in 1925, despite all sorts of difficulties.

We fulfilled this task to t he complete satisfaction of the German navy, at the same time c reating a precedent in the building of triple turrets in Germ any. . . . Rheinmetall took a decisive part in equipping the a rtillery with guns up to the heaviest caliber. Afghanistan, Argentina, Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Holland, Rumania, San Sa lvador, Turkey, and Hungary were among the nations which we sup- plied after 1933.\" It is easy to see why Rheinmetall-Borsig and plants like it were fully equipped to produce war materiel when th e pre- tense of disarmament was thrown aside. They are dem onstra- tions of the efficiency and intelligence of the sec ret general staff and its economic and industrial subdivisions, pouring foreign loans into Germany's industrial machine and utilizing every kind of dodge and camouflage to hide its mili tary intent. Colonel Konstantin Hierl, who served under General von Seeckt, said in a speech before the Nuremberg Party Caucus in 1929, \"A government that is aware of its respons ibilities will not fail to crank up its armament industry in secret when it sees war approaching.\" The approach of war could best be seen by the men who meant it to come and they \"cran ked up\" the German armament industry to good effect. When m anipu- lations of the Herrenklub, which united most of the secret general staff socially, helped put Franz von Papen in the chancellor's chair, he did his best to ring into hi s cabinet as vice-chancellor the man who had the huge National S ocialist Party and the semimilitary Storm Troopers behind hi m. Hitler refused the vice-chancellorship as well as a later offer of the chancellorship with limited powers. He wanted all or nothing. When he finally became chancellor on Ja nuary 172"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"30, 1933, he had what he wanted, including Papen un der his thumb. He also found everything ready for open rearmament. The western world was then struggling through the a fter- math of the depression. It presented a tempting pic ture of weakness to the conquest-minded Germans. As General von Seeckt said in his Thoughts of a Soldier, \"A defens eless neighbor is the strongest inducement to war.\" (The phrase was coined in an effort to make the world feel sorr y for Ger- many, allegedly so weak, but the lesson implied was under- stood by the Nazis and the general's successors.) In the Reichswehr, Hitler found an instrument of ex traor- dinary power. Because it was small, its commanders had greatly developed the striking power of each indivi dual man, carefully co-ordinating at the same time the new eq uipment and the new services required. The noncommissioned officers had been trained as officers. And in addition to th e army, Hit- ler could draw on the vast reservoir of half-traine d men in the different semimilitary organizations. The German pacifist Carl Mertens estimated that in 1930 Germany had 374,000 trained soldiers. This figure b reaks down into: Effectives in the Reichswehr ....................... ............. 99,000 Military police, border guards, railroad guards— bodies in which the Reichswehr camouflaged some of its illegal manpower ....................... ......... 110,000 Men in semimilitary units like the Steel Helmets and the Storm Troopers............................. ............ 150,000 Civilian employees of the Reichswehr (who car- ried out military tasks which other armies assign to soldiers) .................................... ...................... 15,000 Thanks to the four-part plan of the secret general staff, the German factories were only awaiting the word. When Goer- ing began his airplane program, most of the necessa ry plants 173"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"were already nicely co-ordinated in the holding com pany of the German government itself. The Reich's Vereinigt e Indus- trie Aktien-Gesellschaften, or VIAG, included metal works, huge electrical plants, aluminum concerns. That is just one example. Among many others, there is the fact that the Ger- man Dye Trust, the I.G. Farbenindustrie, shared in or con- trolled innumerable foreign chemical plants, oil re fineries, plastic factories, all of them sources of war mater ials—be- sides their incredibly extensive domestic industria l empire. Through cartel agreements they were not only able t o draw on the resources and inventions of foreign countries, but they were also able to restrict production of essential supplies in countries the Germans planned to attack. With open rearmament, with the German Army constant ly enlarging and training its personnel, and backed by the full industrial might of the nation, Hitler took three b old steps. He invaded the Rhineland, he proclaimed conscriptio n, he announced through Goering the creation of a superla tive air force. But with the Beer Hall Putsch General LudendorfFs p upil had learned one indelible lesson in caution. How co uld he be absolutely sure that the armaments, the troops, wer e as fine as the High Command said they were? He must try them o ut before he risked the big gamble. R E H E A R S A L FOR WORLD WAR II Secretly, by devious methods, German soldiers reach ed Spain. Ambassador von Stohrer, General von Faupel, the whole considerable body of Germans in Spain, reinfo rced by all the young men who could, under some pretext, cl aim Spanish or South American citizenship, prepared the big re- hearsal of the German army. When the friction betwe en the different Spanish groups broke out, the Germans wer e there, 174"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"ready to try their organizations and successive del iveries of weapons. The weapons were good. The men and the reinforcemen ts which followed the first groups got battle training . The offi- cers' tactics were found satisfactory, although som e of the new ones had still to be kept secret. Germany was ready for war. When the new German antiaircraft guns, used against Barcelona, forced the town to surrender, Hitler in Berlin was triumphant. To his intimates, he boasted. \"The fall of Bar- celona means that all of Europe will be ours. I sha ll be mas- ter of 350 million people.\" Even his intimates were shaken. Could he be mad? But his confidence was so tremendo us that despite the doubts which the more cautious expresse d, he went ahead, certain that the stars were with him. Those naval antiaircraft guns which reduced Barcelo na were perfected to the point where they were both la nd and air weapons, weapons both of defense and offense, on wa r vessels far out at sea in the days when the Allies \"were no t fussy\" about what the Germans did with their ships. To lull the world into a feeling of security the Na zis signed a pact of friendship with Poland even before they s ent their troops to Spain. In fact, pacts between Germany and the di- verse states of Europe became the order of the day. The die- hard peace lovers grew very angry at the President of the United States for wanting Hitler to guarantee that he had no plans for aggression against his neighbors. How cou ld anyone doubt his peaceful intentions? Even if he was rearm ing, even if the men called to the colors were steadily incre asing in number, even if the guns, the airplanes, the weapon s the Ger- mans displayed at their parades, were the newest, t he most threatening-looking weapons ever seen—still they ta lked peace. 175"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Hitler signed a naval pact with England, promising to limit his naval armaments. What more could anyone expect? Why mention reports about the secret construction of su bmarines in violation of this agreement? Hitler still talked of peace. The labor camps of Ge rmany were merely physical training centers for boys. The Hitler Youth, the Storm Troopers, the Schutz Staffel—they prac- ticed with rifles, maybe, even sometimes with guns— but they still loved peace, said the optimists. Then Hitler lunged out and took Austria, with its m ineral resources and war plants. He mutilated and conquere d Czechoslovakia, and seized her powerful armament in dustry, fortifications, and reserves. Officially Germany had 70 divisions in 1939, but a few months later the official figure was 260 divisions and 8 mil- lion men, including the labor battalions and the Sc hutz Staff el. But Germany didn't want war; she was \"encircled\" by her enemies, who \"forced\" war upon her. Nobody who has seen German officials and German bus i- nessmen work overtime, for very little money, will insult his own intelligence or their industry by assuming that they had no plan. We will hear again and again for years aft er the Second World War that we wrong them, that they had no mili- tary ambitions, no dream of world conquest. But there was a time when they gave themselves away . Dur- ing the period when victory seemed to be within gra sp, the Nazis in Berlin not only gloated over their triumph s, but they even talked freely of the long preparations they ha d under- taken and of the limitless horizon of their future campaigns. It was then that fierce rivalries sprang up in the Nazi Party over who should be Gauleiter of England, or of Afri ca; when the wife of Philipp Bouhler (on duty in Hitler's Ch ancellery), had plans drawn for the Gauleiter's palace in Kenya and 176"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"bought 60,000 marks' worth of furniture for it; whe n more than one important Nazi let slip remarks about the interna- tional currency Germany would establish; when the G ermans discussed how they would use Russia's resources: wh en they talked about the great number of business and apart ment buildings seized in Berlin to provide administrativ e quarters for their new Empire. And not only the big fellows talked. Little men who had grown colorless in their work, men of the Ministry of Eco- nomics, plant officials, people who had never made enough money to keep their teeth in repair, suddenly came to life. They talked about the glittering future of Germany, or the years of secret preparations, of study and scheming behind them, and they made one realize that nothing in the world would make them give up their vision of world maste ry for Germany. They were the unknown soldiers of bureaucracy, humb le men, yet dangerous enough. For they have worked for the German secret general staff to bring about World Wa r II and to win it. And they will continue to work during th e war-in- peace to follow. 9 N A Z I S M IS C O N T A G I O U S MANY PEOPLE try to interpret developments in Europe , and especially in Germany, through their knowledge of old- time, upright Germans. Yet the German character, bo th na- 177"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"tional and individual, has in the last fifty years changed to such a degree that what was a logical estimate of c haracter in World War I is sheer foolishness in World War II. It can be said immediately that fundamental charact er does not change. True, it does not. But if for years exp ert psychol- ogists, teachers, rabble rousers, organizers, and o rators con- centrate on developing and enlarging certain traits of the peo- ple under their control in a carefully concerted ca mpaign, they will be able to achieve very important alterat ions in the character of those people. If, furthermore, they ch oose charac- teristics which already reside in the minds of the people, tendencies which educators of preceding eras had so ught to eradicate, they cannot fail. That is what has happened in Germany and, to a cert ain extent, to Germans in foreign countries. The German met the pan-German creed in every depart - ment of his life even before Hitler—in his office, his coffee house, his newspaper, his poetry, his wife's conver sation, in the talk of his children home from school. To be a pan-Ger- man conveyed a special sense of superiority. As its teachings trickled down from the upper classes, it made the l ower classes feel that they, too, belonged to the elite. In World War I, \"Berlin to Bagdad\" was no longer me rely the Kaiser's pet slogan; it became a reality. Germa n soldiers penetrated deep into Russia, into Palestine, into I raq—they got to Bagdad. And wherever they went they were tol d of Ger- many's claims to all land ever inhabited by persons of Ger- man \"blood.\" These men had, all their lives, been the obedient s ubjects of His Imperial Majesty the Kaiser. Now, as they ad vanced from country to country, they were taught to feel s uperior to the local populations. Suddenly the lowest among th em was 178"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"told that he was better than the rest of the world. That assur- ance was comforting indeed. It was hard to take defeat—more, to be forced to re lin- quish not only land they had conquered, but also so me that their fathers had won. Among the adventurous, pan-G erman- ism was only intensified by the failure of the war. For the sake of future conquests, they accepted the leaders hip of the secret general staff and later of the Nazis. The German army, its drillmasters, Hitler, Himmler, et al have aroused, stimulated, and exaggerated traits an d instincts which have slumbered in the German people for centu ries, to the point where the friendly German in whom so many Ameri- cans still believe has ceased to be an important fa ctor in any German group. He is the German of yesterday. It is the Ger- man of today with whom we have to deal, the arrogan t, ruth- less, intelligent schemer who either suavely hides his intentions or openly boasts of his brutality. It must be stressed that this new German has nothin g in common with the descendants of old-time Germans in the United States and other countries. Early German imm igrants left their native land because they wanted to build up a new and different kind of life. Generally, their grandc hildren have had the advantage of other than pan-German educatio n. They owe no loyalty to the Germany of today, for it is n ot the same nation from which their forebears stemmed. And de- spite the high-pressure campaigns of the Nazis and their affili- ates, the vast majority of German-Americans know as much. Re-education of the people—that was the thing. Gene ral Ludendorff and his inner circle started on it immed iately by making them believe the fable that German arms had not been defeated. And they had the structure of pan-Ge rmanism on which to build: a pan-German is superior; superi or beings are invincible; Germany is a superior body—therefor e Ger- 179"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"many was not defeated. True, some features of the V ersailles Treaty made it easy for the reactionaries to stir u p resentment among the German people. But even had there been no Polish Corridor, nor any suspicion of figure-juggling in p lebiscites, the people had felt close to victory for four years and they would still have been resentful. They were further trained to resent the treatment o f Ger- man groups outside of Germany. Some of the minoriti es sep- arated from the body of the German people in 1919 m ay have had a rather thin time for a while. But they fared infinitely better than the liberated foreign minorities had do ne under German rule. Such information, however, was not par t of the new-German education. German history books have been made to disguise or glo- rify the ancient German thirst for expansion, to cl aim that the other fellow was unfair in having a finer place in the sun than the Germans. Therefore Germany had a right to be re stless. Christian forces in the old Germany worked to curb and guide the dissatisfied, restless German spirit. The secret gen- eral staff and later the Nazis, exploited it with a masterly in- sight into the character of their own countrymen. In our era, outside influences have come close to u s through the radio, the newspapers, movies, publicity campai gns, and easy transportation. As a result something interest ing has happened to the mass mind. Ready-made opinions and enter- tainment and predigested literature are now part of our lives, along with ready-made clothes. Often the mechanical wonders of our age become all-important in themselves, to t he detri- ment of thought. But the point is that in Germany the militarists ha ve per- verted the trend to their own use.

Hitler was absorbed in contemplation of some engine part. As I watched, he turned from it and, staring blankl y into space, muttered, \"Strange that these machines and a ll the thousands of other machines in our factories should be chang- ing the human character. But they are. The man who drives his car at top speed has developed a totally new se t of re- flexes. He does not think any more before he makes a move— there is no time to think. For his own safety he mu st react with lightninglike speed. Therefore he must act aut omatically, almost like a machine. A good part of his energy go es into automatic reflexes instead of into thought. That is why in our day and age the number of people who think for them selves is dwindling. They don't have time for thought. Tha t makes it possible for the men who know what they want to lea d the masses more easily than ever before.\" As he turned away, I saw the gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.

No other contrast could have underlined so well the changes in the German character. In 1914 a young Norwegian cousin and I roamed throu gh the Berlin streets, quite evidently foreigners, and experienced nothing but friendliness from the people. We saw th e Kaiser address the crowds from the balcony of his castle. We saw the citizens bring bouquets of the chubby little red ro ses that bloom in August and throw them to the uniformed tro ops with their spiked helmets, marching to war with their ba nds blar- ing, the brasses glittering in the sunshine. The cr owds always shoved us ahead to help us see what was going on. All through the early part of the war my mother and I could see how convinced the Germans were that they would win. They celebrated the fall of Liege, of Antwerp, the ad- vance into France, the sinking of the Lusitania. Ch urch bells pealed, banners floated from nearly every window, c hildren were dismissed from school because of some success that promised victory. After the United States had joine d the Allies, mother and I had to report daily to the pol ice as enemy aliens. Yet, although our movements were restricted , we sel- dom felt in actual danger. On that September day of 1939, however, when the Fu ehrer gave the order to march, Germany was a grim, a purp oseful country. Troops left the Berlin railway station wit hout cheers. In fact the only cheers heard in the streets came f rom a few people who had been ordered out in organized groups by their Nazi cells. The streets leading to the temporary Re ichstag in the Kroll Opera House where Hitler was to speak wer e lined with police, and with Schutz Staffel men in field g ray battle dress instead of their customary black uniforms. In that somber Berlin one could realize only too cl early that what had remained of gemuetlich Deutschland ha d now been swept away. The atmosphere hung heavy with sus picion 182"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"and hatred of all foreigners, including representat ives of neutral countries. Only the young people celebrated when the Germans marched into Paris, when the French Armistice was s igned at Compiegne in 1940. Their elders, whether they we re Nazis or not, remembered that wars can be lost after many big vic- tories. The non-Nazis whispered dejectedly, \"Do you think that means the end of the war?\" The Nazis said grim ly, \"This is a total war. Every ounce of energy must be mobil ized in the war effort. None must be lost in celebrations.\" \"Don't misunderstand the lack of cheering crowds,\" the Nazi Prince Auwi said to me in the lobby of the Rei chstag. \"It only means that this time we are conserving our energy for victory. Everyone concentrates on the task assi gned to him.\" The Nazis tried to maintain a correct footing with the for- eign correspondents, who had just seen their French and English colleagues hurry away to escape detention i n Ger- many. Still, relations were strained. Nor did they improve as we realized that the Gestapo, together with all the diiferent agencies detailed to supervise foreigners, had beco me more active than ever. Traps were set for us. If we had failed to sidestep German and foreign agents provocateurs we would have landed in Nazi prisons. During World War I a hushed silence would greet the mention of the invasion of Belgium. I remember the German professor of international law at the Berlin Univer sity under whom I studied before the United States entered the war. Professor von Martitz marched up and down the class room literally tearing his gray hair because German troo ps had violated Belgian neutrality. \"This is a crime,\" the old man said, \"and you will see—Germany will be punished fo r it.\" I looked around the classroom at the other students , about 183"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"five young men in field gray, evidently soldiers at home on sick leave. They seemed to share the anxiety and sh ame of the professor. And nothing happened to the old man for ex- pressing freely his regret at an act of aggression by the Im- perial government. But the average German of 1939 and 1940 apparently felt no compunction when Hitler's troops invaded one ill -armed neutral country after another without formal declar ation of war. When German ships masquerading under foreign f lags sailed into peaceful harbors, as they did in Denmar k, in Nor- way, in Holland, and then turned their guns on defe nseless populations, the average German had no qualms of co nscience nor did he bemoan the betrayal of human decency. Wh en so- called \"tourists\" visiting Copenhagen suddenly emer ged from their hotel rooms in German uniforms and helped Naz i troops seize Denmark, when German sailors stole Norwegian uni- forms and tried to march on Christiansand in violat ion of all military law, no protest was heard. Conversation among most Germans centered about just how much food and other loot they would be getting out of the conquered countries. I tried to speak of this d ietary re- action of the population over the radio to the Unit ed States when Norway and Denmark were invaded. My broadcast was so slashed by the censors that I refused to go on t he air. Granted that if anyone had dared to voice objection s as Professor von Martitz did he would have been drawn and quartered or sent to a concentration camp, which is rarely better. The fact that Hitler and Himmler had to res ort to con- centration-camp methods to enforce their rule showe d that there were Germans who rejected their teachings. Th ey were numerous enough to convince the Nazis that they mus t be cowed by terrorizing and persecuting their potentia l leaders. But they were not numerous enough to form an effect ive force. 184"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"I met nobody of importance in the political scene w ho dis- played the slightest embarrassment, much less shame , for Hit- ler Germany's acts of aggression against almost una rmed neutral nations. The fine and decent people who wer e dis- turbed could do nothing, because they were so few a nd be- cause they were without influence. They were, in fact, the exceptions who gave point t o the rule. The militarists and the Nazis had conditioned the Ger- man nation to condone any action the government or its agents might take as long as it furthered German aggrandiz ement. Disregarding the apprehensions of some and objectio ns of others among its more moderate leaders, the army ma de good use of the instrument placed ready to its hand—the mass power psychosis, instilled in the people by the Naz is to sup- plant the \"weakness of Christianity.\" ATROCITIES CONDONED IN WORLD WAR II The war had barely started when we began hearing fr om anti-Nazis about the crimes committed by the black- uni- formed Schutz Staffel in Poland, in the wake of the regular army. Then we heard of a few officers insisting on the court martial of Black Guards caught massacring Polish an d Jewish men, women, and children. One court decreed the dea th sen- tence for these Black Guards, but Heinrich Himmler inter- ceded with Hitler in their behalf before any of the m was executed. The few officers who expressed their indi gnation were removed to minor posts and deprived of any hop e of advancement. As far as the Germans were concerned, the matter was settled. One did not have to rely on non-Nazis to learn of G erman atrocities in invaded countries. All during the cam paigns in the East, all one had to do was to go to one of the waiting- rooms of the railroad stations in eastern Berlin an d listen to 185"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"the Black Guards arriving from or leaving for the f ront. They seemed to enjoy describing how they had locked Pole s and Jews into cellars and then thrown hand grenades thr ough windows left open for the purpose. A few people discussed the necessity of making some kind of protest. But if the attempt of the army officers had met only with punishment, what could anyone else do? The Nazis found a simple way of handling foreign re action. They told their agents abroad to brand any report o f crimes an \"untrue atrocity story, reminiscent of the propa ganda cam- paigns of World War I.\" They knew that anything lab eled \"propaganda\" is disbelieved in America. The method worked perfectly—at least until Pearl Harbor. Many people in the United States read the reports of crimes perpetrate d by the Nazi troops as if they were detective stories, horr or stuff, that might raise some gooseflesh, yet need not be taken seriously. But the German people learned with surprising speed the truth about the German bestialities in Poland, as i t had known about the murder of Czechs after the rape of Czecho slovakia. And why? They were told by their government—to comp el them to share the guilt of what was done. On the wh ole the people reacted with unforgivable indifference. The Catholics displayed a little more compassion for the Poles th an the rest of the citizenry, possibly because the Poles are Ca tholic. There was one Black Guard who boasted freely, withi n hearing of terrified Catholic nuns, about the numbe r of Poles and Jews he had liquidated. When his wife bore a cr ippled baby in a Berlin Catholic hospital, the Catholics w hispered, \"It is God's punishment for his crimes.\" But that w as all. \"Follow me blindly. I am your leader,\" Hitler deman ded. \"Believe what I tell you.\" And the masses did belie ve. My maid arrived one morning with red eyes, swollen fro m weep- ing. Her husband had been enlisted as a stretcher b earer at a 186"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"hospital near Berlin. He had told her for hours of the night how horribly the Poles had mutilated Germans in Pol ish ter- ritory before the German troops had gone in. He des cribed in gruesome detail how they had burned off the skin of their vic- tims, bit by bit, until the limbs were just charred stumps. I thought it rather strange that a stretcher bearer on duty near Berlin could know so much about wounds which m ust have been well bandaged for the trip from Poland. I ques- tioned the maid. \"Are you sure those stories are true?\" I asked. \"Ho w could a stretcher bearer in Berlin see so much?\" She was offended that I should doubt her word. But later she confessed that her husband had not actually see n any of the things he had spoken about so vividly. However he had seen \"authentic\" slides on the subject accompanying a lecture by one of the Black Guards. My questioning her husb and's word convinced my maid that I lacked the proper sym pathy for the Nazi cause. But she didn't, and couldn't, r ealize that that lecture accomplished two steps in the molding of minds along the Hitler pattern—it aroused hatred of the P oles, and it provided graphic lessons in administering tortur e. It wasn't long before my maid was one more servant in the Gestapo system keeping tabs on the activities of th e corre- spondents. Our mail, our telephone conversations, o ur visi- tors, were all regularly reported to the police. THEY L A U G H E D TOO E A R L Y The Black Guards were not the only Germans to rejoi ce at the suffering of the Poles, both Jewish and Gentile . At the pre- view of the first official newsreels of the war, ar ranged at the Propaganda Ministry for our benefit, I was struck b y the squeals and shouts of delight from leading German o fficials at sight of pictures of those anguished Polish pris oners. Pur- 187"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"posely I went to see the same newsreel at a public theatre. The images of unhappy Jews in caftans or merely in rags were flashed on the screen—poor helpless souls, evi dently terrified of their German captors. Immediately ther e were loud guffaws and shrieks of laughter. Apparently no one in the audience wondered how their own people would lo ok as defeated prisoners. After the first reports of the mass murders committ ed by the Nazis in Poland, I happened to meet the leader of the women in Germany, Dr. Erich Hilgenfeldt, at an offi cial re- ception in Berlin. He talked a lot about the constr uctive wel- fare work done by the Germans. I used that as a sta rter for some discreet questioning. He was not in the least reticent. Instead he seemed eager to talk. He called over two other Schutz Staffel offic ers to satisfy my curiosity. After some conversation, the officer with the most silver braid on his black uniform said petulan tly, \"I don't see why you Anglo-Saxons get so excited about what happens to a few Poles. Your reaction shows you and your countrymen do not have the scientific approach to t he prob- lem.\" One of the men in the group was Dr. Roland Freisler , sec- retary of state in the Ministry of Justice. One alw ays had to be careful in talking with men of his type, but sci ence is a safe subject for starting a Nazi off to say more th an he means to. The three men gave me a revealing lecture when I accepted the bait and asked, \"And what is the scientific app roach?\" M U R D E R FOR THE W H I T E RACE \"Do you people realize what is happening to the whi te race?\" This was the near-sighted Nazi with thick-le nsed glasses. I admitted that I did not know the German \"scien- tific\" version. 188"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"\"For every twenty-two persons of pure white blood b orn every minute, there are eighty-five Slav births. If that should go on, by 1960 the Slav populations, including the Poles, would have double the numbers of the white populati ons.\" Hilgenfeldt looked at me, obviously expecting me to be shat- tered by this revelation. Years of reporting had ta ught me that one can do anything with statistics. I merely said, \"Do you mean to say that the Slavs do not belong to the white race?\" \"Certainly not. Or at least on a very inferior leve l.\" Hil- genfeldt, the racial \"scientist\" of the Schutz Staf fel, almost snarled as he moved away. Freisler took his leaving as a sig- nal that he could speak freely. \"We indulge in no false sentimentality,\" he said. \" We shall not allow any of our neighbors to have a high er birth rate than ours, and we shall take measures to preve nt it. The Slavs outnumber us.\" It seemed that the Slavs and t he Jews would be permitted to survive if they worked for Ge rmany. \"But only if they work for us,\" he repeated. \"And w e'll see that they work as we want them to. If they don't th ey can starve.\" Then Freisler touched on the crux of the matter. \"W e'll see that none of their men will ever get enough edu cation to become leaders.\" And added, \"When 1960 comes, we'll see that the birth rate is in our favor, not that of an y Slavs.\" Like many another Nazi, Freisler was ready to commi t any crime to forestall \"racial extinction.\" If one of our leg men had brought in such a story, I would have been skeptical. But I was there, hearing the s tatements made deliberately by a powerful Nazi, a man so full of his scheme to exterminate the race he feared that he di dn't re- alize, or care, how horrifying his remarks appeared to an American. 189"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"S C I E N T I F I C \"NORDIFICATION\" ( A U F N O R D U N G ) Freisler even told me of a plan prepared by the Sch utz Staffel racial office to incorporate blond Poles in to the Ger- man family. A big proportion of the Black Forest po pulation is squat and dark and falls short of the Nazi dream of the Germanic type. The idea was to transfer forty thous and healthy, clearly Nordic Poles into the Black Forest to improve the strain. \"How would your people react to such a move?\" I ask ed. He was amazed that anyone should care what the \"peo ple\" thought. \"We have commissions traveling now through Poland picking out the young men. We tell them they are th e de- scendants of Germans who settled long ago in easter n coun- tries. We tell the same to the Black Forest People. The girls will welcome them, because with the war, their chan ces of marrying are slim. The Poles will learn German,\" he con- tinued, \"and we'll have a good Nordic population in the Black Forest. You don't know how much trouble we have in keeping our lonely women and the Polish war prisoners apart .\" That much was true. At least once a week German pap ers published reports of court sentences imposed on wom en who had ignored the orders to treat all Poles as \"subhu man,\" and had instead succumbed to the charms of some poor pr isoner slaving at forced labor. I sent reliable Germans to the Black Forest in 1940 to check on the progress of the Schutz Staffel scheme. It hadn't worked very well. For one thing, a lot of the Polis h men, even those from tiny villages, hadn't liked the idea of being Ger- mans. Then, although the local women were glad to h ave them around, the local men, who had been cocks of the wa lk with the soldiers away, organized minor riots with the h elp of sol- diers home on leave.

In pre-Hitler days even the thought of applying suc h stud- farm methods to human beings would have aroused sto rms of indignation in Germany. But the constant hammering home of racial teachings had proved effective. For the s ake of a possible numeric superiority in some distant future the Ger- mans under Nazi domination accepted the stud-farm p lan. They even made jokes about it. German churchmen were appalled. But what could they do against the all-pervading Nazi propaganda based on appeals to the lowest human instincts? What could they do w ith Sun- day congregations who were being systematically div orced from Christianity the rest of the week? MERCY K I L L I N G S On the strength of long and learned recommendations drawn up for the racial office by university profes sors work- ing for Heinrich Himmler, Rudolph Hess, in the name of the German Government, issued regulations encouraging t he bearing of illegitimate children. Another professor ial mem- orandum contained provisions for the so-called merc y kill- ings, by which the aged, the sick, the cripples, an d the insane sheltered in homes were wiped out in special mass-m urder centers in Germany and Austria. To the Nazis, this measure was justified by the ass ertion that for every three ill or aged persons, the servi ces of one healthy German were needed. And, in wartime, all ab le- bodied Germans were required in war work. At the same time a Nazi agency, the Society for Eug enics and Against Infant Mortality, began carrying off ch ildren left in nursing homes by their parents. We first go t word of it when in several cases parents, who believed their c hildren to"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"be recuperating in the country or the suburbs of Be rlin, sud- denly received their ashes. Others were merely sent a post- card announcing the death of the child in an \"epide mic.\" I traced the whispered reports about these deaths ver y care- fully. I found that the same company which had ship ped Ger- man soldiers to fight in the Spanish Civil War had charge of transporting both the old and the young mercy-killi ng vic- tims. Its offices were located on Potsdamer Platz, in the Columbus Haus. In one instance, a child had died mysteriously whil e re- cuperating from the measles. I found the parents to be anti- Nazi. The only explanation I could obtain indicated that the Nazis had sought to discipline the parents, indirec tly, by kill- ing their child. Fear for their own safety has become the predominan t consideration in the life of every German under Naz i rule. Certainly no other German government of the past ce ntury was as ruthless. But non-Nazi Germans within the co untry firmly believe that in the old days the citizenry w ould have stood together. They would not have allowed a Himml er time, first to build up and then to entrench a Gestapo, a s modern Germans have done. Such a step could have been achi eved only through the gradual undermining of German char acter.

The machine-age trend, of which Hitler spok e at the Automobile Show, has touched even comparatively feu dal countries. While for years the Nazi propagandists insisted tha t Nazism was not intended for export, at the same tim e they carried forward concerted efforts to enlist followe rs in every single foreign land. They reached into each social level, to secure success under any possible change in interna l politics. Way back in Landsberg days the Nazi Party chieftain s purposely picked out men with special foreign conne ctions to work on susceptible groups abroad. As the Party grew in power, volunteers turned up or were ferreted out to be absorbed into skeleton organizations within the Par ty frame- work, each organization specializing in a specific country. The political emphases in each case differed with the v arying national characteristics involved. N A Z I S E X P L O I T A N T I - S E M I T I S M The original plan evolved at Landsberg called for t he use of local anti-Semitic leaders as Nazi pioneers in f oreign lands. In time a vast net of organizations sprang u p to exploit the political possibilities of anti-Semitism, inclu ding the Al- liance Chretiene Arienne, with its first headquarte rs in Paris, the Anti-Jewish World League, founded in Nuremberg, and the World Service, branching out from Erfurt, with millions of marks to spend on propaganda. One might call these bodies holding-companies of Na zi anti-Semitism. In addition there were the innumerab le sub- sidiary groups, the little fellows who, as mouthpie ces for anti- Semitism in their local centers, sought power and w ealth. They, too, organized secret societies, just as the Nazis did. 193"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The members paid dues, which were then expended by un- scrupulous leaders as they liked.

Especially since it is often forgo tten that tolerance must be firmly protected. LOCAL L E A D E R S The Balt German, Alfred Rosenberg, who ran the Fore ign Political Office and the institute known as the Sch ooling House in Dahlem near Berlin, was not content with b ut one Nazi headquarters in neighboring countries. He visu alized the advantages of maintaining two groups—an open organi zation, and a secret one that would work effectively under cover of the publicity inevitably aroused by its blatant bro ther. These were, of course, in addition to the business leader s won by promises of huge profits, and occasionally an actua l deal to further whet their appetites. The Netherlands, for instance, had an official Nazi Party under Dr. Anton Adrian Mussert. Then the secret, mo re radi- cal, party was launched and the Nazis were able to keep Mus- sert under their thumb by threatening him with his rival. I interviewed Mussert in Utrecht in 1936. He made a p oint of mentioning that he rejected some Nazi tenets; Holla nd was satisfied with her queen, for instance, and could n ot therefore subscribe to Nazi condemnation of women as inferior in of- ficial posts. Sir Harry Deterding, the Dutch oil king, in a class apart but still a Nazi sympathizer, had his own uses to t he Party. Believing that Nazism stood as a bulwark against Co mmu- nism, Deterding financed many Nazi economic-infiltr ation schemes in Southeastern Europe. 194"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Nazi set-up in the Netherlands can be taken as char- acteristic of developments in nearly every other fo reign coun- try, including the United States of America. American correspondents and radio commentators in B er- lin had reason to know that Nazi supporters have lo ng car- ried on their work side by side with decent citizen s. We would receive sharp reproofs and even threats from the mi nistries. \"We have received word from America,\" the officials would say, \"that your reports are too sarcastic.\" Or too inimical, or whatever the charge. \"We can no longer allow you to refer to Germany and Norway as you have been doing,\" I wa s told. \"Our friends in America have complained.\" This was the of- ficial of the Propaganda Ministry whom we called th e Big Oaf speaking. \"You always refer to 'little Norway' and 'big Germany,'\" he went on angrily. \"That must stop.\" From his tone it was plain that if I didn't stop I was in danger of being expelled. I couldn't resist saying, however, \"Why, isn't Germany big?\" (Actually I went right ah ead, and the Nazis \"reconsidered\" the expulsion order.) At the time I thought the Big Oaf was lying about t he com- plaints from America. Since then I have seen a copy of one denunciation, sent from the United States to two of the Nazi Party bosses in Germany. In November, 1939, George Sylvester Viereck, who wa s sentenced as an enemy agent in August, 1943, violen tly pro- tested the lack of enthusiasm for the German war ef fort shown by American radio commentators from Germany. In his weekly report, number 20, he referred to \"the o utrageous broadcasts of American correspondents in Berlin. I listened to Shirer and S. Schultz the other day. Neither had one word of praise for the heroism of the German people, for her splen- did organization, nor a word of gratitude for the f ree speech permitted to them.\" 195"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"After complaining about the tone and some parts of a broadcast of mine, Viereck waxed sarcastic: \"Neithe r of the two correspondents was ever friendly to the New Ger many, but they would not sputter forth such unredeemed gl oom if they were better fed.

Speci alists traveling from country to country accumulated a vas t store of psychological knowledge, some of which was publi shed in an amazing number of books, some of which was caref ully kept secret. Such reports proved invaluable in esta blishing in- fection centers abroad. Then there was a special corps of historians. The h istorical traditions of a country under \"treatment\" would be twisted to suit Nazi Party propaganda. I remember Ambassador William Dodd, historian by pr o- fession, gritting his teeth at some diplomatic func tion when a Nazi said seriously in a speech that Carl Schurz, t he Ameri- can liberal, had really been a Nazi at heart.

D I R E C T AND I N D I R E C T O F F E N S I V E A G A I N S T THE U N I T E D STATES The Nazis obviously prize conquest of the United St ates above other countries.

Instead of employing Germans, in this instance, they exploited the many agencies functioning in Spain and in South America. They cou nted on using our sister continent as a springboard against us. Ever since World War I, German aristocrats and big busi- nessmen, preceding official German propaganda agent s, have cultivated aristocrats and businessmen in Spain, Po rtugal, and South America. General Wilhelm von Faupel, an a ssoci- ate of General Ludendorff in 1918, spent years in S outh America building up sympathy for the German cause a nd inaugurating activist centers. Whatever mistakes th e United States made he and his aides promptly enlarged and distorted. They reached far into the aristocracy, the business groups, the soldiery, and the German enclaves. General von Faupel's selling point was the superiority of Spanish cultur e; his fol- low-up arguments appealed to the national pride.

It convinced many a good Spaniard that only the Germans appreciated the grea tness of their Spanish heritage, and the justice of their cl aims in Europe and South America. When the Spaniards finall y real- ized that they were merely being used and tried to break away, they found themselves in a secure trap which they h ad helped to build: the Falange, modeled on the Nazi Party, e nforced the German will in Spain. To further increase their hold on Spanish-language coun- tries, the Nazis devised the Consejo de Hispanidad, which was supposed to be a purely Spanish organization to spr ead Span- ish culture to North Africa and South America, but which in reality was directed by Germans. The Falange Exterior repeated for Spaniards abroad the tactics used by the Nazis to control Germans in oth er coun- tries. After most Central and South American states broke off relations with Germany, Nazi agitators hid behi nd the chieftains of the Falange Exterior. German pressure on Span- ish companies and organizations forced them to beco me tools, often without their knowing it. The Nazis exploited their patriotism and their love for old traditions, just as they had perverted those same forces at home. Having cached tremendous sums of money in South America in the bank accounts of wealthy and aristoc ratic friends, many of the leading Nazis hope that if the y have to flee Germany they may find refuge below the Panama Canal. From Central and South American hide-outs, they cou ld then finance future pan-German exploits. When the Nazis say, \"Tomorrow the world!\" they mean the whole world.

Like the Spaniards, so the Arabs, the Chinese, the Japa- nese, the Indian leaders heard from Nazi lips that their civili- zation was the only one which could share the world with the German. This assurance was a mellowing confirmation of superiority and expertly paved the way for German \" advice.\" The Germans also generously threw in promises of pe rsonal advancement as bait. One can have no pity for fools. Yet I came to feel deeply sorry for some of the Asiatic leaders in Germany du ring the war. These men were clever enough to realize that s hould their country ever succumb to German propaganda, it would fare no better than Poland, Czechoslovakia, or Fran ce. They wanted to leave, to get home. The cooling of their Nazi ardor made the Germans all the more determined to keep th em in Germany. Some of the Asiatics slipped into my offic e on the quiet, hoping for some help in escaping the country . They had, they said, refused to broadcast under German a uspices.

Q U I S L I N G S IN A S I A AND A F R I C A After the Germans started their World War II there were certain sections of the East which their agents of German nationality could not enter freely. They had, howev er, pre- pared for just such an eventuality by training rene gades from various countries to work for them among the Arabs, the Indians, the Moroccans and the South Africans.

In view of the inherent Nazi ingenuity and adroit u n- morality, it will be even harder to wipe out the se ats of Nazi infection in non-German countries than it will be e ither in Germany or in German-occupied countries. Where the Nazis are in power, everyone knows them and their methods . Abroad, their affiliates and supporters have sought safety in protective coloration. It is also to German advantage that the people of d istant continents have not suffered from Nazi ruthlessness as bit- terly as have the non-Nazi Germans and other Europe ans. These populations will therefore seek out Nazi agen ts with less energy. In Germany the saboteurs, the subversive undergroun d men and women, are the true patriots. Their enemy i s plain to be seen: it is the government and much of the pe ople. The patriots who have escaped being sent to Himmler's c oncen- tration camps are trying desperately to survive—to help re- build the country. In foreign, non-German lands, the saboteur, the und ercover agent, the pro-Nazi, is the traitor. He is the enem y, and he is well concealed.

For many years of the interwar period foreign busin ess- men on whom the Nazis wanted to make a good impress ion came to admire the Nazi version of German economy. They got, of course, a rosy-hued view. It is to Germany' s advan- tage to have potential foreign investors believe th at the Nazis reserve special privileges for capitalists. They do —but only for the capitalists who benefit the Nazi Party. Vast amounts of money have been made in Germany by enterprising men and women. But these deals were at the expense either of the masses or of conquered popula tions. And they were invariably somewhat crooked, placing the busi- nessman at the mercy of Nazi supervisors, for each transaction could be completed only with Nazi approval. And bef ore giving its approval the Party must not only have go tten \"its share,\" but the supervising Nazi official had to be rendered \"co-operative.\" The man who failed to attend to those little detail s dis- covered that the authorities were extremely anxious that each transaction be \"correct.\" He might find himself thr eatened with a lawsuit for \"harming Germany's good reputati on.\" If he was lucky, he was allowed to kick in the proper share to 207"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the Party; then the matter became a \"regrettable mi sunder- standing.\" But in spite of the compromise, fear the nceforth colored his every action.

But such sordid particulars have never been a part of the propaganda handed out to foreigners. German big business has not dared to open its mouth . Its representatives often, in my hearing, talked glowin gly to for- eigners about the wonderful Nazi system. I taxed Ba ron Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach about it once at a rec eption in Berlin. He was groaning about how hard life was under the Nazis. \"Why then,\" I demanded, \"do you and men like you do your best to convince our American businessmen h ow fine it is?\" \"Well, you see, these Americans who come over here, \" he said, \"have a habit of going home and making speech es about what they have learned.

Labor Leader Rober t Ley could not pacify them. Hitler was requested to address them. The workers, gath- ered in a huge factory hall in Spandau, gave him a cool re- ception.

T here were four men on duty; radio, War Office, Propaganda Off ice, and Foreign Office representatives. I was informed that all ref- erences to restriction of profits would have to be deleted. I was furious. That was the big development of the da y. I protested. \"I heard Hitler make those statements, \" I said. \"Are you going to censor the remarks of your chief of state?\" They handed me the late evening papers. \"Here is th e of- ficial text of the Fuehrer's speech,\" they said. \"T here is no reference to any cut in profits, as you will see.\" I did see: there was none.

The angle to the Russian problem which truly alarms the Germans is the Slav birth rate. How can they domina te the European continent if the Slavs continue to multipl y so much faster than the Germans? The Slavs in Russia, in Po land, in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have alway s been the most fecund Europeans. In the decade after 1926 the population of Soviet Russia alone rose 15.9 per cen t, com- pared to a German increase of 7 per cent. The Germans have tried to combat the menace of the Slav birth rate by two means, both carefully thought out by Ger- man professors. The first is to raise the German bi rth rate artificially, handing out medals and tax rebates fo r big fami- lies, glorifying concubinage and unmarried motherho od.

Traveling about in the United States, I have been s truck by the number of university students and graduates who argue for the German cause—often indoctrinated by profess ors trained in German universities. Students of the fashionable geopolitics are extreme ly likely to show signs of German influence.

Because the countries which oppose German and Japan ese aggression have shown that they would pay high for peace, the Germans believe that they can be bluffed into a ccepting terms tailored to suit Germany's goal of ultimate w orld con- quest. The Nazi Party's flair for histrionics came into pl ay when Hitler's deputy leader, Rudolf Hess, flew a Messers chmidt single-handed from Augsburg to a remote part of Sco tland. He brought with him a truce offering, suggested pea ce terms identical with the big-time visions of his former g eopolitics professor, General Karl Haushofer, member of Ludend orff's secret general staff.

In exchange, Britain w ould, supposedly, be allowed to retain her empire. The alternative offered was destruction of the Brit ish Isles and permanent subjugation. England refused the false peace offer, even though at the time Hitler was at the zenith of his power. And, li ke his secret general staff predecessors, Hitler retreated on enc ountering fierce resistance, resistance more moral this time than mili- tary. He neglected his \"duty\" to subjugate Great Br itain, and turned east. He believed Russia to be weak and thor oughly undermined by his agents. Continually meeting not only military but also mora l and civilian resistance, Hitler has gradually pared dow n his de- mands. He even hides behind emissaries who claim to be will- ing to overthrow him. Ever since the Germans suffered their first serious setbacks in Russia they have been launching one campaign for peace after another along three different lines—economic, diplo- matic, and military. On our wisdom in seeing throug h the false offers depends the durability of the real pea ce. The economic campaign started first, to secure Germ an ac- quisitions and holdings throughout the world. Busin essmen from Germany or from occupied countries descended o n towns in Switzerland and Spain, Turkey and Sweden.

Then they would all depart, leaving a minimum of records of their transactions. But their purpose would have been acc om- plished. They had created legalistic caches for dis honestly acquired property which the German representatives meant to hold after the war, either directly or indirectl y. Other Germans started regular black markets in neut ral countries. They came as \"anti-Nazi refugees,\" and o ften told heartrending tales of Nazi persecution. They brough t jewels, shares in German and French concerns, shares in for eign in- dustries seized by the Germans. Everything they had brought they sold cheaply—they were refugees, and they had to live. Oddly enough, many of them were the very men and wo men who had been the most fanatically Nazi when we used to meet them in Berlin as late as 1941. These people were not merely Nazi rats fleeing the sinking ship. Many of them were sent by Berlin to do a dual job: to get foreign cash, which finances Nazi propaganda an d pur- chases abroad, and to get investors interested in t he welfare of German concerns. The men who invest in German-co n- trolled industries may not think of themselves as r eceivers of stolen goods. But they will be effective—and unpaid —propa- ganda agents for Germany in the peace. The second German peace offensive came to us in the per- sons of several diplomats, businessmen, and churchm en. I shall take one man from a neutral country as their prototype. In the fall of 1942 this important businessman arri ved in America with introductions from even more important per- sonages and instructions to confer with leading ban kers.

Germany realized, this man said, that with our trem en- dous economic machine we would need enormous market s.

And if Japan refused, Germany would be deligh ted to join with us to defeat her. The emissary added that if we were wise, we wouldn't help England to become strong; sh e would never let us have the advantages that Germany would . The visitor was asked what Germany proposed to do a bout the countries she had conquered? Germany was willin g, he replied, to withdraw from her western conquests, pe rhaps even from Norway, but she insisted on retaining Pol and, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and a great part of the Ukraine. Germany further insisted, according to the \"neutral \" busi- nessman, on keeping every economic holding acquired through the years in France, in Belgium, in Holland , and else- where, because \"Germany naturally requires economic con- trol of Europe.\" The emissary vainly waited for some encouragement; he received none. While he sat around here, his collea gues in a neutral country in Europe became impatient. They ma de the same proposal to Great Britain, pointing out that A mericans were Shylocks and that England would get fairer tre atment from Germany. The British told them the game wouldn't work. The A meri- cans and the English compared notes. The trial ball oons col- lapsed. In the next peace offensive the Germans tried \"firm \" tac- tics.

In the next phase, the German negotiator boasted th at even if the United Nations should win the war, they would n ever be able to disentangle property rights in Europe, what with dummy sales, \"legal\" purchases of controlling share s, and \"legal\" expropriations. Churchmen, too, began slipping out of Germany. They sounded a warning, which also has a familiar sound. Peace must be made soon, they said, or chaos would break out in Central Europe with the Nazi collapse. We must, the y claimed, at all costs avert this threat to civiliza tion. The militarists played another tune, a medley of se veral well-worn motifs—the strength of the German army. T o the Russians it was described as the \"bulwark against a ggression from the capitalistic countries, which hate the hom e of Com- munism.\" The inference is that the German army love s Rus- sia. It has chosen a rather unpleasant way of showi ng it. England, the United States, and China were urged to re- member that unless the German army remained intact, how could they hope to destroy Communism, or restore or der in Europe and Asia? Would Russia perhaps exploit her great victories to estab- lish Soviets in Central Europe? Would this developm ent then lead to the formation of that Russo-German colossus which the western powers have feared ever since Russia be gan mak- ing her weight felt in Europe? Undeniably, much of the stronger underground moveme nt in Germany is Communist. It is equally true that th e kinship between the Nazi and the Communist systems is very close— in both countries all the power is held by the cent ral govern- ment and the one party.

But even should Russian and German leaders consider it expedient during the transition period after the wa r to renew their collaboration, the populations of both countr ies would still have to be won to the idea. The average Germa n has a deep, instinctive fear of the Russian, and of Russi an occupa- tion. The simple people of north Germany showed the ir feel- ings plainly during the first years of World War II . They said thankfully that \"this time there is no danger of Ru ssian in- vasion.\" They recalled the days of 1914 when Russia n troops occupied East Prussia. Further, they talked of the Russian troops who fought with the Germans against Napoleon . They left no doubt that they feared the Russians as alli es and as enemies. Possibly even more powerful in its way, the hatred of the Russians for the Germans who have ravaged their lan d, tor- tured and massacred their countrymen, would undoubt edly make it difficult for Stalin to take his nation int o any sort of voluntary co-operation with them, should he perchan ce want to. To the Russians more than to any other people, except per- haps the Chinese, this has been a people's war. The y will want also a people's peace, with the right of choosing t heir own allies. And, in the end, the extent to which the Soviet gov ernment will seek to strengthen its hold on Central Europe will depend on the ability of Britain and the United States to strike the right note both with the Russians and with the Germ ans. A desire for hegemony in any of the United Nations ca mps would be disastrous to future peace.

WHAT WE F A C E IN G E R M A N Y When we realize that we shall face a new German tot ally different from the man of the nineteenth century, d ifferent again from the man of 1918, a German molded by pan- Ger- man extremists and Nazis into a very intelligent to ol for con- quests, then we shall have gone a long way toward \" foresee- ing what could possibly occur\" in Germany.

From the wisest, the most severely tried of the Ger man underground leaders, after many conversations, my o wn ideas of the only solution of the German problem ca me. Not a solution imposed from foreign concepts, from a fe eling that we must teach the Germans what we failed to teach t hem once before, but the somber realization that any nation which re- peatedly cries \"Chaos!\" must at last be allowed to have its chaos—to effect a cure. These conclusions came to me in conversations with some of the very few men fighting for life until they ca n be of use to their nation—decent and brave Germans, speaking care- fully, never in front of German witnesses. I rememb er them best, therefore, in an approximate dialogue form. \"The German people themselves,\" said one, \"must be made to take the law into their own hands and destroy th e evil which betrayed them. If the other nations compel th e Ger- mans to punish their own criminals themselves, or s urrender them voluntarily to punishment in the lands where t hey com- mitted their crimes, the real cause of peace would be fur- thered by decades.\" I hesitated. \"But how can it be done? How can one b e sure that the criminals are really punished?\" I asked in disbelief. \"When victory is seen to be within reach, the Allie s would have to surround Germany by occupying the countries along the western borders of Germany and another block al ong the eastern border. Then let them fly troops in, or mar ch them into the countries where they will be greeted as sa viors, Hol- land, Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakia—yes, Austria, or at least part of it .\" \"And then what?\" 226"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"\"Why, within that cordon sanitaire let the Germans fight it out among themselves.\" \"You mean,\" I said, \"that then whatever happens in Ger- many could not spread to the surrounding countries? \" \"Yes. They have suffered enough at the hands of the Ger- mans. Within the ring of iron, the real battle for a decent Germany must be fought.\" \"Many of us,\" another said, \"hope that at least som e of the army leaders are against the Nazis, even if som e others furthered the Nazi cause. They must prove their wor th under fire. The army is the only group besides the Schutz Staffel which possesses arms. If the army wants to show tha t it is anti- Nazi, it will disarm the Nazi hordes.\" The underground has had to retain its faith in part of the army in order to keep any faith at all. For where c ould they ever hope to get the weapons needed to rise up in a rms against the Nazis, if not from army stores? Therefore the u nder- ground has watched for the day when soldiers and ar my groups would mutiny and then give the populace guns to use with them against the oppressors. They have been ce rtain that the mutiny would come. They knew, also, that it wou ld come only when Germany had suffered severe military reve rses. Even the hope of securing weapons from the anti-Naz i underground in other countries could not be realize d until German troops had been driven back, close to their own bor- ders. But once armed, the German underground leader s feel an inspiring confidence that in time they would be able to rally the anti-Nazi elements of the population and subdue the Schutz Staffel—working with the army, for many sold iers and officers hate the Himmler assassins almost as b itterly as the opposition does. I asked several men, including a Communist undergro und leader, \"Why should foreign countries, knowing that it was 227"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"the army, backed by the industrialists and the Junk ers, which fathered Hitler and the Nazis, suddenly assume that the army has changed and is fighting for a decent Germany?\" Two of the three men answered the question this way : \"They should not bank too strongly on that.

The Nazi s will fight to retain their grip on Germany. They have be en trained for the last fight, trained for civil war. What wil l happen if allied soldiers rush in? They won't reduce the bloo dshed. On the contrary. They will suffer losses that might be avoided by making the German army do the cleaning up. And thei r pres- ence might help the Nazis to stir up resentment and increase the strength of their guerillas.\" Those men know, as do the few foreigners who were i n Germany long enough after the start of the war, tha t the Nazis have prepared very well indeed for the time when th ey might have to fight to keep their power. They have made r eady to battle to retain power very much more fiercely than they fought to gain it. BLACK GUARDS SWORN TO H I M M L E R Out of fear of uprisings, Hitler has steadily incre ased the power of Heinrich Himmler, chief of all police forc es in Ger- many, head of the Gestapo, of the Schutz Staffel, o f the racial office, of the concentration camps: Himmler—the rea l master of life and death in Germany and in all countries u nder Ger- many. In wartime the Schutz Staffel swore loyalty t o Himmler personally. Himmler, moreover, has maintained other paid assassins, in many lands.

Often the machine guns have been deliberately displ ayed to cow the people. The German army, by cleaning out the armed Nazis fi rst, would atone a little for having long supported the Nazis. Even if it does only part of the job, at least we shall know where we stand. And that course of action might evidence the sincerity of the inevitable peace pledges. Every one of the German underground leaders whose c on- fidence I enjoyed felt very deeply about exemplary punish- ment of Nazi criminals. The underground for years h as collected evidence on the crimes and depredations o f the Nazi Party members, of sympathizers among their countrym en of all classes. The great burden of guilt, however, is shared by the people who have had some measure of power: the Junkers, aristocrats, professors, industrialists, businessme n, officials, besides the army. There is no way of knowing, of co urse, how many such files, whose mere existence constitutes a menace to the holder's life, will have survived the war. But without exception these underground men insiste d that punishment be administered by Germans, either direc tly or through transfer of those recognized as criminals b y German courts martial. They spoke time and again of the da nger that the Nazified minds among the masses might elevate t o martyr- dom men and women executed by foreigners, without G erman co-operation, whether or not they deserved death. \" The masses would accept the ruling of German courts martial,\" one of the underground workers added. \"That is one of the few ad- 229"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"vantages of dealing with a nation of a militarized mentality.\" During the period of internal German cleansing, the United Nations forces, with their steel ring around the Ge rman bor- ders and their air superiority over the country, wo uld run no extraordinary risk. They would, however, have to re main adamant in their determination to see the criminals punished, even before the final peace terms are worked out. The non-Nazis within the German army have weapons a nd access to weapons. When it becomes sufficiently cle ar to them that they cannot hope for peace as long as Nazi cri minals are at large, they can and will make use of their weapo ns if proper psychological pressure is applied. And after the wholesale bombing of German cities they will find n ot only the genuine anti-Nazis but also large sections of t he population eager to co-operate with them. This must under no c ondition be understood to mean that we countenance the estab lishment of a German militaristic government. For German arm y lead- ers should never be given a chance to repeat their perform- ance of 1918 and of the following years, when they were able to hide behind the Republic, claim they had not bee n de- feated, and regain power. They will not be able to do so if we make use of them to enforce the consequences of def eat. German army leaders who, in collaboration with the under- ground, mete out court martial sentences to German war criminals will automatically do everything in their power— for the sake of their own personal safety—to convin ce the population that the punishment is just. This will r educe their chances of organizing one more conspiracy against w hoever tries to build up a sane government in Germany. And the new government chiefs, knowing how the Republic was tri cked by the army in the past, will be on guard against an a rmy cama- rilla even if it has helped bring about the overthr ow of the Nazis. 230"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"German psychology being what it is, there can be no doubt that the decent German elements would have a better chance to take over governmental responsibility with a cer tain amount of prestige if there were no open occupation of Ger- many by the United Nations. That rigid control will be neces- sary is self-evident. But this control could probab ly be ex- erted more effectively from bases in the ring of ir on surround- ing Germany than it could Be from within. I have seen how occupation worked in Germany after World War I, before the whole of the country was tr ained for nationalistic propaganda. As a consequence of obser vations made at that time, I am deeply convinced that the q uicker the Germans are made to run their own show, with respon sibility placed squarely on their shoulders, the more quickl y pacifica- tion can be enforced, provided they are made to rea lize that none of the tricks which worked after World War I c an serve them after World War II. When the German internal cleansing is finished, we must know which groups within the German borders we can trust. There are the underground leaders and their affilia tions. There are also the natural leaders who often emerge from great national crises. Such men have been feeling t heir way both in Germany and in German-dominated lands. I be lieve that they will be recognizable by the size of their followings, the strength and the preparedness of their organiza tions. The churchmen of Germany have been mentioned as a body with whom we might co-operate. But there, too, we shall have to be exceedingly cautious, partly becau se quite a number of churchmen worked with the secret genera l staff to weaken the Republic, partly because even when th ey tried to, the Protestant pastors, for instance, failed to rally their congregations in critical moments.

Any- one who has seen and talked with members of Himmler 's Death's Head squads, who run the concentration camp s, has reason to fear that, facing doom, they will first m assacre all those within reach. The Catholics also have produced a few outstanding leaders of courage, Cardinal Faulhaber for example. But the re re- mains the fact that many prominent Catholics couldn 't come to terms with the Nazis quickly enough. Franz von P apen, of the Catholic Center Party, did more than his share to secure Nazi victory and betray human decency. The Vatican was the first power to sign a treaty wi th the Nazis—in the summer of 1933, after the first state- organized crime wave in Germany. As early as March, 1933, the Ger- man prelate, Ludwig Kaas, now in the Vatican, appea led to the Germans to cease resistance to Nazi rule. In Ju ne, 1933, the Centrist Party dissolved itself to please the N azis, sup- posedly on the advice of Pope Pius XI. All of these steps were taken before the Gestapo ha d achieved its stranglehold on Germany, at a time whe n brave men, banded together, could have fought effectively .

Some individuals, who consider themselves experts o n Germany, feel that we should protect German unity; others urge the division of Germany into its component par ts of Prussia, the Rhineland and Wuerttemberg, Bavaria an d Aus- tria. The question of German unity, however, can be settled by no one but the Germans themselves. If they want to be together, the cleverest scheme for division will no t work. If they want to be separate, national unity cannot be enforced by outsiders. As for division, during the first phase of World Wa r II, actually through at least part of 1941, the non-Pru ssian Ger- mans themselves thought seriously about overthrowin g Prus- sian hegemony. They resented intensely the behavior of the tens of thousands of Westphalians and North Germans who fled from their bombed cities to the safety of Sout h Germany, living in the best hotels if they were rich, or on pittances as refugees if they were poor. The wealthiest went to Austria, where the population loathed them so heartily that if in 1940 it could have broken free of German domination it w ould gladly have done so.

They have preserved their own country from the worst upheavals, while they have, since the first World W ar, in- cited riots, unrest, and revolutions in foreign cou ntries. When they see that crying \"Chaos! Chaos!\" will not bring us run- ning to help them out, they will promptly settle do wn and control the chaos themselves. Certainly there will be bloody clashes, but they would be and should be Germany's affair.

Similarly, when they find that their strategies for world domination through war-in-peace meet with absolute resist- ance, they will drop them—until the next propitious moment. Our resistance can be effective only if we keep our own defenses strong, if we buttress those defenses with a militant democracy, continually improving our internal polit ical, eco- nomic, and social conditions. We have taken up the challenge of the Germans and t he Japanese against our security. To defeat them perma nently we must remember that our security lies in working out a way of life within the framework of our democracy so we ll de- signed that no totalitarian attack, either open or insidious, can shake it. We will have to remember that Nazism will retain a great appeal for the Germans, even in defeat. It taught t hem to co- ordinate the power of the whole nation. And they wi ll never forget that for a time they almost ruled the whole of Europe. They have been thoroughly indoctrinated with the th ought that German strength is the basis of all life. Thei r decent, humanitarian instincts have been buried in decades of wrong teaching, wrong thinking. They won't accept correct ion from us. Under some stable form of government, chosen by the m- selves, the better German elements can emerge again and assume the direction of Germany's re-education. The y can teach the Germans to fulfill their genuine talent f or co-opera- tion and constructive work, which is evident whenev er they abandon their dreams of conquest and aggression. Our contribution toward real world peace is to keep on guard—unremittingly—eternally. At the first sign of weak- ness on our part, they'll try it again. 238"}]
