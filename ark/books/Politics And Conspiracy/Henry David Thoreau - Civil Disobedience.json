Carried ou t, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,— “That gov ernment is best which governs not at all;” a nd when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind o f government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but m ost governments are usually, and all governments are sometim es, inexpedient. The objections which h ave been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and d eserve to p revail, may also at l ast be brought against a standing g overnment. The standing army is only an arm of the standing g overnment. The government it self, which is only the mode which the people have c hosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be a bused and perverted before the people c an act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing g overnment as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would no t have c onsented to this measure. This American government,— what i s it but a tradition, thou gh a rece nt one, endeavoring to transmit it self unim paired to posterity, bu t each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it t o his will. It i s a sort of wood en gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they shou ld u se it i n earnest as a real one against eac h o ther, it will surely split. But it i s not t he less nece ssary for this; for the people must have some c omplicated machinery or other, and h ear its din, to satisfy that i dea of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 4 government which they have. Governments s how thus how succe ssfully men can be im posed on, even im pose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this government never of itself f urthered any enterprise, bu t by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep the coun try free. It do es not settle the West. It do es not educate. The character inherent in the American people has don e a ll t hat has been accomplished; and it would h ave don e somewhat m ore, if the government had no t sometim es got in its way. For government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it i s most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. Trade a nd comm erce, if they were not m ade of India rubb er, would n ever manage to boun ce over the obstacles which legislators are c ontinually putting in their way; and, if one were to judg e these men who lly by the effects of their actions, and no t partly by their intentions, they would d eserve to b e c lassed and pun ished with those mi schievou s persons who put obstructions on the railroads. But, to speak p ractically and as a c itizen, un like those who call themselves no -government m en, I ask for, not at once no government, bu t at once a better government. Let every man make kno wn what kind o f government would comm and h is respect, and that will be one step toward ob taining it. After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitt ed, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not beca use they are most li kely to b e in the right, no r because this s eems fairest t o the mi nority, bu t beca use they are physically the strongest. But a government i n which the majority rule in all cases canno t be based on justice, even as far as men und erstand it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do n ot virtually decide right and wrong, bu t conscience?—in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the c itizen ever"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 5 for a moment, o r in the least degree, resign h is conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a c onscience, then? I think that we shou ld b e men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume, is to do at any tim e what I think right. It i s truly enou gh said, that a c orporation h as no conscience; but a corporation o f conscientious men is a c orporation with a c onscience. Law never made men a whit m ore just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A comm on and n atural result of an und ue respect for law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, po wder-monk eys and all, marching in admi rable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, aye, against their common sense a nd consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and p rodu ces a palpitation o f the heart. They have no do ubt that it i s a damnable business in which they are c oncerned; they are a ll peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all? or small m oveable forts and magazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in po wer? Visit t he Navy Yard, and b ehold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, o r such as it can make a man with its black arts,— a mere shadow and remi niscence of humanity, a man laid out alive a nd standing, and already, as one may say, bu ried und er arms with funeral acc ompanim ents, thou gh it m ay be “Not a drum was heard, no t a funeral note, As his corse to the ramparts we hurried; Not a soldier discharged h is farewell shot O’er the grave where our hero we buried.” The mass of men serve the State thus, no t as men mainly, bu t as machines, with their bodies.

Such comm and no more respect t han men of straw, o r a lump o f dirt. They have the same sort of worth on ly as horses and d ogs. Yet such as these e ven are c omm only esteemed good citizens. Others, as most l egislators, politi cians, lawyers, mi nisters, and o ffice-holders, serve the State chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make a ny moral distinctions, they are a s likely to serve the devil, withou t intending it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men , serve the State with their consciences also, and so n ece ssarily resist it for the most part; and they are c omm only treated by it as enemi es. A w ise man will only be useful as a man, and will not submit t o b e “c lay,” a nd “stop a hole to k eep the wind away,” but leave that office to h is dust at least:— “I am too h igh-born to b e propertied, To b e a second ary at control, Or useful serving -man and instrument To any sovereign state throughou t the world.” He who gives him self entirely to h is fellow-men appears to them useless and selfish; but he who gives him self partially to them i s pronoun ced a benefactor and ph ilanthropist. How does it become a man to b ehave toward this American government to-day? I answer that he canno t withou t disgrace be associated with it. I cannot for an instant recogn ize that political organization as my government which is the slave’s government also.

But alm ost all say"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 7 that such is not the case now. But such was the c ase, they think, in the Revolution o f ’ 75. If one were to tell m e that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign comm od ities brought to its ports, it i s most probable that I shou ld no t make a n ado abou t it, for I can do withou t them: all m achines have their fr iction; and possibly this does enough good to coun terbalance the e vil. At any rate, it i s a great evil t o make a stir abou t it . But when the friction comes to h ave its machine, and opp ression and robb ery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine a ny longer. In other words, when a sixth o f the popu lation o f a nation which h as und ertaken to b e the refuge of li berty are slaves, and a whole coun try is unjustly overrun and conqu ered by a foreign army, and subjected to milit ary law, I think that it i s not too soon for hon est men to rebel and revolutionize. What m akes this duty the more urgent is the fact, that the coun try so ov errun is not our own, bu t ours is the invading army. Paley, a c omm on authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter on the “ Duty of Submi ssion to Civil Government,” resolves all civil obligation into expediency; and h e proceeds to say, “that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it, that is, so long as the e stablished government cannot be resisted o r changed withou t pub lic inconv eniency, it i s the will of God, that the e stablished government be obeyed, and no longer.”—“This principle being admitt ed, the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation o f the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and o f the probability and expense of r edressing it on the other.” Of this, h e says, every man shall judge for him self. But Paley appears never to have c ontemplated those ca ses to which the rule of expediency does not apply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do justice, cost what it m ay. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man, I must restore it t o h im t hough I drown myself. This, acc ording to Paley, would b e inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 8 such a ca se, shall l ose it. This people must cea se to ho ld slaves, and to make war on Mexico, thou gh it cost them t heir existence a s a people. In their practice, n ations agree with Paley; but does any one think that Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis? “A drab of state, a c loth-o’-silver slut, To h ave her train bo rne up, and h er soul trail i n the dirt.” Practically speaking, the oppon ents to a reform i n Massachusetts are not a hund red thou sand po liti cians at the South, bu t a hund red thou sand merchants and farmers here, who are more interested in comm erce and agriculture than they are in hu manity, and are not prepared to do justice to the slave a nd to Mexico, cost what it may . I quarrel not with far- off foes, bu t with those who, n ear at home, co-operate with, and d o the bidding o f tho se far away, and withou t whom t he latter would b e harml ess. We a re accustomed to say, that the mass of men are unp repared; but im provement is s low, b ecause the few are not m aterially wiser or better than the many. It is not so im portant that m any should b e as good as you, as that there be some a bsolute goodn ess s omewhere; for that will l eaven the whole lump. There a re thou sands who are in op inion oppo sed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to p ut an end to them; who, esteemi ng themselves children o f Washington and Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets, and say that they kno w not what to do , and do nothing; who even po stpon e the question o f freedom t o the question o f free-trade, and qu ietly read the prices- current along with the latest advices from Mexico, after dinner, and, it m ay be, fall asleep o ver them both. What i s the price- current of an hon est m an and p atriot to-day? They hesitate, and they regret, and sometim es they petiti on; but they do no thing in earnest and with effect. They will wait, well disposed, for others to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 9 remedy the e vil, that they may no longer have it to regret. At m ost, they give only a c heap vo te, and a feeble c oun tenance a nd Godspeed, to the right, as it goes by them. There a re nine hund red and n inety-nine patrons of virtue to o ne virtuous man; but it i s easier to d eal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian o f it. All voting is a sort of gami ng, like c heckers or backgamm on, with a slight m oral ti nge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and b etting naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not staked. I cast my vote, p erchance, as I think right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right shou ld prevail. I am willi ng to leave it t o the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never excee ds that of expediency. Even vo ting for the right is doing no thing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it shou ld p revail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, no r wish it t o p revail t hrough the power of the majority. There is but littl e virtue in the ac tion o f masses of men. When the majority shall at l ength vo te for the aboliti on o f slavery, it will be beca use they are indifferent t o slavery, o r because there is but little slavery left to b e a bolished by their vote. They will t hen b e the only slaves. Only his vo te ca n hasten the a boliti on o f slavery who asserts his own freedom by his vote. I hear of a c onvention to b e held at Baltim ore, o r elsewhere, for the selection o f a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors, and men who are politi cians by profession; but I think, what is it t o any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what decision they may come to, shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and hon esty, n evertheless? Can we not coun t upon some independent votes? Are there not m any individuals in the c oun try who do no t attend conv entions? But no: I find that the respectable man, so called, h as imm ediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his coun try, when h is coun try has more reason to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 10 despair of him . He forthwith adop ts one of the ca ndidates thus selected as the only available on e, thus proving that he is him self available for any purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that of any unp rincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have been bo ught. Oh for a man who is a man , and, as my neighbo r says, h as a bon e in h is back which you canno t pass your hand through! Our statistics are a t fault: t he popu lation has been returned too large. How many men are there to a square thou sand mil es in this coun try? Hardly one. Does not America offer any indu cement for men to settle here? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow,—on e who may be kno wn by the development of his organ o f gregariousness, and a manifest lack of intellect and cheerful self-r eliance; whose first and chief concern, on comi ng into the world, is to see that the a lm s-houses are in good repair; and, before yet he has lawfully don ned the viril e garb, to collect a fund for the suppo rt of the widows and o rphans that m ay be; who, in short, v entures to live only by the aid o f the mutual insurance c ompany, which h as promi sed to bu ry him dece ntly. It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to d evote him self to the e radication o f any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it i s his duty, at l east, to wash h is hands of it, and, if he gives it no thou ght longer, no t to give it practically his s uppo rt. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do no t pursue them sitting upon another man’s s hou lders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I shou ld like to h ave them order me out to help pu t down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico,— see if I would go;” and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.

Thus, und er the name of order and civil government, we are a ll m ade a t last t o p ay homage to and suppo rt our own meanness. After the first blush o f sin, comes its indifference; and from imm oral it becomes, as it were, un moral, and no t quite unn ece ssary to that li fe which we have made. The broadest and most prevalent error r equires the most disinterested v irtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism i s comm only liable, the nob le a re most li kely to incur. Those who, while they disapprove of the c haracter and measures of a government, yield to it t heir allegiance a nd suppo rt, are und oubtedly its most conscientious s uppo rters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform. Some a re petiti oning the State to dissolve the Union, to d isregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they not dissolve it themselves,— the union b etween themselves and the State,— and refuse to pay their quo ta into its treasury? Do no t they stand in the same relation to the State, that the State does to the Union? And have not the same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union, which h ave prevented them from resisting the State?

It not only divides states and churches, it divides famili es; aye, it divides the individual , separating the diabolical in h im from the divine. Unjust laws exist; shall we be c ontent to ob ey them, o r shall we e ndeavor to amend them, and ob ey them until we have succee ded, or shall we transgress them at once ? Men generally, und er such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if they shou ld resist, the remedy would b e worse than the e vil. But it is the fault of the government it self that the remedy is worse than the e vil. It makes it worse. Why is it not m ore a pt to anticipate and provide for r eform? Why does it not cherish its wise mi nority? Why does it cry and resist before it i s hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to po int out it s faults, and do better than it would h ave them? Why does it always crucify Christ, and excomm unicate Copernicus and Luther, and p ronou nce Washington and Franklin rebels? One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority, was the only offense never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its definite, its s uitable and p ropo rtionate penalty?

What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do no t lend myself to the wrong which I cond emn. As for adop ting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the e vil, I know not of such ways. They take too much tim e, and a man’s life will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good p lace to live in, bu t to live in it, b e it good o r bad. A man h as not every thing to do, bu t something; and beca use he canno t do every thing , it i s not nece ssary that he shou ld do something wrong. It is not my business to b e petiti oning the governor or the legislature any more than it i s theirs to p etiti on me; and, if they shou ld no t hear my petiti on, what shou ld I do then? But in this case the State has provided no way: its very Constitution is the e vil. This may seem to b e harsh and stubbo rn and un conciliatory; but it i s to treat with the utm ost kindn ess and consideration the only spirit t hat can appreciate or deserve it. So is all change for the better, like birth and death which convu lse the body. I do no t hesitate to say, that t hose who call t hemselves aboliti onists s hou ld at once e ffectually withdraw their suppo rt, both in p erson and property, from t he government of Massachusetts, and no t wait till t hey constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to p revail t hrough them.

I meet t his American gov ernment, o r its representative the State government, d irectly, and face to face, on ce a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am nece ssarily meets it; and it t hen says distinctly, Recognize me; and the sim plest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest m ode of treating with it on this head, o f expressing your littl e satisfaction with and love for it, is to d eny it t hen.

How shall he ever kno w w ell what he is and do es as an o fficer of the government, o r as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he shall t reat m e, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, o r as a maniac a nd d isturber of the peace, and see if he ca n g et over this obstruction to h is neighbo rliness withou t a ruder and more im petuou s thou ght or speech correspond ing with h is action?

For it matters not how small t he beginning may seem t o be: what is once well don e is don e for ever. But we love better to talk abou t it : that we say is our mi ssion. Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its s ervice, bu t not one man. If my esteemed n eighbo r, the State’s ambassador, who will devote his days to the settlement of the question o f human rights in the Coun cil Chamber, instead o f being threatened with the prisons of Carolina, were to sit down the prisoner of Massachusetts, that State which is s o anxious to foist the sin o f slavery upo n her sister,— though at present she can discover only an act of inho spitality to b e the ground o f a quarrel with h er,— the Legislature would no t wholly waive the subject the following winter. Under a government which im prisons any unjustly, the true place for a just m an is also a prison. The proper place to-day, the only place which Massachusetts has provided for her freer and less despond ing spirits, is in h er prisons, to b e put out and locked ou t of the State by her own act, as they have a lready put themselves out by their principles. It i s there that t he fugitive slave, and the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 15 Mexican p risoner on parole, and the Indian come to p lead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on that separate, bu t m ore free a nd hono rable ground, where the State places those who are not with her but aga inst her,— the only hou se in a slave-state in which a free man can abide with hono r. If any think that t heir influence would b e lost there, and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the State, that they would no t be a s an enemy within its walls, they do no t know by how much truth is s tronger than error, nor how much more e loqu ently and effectively he ca n combat injustice who h as experienced a littl e in h is own p erson. Cast your whole vote, no t a strip of paper merely, bu t your whole influence.

If a thou sand men were not to p ay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and b loody measure, as it would b e to p ay them, and enable the State to commit violence a nd shed inno cent blood . This is, in fact, the definition o f a peacea ble revo lution, if any such is possible. If the tax-gatherer, or any other pub lic officer, asks me, as one has don e, “But what shall I do?” my answer is, “If you really wish to do any thing, resign your office.” W hen the subject has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned h is office, then the revolution is acc omplished. But even suppose blood shou ld flow. Is there not a sort of blood shed when the c onscience is wound ed? Through this wound a man’s real m anhood and imm ortality flow out, and h e bleeds to an everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now. I have contemplated the im prisonment of the offender, rather than the seizure of his good s,— though bo th will serve the same purpose,—b ecause they who assert t he purest right, and consequently are most dangerous to a c orrupt State, comm only have not spent m uch time in acc umulating property.

If there were one who lived wholly withou t the use of money, the State itself would h esitate to d emand it of him . But t he rich man—no t t o make a ny invidious comparison— is always s old to the institution which makes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money comes between a man and h is objects, and obtains them for him; it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions which h e would o therwise be taxed to answer; while the only new question which it puts is the hard bu t superfluou s one, ho w to spend it. Thus his moral ground is taken from und er his feet. The oppo rtunities of living are dimi nished in propo rtion as what are called the “ means” a re increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which h e e ntertained when h e was poo r. Christ answered the Herodians acc ording to their cond ition. “Show me the tribute-money,” said h e;—and on e took a penny out of his pocket;— If you u se money which has the im age of Caesar on it, and which h e has made current and v aluable, that is, if you a re men of t he State , and gladly enjoy the a dvantages of Caesar’s government, then p ay him back some of his own when h e demands it; “Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and to God those things which are God’s,”—leaving them no wiser than b efore as to which was which; for they did no t wish to know. When I converse with the freest of my neighbo rs, I perceive that, whatever they may say abou t the magnitude a nd seriousness of the question, and their regard for the public tranqu illi ty, the long and the short of the matter is, that they canno t spare the protection of the e xisting g overnment, and they dread the c onsequences of disobedience to it t o their property and famili es. For my own part, I shou ld no t like to think that I ever rely on the protection o f the State. But, if I deny the authority of the State when it presents its"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 17 tax-bill, it will soon take a nd waste a ll my property, and so harass me a nd my children withou t end. This is hard. This makes it im possible for a man to live hon estly and at the same tim e comfortably in ou tward respects. It will not be worth the while to acc umulate property; that would b e sure to go again. You must hire or squat somewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat that soon . You must li ve within yourself, and d epend upo n yourself, always tucked up and ready for a start, and no t have many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey even, if he will be in all respects a good subject of the Turkish gov ernment. Confucius s aid,— “If a State is governed by the principles of reason, po verty and mi sery are subjects of shame; if a State is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and hono rs are the subjects of shame.” No: until I want the protection o f Massachusetts to b e e xtended to me in some distant southern po rt, where my liberty is endangered, o r until I am bent solely on bu ilding up an estate a t home by peace ful enterprise, I can afford to refuse a llegiance to Massachusett s, and h er right to my property and life. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State, than it would to ob ey. I shou ld feel as if I were worth less in that case. Some years ago, the State met m e in b ehalf of the church, and comm anded me to p ay a ce rtain sum t oward the suppo rt of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended, bu t never I myself. “Pay,” it said, “or be locked up in the jail.” I declined to pay. But, un fortunately another man saw fit t o p ay it. I did no t see why the schoo lm aster should b e taxed to suppo rt the priest, and no t the priest the schoo lm aster: for I was not the State’s s choo lm aster, but I suppo rted myself by voluntary subscription. I did no t see why the lyceum shou ld no t present it s tax-bill, and h ave the State to back its demand, as well as the c hurch. However, at the request of the selectm en, I condescended to make some such statement as this in writing:—“Know all men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do no t wish to b e regarded as a member of any"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 18 incorporated society which I have not joined.” This I gave to the town-clerk; and h e has it. The State, h aving thus learned that I did not wish to b e regarded as a member of that church, h as never made a like demand o n me since; though it said that it m ust adhere to its original presumption that tim e. If I had k nown ho w to n ame them, I shou ld then have signed off in d etail from all t he societies which I never signed o n to; but I did no t kno w w here to find a complete list. I have paid no po ll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this acc oun t, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone, two o r three feet thick, the doo r of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could no t help b eing struck with the foolishness of that i nstitution which treated me a s if I were mere flesh and b lood and bon es, to b e locked up. I wond ered that it shou ld have c oncluded at length that this was the best use it could pu t m e to, and h ad n ever thought to avail it self of my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me a nd my townsmen, there was a still m ore difficult one to clim b or break through, b efore they could g et to b e as free a s I was. I did no t for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone a nd mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen h ad p aid my tax. They plainly did not kno w how to treat m e, bu t behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every complim ent t here was a blund er; for they thou ght that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could no t but smil e to see how indu striously they locked the doo r on my meditations, which followed them out again withou t l et or hindrance, and they were rea lly all t hat was dangerous. As they could no t reach me, they had resolved to pun ish my body; just as boys, if they canno t come a t some person against whom t hey have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timi d as a lone woman with h er"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 19 silver spoon s, and that it did no t kno w its friends from it s foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and p itied it. Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man’s s ense, intellectual or moral, bu t only his body, h is s enses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, bu t with superior ph ysical strength. I was not born to b e forced. I will breathe a fter my own fashion. Let us s ee who is the strongest. What force has a multit ude? They only can force me who ob ey a higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do no t hear of men being forced to live this way or that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, “Your money or your life,” why shou ld I be in haste to give it my money? It m ay be in a great strait, and not kno w w hat to do : I canno t help that. It must help itself: do as I do. It is not worth the while to snivel abou t it. I am not respon sible for the successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son o f the e ngineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a c hestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, bu t both ob ey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one, perchance , ov ershadows and d estroys the other. If a plant canno t live acc ording to its nature, it dies; and so a man. The night in p rison was nov el and interesting enou gh. The prisoners in their shirt-sleeves were e njoying a c hat and the evening air in the doo rway, when I entered. But the jailer said, “Come, b oys, it i s tim e to lock up, ” a nd so they dispersed, and I heard the soun d of their steps returning into the hollow apartm ents. My roomm ate was introduced to me by the jailer, as “a first-rate fellow and a clever man.” When the doo r was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and ho w he managed matters there. The rooms were whitewashed on ce a month; and this one, at least, was the whitest, most sim ply furnished, and p robably the neatest apartm ent in the town. He naturally wanted to kno w w here I came from, and what brought me there; and, when I had told h im , I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 20 asked h im i n my turn h ow he ca me there, p resuming him t o b e a n hon est m an, o f course; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. “Why,” said he, “they accuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.” As near as I could d iscover, h e had p robably gone to b ed in a barn when d runk, and smoked h is pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation o f being a clever man, h ad b een there some three months waiting for his trial to come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite domesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, and thou ght that he was well t reated. He occupied on e window, and I the other; and I saw, that, if one stayed there long, h is principal business would b e to look out the windo w. I had soon read all t he tracts that were left there, and exami ned where former prisoners had b roken ou t, and where a grate had b een sawed off, and heard the history of the various occupants of that room; for I found that even h ere there was a history and a gossip which n ever circulated b eyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only hou se in the town where verses are composed, which are a fterward printed in circular f orm, b ut not pub lished. I was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who h ad b een d etected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing them. I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for f ear I shou ld n ever see him again; but at length h e showed me which was my bed, and left m e to b low out the lamp. It was like travelling into a far coun try, such as I had never expected to b ehold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had h eard the town-clock strike before, nor the e vening sound s of the village; for we slept with the windows open, which were inside the grating. It was to see my native village in the light of the mi ddle ages, and ou r Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and v isions of knights and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old burghers that I heard in the streets. I was an"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"HENRY DA VID THOREAU 21 invo luntary spectator and auditor of whatever was don e a nd said in the kitchen o f the a djacent village-inn,— a wholly new and rare experience to me. It was a c loser view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had seen its institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions; for it i s a shire town. I began to comprehend what it s inhabitants were a bou t. In the morning, ou r breakfasts were put through the hole in the doo r, in small oblong -square tin p ans, made to fit, and ho lding a pint of chocolate, with b rown b read, and an iron spoon. When they called for the vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left, bu t my comrade seized it, and said that I shou ld lay that up for lunch o r dinner. Soon after, he was let out to work at haying in a neighbo ring field, whither he went every day, and would no t be back till noon ; so h e bade me good-day, saying that he doub ted if he shou ld see me again. When I came out of prison,— for some one interfered, and paid that t ax,— I did n ot perceive that great changes had taken place on the c omm on, such as he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a tottering and gray-headed man; and yet a c hange had to my eyes come over the scene,— the town, and State a nd coun try,— greater than any that mere tim e c ould effect. I saw yet more distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to what extent the people a mong whom I lived could b e trusted as good neighbo rs and friends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that t hey did no t greatly propo se to do right; t hat t hey were a distinct race from m e by their prejudices and superstiti ons, as the Chinamen and Malays are; t hat, in their sacrifices to hu manity, they ran no risks, no t even to their property; that, after all, they were not so nob le but they treated the thief as he had treated them, and hop ed, by a certain outward ob servance a nd a few prayers, and by walking in a particular straight though u seless path from tim e to tim e, to save their souls. This may be to judge my neighbors"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 22 harshly; for I believe that m any of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail i n their village. It was formerly the c ustom i n ou r village, when a poo r debtor came out of jail, for his acquaintances to salute him , look ing through their f ingers, which were c rossed to represent the grating of a jail windo w, “How do ye do?” My neighbors did no t thus salute me, bu t first look ed at m e, and then at one a nother, as if I had returned from a long journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker’s to get a shoe which was mended. When I was let out the next m orning, I procee ded to finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a huckleberry party, who were im patient to pu t themselves und er my cond uct; and in h alf an hou r,— for the horse was s oon tackled,— was in the mi dst of a huckleberry field, on on e of our highest hills, two mil es off, and then the State was nowhere to b e seen. This is the whole history of “My Prisons.” I have never declined paying the highway tax, beca use I am as desirous of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and, as for supp orting schoo ls, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-coun trymen no w. It is for no particular item i n the tax-bill that I refuse to p ay it. I sim ply wish to refuse a llegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually.

In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion, thou gh I will still make what use a nd g et what advantage of her I can, as is usual in such cases. If others pay the tax which is demanded o f me, from a sympathy with the State, they do but what they have a lready done in their own case, or r ather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires.

This, then, is my position at present. But one c anno t be too much on h is guard in such a ca se, lest his action b e biased by obstinacy, o r an undu e regard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does only what belongs to h im self and to the hou r. I think sometim es, Why, this people mean well; t hey are only ignorant; t hey would do better if they knew how; why give your neighbo rs this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to? But I think, again, This is no reason why I shou ld do as they do, o r permi t others to suffer much greater pain o f a different kind. Again, I sometim es s ay to myself, When many milli ons of men, withou t heat, withou t ill-will, withou t personal feeling of any kind, demand o f you a few shillings only, withou t the possibility, such is their constitution, o f r etracting or altering their present demand, and withou t the possibility, on your side, of appeal to any other milli ons, why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force? You do no t resist cold and hung er, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you qu ietly submit t o a thou sand simil ar nece ssities. You do no t put your head into the fire. But just in p ropo rtion as I regard this as not wholly a brute force, bu t partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to those milli ons as to so many milli ons of men, and no t of mere brute or inanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and instantaneously, from t hem t o the Maker of them, and, second ly, from t hem t o themselves. But, if I put my head deliberately into the fire, there is no appeal to fire or to the Maker of f ire, and I have only myself to b lame. If I could conv ince myself that I have a ny right to b e satisfied with men as they are, and to treat them acc ordingly, and no t according, in some respects, to my requ isitions and expectations of what they and I ought to b e, then, like a good Mussulm an and fatalist, I shou ld endeavor to b e satisfied with things as they are, and say it i s the will of God.

I do no t wish to qu arrel with any man o r nation. I do no t wish to split hairs, to make fine distinctions, o r set myself up as better than my neighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse for conformi ng to the laws of the land. I am but too ready to conform to them. Indeed, I have reason to suspect myself on this head; and eac h year, as the tax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and po sition o f the general and State governments, and the spirit of the people, to discover a pretext for conformi ty. “We must affect our country as our parents, And if at any tim e we a lienate Our love or indu stry from doing it hono r, We must respect effects and teac h the soul Matter of conscience a nd religion, And no t desire of rule or benefit.” I believe that the State will soon b e a ble to take all my work of this s ort out of my hands, and then I shall be no b etter a patriot than my fellow-coun trymen.
