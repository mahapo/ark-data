The Tavistock Institute for Human Relations has had a profound effect on the moral, spiritual, cultural, political and econo mic policies of the United States of America and Great Britain. It has been in the front line of the attack on the U.S. Constitution and State constitut ions. No group did more to propagandize the U.S. to participate in the WWI at a time when the majority of the American people were opposed to it. Much the same tactics were used by the Social Scien ce scientists at Tavistock to get the United States into WWII, Korea , Vietnam, Serbia and both wars against Iraq. Tavistock began as a pr opaganda creating and disseminating organization at Wellington House in L ondon in the run-up to WWI, what Toynbee called \"that black hole of dis information.\" On another occasion Toynbee called Wellington House \"a lie factory.\" From a somewhat crude beginning, Wellington House evolve d into the Tavistock Institute and went on to shape the destin y of Germany, Russia, Britain and the United States in a highly controver sial manner. The people of these nations were unaware that they were being \"brainwashed.\" The origin of \"mind control,\" \"inner directional conditioning\" and mass \"brainwashing\" is explained in an easy to understand book written with great authority. The fall of dynasties, the Bolshevik Revolution, WW I and WWII saw the destruction of old alliances and boundaries, the co nvulsions in religion, morals, family life, economic and political conduct , decadence in music and art can all be traced back to mass indoctrinati on (mass brainwashing) practiced by the Tavistock Institute Social Science scientists. Prominent among Tavistock's faculty were Edward Bernays, the double nephew of Sigmund Freud. It is said that Herr Goebbels, Propa ganda Minister in the German Third Reich used methodology devised by Bern ays as well as those of Willy Munzenberg, whose extraordinary care er is touched upon in this work about the past, present and future. Wi thout Tavistock, there would have been no WWI and WWII, no Bolshevik Revol ution, Korea, Vietnam, Serbia and Iraq wars. But for Tavistock, t he United States would not be rushing down the road to dissolution a nd collapse."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"V C ONTENTS FORWARD 1.

FORWARD. The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was unkn own to the people of the United States before Dr. Coleman exposed its existence in his monograph, The Tavistock Insti tute of Human Relations: Britain's Control of the United St ates. Up to that time, Tavistock had successfully retained i ts secretive role in shaping the affairs of the United States, i ts government and its people since its early beginning in London, in 1913 at Wellington House. Since Dr. Coleman's original article exposing this ultra- secret organization, others have come forward with claims of authorship, which they were unable to substantia te. Tavistock began as a propaganda creating and dissem inating organization centered at Wellington House, which wa s where the original organization was put together with int ent of shaping a propaganda outlet that would break down t he stiff public resistance being encountered to the looming war between Britain and Germany."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"X The project was given to Lords Rothmere and Northcl iffe and their mandate was to produce an organization capabl e of manipulating public opinion and directing that manu factured opinion down the desired pathway to support for a d eclaration of war by Great Britain against Germany. Funding was provided by the British royal family, a nd later by the Rothschilds to whom Lord Northcliffe was relate d through marriage. Arnold Toynbee was selected as Director o f Future Studies. Two Americans, Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays were appointed to handle the manipulation o f American public opinion in preparation for the entr y of the United States into WWI, and to brief and direct Pre sident Woodrow Wilson. From a somewhat crude beginning at Wellington House , grew an organization that was to shape the destiny of Germany, Britain and more especially the United Sta tes in manner that became a highly sophisticated organizat ion to manipulate and create public opinion, what is commo nly termed, \"mass brainwashing.\" During the course of its evolvement, Tavistock expa nded in size and ambition, when in 1937, a decision was mad e to use the German author Oswald Spengler's monumental work , Untergange des Abenlandes (The Decline of Western Civilization) as a model. Previously, Wellington House board members Rothmere , Northcliffe, Lippmann, and Bernays had read and pro posed as a guide the writings of Correa Moylan Walsh, in particular, the book The Climax of Civilization (19 17) as corresponding closely to conditions that had to be created before a New World Order in a One World Government could be ushered in."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"XI In this endeavor the members of the board consulted with the British royal family and obtained the approval of t he \"Olympians\" (the inner core of the Committee of 300 ) to formulate a strategy. Funding was provided by the m onarchy, the Rothschilds, the Milner Group and the Rockefell er family trusts. In 1936, Spengler's monumental work had come to the attention of what had become the Tavistock Institut e. In preparation for changing and reshaping public opini on for the second time in less than twelve years, by unanimous consent of the board, Spengler's massive book was adopted a s the blueprint for a new working model to bring about th e decline and fall of Western civilization necessary to creat e and establish a New World Order inside a One World Government. Spengler held it bound to happen that alien element s would be introduced into Western civilization in increasing numbers, and that the West would fail at that time to expel the aliens, thereby sealing its fate, a society, whose inward b eliefs and sound convictions would become at variance with its outward profession and thus Western civilization would fall by the wayside in the manner of the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome. Tavistock thinking was that Spengler had indoctrina ted Western civilization to believe that it would err o n the side of Roman civilization, and expel the aliens. The genet ic loss that has fallen upon Europe-and especially on Scand inavia, England, Germany, France-(the Anglo-Saxon, Nordic A lpine Germanic races) that began just before the Second W orld War is already so great as to be beyond expectations, a nd continues at an alarming pace under the skilled gui dance of the Tavistock managers."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XII What was a very rare instance became a common occur rence, a black man married to a white women or vice-versa. The two World Wars cost the German nation almost on e quarter of its population. Most of the intellectual energies of the German nation were diverted into war channels i n defense of the Fatherland at the expense of science, arts, literature, music and the cultural, spiritual and moral advance ment of the nation. The same could be said of the British n ation. The blaze kindled by the British under the direction of Tavistock set all of Europe on fire, and did incalculable dam age according to the Tavistock blueprint that matched S pengler's predictions. Classical and Western are the only two civilization s that could bring a modern renaissance to the world. They had flourished and progressed just as long as these civ ilizations remained under the control of the Anglo-Saxon Nordi c Alpine, Germanic races. The unsurpassed beauty of t heir literature, art, their classics, spiritual and mora l advancement of the female sex with a very large corresponding d egree of protection, was what distinguished Western and Clas sic civilizations from others. It was this bastion that Spengler saw coming under increasing attack and the thinking at Tavistock ran on paralle l tracks, but with a totally different goal. Tavistock saw this c ivilizations a stumbling block to ushering a New World Order, as d id the emphasis on protection and elevation of the female sex to a place of high respect and honor."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"XIII Thus the whole thrust of Tavistock was to \"democrat ize\" the West by an attack on womanhood, and the racial, mor al, spiritual and religious foundation upon which Weste rn civilization rested. As Spengler suggested, the Greeks and Romans were d evoted to the social, religious, moral and spiritual advan cement and the preservation of womanhood and they were success ful for just as long as they were in control and could arra nge matters so that government was carried out by a limited num ber of responsible citizens supported by the general popul ace below them, all being of the same pure unadulterated race . The planners at Tavistock saw that the way to upset the balance of Western civilization was to force unwelcome changes in the race by removing control from the deserving to the undeserving in the manner of ancient Roman leaders who were supplanted by their former slaves and aliens, whom they had permitted to come and dwell among them. Tavistock, by 1937, had come a long way from its Wellington House beginnings and the successful prop aganda campaign that had turned the British public from be ing strongly anti-war in 1913 to willing participants t hrough the arts of manipulation with the willing cooperation o f news communications media. The technique was carried across the Atlantic in 19 16 to manipulate the American people to support of the wa r in Europe. In spite of the fact that the vast majority , including at least 50 U.S. Senators were adamantly opposed to th e U.S. getting dragged into what they perceived was essent ially a quarrel between Britain and France on the one hand, and Germany on the other, largely over trade and econom ics, the conspirators were undeterred. At that point Welling ton House introduced the word, \"Isolationists\" as a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"XIV derogatory description of those Americans who oppos ed U.S. participation in the war. The use of such words and phrases has proliferated under the expert brainwashing of t he Social sciences scientists at Tavistock. Terms like \"regim e change,\" \"collateral damage\" became almost new English langu age. With the Tavistock plan modified to suit American conditions, Bernays and Lippmann led President Wood row Wilson to set up the very first Tavistock methodolo gy techniques for polling (manufacturing) so-called pu blic opinion created by Tavistock propaganda. They also taught Wilson to set up a secret body of \"managers\" to run the war effort and a body of \"advisors\" to assist the Presi dent in his decision-making. The Creel Commission was the first such body of opinion-makers set up in the United States. Woodrow Wilson was the first American president to publicly proclaim himself in favor of a Socialist N ew World Order inside a Socialist One World Government. His remarkable acceptance of the New World Order is fou nd in his book The New Freedom. We say \"his\" book, but actually, it was written by Socialist William B. Hayle. Wilson denounced capitalism. \"It is contrary to the common man and it has brought stagn ation to our economy,\" Wilson wrote. Yet, at the time, the United States economy was enj oying prosperity and industrial expansion as it had never experienced before in its history: \"We stand in the presence of a revolution—not a blo ody revolution, America is not given to spilling blood— but a silent revolution, whereby America will insist upon recovering to practice those ideals which she has always"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"XV professed, upon securing a government devoted to th e general and not the special interests. We are upon the threshold of a time when the systematic life of the country will be sustained or at least supplemented at every point by government activity. And now we have to determine w hat kind of a government activity it shall be; whether, in the first place, it shall be directed from government itself, or whether it shall be indirect, through instrumentalities whi ch have already constituted themselves and which stand read y to supersede government.\" While the U.S. was still a neutral power under the Wilson presidency, Wellington House poured out a cadence o f lies about Germany, and what a threat it was to America. We are reminded of the statement made by Bakunin in 1814 as it tied in so well with the outrageous propagand a that Wilson made use of to bolster his case: \"Lying by diplomacy: Diplomacy has no other mission . Every time a State wants to declare war upon anothe r State, it starts off by launching a manifesto addressed no t only to its own subjects but also to the whole world. In this manifesto it declares that right and justic e are on its side and endeavors to prove that it is actuated by love of peace and humanity (and democracy), and that, imbued with generous and peaceful sentiments, it suffered for a long time in silence until mounting iniquity of its enemy for ced it to bare its sword. \" \"At the same time it vows that, disdainful of all m aterial conquest and not seeking any increase in territory, it will put an end to this war as soon as justice is reestablis hed. And its antagonist's answer with a similar manifesto, in wh ich, naturally, right, justice and humanity and all"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XVI generous sentiments are to be found respectively on its side. These mutually opposed manifestos are written with the same eloquence, they breath the same righteous indignati on, and one is just as sincere as the other, that is to say they are both brazen in their lies, and it is only fools who are deceived by them. Sensible persons, all those who have some pol itical experience do not even take the trouble of reading such manifestos.\" President Wilson's statements just before he went t o the Congress to request a constitutional declaration of war embodies every one of Bakunin's sentiments. He was \"lying by diplomacy\" and he used the gross propaganda manufactured at Wellington House to infl ame the American public by tales of atrocities committed by the German Army in its march across Belgium in 1914. As we shall discover, it was, for the most part, a gigant ic lie passed off as truth. I remember looking through a large stack of old new spapers at the British Museum where I spent five years doin g in- depth research. The papers covered the years 1912 t o 1920. I recall thinking at the time: \"Isn't it amazing th at the rush to the New World Order Socialist totalitarian governme nt should be led by the United States, supposedly a ba stion of freedom?\" Then, as I recall, it came to me with great clarity that the Committee of 300 has its people at the highest and lowest echelons embedded in the U.S., in banking, industry , trade, defense, the State Department and indeed in the ver y White House, not to mention the Elite Club called the U.S . Senate, which in my view is a forum for pushing the New Wor ld Order.\""},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"XVII I recall thinking that President Wilson's propagand a blast against Germany and the Kaiser (actually the produc t of Rothschild agents Lords Northcliffe and Rothmere, a nd the Wellington House propaganda factory) was not much different to the \"contrived situation\" of Pearl Har bor, the Gulf of Tonkin \"incident\" and looking back now I ca n see no difference between the propaganda lies about the br utality of German soldiers allegedly chopping off the arms and legs of little Belgian children in 1914, than the method s used to get the American people duped and doped into allowi ng the Bush administration to invade Iraq. Whereas in 1914 it was the Kaiser who was a \"brute savage,\" a \"ruthless mu rderer\", a \"monster\", the \"Butcher of Berlin\", in 2002 it wa s President Hussein who was all of these things and a whole lot more, including the \"Butcher of Baghdad!\" Poor duped, deluded, deceived, connived, trustful, America! Whe n will you ever learn? In 1917 the New World Order agenda was being rushed through the House and Senate by Woodrow Wilson, and President Bush forced the New World Order agenda fo r Iraq through the House and Senate in 2002 without debate , an exercise in arbitrary power and a gross violation o f the U.S. Constitution for which the American people are payi ng a huge price. But the American people are suffering f rom toxic shock induced by the Tavistock Institute of Human R elations and the American people are in a state of sleepwalk ing and without leadership. They do not know what the price is and do not care to find out. The Committee of 300 continues to rule the Uni ted States, just as it did in the Wilson and Roosevelt presidencies, while the American people were distra cted with \"bread and circuses\" only today it is baseball, foo tball, endless Hollywood, and Social Security. Nothing has changed ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"XVIII The United States, harried, hounded, pushed and sho ved is headed of a fast track to the New World Order, prop elled along by the Radical Republicans of the War Party w ho have been taken over by the scientists at the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations. Just recently I was asked by a subscriber \"where do we find the Tavistock Institute?\" My response was: \"Look ar ound the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, the Whit e House, the State Department, the Defense Department, Wall Street, Fox T.V. (Faux T.V.) and you will see their change agents in every one of these places.\" President Wilson was the first U.S. president to \"m anage\" the war through a civilian committee guided and directe d by the Bernays and Lippmann from Wellington House, to whic h we have already made mention. The resounding success of Wellington House and its enormous influence on the course of American histor y began before that in 1913. Wilson had spent almost a year tearing down the protective trade tariffs that had defended the American domestic markets from being overwhelmed by \"Free Trade,\" essentially the practice of allowing cheap British goods made with cheap labor in India to flo od the American market. On October 12, 1913 Wilson signed the bill that was the beginning of the end of the unique Ame rican middle class, long the target of the Fabian Sociali sts. The bill was described as a measure to \"adjust tariffs,\" but it would have been accurate to describe it as a bill to \"des troy tariffs.\" Such was the hidden power of Wellington House that the vast majority of the American people accepted this lie, not knowing or realizing that it was a death knell for American commerce that would lead to NAFTA, GATT and the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"XIX World Trade Organization (WTO). Even more astonishi ng was the acceptance of the Federal Income Tax Act th at was passed on September 5, 1913, to replace trade tarif fs as the source of revenue for the Federal Government. Incom e Tax is a Marxist doctrine not found in the U.S. Constituti on anymore than the Federal Reserve Bank is found in t he Constitution. Wilson called his twin blows against the Constitution, \"a fight for the people, and for free business,\" and said he was proud to have taken \"part in the co mpletion of a great piece of business...\" The Federal Reserve A ct, explained by Wilson as \"reconstructing the Nation's banking and currency system\" was rushed through on a flood- tide of propaganda emanating from Wellington House, just in time for the hostilities that began the horror of WWI. Most historians are agreed that without passage of the Federal Reserve Bank Act, Lord Grey would not have been abl e to start that terrible conflagration. The deceptive language of the Federal Reserve Act w as under the guidance of Bernays and Lippman who set u p a \"National Citizen's League\" with the notorious Samu el Untermeyer as its chairman, to promote the Federal Reserve Bank, that secured control of the people's money an d currency and transferred it to a private monopoly w ithout the victim's consent. One of the most interesting pieces of history surro unding the imposition of the foreign financial slavery measure was that before it was sent to Wilson for his signature, a c opy was given to the sinister Colonel Edward Mandel House a s the representative of Wellington House and the British oligarchy represented by the banker, J.P. Morgan."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XX As to the American people, in whose name the disast rous measure was instituted, they had not the faintest i dea how they had been connived, cheated, lied to and utterl y deceived. An instrument of slavery was fastened around their necks without the victims ever becoming aware of it. Wellington House methodology was at its height when Wilson was coached in how to persuade Congress to d eclare war on Germany, although he had won election on the solemn promise to keep America out of the war then raging in Europe, a great triumph for the new art of publi c opinion making. It was just that - the poll questions were shaded in such away that the answers reflected the opinions o f the public; not their understanding of the questions, n or their understanding of the processes of political science . A thorough search and reading of the Congressional Records from 1910 to 1920 by this writer showed very clearl y that had Wilson not signed the iniquitous \"currency reform\" bill on December 23, 1913, the upper-level parallel secret government of the United States foretold by H.G. We lls would not have been able to commit the vast resourc es of the United States to the war in Europe. The House of Morgan representing the \"Olympians\" of the Committee of 300, and its all powerful City of Lond on financial nexus, played a leading role in shaping t he \"U.S. Federal Reserve Banks,\" which were neither \"Federal \" nor \"banks,\" but a private money-generating monopoly fa stened around the necks of the American people whose money was now free to be stolen on an unimaginable scale, mak ing them slaves of the New World Order inside the coming One World Government. The Great Depression of the 1930s was t he second major catastrophic bill the American people had to pay, the first being World War I. (See Appendix)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"XXI Those who read this book as a first introduction to the New World Order inside a One World Government will be skeptical; but consider that no less a personage th an the great Sir Harold Mackinder did not hide his beliefs about its coming. More than that, he gave notice that it might be a d ictatorship. Sir Harold had an impressive resume (CV) having bee n Professor of Geography at the University of London; a director of the London School of Economics from 190 3-1908 and a Member of Parliament from 1910-1922. He was a lso a close associate of Arnold Toynbee one of the leadin g lights at Wellington House. He had correctly predicted a core of startling geopolitical events, many of them actuall y coming to pass. One such \"prophecy\" was the founding of two Germany s, the Social Democratic Republic of Germany and the Feder al Republic of Germany. Critics suggested that he got the information from Toynbee; that it was merely the lo ng range planning of the Committee of 300 that Toynbee knew about. After Wellington House, Toynbee moved to the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA), and the n to London University where he held the chair for Internationa l History. In his book, America and World Revolution he said: \"If we are to avoid mass-suicide, we must have our world- state quickly and this probably means that we must have it in a non-democratic form to begin with. We will have t o start building a world-state now on the best design that is practicable at the moment.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"XXII Toynbee went on in a forthright manner saying this \"world dictatorship\" would have to supplant \"the local nat ional states which litter the present political map.\" The new world-state was to be brought about on the basis of mass mind control and propaganda that would make it acceptable. I explained in my book The Committee of 300, that Bernays \"blew the whistle\" on polling in his 1 923 and 1928 books, Propaganda, and Crystallizing Public Op inion. This was followed by Engineering Consent: Self-preservation, ambition, pride, hunger, love of family and children, patriotism, imitativeness, the desire to be a leader, love of play-these and other drives are the psychol ogical raw materials which every leader must take into account in his endeavor to win the public to his point of view... To maintain their self-assurance, most people need to feel cert ain that whatever they believe about anything is true. These revealing works are examined and we should ad d that in writing them, the Tavistock hierarchy apparently felt secure enough to gloat over their control of the United St ates and Great Britain that had blossomed into an open consp iracy along the lines first suggested by H.G. Wells. With the advent of Wellington House, funded by the British monarchy and later by Rockefeller, Rothschild and t he United States, Western civilization entered into th e first phase of a plan that would provide a secret governm ent to rule the world, namely, the Committee of 300."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"XXIII Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was its crea tion.

Th is book is an attempt to do just that."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1 CHAPTER 1 Founding the World's Premiere Brainwashing Institut e From its modest but vitally important beginning at Wellington House, the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations expanded rapidly to become the world's pr emier top-secret \"brainwashing\" institute.\" How this rapi d progression was accomplished needs to be explained. The modern science of mass manipulation of public o pinion was born at Wellington House, London, the lusty inf ant being midwifed by Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothmere. The British monarchy, Lord Rothschild, and the Rock efellers were responsible for funding the venture. The paper s we were privileged to examine showed that the purpose of th ose at Wellington House was to effect a change in the opin ion of the British people who were adamantly opposed to wa r with Germany, a formidable task that was accomplished by \"opinion making\" through polling. The staff consist ed of Arnold Toynbee, a future director of studies at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), Lords No rhcliffe, and the Americans, Walter Lippmann and Edward Berna ys. Bernays was born in Vienna on November 22, 1891. As the nephew of Sigmund Freud the father of psychoanalysi s, regarded by many as \"the father of public relations \" although the title properly belongs to Willy Munzenberg. Ber nays pioneered the use of psychology and other social sc iences to shape and form public opinion so that the public th ought such manufactured opinions were their own."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"2 \"If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment th e masses according to our will without them knowing it.\" Ber nays postulated. He called this technique \"Engineering C onsent. One of his best-known techniques of achieving this goal was the indirect use of what he called third party auth orities to shape the desired opinions: \"If you can influence t he leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway. This technique he called \"opinion making.\" Perhaps we can now begin to understand how it was t hat Wilson, Roosevelt, Clinton, Bush the elder and the younger could so easily lead American into disastrous wars in which its people should never have become involved. The joint British and American participants concent rated their efforts on techniques as yet not tried out, t o mobilize support for the war looming on the horizon. As previously stated, the British people did not wa nt war, and said so, but Toynbee, Lippmann and Bernays expected to change that by applying techniques designed to mani pulate public opinion through the use of polling. Herein w e provide a review of the methods that were devised and execu ted to bring Great Britain and the United States into the First World War, plus the techniques that were put into practic e between the two World Wars and beyond. As will be seen prop aganda was to play a major role. One of the main objectives at Tavistock was to achi eve the degradation of women. Tavistock recognized that Jes us Christ has brought a new place of respect in the or der of civilization to womanhood, which prior to his comin g had not been present."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"3 After Christ's ministry, womanhood gained a respect and a high place in society absent from pre-Christian civ ilizations. Of course it can be argued that such an elevated st atus existed in the Greek and Roman empires, and that would be t rue to a certain extent, but not to the extent that womanhoo d was elevated in post-Christ society. Tavistock sought to change that and the process beg an immediately after WWI. The Eastern Orthodox Church which the Rus (Viking) princes of Moscow brought ba ck from Constantinople, revered and respected womanhoo d, and their experience with the Khazarians whom they subsequently defeated and drove out of Russia, left them determined to protect womanhood in Russia. The founder of the Romanov dynasty, Michael Romanov was the scion of a noble family that had defended Russi a on the basis of a Christian country. From 1613 the Romanov s sought to ennoble Russia and imbue it with a great spirit of Christianity, which meant also, protection for and the honoring of Russian womanhood. The Princes of Moscow under Prince Dimitri Donskoi earned the unremitting hatred of the Rothschilds for Russi a because of Donskoi's defeat and expulsion of the Khazarian hordes that inhabited the lower-regions of the Volga. This barbaric warrior nation of mysterious Indo-Turk origin, had adopted the Judaic religion on passage of a decree by King Bulant after the religion was approved by the chief Khazar ian soothsayer-magician-sorcerer, David el-Roi. It was el Roi's personal flag, now called the \"Star of David\" that became the official flag of the Khazarian nati on when they settled in Poland after being forced out of Ru ssia."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"4 The flag was adopted by the Zionists as their stand ard and is still mistakenly called the \"Star of David.\" Christ ians make the error of confusion linking it with the Old Test ament King David, when in fact there is no relation between th e two. The hatred of Russia was compounded in 1612 when th e Romanov dynasty led a Russian Army against Poland t aking back large parts of Poland that had formerly belong ed to Russia. The principal architect of enmity brought to bear a gainst Russia was the Rothschild dynasty and it was this b urning hatred that Tavistock used and channeled in its pla n to destroy Western civilization. The first opportunity created by Tavistock came in 1905 with the attack by the Japanese Navy that completely sur prised the Russian Fleet. The exercise was bankrolled by Jacob Schiff, the Wall Street banker, who was related to Rothschi ld. The defeat of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in a surprise attack marked the beginning of the pall of gloom th at was about to roll in over Christian Europe. The Rockefe ller Standard Oil Group directed by Tavistock and with t he aid of the \"300\" engineered the Russo-Japanese War. The mo ney used to finance the operation came from Jacob Schif f, but was actually provided by the Rockefeller General Ed ucation Board, whose outward purpose was to finance Negro education. All of the propaganda and advertising fo r the board was written and crafted by the Social scienti sts at Tavistock, which was then called \"Wellington House. \""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"5 In 1941 another Rockefeller front organization, the Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR) gave large sums to its Japanese counterpart in Tokyo.

Again, Tavistock was the originator of all of IPR's publications. Although it was not yet evident, as Spengler was to mention in his monumental work, published in 1936, it marke d the beginning of the end of the old order. Contrary to most establishment accounts of history, the \"Russian\" re volution was not a Russian revolution at all, but a foreign ideology backed primarily by the Committee of 300 and its ar m, the Tavistock Institute, that was violently forced upon a startled, unprepared and dismayed Romanov family. It was political warfare, low grade warfare and psy chological warfare in which Tavistock had become well versed. As Winston Churchill was to remark: \"They transport ed Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia,\" and then once established \"Lenin and Trotsky seized Russia by the hair of its head.\" Much has been written (but nearly always in passing as if it is a mere postscript to history) about the \"sealed tru ck,\" \"sealed car,\" \"sealed train,\" that transported Lenin and hi s Bolshevik revolutionaries safely through the midst of war-tor n Europe and deposited them in Russia, there to begin their imported Bolshevik Revolution so mistakenly termed the \"Russ ian Revolution.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"6 Documents the author was privileged to study at Wel lington House and what was revealed in the Arnold Toynbee p apers and Bruce Lockhart's private papers, led to the con clusion that without Toynbee, Bruce Lockhart of MI6 British intelligence and without the complicity of at least five European nations, ostensibly loyal and friendly wit h the Court at St. Petersburg, the merciless Bolshevik Re volution would have been still-born. As this account must of necessity be limited to Tav istock's participation in the affair, it will not be as a co mplete account of the skullduggery we would liked to have presente d. According to Milner's private papers his aides thro ugh Tavistock contacted a fellow Socialist Fritz Platte n. (Milner was a leading Fabian Socialist although he scorned Sydney and Beatrice Webb.) It was Platten, who planned the logistics of the trip and oversaw it until the revolutionarie s arrived in Petrograd. This was confirmed and borne out by the Wilhelmstra sse Files the majority of which we were able to gain ac cess to, which files were open to certain people qualified t o read them. They tallied fairly closely with Bruce Lockha rt's account in his private papers as well as what Lord Alfred Milner had to say about the underhand affair that b etrayed Russia. It appeared that Milner had many contacts a mong the Bolshevik expatriates among them, Lenin. It was to Lord Milner that Lenin went, when he needed money for th e Revolution. Armed with a letter of introduction fro m Platten, Lenin met with Lord Milner and laid down his plan f or the overthrow of the Romanov's and Christian Russia. Milner agreed on condition that he could send his a gent Bruce Lockhart of MI6 to supervise the day-to-day a ffairs and report back on Lenin."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"7 Lord Rothschild and the Rockefellers demanded that they be allowed to send Sydney Reilly to Russia to supervis e transfer of Russia's natural resources and the gold rubles h eld in the Central Bank to London.

Countries in complicity with the \"sealed train\" aff air were Great Britain, Germany, Finland, Switzerland and Sw eden. While the United States was not directly involved, it must have been aware of what was going on. After all, on the orders of President Wilson, a brand new American pa ssport was issued to Leon Trotsky, (whose real name was Le v Bronstein) so that he could travel in peace, althou gh Trotsky was not a U.S. citizen. Lenin and his compatriots were provided with a priv ate well- appointed rail carriage by the top German governmen t functionaries and always kept locked by agreements with stations along the line. Platten was in charge and he laid down the rules for the trip, some of which are list ed in the Wilhelmstrasse Files: The carriage was to remain locked for the entire tr ip. No one could board the carriage without Platten's permission. The train would have extra territorial status. No passports were to be asked at borders. Tickets would be bought at regular prices.

One of the notable revolutionaries, who joined the train when it arrived at the German frontier with Switzerland, was Radek, who was to play a leading role in the bloody Bolshevik Revolution. There were some lighter momen ts too. The Wilhelmstrasse Files describe how the carriage missed its engine at Frankfurt, resulting in it being shun ted to and fro for about 8 hours. The party had to de-train in the German Baltic town of Sasnitz where they were accorded \"decent accommodat ion\" by the German Government. The Swedish Government kindl y gave them ferry transport to Malmo, from where they sailed to Stockholm, where \"nice\" accommodation awaited th e Bolshevik party for an overnight layover and then i t was on to the Finnish border. There, the intrepid Platten left the high-spirited party and the final journey into Russia was made by train to Petr ograd. Thus an epic journey that began in Zurich, Switzerl and, ended in Petrograd. Lenin had arrived on the scene and Russia was about to be brought low.

One thing that many writers -myself included - are agreed on. The war was started by Great Britain out of sheer h ated of Germany's rapid progress toward becoming a major economic power in competition against Britain, and Lord Edward Grey was the principle architect of the war. That it was unpopular and not approved of by a larg e majority of the British people called for \"special measures\" a new department to handle the challenge.

The aftermath of the First World War and the failed attempts to form a League of Nations served only to emphasiz e the gap between the old Western civilization and the new. T he economic disaster of postwar Germany hung like the smoke from a funeral pyre over Western culture adding to the dismal, sad and fearful climate that began in the 1 920s. Historian agree that all of the combatants suffered economic ravage of varying degree, although Russia was somew hat spared, only to be destroyed by the Bolsheviks, whi le Germany and Austria were the hardest hit. A strange kind of a forced gaiety descended on Europe in the 1920s (in which I include Britain) and the United States. It was put down to \"rebellious youth\" and people generally being \"sick of war and politics.\" In point of fact, people were reacti ng to the long-range penetration and inner-directional condit ioning of the masters at Tavistock. In the period between the end of WWI and 1935, they were as much shell-shocked as were the troops who had su rvived the hell of the trenches with shot and shell flying all around them, only now, it was economic shot and shell and vast changes in social mores that numbed their senses. But the end result of the \"treatment\" was the same. People threw discretion to the winds and the moral rot tha t was set in motion in 1918, is ongoing and gathering momentum.

In 1935 with Hitle r rising to power, guaranteed by the impossible conditions forc ed upon Germany at Versailles, hemlines were also rising to the dizzy height of the knees, except in Germany, where Hitle r was demanding modesty from German womanhood and getting it, along with wholesome respect, which did not suit Ta vistock's book. People who stopped to think at all said they hated the way \"times are changing,\" but what they did not and cou ld not know was that times were being made to change accor ding to a carefully laid out Tavistock formula. Everywhere else in Europe and America the revolt was on as \"emancipati on\" fever spread. In the United States it was silent screen idols who led the way, but this was no match with what was happening in Europe where every single \"pleasure\" was being indu lged in, including homosexuality, that had long been hidden in darkness and never mentioned in polite society. Homosexuality emerged alongside lesbianism to shock disgust, and it seemed, to deliberately affront tho se who still lingered in the old order. A study of this aberration showed that homosexualit y and lesbianism became rampant not out of any inner or l atent desires, but as a means to \"shocking\" the old estab lishment with its rigid codes of good order.

During the course of years, the Federal Government contributed millions upon millions of dollars to Tavistock and its expanded w eb of interlinking institutions, while corporate America and Wall Street came up with matching amounts. We make bold to say that without the amazing growth and advances techniques for mass brainwashing developed by the Tavistock Institute, there would have been no Secon d World War, nor any of the wars that followed, and certain ly not the two Gulf Wars, the second of which is still raging in November 2005."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 By the year 2000 there was hardly any aspect of lif e in America into which Tavistock's tentacles had not re ached and that included every level of government from local to federal, industry, trade, education and the political instit utions of the nation. Every mental and psychological aspect of th e nation was analyzed, recorded, profiled and stored in comp uter memory banks. What has come out of this is what Tavistock calls \" a three- system response\" and it is how population groups re act to stress resulting from \"contrived situations\" that b ecome crisis management exercises. What we have in the U.S. and Britain is a government, that creates a situation viewed by its citizens as a crisis, and government then manages that \"cris is.\" An example of a \"contrived situation\" was the Japan ese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor was \"contrived\" as previously explaine d herein with the transfer of Rockefeller cash to Richard So rge the master spy, and then to a member of the imperial fa mily to prompt Japan to fire the first shots so that the Ro osevelt administration could take the United States into WW II. The economic strangulation of Japan by Britain and the United States unilaterally choking off the flow of essential raw materials to the island factory that was Japan, had reached a point where a decision was made to put an end to it. Tavistock played an enormous role in crafting the m assive wave of anti-Japanese propaganda that swept the Uni ted States into the war in Europe via war against Japan ."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"21 Unbearable economic pressure was put on Japan while at the same time the Roosevelt administration refused to \"negotiate,\" until the Tokyo government could see n o way out but to attack at Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt had co nveniently obligingly shifted the Pacific Fleet into harm's wa y by moving it from its safe-haven at San Diego to Pearl Harbor, for absolutely no valid or strategic reason, thereb y placing it squarely in reach of the Japanese Navy. Another example is more recent; the Gulf War that b egan when a hue and a cry was raised about Iraq's allege d stocks of nuclear and chemical weapons, the so-called \"weapon s of mass destruction,\" (WMD's.) The Bush administration and the Blair government knew the issue was a \"contrive d situation\" without foundation or merit; they knew t hat there were no such weapons. Indisputable proof existed th at Hussein's weapons program had been nullified after the 1991 Gulf War and through continued brutal sanctions. In short, the two Western \"leaders\" were caught out in a web of lies, yet such is the power of the Committee of 300 and the brainwashing power of Tavistock, that they remained in office although it is an accepted fact that because of their lies, at least one million Iraqis and more than 2000 Amer ican servicemen dead and 25,999 wounded (Russia's GRU Military Intelligence figures) of which 53 percent are maimed, with the cost in monetary terms as of Octob er 2005, exceeding $550 billion.

There is no parallel in history where a man holding the highest office was proved to be a liar and deceiver and yet could remain in power as if nothing had stained his office, a state of affairs that demonstrates the power of the Tavistock Institute's \"long range penetration and inner condi tioning\" treatment of the American people, that would cause them docilely to accept such a turgid, horror-filled sit uation without ever taking to the streets in rage. Well did Henry Ford say that \"people deserve the government they get\" if the people do nothing to tu rn that government out of office, such as is the right of t he American people under their U.S. Constitution, then they des erve to have liars and deceivers running their nation and t heir lives. On the other hand, the American people may well be going through the one of the three phases of what Dr. Fre d Emery, at one time the senior psychiatrist at Tavistock, o nce described as \"social environmental turbulence.\" Acc ording to Emery: \"Large populations groups manifest the follo wing symptoms when subjected to conditions of violent so cial changes, stress and turbulence which can be divided into well-defined categories: Superficiality is the condition that manifests itse lf when the threatened population group reacts by adopting shal low sloganeering, which they attempt to pass off as ide als.\" Very little \"ego investment\" takes place making the first phase a \"maladaptive response\" because, as Emery st ated, \"the cause of the crisis is not isolated and identi fied\" and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"23 the crisis and tension is not abated, but continues for as long as the controller want it to last. The second phase of the crisis reaction (since the crisis is continuing), is \"frag mentation\", a condition in which panic strikes, \"social cohesion\" falls apart with the result that very small groups form and att empt to protect themselves from the crisis with little or n o regard for the expense or cost to other fragmented, small grou ps. This phase Emery calls \"passive maladaption,\" while stil l failing to identify the cause of the crisis. The third phase is when the victims turn away from the source of the induced crisis and the resulting tens ion. They take \"fantasy trips of internal migration, introspe ction and obsession with self.\" This is what Tavistock calls \"disassociation and self realization.\" Emery goes o n to explain that \"the passive maladaption responses are now coupled with \"active maladaptive responses.\" Emery states that over the past 50 years that exper iments in applied social psychology and resultant \"crisis man agement\" have taken over all aspects of life in America and the results are stored in the computers in the major \"think tan ks\" such as Stanford University. The scenarios are taken out, u sed and revised from time to time and, according to Tavisto ck, \"the scenarios are in operation at the present time.\" Translated this means that Tavistock has the majori ty of the American people profiled and brainwashed. If any pa rt of the American public is ever able to identify the cause of the crises that have washed over this nation in the past seven ty years, the social engineering structure built by Tavistock will come crashing down. But that has not yet happened.

Today, the manipulation-by-polls of public opinion has become a central technique in the hands of the soci al engineers and controllers of the Social scientists employed at Tavistock and its many \"think tanks\" located all ov er the United States and Britain."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"25 CHAPTER 5 Do we have what H.G. Wells called \"An Invisible Government?\" As I have previously related, the modern science of making public opinion through advanced techniques of manip ulating mass-opinion began at one of the West's most advanc ed propaganda factory situated in Britain at Wellingto n House. This facility dedicated to social engineering and c reating public opinion at the commencement of World War I, was under the aegis of Lords Rothmere and Northcliffe, and the future director of studies of the Royal Institute o f International Affairs (RIIA), Arnold Toynbee. Welli ngton House had an American Section, whose most prominent members were Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays. As we discovered later, Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, a fact carefully hidden from public view. Jointly, they centered work on techniques to \"mobil ize\" support for World War I among the masses of people who were opposed to war with Germany. The public percep tion was that Germany was a friend of the British people , not an enemy and the British people saw no need to fight G ermany. After all, was it not true that Queen Victoria was the cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm II? Toynbee, Lippmann and Bernays wo rked to persuade them that war was necessary, using the techniques of the new science through new arts of mass-manipul ation via the communications media for its propaganda purpose s tinged with willingness to lie, which was just gett ing into its stride, having learned a great deal of experience d uring the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902). It was not only the British public whose perception of events had to be altered, but also a recalcitrant American public."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"26 To this end Bernays and Lippmann were instrumental in getting Woodrow Wilson to establish the Creel Commi ttee, which created the first body of methodological tech niques for dissemination of successful propaganda and for the science of polling to secure the \"correct\" opinion. From the beginning the techniques were designed in such a way that polling (public opinion-making) was based on one obvious, but striking feature: — it was concerned w ith people's opinions, not with their understanding of the processes of science. Thus, by intent, the pollster s elevated an essentially irrational element of mind to a primary level of public focus. This was a conscious decision to unde rmine the grasps of reality of masses of people in an increas ingly complex industrial society. If you have ever watched \"Fox News\" where viewers a re given the results of a poll about \"what Americans a re thinking,\" and then for the next hour found yoursel f shaking your head and wondering what the results of the pol l reflected about your own thinking processes, then y ou could only have felt more puzzled than ever. The key to understanding Fox News and the poll migh t lie in what Lippmann had to say about such matters. In his 1922 book, Public Opinion, Lippmann outlined Tavistock's psychological warfare methodology. In an introductory chapter, \"The World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads,\" Lippmann stressed, \"that th e object of study of the public opinion social analyst is re ality as defined by internal perception or images of that re ality. Public opinion deals with indirect, unseen, and puz zling facts, and there is nothing obvious about them. The situations to which public opinions refer are known only as op inions....\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"27 \"The pictures inside the heads of these human being s, the pictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes, and relationship, are their public opinions. Those pictures, which are acted upon by groups of people, or by ind ividuals acting in the name of groups, are Public Opinion wi th capital letters. The picture inside so often misleads men i n their dealings with the world outside.\" From this evaluation, it is easy to take the next d ecisive step made by Bernays, — that the elites who run society can and do marshal the resources of mass communications to mobilize and alter the \"herd\" mind. One year after Lippmann's book, Bernays authored Crystallizing Public Opinion. He followed that in 1 928 with a book entitled quite simply: Propaganda. In the first chapter, \"Organizing Chaos\" Bernays wr ote: The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the o rganized, habits and opinions of the masses is an important e lement in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unsee n mechanism of society constitute an invisible govern ment, which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes f ormed, our ideas-suggested, largely by men, that we have n ever heard of... Our invisible governors are, in many ca ses, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this c ondition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our d aily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"28 in our social conductor or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons —a trifling fraction of our hundred arid twenty millio n—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires, which contro l the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive ne w ways to bind and guide the world. In Propaganda, Bernays followed his praise of the \" invisible government\" by underscoring the next phase that pro paganda techniques would follow: As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demo nstrated, the technical means have been invented and develope d by which opinion may be regimented. With the printing press and the newspaper, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas can spread rapidly and even instan taneously over the whole of America. To back up his point, Bernays quoted the mentor of \"public opinion manipulation,\" H. G. Wells. He cited a 1928 article in the New York Times in which Wells welcomed \"mode rn means of communication\" for \"opening up a new world of political processes,\" and for allowing \"the common design\" to be \"documented and sustained against perversion and betrayal.\" For Wells, the advent of \"mass communica tion\" leading up to television meant fantastic new paths for social control beyond the wildest dreams of the earlier ma ss- manipulation fanatics of the British Fabian Society . We shall return to this vitally important subject later here in."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"29 CHAPTER 6 Mass communications ushers in the polling industry For Bernays, his recognition of Wells' idea won him a key place in the hierarchy of U.S. public opinion contr ollers; in 1929, he won a position at CBS, which had recently been taken over by William Paley. By the same token, the advent of mass communication s ushered in the polling/sampling industry, to organi ze the perceptions of the masses for the media mafia (part of the \"invisible government\" running the show from behind the scenes.) By 1935-36, polling was in full swing. In the same year, Elmo Roper began his Fortune magazine FOR surveys, which evolved into his \"What People Are Thinking\" c olumn for the New York Herald Tribune. George Gallup initiated the American Institute of P ublic Opinion; — in 1936 he opened up the British Institu te of Public Opinion. Gallup was to headquarter his activ ities around Princeton University, intermeshing with the Office of Public Opinion Research/Institute for International Social Research/Psychology Department complex run by Hadle y Cantril, who was destined to play an increasingly i mportant role in developing the psychological profiling meth ods later to be used in manufacturing the Aquarian Conspiracy . In the same 1935-36 period, the first-time use was made of polling in presidential elections, under the impetu s of two newspapers owned by the Cowles family, the Minneapo lis Star-Tribune and the Des Moines Register.

It is not certain who introduced the practice of \"a dvisors to the President,\" - those persons who are not elected by the citizens and whom they have no opportunity to vet, but who decided the internal and external foreign policies of the Nation. Woodrow Wilson was the first American Presi dent to make use of the practice. Opinion Research and World War II These were all small lead-ups to the next phase, tr iggered by two important intersecting developments: the arriva l of emigre psychological warfare expert Kurt Lewin in I owa, and the involvement of the United States in World War I I. World War II provided the emerging Tavistock Social sciences scientists with enormous scope for experim entation. Lewin's leadership put together the key-force that would deploy after World War II to utilize those techniqu es developed in warfare against the population of the United States. In fact in 1946, Tavistock declared war on the civilian population of the United States and has remained in a state of war ever since. The basic conceptions expounded by Lewin, Wells, Be rnays, and Lippmann remained in place as the guidepost for manipulation of public opinion; the war gave the So cial scientists the opportunity to apply them in highly concentrated form and to bring together a large num ber of institutions under their direction to further the e nds of their experiments."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"31 The core institute which was the vehicle for making \"public opinion,\" was the Committee on National Morale. Ost ensibly established to mobilize support for the war in much as President Wilson had set up his management committe e to \"manage\" WWI, its real purpose was to carry out the intensive profiling of both the \"Axis\" and American s population for the purposes of creating and maintai ning a means of social control. The committee was headed by several leaders of Amer ican society, including Robert P. Bass, Herbert Bayard S wope, among other notables. Its secretary was Margaret Me ade's husband, Gregory Bateson, one of the principal inst igators of the CIA's notorious \"MK - Ultra\" LSD experiments th at some experts consider as the launch vehicle for the U.S. counterculture of drugs, rock and sex. The committee's Board of Trustees included poll-tak er George Gallup; intelligence agent Ladislas Farago a nd Tavistock psychologist, Gardner Murphy. The committee ran a number of special projects, the most important being a major study on how best to wage Psychological Warfare on Germany. The key personnel critical to the development of the public opinion p roject were: * Kurt K. Lewin, Education and History; Psychology; Social Sciences * Professor Gordon W. Allport, Psychology * Professor Edwin G. Borin, Psychology * Professor Hadley Cantril, Psychology * Ronald Lippitt, Social Sciences * Margaret Mead, Anthropology, Social Sciences; Youth & Child Development"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"32 The staff numbered more than a 100 researchers who comprised the staff of the Committee, and several o pinion- profiling institutions critical to the project. One such a special project team was in the Office a nd Strategic Services (OSS) (the forerunner of the CIA ) composed of Margaret Mead, Kurt Lewin, Ronald Lippi tt, Dorwin Cartwright, John K. French and public-opinio n makers like Samuel Stouffer (later chairman of the Laboratory Social Relations group at Harvard Univer sity); Paul Lazarsfeld of Columbia University's Sociology Department, who developed with profiler Harold Lass well an \"opinion research\" methodology for the OSS based on detailed \"content analysis\" of the local press of e nemy countries and Rensis Likert. Likert, a Prudential Insurance Company key executiv e immediately before the war, had perfected profiling techniques as the director of research for the Life Insurance Agency Management Association. This equipped him to interact favorably with the head of the U.S. Strate gic Bombing Survey, who was the former head of Prudenti al Life Insurance Company. Likert served as director of the division of morale of the Strategic Bombing Survey from 1945 -1946 from which position he had enormous scope for mass public opinion profiling and manipulation."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"33 CHAPTER 7 The making of public opinion According to Tavistock Institute records, the Strat egic Bombing Survey played a key role in forcing Germany to its knees through a highly disciplined program of syste matic bombing of German worker housing, which Sir Arthur Harris of the RAF was only too delighted to carry out. In addition, from 1939-1945, Likert ran the Divisio n of Program Surveys of the Department of Agriculture, f rom which major studies were undertaken in the techniqu es of \"mass persuasion.\" Or to put it another way, \"makin g public opinion to fit the desired goals.\" One can only spe culate on the numbers of citizens who believed their support for the \"Allied\" war effort sprang from their own opinions. One of Likert's key aides in the division was Lewin protege and future Tavistock operative Dorwin Cartwright, w ho wrote the text-book document titled, \"Some Principl es of Mass Persuasion \" which is still in use today. Another major agency for shaping public opinion was the Office of War Information, directed by Gardner Cowl es for much of the war effort. Bernays was brought into OW I as an advisor. It is out of the nexus we have described h ere that the network of key \"polling institutions\" emerged after World War II. They have played a powerful and decisive ro le in American life ever since. Gallup, from the committe e on National Morale's Board of Trustees, upgraded his a ctivity and became the key commander of polling institution s for launching new policies of the Committee of 300, whi ch he passed off as \"polling results.\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34 Bernays played several key postwar roles. In 1953, he wrote a paper for the State Department that recommended s etting up a psychological warfare office by State. In 1954 , he was a consultant to the U.S. Air Force, the armed forces branch most under the influence of the Strategic Bombing S urvey people. During this early 1950s period, Bernays was public relations counsel to the United Fruit (United Brands) Corpora tion, one of the leading corporations in the communication/na tional security apparat (Eisenhower's \"military-industrial complex\") then busy with consolidating its power over U.S. po licy. Bernays conducted the propaganda campaign alleging Guatemala was falling under \"Communist control\" tha t resulted in a U.S. engineered coup in that country. In 1955 Bernays wrote a book about his experience titled \"T he Engineering of Consent.\" The book became the virtual Tavistock blueprint fol lowed by the U.S. Government to overthrow any country whose policies were unacceptable to the One World Governm ent Socialist dictatorship. Throughout the postwar period, Bernays was a member of the Society for Applied Anthropology, one of Margaret M ead's social-control institutions inside the U.S., and th e Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, a group c reated by John Rawlings Reese, a founder member of Tavistock to run \"psychiatric shock troops\" among the American popul ation. One of its first actions was the unlashing of homos exuality in Florida, a move bitterly opposed by Anita Bryant wh o had no idea of what she was up against."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"35 The second of its actions was to introduce the them e that non-white people are more intelligent than whites, which we shall discuss later. Likert moved to the University of Michigan to set u p the Institute for Social Research (ISR) that absorbed t he Massachusetts Center for the Study of Group Dynamic s, the principal Tavistock affiliate in the U.S. in the be ginning of the postwar era. Tavistock's ISR was the center of a number of criti cal profiling and \"Opinion Research\" subgroups, among t hem the Center for research in the Utilization of Scien tific Knowledge, was established by Likert OSS co-worker and Lewin disciples, Ronald Lippitt. Project Director Donald Michael was a leading playe r in the Club of Rome, and a second subgroup, the Survey Res earch Center, was Likert's own personal creation that gre w to become the most elaborate institution in the U.S. f or \"surveying\" (creating) popular attitudes and trends , among the principal of which were demeaning and degrading womanhood and pushing the superior intellectual cap abilities of non-white persons according to Lewin's carefully crafted scripts. Robert Hutchins became famous during this period an d his closest colleague in those early years was William Benton, the founder in 1929 with Chester Bowles of Benton a nd Bowles, the well-known advertising firm. Benton uti lized Benton and Bowles as a means to develop the science of mass control through advertising."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36 It was Benton's pioneering work supported by Dougla ss Cater, that led to the development of Tavistock's b urgeoning control over U.S. media policy through the Aspen In stitute of Colorado, the American home of the Socialist One Wo rld Government Committee of 300. In passing I mention that the science of mass media control through advertising is today so firmly entrenched t hat it has become the key component in opinion making. In the early post WWII days, Hollywood incorporated it into near ly all of its movies. Advertising (brainwashing) was done through the typ e and make of car the hero drove, the brand of cigarette the suave Lawrence Harvey smoked, the clothes and make up the leading lady wore, clothes that became more risque with each passing year, until today in 2005 we have womanhood degraded by the likes of Britney Spear's almost nak ed breasts and bare stomach exposed by crotch hugging jeans sh e often wears, the social mores that Hollywood enjoys so mu ch in flouting."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"37 CHAPTER 8 Degrading women and decline of moral standards The pace of degrading womanhood has quickened at a remarkable degree since hemlines reached the knee. This is manifesting itself in such areas as near pornograph y in mainstream movies and soap operas and we venture to suggest that the day is not far off, when such scen es will be \"total and mandatory.\" This decline in attractive feminine speech can be t raced to Tavistock methodology and its practitioners, Cantri l, Likert and Lewin. Another noticeable change was the increa se in movies featuring inter-racial dating and sexual enc ounters coupled with \"human rights\" claims for lesbians in the most blatantly open form. Special people were selected and trained for this t ask, probably the best known of many being Ellen Degener es who received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of free publicity under the guise of being interviewed on t alk shows and \"discussion\" groups on the subject of \"same-sex love\" meaning encounters between two females involving a type of sex practice. Benton the pioneer in degrading womanhood had as hi s mentor Social scientist's leading expert in profili ng theory at Tavistock, one Harold Lasswell, who together with B enton founded the American Policy Commission in 1940. Las swell's joint venture with Benton marked the clearest link between Aspen's hidden Socialist One World Government opera tions in America and the Tavistock Institute. Aspen becam e the headquarters of the Committee of 300 branches in th e United States."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"38 Hedley Cantril, Likert and Lewin with their humanis tic psychology brainwashing applied methodology, played an increasingly vital role in using \"opinion research\" to bring about paradigm shifts value shifts in society, such as those just described, but on an expanded range and reachi ng into every level of society that comprised Western civil ization as it had been known for centuries. Cantril's home base from where he conducted his war operations against the American people was the Offi ce of Public Opinion Research at Princeton University, fo unded in 1940, the same year in which Cantril wrote his book entitled, The Invasion From Mars, a detailed analysis about h ow the population of the New York-New Jersey area reacted with fear and panic to Orson Wells \"War of the Worlds\" b roadcast in 1938. How could they have known that they were part of a profiling venture since it is reasonable to conclud e that in 1938 not one in five million had ever heard of Hadl ey Cantril or the Tavistock Institute. It would be interesting to find out how many Americans have heard of Tavistock now in 2 005? Most would remember Orson Wells, but the probabilit ies are that ninety-nine percent of the population would no t attach any significance to the name, Cantril, or have any knowledge of the Tavistock Institute. Let us recount the events of the night of October 3 0 th 1938, because the same techniques have been used by the B ush Administration, the Defense Department and the CIA to shape the public perception of the events that led up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and are still very much in use in 2005."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"39 In 1938, Orson Wells had created quite a reputation for himself as a master at staging faux news events by making use of the English author, H.G. Wells, a former MI6 operative and his book, The War of the Worlds. In the radio adaptation of the Wells' work, the oth er Wells, interrupted radio programs in New Jersey with an announcement that Martians had just landed. \"The Ma rtian invasion has begun,\" said Orson Wells. During the 4-hour long production, it was announced no less than four times that what radio audiences were list ening to was a fictitious re-enactment of what it would be l ike if H.G. Wells' story had come to life. But that availed not hing. Panic gripped millions of people who fled from their home s in terror, jamming roads and communication systems. What was the purpose of the \"hoax?\" In the first in stance it was to gauge just how effective Cantril and Tavisto ck's methods were in practice, and perhaps of greater im portance, it was to set the stage for the coming war in Europ e in which \"news broadcasts\" would play a crucial role in info rmation gathering and dissemination as an established sourc e of reliable information, as well as a forum for direct ing public opinion. Two days after the \"Martian Invasion news broadcast ,\" an editorial in the New York Times headed \"Terror by R adio\" inadvertently shed light on what Tavistock had in m ind for the American people in the coming war now looming close r: \"What began as entertainment might readily have end ed in disaster,\" the editorial said. Radio officials had a responsibility and \"should think twice before mingl ing news techniques with fiction so terrifying.\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"40 What the \"Times\" had inadvertently stumbled onto wa s the wave of the future seen through the eyes of the the oreticians at Tavistock.

A ll news broadcast were to be adaptations of \"news and ficti on\" in a skilful blend so as to make the one unrecognizable from the other. In fact, Tavistock put their newly tested theory in to practice a year later when the population of cities in Europe, London, Munich, Paris and Amsterdam were smitten with war j itters even as Neville Chamberlain was successfully avoidi ng war, using the same techniques that were employed in the October 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcasts."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"41 CHAPTER 9 How individuals and groups react to blending fact w ith fiction Cantril's conclusion was that the public reacted ex actly as his profiling research experiments had led him to belie ve it would. That Sunday night October 30, 1938 was to be come a landmark date in his files and a date signifying a vast paradigm shift for ever in the way that \"news\" woul d henceforth, be presented. Slightly more than seven decades later, the world is still being fed a diet of news mingled with fiction, - fiction that in so many instances is ter rifying. The Western world has undergone drastic changes unwilli ngly forced upon it, that it has become a world so vastl y different from what it was on that October night in 1938, as to be \"another planet.\" We shall return to this vital sub ject later in this work. Following the Second World War, Cantril became tota lly involved with the head guru at Tavistock, its found er, John Rawlings Reese and his World Tensions Project at th e United Nations' UNESCO. Profiles on how individuals and groups reacted to international tensions were formulated on the basis of skillfully blending fact with terrifying fiction in preparation for a campaign to launch \"World citizens,\" (of a One Wo rld Government Socialist-Communist dictatorship) that b egan to be employed to weaken national boundaries, language and culture and to discredit pride of nation and sovere ignty of nation-states, in preparation for the coming of the Socialist New World Order—One World Government, that Presiden t Woodrow Wilson said America would make safe for \"democracy.\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42 Those fresh-faced young American boys from Arkansas and North Carolina were sent marching off to Europe bel ieving they were \"fighting for their country,\" never knowi ng that the \"democracy\" Wilson sent them to \"make safe for the world\" was a Socialist- International Communist One World Government dictatorship. John Rawlings Reese was the publisher of Tavistock' s magazine Journal of Humanistic Psychology. Their jo int thinking mentality is seen in the 1955 monograph, \" Toward a Humanistic Psychology, \" an as a progression of Can tril's support for the Tavistock-trained Gordon Airport's perception of the \"personality.\" As he expressed it in the 194 7 book, Understanding Man's Social Behavior, in a chapter o n \"Causality.\" Cantril's methodology was based on the conception that \"the particular environment in whic h growth takes place gives the particular individual a parti cular direction for growth.\" Cantril's endeavors are good examples of the breakd own of boundaries between supposedly neutral opinion takin g and social-engineering opinion making; Tavistock's commitment to forcing major shifts in p ersonality and behavior in all sectors of targeted population groups such as we have sought to describe. Cantril appointed a board of directors to assist in the work, among who were: Warren Bennis, a follower of Tavistock director Eri c Trist. Marilyn Ferguson, allegedly the author of The Aquar ian Conspiracy; Jean Houston, head of the Institute for Brain Resea rch, member of the Club of Rome and author of Mind Games ."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"43 Aldous Huxley, who supervised the MK-Ultra LSD program that ran for 20 years.

Carl Rogers, Maslow's co-worker at the AHP in 1957. AHP's reigning ideology was exemplified by a book r eview in a 1966 issue of its journal, The Journal of Humanis tic Psychology. Reviewing Maslow's book, The Psychology of Science, Willis Harman, a year before his 1967-69 Stanford R esearch study, welcomed the \"challenge to science\" from \"extrasensory perception, psycho kinesis, mysticism , and consciousness-expanding drugs\" (particularly LSD an d Mesacalin.) He lauded Maslow's \"new science\" since it would bring to the fore \"hypnosis, creativity, para psychology, and psychedelic experience,\" and shift scientific c oncern away from the \"outside\" world to studying \"inner sp ace.\" This was Cantril's original \"particular personality \" thinking brought to its logical conclusion. To Cantril goes the \"glory and honor\" of forcing a vast paradigm shift on the way the Western world thinks and behaves."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 Certainly Oswald Spengler would have had no trouble in identifying it as one of the causes of the downfall of the West he had predicted in 1936. Making Changes in the \"Cognitive and Behavioral Structure.\" Whatever the particular coloration of ideology that accompanied the scientists of the polling instituti ons after World War II, the invariant notion of social engine ering trough \"sampling methods\" and \"opinion research\" co uld be found in Cartwright's paper Some Principles of Mass Persuasion prepared for the Division of Program Sur veys of the Department of Agriculture. The paper was subtitled, \"Selected Findings of Rese arch on the Sale of United States War Bonds,\" but as Cartwr ight makes clear, the war-related aspect of the survey w as just a pretext for conducting an analysis on the principle s of how perception can be modified to suit whatever ends th e controller might have in mind. One would be puzzled as to what the sale of war bon ds had to do with agriculture, but that was part of Cartwrigh t's methodology. It was the Bernays-Lippmann-Cantril- Cartwright hypothesis synthesized and concentrated in a World War II setting. The article was featured in T avistock's journal. Human Relations which ought to immediately brought the reader to attention. \"Among the many technological advances of the past century that have produced changes in social organization,\" Cartwright began, \"the development of the mass medi a of communication promises to be the most far reaching. This heightened interdependence of people means that the possibilities of mobilizing mass social action have been"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"45 greatly increased. It is conceivable that one persu asive person could, through the use of mass media, bend the worl d's population to his will.\" We do not believe that Car twright had Jesus Christ in mind when he made that statement. Under a subheading, \"Creating a Particular Cognitiv e Structure,\" Cartwright continues: Principle One: \"It is considered a truism by virtua lly all psychologists that a person's behavior is guided by his perception of the world in which he lives.... It fo llows from this formulation that one way to change a person's behavior is to modify his cognitive structure. The modification of cognitive structure in individuals by means of the mass media has several prerequisites. These may be stated in t he form of principles.\" Interspersing his account with examples from the ap plication of his study to the World War Two war-bonds sale dr ive, Cartwright then elaborated the principles: \"The 'me ssage' (i.e., information, facts, etc.), must reach the sense org ans of the persons who are to be influenced... Total stimulus situations are selected or rejected on the basis of an impress ion of their general characteristics,\" etc. A second set of prin ciples investigated more deeply the methods of altering \"c ognitive structure.\" Principle Two: \"Having reached the sense organs, 'm essage' must be accepted as part of the person's cognitive structure.\" Cartwright noted in this section that \"any effort t o change behavior through a modification of this cognitive s tructure must overcome the forces tending to maintain the pr esent structure."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 Only when a given cognitive structure seems to the person to be unsatisfactory for his adjustment is he likely r eadily to receive influences designed to change that structur e.\" Under \"Creating a Particular Motivational Structure ,\" Cartwright analyzed further \"the social inductions the governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in Was hington into turmoil for a protracted period.\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"47 CHAPTER 10 Polling comes of age The Tavistock Clinic in London was where Sigmund Fr eud had settled when he arrived from Germany, and where his nephew, Edward Bernays later held court. Thus it was that England became the world's center for mass brainwashing, social engineering experimenting that spread to postwar clinics spread all over the United States. During World War II, Tavistock was the headquarters of the British Army's Psychological Warfare Bureau which, through the arrangements of the British Special Operation E xecutive (SOE) (later known as MI6) dictated policy to the U nited States Armed Forces in matters of psychological war fare. Toward the end of the war, Tavistock personnel took over the World Federation of Mental Health and the Psycholog ical Warfare Division of the Supreme Headquarters, Allie d Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) in Europe.

What the public sees in newspapers as opinion polls represents only a fractional portion of the work th at the pollsters undertook to do.

The Club itself was only founded in 1968 as part of the call for a New World Order inside a One World Government.

Among the \"Olympians,\" this network was known as the \"Aquaria n Conspiracy\" and its adherents were to be known as \" invisible shock troops.\" This massive paradigm gigantic, irrevocable shift, overtook America while we slept, sweeping away the old with new political, religious and philosophical systems. It was what citizens of the New World Order-One World Governmen t would have to exhibit hereafter, a new mind - the r ise of a new order with no nation-states, pride of place and pride of race, a culture of the past, destined to the dustbi n of history, never to be revived."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"55 We know from experience that this work is likely to be greeted with scorn and disbelief. Some will even pi ty us. Terms like \"off the wall\" will be used to describe this work. This is the standard reaction when the motivations of Tavistock's Social scientists brain-washers, opinio n-makers, social-psychologists have for acting out their war on the United States are not known. The probability is 90% of the American people do not know that Tavistock declared war on the German civilian population to end WWII. When that conflict ended in 1946, the Tavistock pra ctitioners of mass brainwashing and opinion went to war agains t the American people. If this is how you react when you read this expose, don't feel bad, - then understand that it is the way you are e xpected to react. If the motivation appears far-fetched and la cking credibility, also incomprehensible, then the motiva tion \"does not exist.\" That being the case, then the action th at derives from it does not exist; therefore, ergo \"the Olympi ans\" do not exist and there is no conspiracy. But the hard fact is that a gigantic conspiracy doe s exist. No doubt Kurt Lewin, the top scientist at Tavistock an d key theoretician of all think tanks could explain it mo re clearly than we have been able to do, if he chose to. His p ractice is derived from what he called \"topological-psychology \" doctrine. Lewin is the man upon whose theories, the psychological warfare battles of World War II were fought so successfully, the man who planned and executed the Strategic Bombing Survey that brought Germany defeat in WWII through the wholesale destruction of 65 percent of German worker housing to which we have just referred to ve ry briefly."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"57 CHAPTER 12 Lewin's doctrine of \"identity change\" The Lewin doctrine is not easy for the layman to fo llow. Basically, Lewin said that all psychological phenom ena occur in a domain defined as \"psychological phase space.\" This space is composed of two interdependent \"fields,\" t he \"environment\" and the \"self.\" The concept of \"controlled environment\" arose from the study that if you have a fixed-personality (one sus ceptible to being predictably profiled), and if you want to eli cit from this personality a particular type of behavior, then all you have to do is control the third variable of the equation an d thus produce the desired behavior. This was the norm in social-psychology formulas. MI 6 uses it, and almost every type of situation involving negoti ations; army counterinsurgency operations, labor negotiatio ns and diplomatic negotiations used it up until apparently the 1960s. After 1960, Tavistock changed the equation by placi ng greater emphasis on the technique of controlled env ironment not the behavior, but the desired personality. What Lewin set out to accomplish was far more drastic and permanen t; altering the deeper structures of human personalities. In sh ort, what Lewin succeeded in doing was to move beyond \"behavi or modification\" to \"identity change.\" Identity change was adopted by the nations of the w orld. Nations worked to acquire a \"new personality\" that would change the way the world looked at them."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58 The theory relied upon the original formulations of two Tavistock theoreticians, Dr. William Sargent's theo ry in his Battle for the Mind, and Kurt Lewin's own work on personality regression. Lewin observed that the \"inner self of the individu al displays certain reactions when under tension from the envir onment. When there is no tension, then the normal inner sel f of a person is well differentiated, balanced multifacete d, versatile.\" \"When a reasonable amount of tension is applied fro m the environment, then all the various abilities and fac ulties of the inner self go on alert, ready for effective action. But, when an intolerable amount of tension is appli ed, then this geometry collapses into a blinded, undifferent iated soup; a primitive, a regressed personality. The person is reduced to an animal; the highly differentiated and versatile abilities disappear. The controlled environment takes over th e personality.\" It is this Lewin \"technique\" that is used on the ca ptives held at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in defiance of international law and the U.S. Constitution. The gr oss misconduct of the Bush administration at the camp i s beyond the pale of normal Western Christian civilization, and its acceptance by a docile American public, might be th e first sign that the American people have been so changed by Tavistock's \"long range penetration and inner-direc tion conditioning,\" that they are now ready to descend t o the level of the New World Order in a One World Government wh ere such barbaric \"treatment\" will be regarded as norma l and accepted without protest."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"59 The fact that medical doctors took part in the inhu man torture of fellow human being and felt no remorse would ind icate just how far down the world has already fallen. This has been observed as being the basis for the m ilitary camp at Guantanamo, Cuba, which was opened there to avoid the strictures of the U.S. Constitution and to prov ide a Lewin-type controlled environment. The men being he ld at this psychological prison are now in the state of r egression where they have been reduced to the level of animal s. Guantanamo is the type of camp that we predict will be established all over the United States and the worl d, when the New World Order-One World Government assumes total world control. It is sadistic, inhuman and beastly, designed to break the natural pride of the victims, to break th e will to resist and to reduce the prisoners to the level of beasts. During the first world government experiment in the then USSR, men were allowed to use toilets only to be in terrupted in the middle of evacuating and hustled out before they could clean themselves. Abu Graihb and Guantanamo were ab out at that level when the controllers were roughly subjec ted to world-wide scrutiny. General Miller who was the chi ef kapo has since disappeared from sight. \"Dissidents\" who insist on the U.S. Government obey ing the Constitution and demand their constitutional rights , will in future be treated as \"dissidents,\" exactly like Sta lin treated \"dissidents\" in Russia.

Of all European nations, in the period between the two world wars, Germany, as the super-economic, super racial purity, super warrior nation, suffered the most, as was the intention. The League of Nation was the \"first draft\" of the l ast- approaching New World Order inside a One World Government, and the \"peace proposals\" at the Paris Peace Conference, directed and controlled by Tavistock, w as meant to cripple Germany and make it a permanent second-c lass European power, their self-respect destroyed throug h the social demotion to pauperism or at best proletarian status. It is hardly surprising that the German people turn ed savage and gave Hitler the mass following he needed to con vert his latent nationalistic movement into a revival force. We shall never know whether Tavistock miscalculated or indeed, set the stage in this manner for a bigger a nd bloodier war. After all, Meade and Bertrand Russell had stat ed, that what was needed was a world populated by \"docile\" s ubjects. Russell had remarked on the \"child-like\" character of the American Negro he had encountered during his travel s to the United States. Russell said he preferred them to th e white people. He also said that if the White race was to survive, it would have to learn to behave in the child-like man ner of the Negro. Yet, in the same breath the Tavistock emissa ry called black people \"useless eaters\" and declared that the y ought to be wiped out, en-masse."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62 Russell also liked the docility of the Brazilian pe ople, brought about, he thought, by \"inter-race breeding with Africans brought over as slaves.\" There is a school of thought that one of the primar y objectives of the fiends who planned both world war s was that they would be fought for the most part by youn g white men. It is certainly true that Germany, Britain, th e U.S. and Russia lost millions of the flower of their male po pulation who were removed from the nation-building stock for ever. In the Tavistock-engineered WWI, war fronts and battle s were arranged in such a manner that Russia lost 9,000,00 0 men killed or 70 percent of its entire military strengt h. With the exception of Russia the aristocracy suffer ed much less than the bourgeoisie from the economic consequ ences of war and revolution. Traditionally much of their wea lth was in land; which did not depreciate as much during infla tion as some tangibles. The disintegration of the monarchies (except in Eng land) hit the old order of society of the upper-classes, who could not continue to serve society in their roles as officer s or diplomats—as there no longer are much demand for th eir services—opportunities for such service were far fe wer than they had been before the war. Some of the Russia aristocracy courageously accepte d proletarian or even menial status like the Russian taxi drivers, night-club doormen, and headwaiters in postwar Pari s; others went into business. Most, however, fell into a life of social denigration. Where the strictly guarded frontier be tween Societies was once impassable in the old monarchic capitals, and cafe society, now appeared large gaps as the li nes gradually became blurred."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"63 As the Duke of Windsor put it in his memoirs, A Kin g's Story: \"The force of change had not yet thrust so deeply i nto the texture of British society as to have obliterated m uch of the old elegance ...........

The evening could always be saved by recourse to one or another of the gay nightclubs, w hich had then become so fashionable and almost respectable.\" (The word \"gay\" at that time meant \"happy\". It was not co- opted as a euphemism for sodomy until the mid-fifti es.) Nor did the Duke explain that the \"force of change\" was expertly applied by the Tavistock Institute. The declining female modesty that became noticeable soon after the end of WWI, suddenly appeared everywhere and with increased velocity. To the uninformed, it was a social phenomenon. Nobody could have suspected that Wellin gton House and its sinister social engineers were its ca use. Accompanying this testamentary emancipation was a movement of revolt, particularly among young people , against every conventional restraint of mind or bod y coming to a close amid the shattered idols of the fallen e mpires. The postwar generation in Europe revolted against every more and custom, as they fought desperately to throw off the horrors of war they had lived through.

Those were the years when all of Europe was shell- shocked. Wellington House and Tavistock had done th eir work well. Underneath the hectic sense of being propelled forw ard by uncontrollable events there was a spiritual and emo tional numbness. The horror of the war in which millions o f young men were needlessly slaughtered, maimed, wounded an d gassed was just now beginning to register, so the t hing to do was \"blot it from remembrances.\" The casualties made wars all too real in its ghastl y and cruel ugliness, and people recoiled from it in shock and revolution, in the despair brought by disillusionment of peace. Europeans, with their superior culture that epitomi zed Western civilization were shell-shocked to a greate r degree than were Americans. They lost their faith in the rudiments that made th e progress that had sustained their fathers and their grandfat hers and made their nations great. And this was particularly true of Germany, Russia, France, and England.

Th e fear that it might happen again was what almost prevente d the outbreak of WWII. Officers returning from the carnage described to th e news journals the horrors of hand-to-hand combat that ha d frequently occurred in \"the Great War.\" They were a ppalled and aghast, horrified and afraid. None of them coul d understand why there had been a war at all. The dar k secrets of Wellington House and the \"Olympians\" remained hi dden, even as they are hidden to this very day. Where once the laying of a wreath at the Cenotaph i n Whitehall, London by the Monarch of England had bro ught solace, it now engendered bitterness, anger and loa thing. The stage was being set for the Second World War in whi ch Tavistock was to play a huge, disproportionate role . There were the few thinkers who did have something to say: Spengler, in history for example, Hemingway, Evelyn Waugh in literature, and in America Upton Sinclair and Ja ck London, but their message was also gloomy, even glo omier than Spengler's dark foreboding of the inevitable d ecline of Western civilization. It was confirmed by the postwar degradation of pers onal relationships. Divorce and cheating on one's wife h appened more frequently. The beautiful concept of women on a pedestal, women soft and feminine, with a lovely vo ice filled with cadences, the flower of God's creation, the my stery, was a vanishing ideal.

But Berlin, once so bustling and so clean, became the B abylon of Europe and perhaps the saddest place of them all. \"Whoever lived through these apocalyptic month, the se years, became disgusted and embittered, sensed the coming of a counter-blow, a horrible reaction,\" wrote the historian, Zweig. The political, spiritual, and social bankruptcy of the new power elites, who succeeded the monarchs, the arist ocrats and the old-fashioned bourgeois dynasties, was in m any respects more spectacular than that of their predec essors, and nowhere more so than in the United States, with the coming of the Socialist era under Franklin D.

The geographical New World, in terms of the problem s that confronted it, the America of Franklin Roosevelt so on demonstrated that the United States was scarcely le ss anachronistic than the Austria-Hungary of Franz Jos eph had been.

Its forerun ner was the organization put together by Lord Northcliffe, who married into the Rothschild family, and who was abl y assisted by Lord Rothmere and the Americans, Walter Lippman and Edward Bernays. From this modest beginning in 1914 grew the Tavisto ck Institute of Human Relations, which has no peer whe n it came to creating propaganda. Tavistock is a facilit y dedicated to the propagation of propaganda to suit every aspect of life. Tavistock approached propaganda as if it were going into battle, and in a sense, it was. There ar e no half- measures; it was a war where anything goes as long as it assures victory. Surveying the political scene one cannot escape the fact that in the past two decades, the increase in depth and volume of propaganda, and more especially, mind control, has become all pervasive. The correct application of propagand a to any theme, whether it is economic, or political, is an essential element in the control-mechanism of government. Stalin once said that if one wanted a docile popula tion then fear and terror had to be unleashed against them. I n a sense that is what happened in the United States and Brit ain."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"70 The Second World War provided unlimited opportuniti es of developing propaganda into a fine art. Looking back on the efforts made by the Roosevelt administration to cau se the American people — who were 87 percent against going to war in Europe change their minds, we find that in s pite of everything, Roosevelt did not succeed. The American people rejected entry into the war in Europe. It took a contrived situation, a contrived pre-chos en pretext, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to reverse pub lic opinion in favor of America's entry into the European war. Roosevelt held out that America was fighting for democracy an d its very way of life, neither of which bore the slightest re semblance to the truth; the war was fought to advance the cause of International Socialism toward its goal of a New Wo rld Order inside a One World Government. Propaganda, to be successful, must be aimed at the total population and not at individuals or individual gro ups, the purpose being to attract the widest possible attent ion. It is not intended as personal instruction. Facts play no rol e in propaganda which is always to create an impression. It has to one-sided systematic, sustained indoctrination that what the Government, the media and political leaders are say ing is the truth. And it has to be pitched in such a manner th at the people feel that it is their thinking. Thus, propaganda has to be directed at mass audienc es where its message will make its mark. Let us take a recen t example of the type of propaganda that would usually be emb raced by a receptive audience. In the wake of the World Trad e Center disaster, President Bush created a new Government a gency, which he called the Office of Homeland Security, an d appointed a director to oversee the agency."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"71 Now this sounds very comforting and very soothing u ntil we look at the 10 th Amendment, which reserves all such powers as Mr. Bush proposed to seize, to the several State s. The fact that Mr. Bush cannot overrule the 10 th Amendment was blithely ignored. The propaganda blurb says he can, and since it was directed to the masses, they believed the blurb, rather than their Constitution, and so there was li ttle effective opposition to this gross violation of the Constitut ion, particularly the 10 th Amendment. Bush appears to have been operating under the Stalin directive: \"If you want to control the people, first terrorize them.\" Those who opposed the \"Homeland Security\" quasi-law , were dubbed, \"unpatriotic\" and \"favoring terrorism. \" Again, the absolute fact that this bogus act is no law at all and is sheer propaganda was never called into question, bu t was accepted by the \"rah-rah\" unthinking public. Public opinion is made in this way and public opinion is what swayed legislators to vote for \"Homeland Security\" or any other bogus laws, as Bernays and Lippmann both asserted i n the very early days of Wellington House. The legislator s vote along party lines as in the British Parliamentary s ystem, and do not vote on the basis of the U.S. Constitution. They knew that to oppose the President, they stand a good cha nce of losing a cozy job at the next election, or face bei ng smeared by some sleazy muck-racking \"administration\" man. America is not one \"homeland\" but 50 distinct and s eparate States. In any case the word \"homeland\" comes strai ght out of the Communist Manifesto. Since the ultimate goal of government is to establish a New World Order Intern ational Communist One World Government, the choice of this word to title Communist legislation, should not surprise us."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72 The power to control Education, Welfare and Police Powers belongs to the States where it has always resided, and it was not taken away from the States at the time of the c ovenant. Neither President Bush nor the House and Senate hav e any power to change that, which the newly created offic e proposed to do. It was only through the exercise of sustained, systematic, repetition of propaganda that the peopl e of the States accepted this gross violation of the U.S. Co nstitution. The drumbeat of propaganda continued through numero us articles about the background and experience of the \"Homeland Director\" and what his job is etc., but t here is not one word about the blatant unconstitutionality of t he new department. It will not escape your notice that the very title: \"Homeland Security\" is a clever little bit of propa ganda.

Those who wish to study the matter instead of merel y watching the CBS Evening News will find something q uite different from an account of an independent comment ator and the accounts in the press. As always, such pers on will be in the minority, so that his opinions, even if expr essed, will not alter the purpose and intent of setting up the new agency. I say to you that the United States is forbidden by i ts Constitution and the constitutions of the separate 50 States from having any central Federal control mechanism i mposed upon them.

No measure that is unconstituti onal can be enacted into law and the Congress has urgent dut y repeal the \"law\" that gave illegitimate birth to the \"Home land\" and \"Patriot\" Acts forthwith. The cardinal point to rem ember is that propaganda and mass brainwashing must always b e viewed in relation to the end it is intended to ser ve. In this instance it convinces the populace, that liberties must be sacrificed in exchange for \"protection.\" Henry Clay , the greatest constitutional scholar who ever lived call ed the ploy \"a doctrine of necessity, a doctrine from Hell\" and utterly condemned such attempts. H.V. Dicks taught at Tavistock. He stated that indi vidual rights have to be sacrificed for the good of all! T hat includes the measure violating the highest law of the land! It must be accepted because it is for the good of all! This is better explained if we take as an example, the propaganda and brainwashing that accompanied President Roosevelt's desperate efforts to involve the United States in t he war going on in Europe, via Japan. When the anticipated attack on Pearl Harbor happene d, (Roosevelt knew the day and the time it would take place) announced in his speeches written for him by the Ta vistock Institute, that the American people would be fighti ng for the highest and noblest of causes, the defense of the n ation, defense of freedom and for the future security and well-being of the nation.

The American people were told that Germany intended to enslave the world. This was a very good line becaus e even the most poorly educated of people realize that slavery is one of the worst fates that mankind could be called on to suffer. By introducing the word \"slavery\" a sympathetic chord was struck. Once again, propaganda bore no relationship to the facts. Thinking persons, not susceptible to propaganda, wo uld have realized that a small nation like Germany could not possibly enslave the world even if had wanted to do so. The resources and manpower were just not there. Germany did not p ossess the vast maritime fleet to make such an attack on t he United States a real possibility. The promoters of the war realized from the very out set that for momentum to be maintained, a sustained blast of pro paganda would be necessary. The same principle was followed by Vice President Cheney in the weeks preceding the U.S. at tack on Iraq; he distorted facts, delivered blast after bla st of \"fear rhetoric\" and twisted intelligence information to f it his purposes. Nobody worked harder than Cheney to ensur e that war with Iraq would not be prevented at the last mi nute. It was important that Roosevelt attract the attenti on of the masses the \"issues\" and bring them home to the peop le, hence the endless press reports, the \"newsreels\" sh own endlessly at cinemas and the endless brainwashing s peeches of the politicians."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"75 Propaganda has to be in a medium easily understood by the lowest level of intelligence among the nation, such as posters depicting workers in munitions factories, shipyards ; aircraft- assembly plants all working on the \"home front\" for the \"war effort\" and so on. In the aftermath of the WTC tragedy, much of that t ype of mass-brainwashing propaganda was revived: \"America at War\", \"the front line\", \"and munitions dumps\", \"ene my troop positions\" appeared as sub headings on almost every thing televisions screened. The fact that the United States was not at war beca use war had not been declared, and that there were no enemy \"troops\" other than loosely knit guerilla groups, was of cou rse omitted. Dictionaries define troops as \"a body of soldiers; an army, generally in the plural.\" The Taliban had no army, and therefore, no troops. Besides which, war could not be declared on \"terrorism\" or \"Bolshevism\" or any othe r \"ism.\" War can only be declared against sovereign nations, this according to the U.S. Constitution. War can only be declared on a country or a particul ar nation of people inhabiting that country. Anything else is Tavistock balderdash dished up on a platter decorated with wa ving flags and to the accompaniment of martial music. To say t hat that the United States is at war with the Taliban is the height of deception. To be at war of necessity demands a prio r declaration of war. Without a declaration of war it is deception, in effect no war at all. A new dimension was added.

Thus, the illicit, unconstitutional seizure of powe rs by a sitting U.S. President that began with Woodrow Wils on \"taking\" ten additional powers to which he was abso lutely not entitled, expanded with Roosevelt \"taking\" thir ty and G.W.

Indeed, the United States has become a lawless nati on under the expert guidance of the Tavistock Institute whos e \"inner- directional conditioning and long-range penetration \" brainwashing of the American public made it all pos sible. In passing let me add that the British propaganda establishment used the self-same language of lies a gainst the Boers in South Africa in the war launched by the Br itish to take control of the massive gold deposits in that l and. The British press was full of accounts of the \"Boer Arm y\" when the Boers had no army, only a farmer citizen gueril la force.

The lessons learned in the art of propaganda in the two World Wars were simply switched from the European theater to mainstream USA, and later, to Iraq, Serbia and Afgh anistan.

The period prio r to the First World War was a classic series of events in w hich personalities were manipulated, the worst offenders being the British and American newspapers. As in all wars, so meone has to be demonized to get the public involved. In 1913 it was Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany who was demonized befo re, during and after that terrible war. One of the principle creators of propaganda of that period was Lord Nortcliffe, the noted press baron, a relat ive of the Rothschilds and a hater of Germany. Northcliffe ran Wellington House as a major center for anti-German propaganda and he harbored a particular hatred of W ilhelm II, who was a cousin of Queen Victoria of the notor ious Black Guelph dynasty of Venice. Northcliffe abused Wilhelm II on every possible occ asion especially on the occasions when the Kaiser talked about Germany's military might and prowess. Wilhelm was g iven to childish boasting and most European governments knew him as a man who liked to \"play soldiers\", and dres sing in outlandishly decorated uniforms. Wilhelm was very d istinctly not a military man. As a Rothschild, this irked Nor thcliffe who began \"warning\" that \"Germany's place in the su n\" as the Kaiser liked to call it, was a danger to the re st of Europe. That this claim was without the slightest foundatio n did not seem to bother Northcliffe who maximized it to the extent where it was marvelous to behold."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80 The truth is that Germany was not a threat at that time and nor was the Kaiser a mighty warrior waiting to stri ke, but rather, a man prone to nervous breakdowns of which he had three in five years and a near useless withered arm , which did not project a martial man at all. The nearest one c an say that Wilhelm got to being martial, was his love of dress ing up in extravagantly bedecked uniforms. In truth Wilhelm I I had little if any control over the German military, a f act that Northcliffe was well aware of and yet chose to igno re. In this the Kaiser was on the same level as the Bri tish monarch, King George V who had no control of the Br itish Expeditionary Force. That didn't stop Northcliffe o f launching a blistering attack on Queen Victoria's G erman cousin, blaming him for being responsible for a who le list of atrocities allegedly carried out by the German Army driving through Belgium. Of course, the German High Command did wrong in invading neutral Belgium, but they were on ly in transit with no plans to occupy the country. It was all part of a tactical plan to march on Pari s taking a \"short cut\" through Belgium to outflank the French Army. There would have been nothing to gain by deliberate ly killing civilians, a fact the German High Command h as stressed. Northcliffe called the Kaiser a \"megaloma niac\" with a \"hunger to rule the world\" which in any case was quite beyond the capabilities of any European power. In 1 940 Churchill accused Hitler of having the same desire to 'rule the world\" knowing it to be false. Churchill also decla red Hitler \"a madman\" knowing his characterization of the chan cellor to be false.

The book was what the English use d to call \"a penny horrible.\" Showing the power of the press, Northcliffe got the media to give rave revues about the book. Lord Asquith, the Prime Minister, was persuaded to write a forward to what was essentially an absolute farce. President Wilson inv ited the \"artist,\" a Dutchman by the name of Raemakers, to t he White House when he was on a book-selling tour of the U.S . As was expected, Wilson lionized the cartoonist and ga ve his blessing to the book. Even the legendary \"Punch\" magazine joined in the c ampaign to depict Wilhelm in the most unfavorable light. It seemed that no journal escaped having to print the torrent of sewage that poured forth from Wellington House. It was pro paganda in its rawest form. It was not long thereafter that the effect rubbed o ff on the people who began insisting that the Kaiser \"be hang ed\" and one minister of religion went as far as to say that he would forgive Germany as long as all Germans were shot. Hollywood soon joined in the act of condemning the Kaiser, of whom it knew nothing. First off was the movie My Four Years in Germany adapted from a book written by U.S . ambassador to Berlin, James W. Gerard. The movie wa s depicted as a factual account of the Kaiser prepari ng for war. Wilhelm was given the IQ of a paranoid six-year old child and depicted as a man riding a hobbyhorse. Scathing descriptions of his disability were repeated hundre ds of times."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82 Worse was tc come with the Hollywood version of his tory entitled The Beast of Berlin that portrayed the Kai ser gloating over slaughtered Belgian civilians and chuckling in mirth over torpedoed ships. None of which was true, but i t served its purpose, generating a fierce hate against Germa ns and all things German that spread across the U.S. with asto nishing rapidity. It was the basis of the worst type of propaganda ev er seen and it was carried out in a relentless fashion by t he British Government, not only at home, but also where it cou nted the most, in the United States. Wellington House was co unting on the United States to defeat Germany on the field of battle. In the late 1990's it was but a very short step for the mass of the American people to believe the same of the Tali ban and of President Hussein of Iraq with who the Taliban w as not connected. (In fact they hated each other.) The fundamental question: \"Were the Taliban as a wh ole, and the people of Afghanistan, separate from the Taliba n, responsible for the dastardly bombing of the WTC?\" Does the Taliban actually exist? Or is Osama bin Laden j ust another Kaiser Wilhelm II? Perhaps, fifty years hen ce we might find out the truth. In the meantime the Tavis tock Institute played the propaganda card to the limit, and once again, it succeeded. After the end of the war the myth of Kaiser Wilhelm II persisted. In fact the same propaganda machine that had demonized him before and during the war, did not gi ve way until July 13, 1959, the 100 th anniversary of Kaiser Wilhelm II birthday, which was celebrated by the BBC in the form of a documentary about the much abused former German lea der."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"83 It explained how the British people were terrorized by bloodcurdling accounts of the Kaiser slashing arms off Belgian children with his sword while columns of Ge rman soldiers raped women in the Belgian villages they p assed through, none of the accounts bearing even a faint resemblance to the truth.

However, as good as it was, t he BBC documentary made no effort to explain how the myth of a monstrous Kaiser Wilhelm could suddenly arise as if from nowhere, to take up the headlines in the newspapers ? In the same way no one has explained to my satisfac tion how Osama bin Laden suddenly appeared on the scene, and how he became the villain in the manner of the Kaiser in a n amazingly short period of time. How did this happen? It is an historical fact, that President Wilson rus hed the bill to establish the Federal Reserve banks to the House, j ust in time for the start of WWI period. Without paper dollars, printed at will, it is doubtful, that the war would have occur red. How could the Kaiser have suddenly come alive from the cartoon character staring out of thousands of newsp apers, magazines and billboards? We know now that he was t he product of the vast British War Office's propaganda machine, which remained secret as it still remains a big sec ret organization to this very day.

The vast majority of people in the world today will surely have heard of the \"Beast of Berlin\" and how the \"Al lies\" put to an end to his mad rampage through Europe. Most p eople in recent times have also heard of the \"Beast of Ba ghdad.\" But how many have heard of the name, Sir Harold Nic holson, a distinguished scholar, whose thorough examination of literally hundreds of thousands of documents from 1 912 to 1925, absolutely exonerated Kaiser Wilhelm II from starting WWI? How many people know this? Put it to the test. Try your local talk show whiz, and see what happens. Thus for more than twenty five years the myth of the Kaiser dominated the headlines and had the effect of turning millions of people in Britain and America, against Germany in an unjust a nd unfortunate by product of the vast propaganda machi ne that has the British people by the throat since it was f irst opened for business in 1913. We speak of Wellington House and its successor, the Tavistock Institute for Human Relati ons. The amazing thing about the myth is how long it las ted. But the purpose of propaganda is precisely to perpetuat e a myth, a lie or some piece of misinformation that lives lo ng after the truth is forgotten. Japan will forever be blamed fo r Pearl Harbor, and for the \"rape of Nanking,\" while Church ill will forever be hailed as a great man, instead of a brut al warmonger. In the same way Colin Powell recently visited Iraq and came out with a banner headline statement about Hussein \"gassing Kurds\" during the Iraq-Iran war."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86 The truth is that the gas-filled missiles that fell on the Kurdish village were Phosgene, a type not possessed by Iraq, but they were in the arsenal of Iran. What happened was that during an Iraqi offensive, the Iranians fired a lar ge number of gas-filled rockets at Iraqi position, but some fell short among the Kurds along the border. This was confirmed by t he U.S. Military College of War report, which entirely exon erated Iraq. Yet, although the accusation was thoroughly refuted , in 2005, almost 30 years later, while on a goodwill tour of Malaysia, Karen Hughes representing President George Bush rep eated the lie, embellishing it by claiming that \"30,000 K urds\" had been gassed to death by \"Saddam Hussein.\" A member of the audience contested her statement, and the next day Hughes was forced to retract her story, saying that she ha d \"misspoken\" herself. An investigation into the inci dent revealed that Hughes actually believed the lies she had heard repeated over and over again, by President Bush, Pr ime Minister Blair, Secretary of States Colin Powell, a nd Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which ought t o tell us a great deal about the power of propaganda. The facts of the case reported by the War College w ere later confirmed by the U.S. Army and by a second U.S. sou rce. Does the world know this? We doubt it. Truth is for gotten while a lie lives on. Thus Colin Powell's propagand a against Iraq will go the way of the propaganda against Kais er Wilhelm II, on and on for more than 100 years, whil e the truth died the moment the first propaganda blast ap peared in the newspapers.

From the beginning of the war, both German and Brit ish propagandists worked hard to win sympathy and suppo rt of the United States. German propagandists appealed to the many Americans of German descent, and to those of I rish descent, who were traditionally hostile to Great Br itain who was living in America. The propaganda was rather cr ude by today's standards, but what it lacked in finesse wa s made up by the sheer volume of the huge output of Wellingto n House. Soon, however, Germany was virtually cut off from d irect access to the United States. Thereafter British pro paganda had little competition in the United States, and it was conducted more skillfully than that of the Germans who had no equivalent of Wellington House, Bernays, or Lipp mann. Once engaged in the war Woodrow Wilson organized th e Committee on Public Information, an official propag anda agency, to mobilize American public opinion. This committee proved highly successful, particularly in the sale of Liberty Bonds. And no wonder. Its program was writt en for the White House by Tavistock and was largely direct ed from London. The exploitation by the Allies of President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which seemed to promise a just peace for both the victors and the vanquished, cont ributed greatly toward crystallizing opposition within the Central Powers to continuation of the war."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"96 Elsewhere herein we have detailed the lies and dist ortions engaged in by the Bryce Commission, which remains o ne of the most disturbing examples of blatant lying succe ssfully passed off as truth. The part played by Americans a t Wellington House, the premiere propaganda center in the world at that time is also explained later herein. The propaganda aspects of World War II were similar to those of World War I, except that the Second World War, also started by Britain and financed by the interna tional bankers, was greater in scope. Radio played a major role, with \"news broadcasts\" always a mixture of facts he avily laced with fiction. Propaganda activities overseas were more intense. The Tavistock Institute was able to put in to practice all of the valuable lessons it had learned in 1914- 1919, and it used its experience in a number of new ways in the old as well as new countries. Both Germany and the United Kingdom again sought to sway American opinion. German propagandists played on an ti- British sentiment, represented the war as a struggl e against communism, and pictured Germany as the invincible champion of a new wave of anti-Communism. German ag ents also gave their support to movements in the United States that backed \"isolationism\", a descriptive tag attached t o all Americans who opposed war with Germany. German propaganda efforts were no match against the expertise of Wellington House and Tavistock or the resources of Britain (secretly aided with huge amounts of mon ey by the Roosevelt administration) and once again it proved ineffective."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"97 The carefully planned attack on Pearl Harbor was we ll known by Roosevelt, Stimson and Knox for months bef ore the actual attack.

The dire warnings by Lindbergh, the famous aviator, and a number of other anti-war Senators that Roosevelt wa s not to be trusted, and that as was the case in WWI, the U. S. had no business interjecting itself into the war in German y, was blunted by propaganda. Also, the \"contrived situati on\" at Pearl Harbor changed public opinion, as Roosevelt w ell knew it would. Allied propaganda efforts that flowed fro m Tavistock were aimed at separating the peoples of t he Axis nations from their governments, which were held sol ely to blame for the war. Radio broadcasts and leaflets dr opped from the air carried Allied propaganda to the enemy . The official U.S. propaganda agencies during World War II were the Office of War Information (OWI), charged w ith disseminating Tavistock \"information\" at home and a broad, and the Office of Strategic Service (OSS), forerunn er of the CIA and a creation of Tavistock, charged with condu cting psychological warfare against the enemy.

Every aspect of national life and policy was exploited fo r purposes of propaganda. The Cold War was also marked by the use of defector s, trials, and confessions for propaganda purposes. In this pr opaganda war the Communist nations seemed initially to have a distinct advantage. Because their governments controlled all media, they could largely seal off their people from Weste rn propaganda. At the same time, the highly centralized government s could plan elaborate propaganda campaigns and mobilize re sources to carry out their plans. They could also count on aid from Communist parties and sympathizers in other countri es. Democratic states, on the other hand, could neither prevent their peoples from being exposed to Communist propa ganda nor mobilize all their resources to counter it.

The case of Lord Bryce With historians heavily involved in either defendin g or damning the war in Iraq, it might be good time to p onder the case of Viscount James Bryce, the highly respected historian who sold out and went to his grave as a confirmed, dastardly, unrepentant liar. Before his unfortunate involvemen t with Wellington House, Bryce had enjoyed wide respect as an honest historian. From the start of World War I, stories of German at rocities filled British and American newspapers. By far the bulk of them were prepared at Wellington House and spread t hrough media channels. Mostly, they were supposed to have emanated from \"eye-witness\" accounts by \"reporters and photographers,\" who accompanied the German Army's m arch through Belgium to outflank French defenses in thei r drive on Paris. Eyewitnesses described German infantrymen spearing Belgian babies on their bayonets as they marched al ong, singing war songs. Accounts of Belgian boys and gir ls with amputated hands (supposedly to prevent them from us ing guns) abounded. Tales of women with amputated breas ts multiplied even faster. At the top of the atrocity hit parade were rape sto ries. One eyewitness claimed the Germans dragged twenty young women out of their houses in a captured Belgian tow n and stretched them on tables in the village square, whe re each was violated by at least twelve \"Huns,\" while the r est of the division watched and cheered. At British expense, a group of Belgians toured the United States retelling these s tories."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"100 President Woodrow Wilson solemnly received them in the White House. Their story horrified America. Nobody thought to check their account of the rape they had witness ed. Their accounts of the brutality they allegedly had suffer ed were never questioned. The Germans angrily denied these stories. So did Am erican reporters with the German army. In 1914 Wilson had not yet \"managed\" the battlefield reporters unlike George B ush in the invasion of Iraq in 2002. There were no \"embedded\" reporters with the British Army. Tavistock had yet to learn h ow to censor the truth by \"embedding\" selected reporters with the troops. When British journalist's dispatches began to be pu blished in England, throwing doubt of the \"atrocities\", Northc liffe came up with the idea of appointing Lord Bryce to head a n enquiry board to investigate accounts of German atrocities and report back to him. Actually the suggestion came from Edwa rd Bernays and was approved by Walter Lippmann. Then, early in 1915, the British government made it official by asking Viscount Bryce to head a royal commission to investigate the atrocity reports. Bryce was one of the best- known historians of the era; he had written widely praised books on the American government and on Irish histo ry, sympathetically portraying the Irish people's hard fate under British rule. In 1907, he had worked with an Anglo- Irish diplomat, Roger Casement, to expose horrendous expl oitation of Indian peoples on the Amazon River by a British rubber company. From 1907-1913, he had served as British ambassador in Washington, where he became a popular, even beloved figure."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"101 It would have been hard to find a more admired scho lar who had an established reputation of honesty and integr ity. Bryce and his six fellow commissioners, an amalgam of distinguished lawyers, historians land jurists, \"an alyzed\" 1,200 depositions of \"eyewitnesses,\" who claimed to have seen all manner of atrocious German behavior. Almost all the testimony came from Belgians who had fled to England as refugees; and there were some statements from Belgian and British soldiers, collected in France. But the commissioners failed to interrogate even a single o ne of these eyewitnesses; that task was left to \"gentlemen of l egal knowledge and experience\"—lawyers. Since the assert ed crimes took place in what continued to be a war zon e, there was no on site investigation of any of the reports. Not a single witness was identified by name; the commissioners said this was justified in the case o f Belgians by the fear that there might be German reprisals ag ainst family members. But British soldier witnesses remai ned equally anonymous, for no apparent reason. Neverthe less, in his introduction, Bryce claimed that he and his fel low commissioners had tested the evidence \"severely.\" N obody suspected that military witnesses were not to be \"t ested\" at all, let alone, severely so. No reason was ever giv en for such a grave lapse, and what Tavistock has since charact erized not as a lie, but as a \"misstatement.\" The Bryce Report was released on May 13, 1915.

He went to Fra nce and Belgium later in 1915 and searched in vain for a si ngle eyewitness who could confirm even one of the Bryce stories. Increasingly dubious, Darrow announced he would pay $l,000-a very large sum in 1915 - more than $17,000 in 21 st Century money - to anyone who could produce a Belgi an or French boy whose hands had been amputated by a Germ an soldier or a single child of either sex that had be en bayoneted by German troops. There were no takers, not one \"victim\" came forward to claim the reward although Darrow had spent a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it, far and wide. After the war, historians who sought to examine the documentation for Bryce's stories were told that th e files had mysteriously disappeared. No government official or department offered to start a search for the \"missi ng\" documents. This blatant evasion of putting the \"severely teste d\" documents to a newer, thoroughly impartial test pro mpted most historians to dismiss 99 percent of Bryce's at rocities as fabrications. One called the Report \"in itself one of the worst atrocities of the war.\" More recent scholarship has scaled down the percentage of the Bryce report's fabricati ons because it turned out that several thousand Belgian civilians, including some women and children were apparently s hot by the Germans in the summer of 1914 and Bryce more or less accurately summarized some of the worst excesses, s uch as the executions in the town of Dinant."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"104 But even these latter day scholars admit Bryce's re port was \"seriously contaminated\" by the rapes, amputations and speared babies.

The numbe r of corrections that had to be made by critics of Darro w's reports was less than one percent and failed to clear Bryce . As was pointed out at the time, 99 percent of the Bryce Co mmission Report were lies. Correspondence between the member s of the Bryce committee survived the \"disappearance\" of the documents; it reveals severe doubts about the tales of mutilation and rape. These serious doubts were neve r spread across Britain and America in the manner of Welling ton House brutality reports. One of the committee's sec retaries admitted that he had been given numerous English ad dresses of Belgian women supposedly made pregnant by German rapes but in spite of intensive searches, was not a ble to locate a single one on the list. Even the highly touted story of a Member of Parliam ent sheltering two pregnant women turned out to be frau dulent. Bryce apparently brushed aside this negative eviden ce as Bush and Blair were to do scores of times when on r are occasions, a few reporters did their job and asked awkward questions. Lord Bryce the scholar should have known - and almo st certainly did know - - that tales of spearing babie s, raping and cutting off the breasts of murdered women were standard \"hate - the - enemy\" fables hundreds of years old, as were mass rapes in fields and public squares. Even a cursory examination of Napoleon's campaigns in Europe brought out hundreds of these types of \"atro cities,\" a very small fraction of which turned out to be true."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"105 Bryce the learned historian, the learned, trusted s cholar with a reputation for honesty should have rejected such fabrications out of hand. He most certainly knew th at the vast majority of the \"atrocity\" stories emanated from We llington House (the forerunner of the Tavistock Institute.) Instead of examining their origin and then dismissing them as propaganda, Bryce grouped them all into a \"report,\" that found them generally factual and then issued genera l condemnation of the German army and people. This is reminiscent of Mr. G.W. Bush and his general classi fication that the entire population of several Muslim states belonged to an \"Axis of Evil.\" Why didn't Bryce dismiss the fabrications and conce ntrate on the German executions of civilians? As we have stat ed, he knew the bulk of the \"incidents\" were products of W ellington House; and had he done so, it would have opened up a very sticky subject of the wide use being made of propag anda by the British Government. There was an important reason why Bryce chose to ab andon an honorable course instead of soiling his reputati on: A high percentage of the Belgian Army in 1914/1915 was mad e up of \"Home Guards\" (partisans) who wore no uniforms exce pt for an insignia pinned to their shirts or hats. The Ger mans, desperately trying to win in the West before the in vading Russian Army smashed through their lightly held lin es in the East, were infuriated by these seemingly civilian c ombatants, and showed them no mercy. That the German Army was entitled to return the fir e of civilians or even initiate it by the rules of war u nder the Geneva Conventions applicable at that time, was nev er brought out in the press."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106 The fact is that in 1915 \"partisans\" right up to 19 45, were fair game. Civilians, even with badges pinned to their h ats were not given authority to shoot at soldiers in uniform , or afforded protection. Yes, that was what the rules of war lai d out in the Geneva Conventions, and Lord Bryce and his commissi oners knew it. Nor was this important fact trumpeted acro ss England and America in the manner of the propaganda that had successfully captured the hearts and minds of t he British and American people. Some German field commanders obviously lost their h eads and retaliated excessively against whole towns, suc h as Dinant. But a defense of sorts could be mounted, even for t hese men. The ensuing debate as to what the Geneva Convention allowed would have produced yawns in newspaper readers. The y wanted what Bryce gave them - blood and lust, rape and horror perpetrated by the German (\"Boche\") \"beasts\" against women and young children and \"unarmed civilians.\" T hey wanted proof that the German \"Hun\" was a barbarian, a savage beast. And if the public had not been deceived, Wel lington House, and the British Government's war effort, wou ld have been in deep trouble. The Bryce Report unquestionably helped England win the war. Unquestionably it swayed the opinions of the A merican public and convinced millions of Americans and othe r neutrals—it was translated into 27 languages — that the Germans were ugly beasts in human form. No one exce pt a few \"biased\" outsiders such as Sir Roger Casement a nd Clarence Darrow ever reproached Lord Bryce for the vicious lies he had spread around the world. No fair-minded man could ever forgive Bryce for soiling himself."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"107 Through it all, Wellington House remained in the ba ckground - few people knew of its existence - let alone its vital role, but it had done an important job and struck a mighty bl ow for brainwashing. As for Bryce, he went to his grave lo aded with royal and academic honors, a sullied, superior liar , a man who had soiled himself and with the blood of millions o n his hands, a brilliant scoundrel, a thief who stole the truth from a public entitled to know it, and who managed to evad e detection and exposure and the utter condemnation t hat was universally afforded to Judas Iscariot. From a perspective of a hundred years, we ought to take a much harsher view of this man. The Bryce Report had obvious connections to the British decision to main tain the blockade of Germany for seven months after the armi stice in 1918, causing the starvation deaths of an estimated 600,000 elderly and very young Germans, all part of the gam e plan to so weaken Germany that it would never be a \"threat\" to the \"allies\" again. The Wellington House propaganda lies about the Germ an Army was far and away the greatest atrocity of Worl d War I and it made every German man and woman hunger for revenge.

It also brought to mind how Wellington H ouse and then Tavistock set its seal on brainwashing as a to ol of war. It was one of the deciding factors that made me determ ined to write this work and expose Tavistock and its injuri ous, baleful influence. In the Gulf War the U.S. Department of Defense shut out all news media and appointed its own spokesman who gave his grossly untruthful version of events via television broadcasts. I dubbed the fellow \"Pentagon Pete\" and he talked b lithely about \"collateral damage\" a new Tavistock phrase be ing tried for the first time ever. It took the public a long time to catch on to its meaning-human casualties, human deaths an d destruction of property. Then we had a break when CNN was allowed to come in and report on the success of the \"Patriot\" missile defe nse shooting down Iraqi SCUDS, which it turned out, was another base exercise in propaganda. According to CNN at least o ne SCUD attacking Israel was shot down every night. On ly World In Review, in the midst of the war, reported that not a single SCUD missile had been shot down. Nobody dare d to report that a total of 15 SCUDS had hit Tel Aviv an d other parts of Israel. Disinformation and misinformation prevailed.

Here again, only WIR broke the story that the whole tear- jerking episode of Iraqi soldiers pulling out new-b orn Kuwait babies from incubators and throwing them on the flo or, was a gross falsehood. It is interesting that like Benton and Bowles, Hilton and Knowles had long ties to the Tavistock I nstitute. Both companies were leading \"advertising\" agencies. The Hilton and Knowles fabrication, tearfully narra ted by an \"eye witness,\" (who just happened to be the teenage daughter of the Al Sabah family's Kuwaiti ambassador to Wash ington) was what swayed the Senate to violate the U.S. Cons titution and \"give\" Bush the elder, \"permission\" to attack I raq, despite the fact that no such provision exists in t he U.S. Constitution. While Bush the elder could say; -\"Wel l, I didn't know this, I didn't hire Hilton and Knowles,\" he pl ainly knew all about the key propaganda stunt pulled off again st the American people. Nobody will ever believe that he d id not recognize the sixteen-year old daughter of the Kuwa iti ambassador, who he had met before. The Kuwaiti ambassador paid Hilton and Knowles $600 ,000 to stage the elaborate fraud in front of the Senate , for which he ought to have been arrested for lying to a Senat e committee. What was so galling is that the daughter also went unpunished for her part in tearfully recountin g her experience: \"I saw the Iraqi soldiers pull the new born babies out of the incubators and thrown them on the ground ,\" she cried."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"111 The fact of the matter was that Narita Al Sabah had not been anywhere near Kuwait for years, and certainly not d uring the war!

That is what the pr opaganda experts at Tavistock call \"a successful remake of e vents.\" Narita Al Sabah's testimony became the centerpiece of a huge media campaign in America, and it is known to have swayed not only the Senate, but put the American people on the side of the war against Iraq. Bush the elder indulged in an old propaganda piece in telling the world that \"Saaadam\" had to be removed from Ira q \"to make the Middle East safe.\" (Remember that Wilson s ent American troops to their death in France to \"make t he world safe for democracy.\") Bush the elder suddenly began vilifying and demonizing the Iraqi president to sui t the purposes of his oil cartel friends, and, as in the case of the Kaiser in 1913, it worked. Not many people remembered the ploy put on by Wilso n, otherwise they might have noticed the striking simi larity in what President Bush was saying, and what Bryce told Wilson and what Wilson told the American people to sway th em to support WWI. Now that Hussein is all but forgotten and the threats he allegedly posed have all been dismissed as a pack of lies, all of a sudden it is \"Al Qaeda\" we have t o worry about.

The figures of the dollar cost of WWI do not tell a nything about the sorrow and suffering brought to America b y Wilson, the transgressor. We insert here a recent a rticle, which gives a poignant, personal touch to the dread ful loss of life in that nightmarish war. \"Several weeks ago I visited with my family the Sol dier's Memorial Museum in the heart of downtown St. Louis. It is a huge and deeply impressive building, dedicated in 1 936 by President Roosevelt as a memorial to the 1075 men o f St. Louis who died in the First World War. The memorial is painfully beautiful, all mosaics and marble, with t errazzo floors and Bedford stone sculptures. It is dominate d by the vast black granite cenotaph in its center, covered with the hundreds of dead men's names in neat row upon row.\" \"On the day we visited this striking but haunted pl ace it seemed completely empty. While empty of visitors, i t was, however, full of the spirits and voices and faces o f the pale, tousled-headed boys in neatly-pressed uniforms, who had marched off from St. Louis 86 years ago to fight in a glorious war so far away in a far-off land, boys who had nev er come back home."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"114 The poignancy of that was rendered all the stronger by the fact that we are living daily with the repercussion s of current conflict, the savage bloody war in Iraq. We read da ily of the boys who will never come back home.\" \"What struck me most as I walked around the memoria l and the museum, holding my newborn baby girl, was the f act that it looked like so many memorials that I had visited in my home country of Scotland. It also looked like those I had visited in France, in England and in Canada and New Zealand and it looked just like the memorials in almost eve ry other country touched by the carnage of World War One.\" \"In almost every country touched by the carnage of WWI, the so-called \"War to End all Wars;\" men rushed to join the military and marched off to war with great enthusia sm. They believed it would be a short, sharp and successful war, fought for good reasons, and glorious for the winners. The y believed they were building a better world.\" \"They were wrong. An average of 5,500 men died ever y single day for four and a half years in the First W orld War; that is roughly four men per minute, every minute, for four and a half years, until 10 million men were dead. T he First World War did more than destroy lives; it destroyed the confidence in progress, in prosperity and in reason ableness of civilized human beings that had become so character istic of the nineteenth century. The war destroyed much of t he next generation which would have provided leadership to Europe ...\" \"And this morning, as I sit holding my baby girl I read daily reports of escalating violence in Iraq, with Britis h, Iraqi and American men continuing to die, the St. Louis Soldi er's - a memorial to a war that should have never been"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"115 fought - haunts me and their ghosts haunt the Memor ial.

(Written by Professor Dr. James Lachlan MacLeod, As sociate Professor of History, University of Evansville, In diana). My experiences parallel those of Professor MacLeod. I visited the battlefields of Verdun and Passchendale where most of the slaughter he so ably recounts, occurred . I tried to imagine 10 million soldiers dying so young, the ter ror, the horror and the sorrow they experienced, and the inc onsolable sorrow of the ones they left behind. While standing in the afternoon's fading light in one of the many war cem eteries in France, and looking upon the thousands upon thousan ds of neat white crosses marching across the war cemeteri es, I was overcome by anger and then overwhelmed by grief, so much so that I swear I heard the cries and the shouts of anguish of the dead calling for justice to be done, so cruelly cut down in their prime, and seemed to see their faces reflecte d in the clouds above. It was a mystical experience I will never forget, m uch like the experience of a British officer who visited the se battlefields in 1919:"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"116 Yesterday I visited the battlefields of the last ye ars. The place was scarcely recognizable. Instead of a wilderness of ground torn up by shells, the round was a garden of wild f lowers and tall grasses. Most remarkable of all was the appear ance of many thousands of white butterflies which fluttered around. It was as if the souls of the dead soldiers had come t o haunt the spot where so many fell. It was eerie to see them. And the silence! It was so still that I could almost hear t he beat of the butterflies' wings. (From records in the British Wa r Museum in London) My intense feelings of outrage made me determined t o find out everything I could about a terrible war that be gan with massive gout of propaganda, the scourge of the mode rn world. It was another decisive reason for writing t his book and exposing the evil of Tavistock. Sir Roger Casem ent thought Lord Bryce ought to have been hanged for tr eason and I feel Wilson ought to have suffered a similar fate, which would have stopped Roosevelt and Churchill from plu nging the world into a second round of carnage. Propagand a prevailed, and the western civilized world was lost . The world we knew, the world established by western civilization, is gone. Spengler's gloomy prediction s proved right. In place of our western civilized world we s hall soon see the ghastly edifice of the new Communist Social ist One World Government looming up through the darkness of the coming long night. Let there be no doubt that the First World War was caused by Britain and her ally, the United States of Ameri ca with the aide of Wellington House. The war could not hav e been mounted without the dark forces of Wellington House . The name of Lord Grey, its principal architect will go down in history as traitorous dishonest politician."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"117 There is no consensus as to why Britain started WWI . But by 1916, the German Army had defeated the French and B ritish armies in a most decisive manner. Wilson was under heavy pressure to get American troops shipped to Europe, so Wellington House unleashed an all-out propaganda wa r against the American people, but which nevertheless , remained ineffective until the Bryce Report was pub lished. To understand what is happening in Iraq is impossib le unless we make ourselves fully cognizant with the terrible propaganda deployed against the British and America n people in 1913 and 1940. It was one of the darkest and most foul chapters in history, with Wilson mouthing such lies as a\" just war\", and \"a war to end all wars\", a war \"to m ake the world safe for democracy.\" What the war was about w as to make trade safe for Britain especially, and France now being threatened by German industry. But they were words in obfuscation of his true inte nt and meaningless in that context, just what you'd expect from a politician. The kind of bunkum one find's on a soci ety page. Wilson's talk of \"making the world safe for democra cy\" was nothing more than colored gas bubbles. He was propo sing to go into the war on the side of the English, who wer e at that very moment making sure there was no popular democr acy in the Empire. The English had just brutally finished off the Boer s in South Africa in a cruel war that lasted three years. If W ilson wanted to make the world \"safe for democracy\", he ought to have gone to war on the side of Germany against England, the aggressor and instigator of the war."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"118 Instead of \"making the world safe for democracy\" it turned out to be the greatest calamity ever to befall civi lized nations that had fallen into the clutches of men who were c orrupt immoral liars, into a war quite properly called, \"T he Great War.\" It was of course only \"great\" in its size and scope. We will never understand how the United States beca me the \"sole great power,\" unless we confess to the sins o f Wilson and the British establishment of 100 years ago. The United States has continuously entangled itself in the aff airs of other sovereign nation's affairs, despite the dire warnin g of George Washington, and the first instance of this was our entry into WWI and the failed League of Nations. Wilson made f ull use of the master propagandists of Wellington House usi ng sloganeering as a sword, told the reluctant Senate that if it did not ratify the League of Nations \"it will break the heart of the world.\" Thanks to Senator Cabot Lodge, and a number of U.S. Senators who after sober reflection and examination of the U.S. Constitution, declined to ratify the League of Nations treaty because they discovered it sought to kill U. S. sovereignty. Using and abusing his penchant for pro paganda, Wilson tried to carry the day by declaring his re-e lection campaign \"a great and solemn referendum for accepta nce of the treaty\" but not having Lord Bryce to back him, lost, and was swept away. Unfortunately it did not take the pliers of propaga nda long to stage a comeback with the revamped United Nations v ersion of the League of Nations. Truman, (not the simple h at seller from Missouri but the Master Mason) betrayed the Am erican people by permitting this one-world edifice in the U.S. and Truman used propaganda left over by Wilson to persu ade key senators to vote for his lies."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"119 What Truman did was force the American nation to en ter into a pact with the devil-the devil of power over justi ce and truth, justice from the barrel of a gun.

The world did not learn the truth about Chamberlain or that he was an able politician bent upon avoiding another w ar, or that he was well experienced and had worked out an equit able peace plan - which of course - did not suit the mun itions merchants vultures sitting on the fence waiting to pick clean the wealth of nations and the corpses of their sons . The vast propaganda machine set up at the Tavistock Institute in London immediately swung into action against Chamberlain, after he announced his successful peac e plan. Shakespeare said that \"the evil that men do lives a fter them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\" The goo d done by Chamberlain did not suit the warmongers and they bu ried Chamberlain under a catalogue of propaganda and out right lies. These lies were the work of specialists in propagan da employed at the Tavistock Institute, notably, Peter Howard, Michael Foot and Frank Owen.

Far from being a \"dupe of Hitler\" and \"a fool\" Cham berlain showed considerable negotiating skill and was a hig hly competent leader, who fought valiantly to prevent a nother war. But that ran contrary to the wishes of the Com mittee of 300. Churchill got his \"delicious war,\" but by 1941 , the \"Allies\" had virtually been driven off the continen t of Europe with huge loss of manpower. France, Belgium, Hollan d and Denmark were occupied. Germany offered generous terms to England but warmo nger Churchill rejected peace overtures, and turned to h is old workhorse ally, the United States, to provide men, money and materials to continue \"the delicious war.\" To the American people we say in deep sorrow: \"When will you ever learn? When are you going to distinguish b etween propaganda and genuine information? When are you go ing to put proposal for war to the constitutional test?\" Wilson was a consummate liar and a hater of the U.S . Constitution; yet, thanks to a huge propaganda driv e organized run and maintained by Wellington House, h e was able to accomplish his mission by operating under a banner of patriotism, which overcame vigorous opposition to t he war. Between Wilson, Churchill and Roosevelt, tremendous damage was done to western Christian civilization.

Tavistock remains as important today as it was when I first revealed its existence early in 1969. I have been a ccused of having been a part of Tavistock because I worked in close proximity to Tavistock's Sussex facility, and knew so much of its history. Most of Tavistock's more recent activity has had, a nd is still having, a profound influence upon the way we live i n America, and upon our political institutions. Tavis tock is believed to be behind the pro-abortion publicity, t he proliferation of drugs, sodomy and lesbianism, fami ly traditions, and the fierce attack on the Constituti on, our misconduct in foreign policy and our economic syste m, programmed to fail. Apart from John Rawlings Reese no two men made such a difference to world politics and world events as sh aped at Tavistock than Edward Bernays (the double nephew of Sigmund Freud) and Kurt Lewin. A \"third man\" must b e included here, although he was never on the faculty at Tavistock and I refer to Willi Munzenberg whose pro paganda methods and applications so crucial to the modern a ge of mass communication earned him the title, \"the great est propagandist in the world.\" Undoubtedly the most br illiant man of his era, (he began his work before WWI) Munz enberg was responsible for sanitizing the Bolsheviks after they overthrew the Romanov Dynasty."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"134 Munzenberg definitely shaped the ideas and methods put into practice by Bernays and Lewin. His legendary exploi ts in handling Leon Tepper the Kappelmeister of the Rot K appell (Conductor of the \"Red Orchestra\" spy ring) made Munzenberg the master spy of every intelligence age ncy in existence. Tepper was trained by Munzenberg and he never got caught. Tepper was able to obtain all of the se crets of Britain and the United States in WWII. There was ha rdly a single secret plan the \"allies\" launched that was n ot already known to Tepper, who passed the information to the KGB and the GRU in Moscow. In his field, Bernays was equally brilliant but I s uspect that most of his ideas originated with his famous uncle Sigmund. As for his ideas on propaganda, there is little dou bt that he \"borrowed\" from Munzenberg and this is reflected in the Bernays classic Propaganda that was published in 19 28. The thesis of the book is that it is entirely proper an d a natural right for government to organize public opinion to conform to official policies. We shall return to this subject later. Munzenberg was bold enough to put his basic tenets about propaganda into practice well before Bernays, or Jo seph Goebbels, the German Minister of Popular Enlightenm ent (as the Ministry of Propaganda was called.) The propaganda specialist of the Nazi Party greatly admired Munzenberg's work and modeled his own propaganda program closely upon Munzenberg's methods.

To quote from a recent history account: \"Munzenberg, who by then had returned to Berlin whe re he was later elected to the Reichstag as a Communist d eputy, was charged with setting up a bogus 'charity', the Foreign Committee for the Organization of Worker Relief for the Hungry in the Soviet Union, the purpose of which wa s to pretend to the world that humanitarian relief was c oming from a source other than Herbert Hoover's American Relief Organization. In this Munzenberg was altogether suc cessful.\" Munzenberg gained the attention of the directorate of the former Wellington House which in 1921 had changed i ts name to the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations under the direction of Major General John Rawlings Reese, for merly of the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau Schoo l. It will not come as a surprise to readers who have followed my work that much of the techniques adopted and perfec ted by Munzenberg were adopted by Bernays and his colleagu es, Kurt Lewin, Eric Trist, Dorwin Cartwright, and H.V. Dicks W.R. Bion at Tavistock, who then taught the methods to the Central Intelligence Agency. Munzenberg was not the only Communist to profoundly influence events in the United States.

Kollontei, of course, took her \"feminism\" straight from the pa ges of the Communist Manifesto of 1848. George Orwell, the MI6 operative who wrote the famo us 1984 had studied the work of Munzenberg in great de tail. In fact his best-known statement was based on what Munzenberg had said was the basis of propaganda: \"Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give the appearance o f solidity to pure wind.\" As his German counterpart Munzenberg said: \"All new s is lies and all propaganda is disguised as news.\" It is useful to know about Munzenberg as it helps u s to understand how politicians operate and how secret f orces control access to information, and how public opini on is shaped and molded. Bernays certainly followed the m aster and never deviated from his methodology. Without kn owing these things, we can never understand how President George Bush is able to do the things he does and not have to face the consequences. It has certainly enabled me to trace the origin of the so-called \"Neo-Conservatives\" that shape his policies, right back to its founder, Irving Kristol who admit s to having been an avowed follower of Leon Trotsky."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"137 Tavistock remains the mother of all research facili ties connected with behavior modifications, opinion maki ng and shaping of political events. What Tavistock did was to create a \"black hole of deception in the 20 th century.\" Its task would have been made a great deal more difficult had it n ot been for the prostitution of the media and its role in disse minating \"the gospel according to George Orwell.\" Lord Northcliffe the chief of Tavistock's predecess or, Wellington House, had been a media mogul and at one stage went so far as to ship thousands of copies of his D aily Mail to France each week and then have them delivered by a fleet of motor trucks to British troops at the front lines, \"to win their hearts and minds in support of the war\" (WWI). Especially here in the United States, it has virtua lly taken over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT ), Stanford Research, Esalen Institute, the Wharton Sc hool of Economics, Hudson Institute, Kissinger Associates, Duke University, and many more institutions we have come to think of as wholly American. The Rand Research and Development Corporation, unde r the tutelage of Tavistock has had a profound influence on so many institutions and segments of our society. As o ne of the principal research institutions directly controlled by Tavistock, Rand runs our ICBM program, does prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy makers, and advise s on nuclear policies, does hundreds of projects for the C.I.

Without excep tion, United States State Department field officers are t rained at Georgetown. Some of Georgetown's (Tavistock) better-known gradu ates are Richard Armitage and Henry Kissinger. Just how much damage these two members of the John Rawlings Reese Invisible Army have done to the well-being of our c ountry will have to be told at another time. There is mounting evidence of increased input into our intelligence agencies by Tavistock. When we think o f intelligence in the U.S. we generally think of the CJA or Division Five of the FBI. But there are a great many other intelligence agenc ies receiving instruction from Tavistock. These include the Defense Department Intelligence (DIA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the Office of Nava l Intelligence (ONI,) the Treasury Intelligence Servi ce (TIS), the State Department Intelligence Service, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and at least ten others."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"139 How and when did Tavistock begin its career? As I s aid in my 1969 and 1983 works, when we think of Tavistock we automatically think of its founder, British Army Ma jor John Rawlings Reese. Up until 1969, there were very few people in Britain outside of intelligence circles, who kne w of the existence of Tavistock, let alone what was being do ne at its facilities in London and Sussex. Tavistock provided services of a sinister nature to those people we find in every city across this land; peop le who have local and state government officials and polic e departments in the palm of their hand. This is the case in every major American city also, where the Illuminati members of Freemasonry use their secret powers of control, to walk all over the Bill of Rights, in timidating and brutalizing innocent citizens at will. Where ar e the statesmen who once made this country great? What we have in their place are lawmakers who do not enforce the laws they make, and who are terrified to correct the obv ious wrongs that abound on every hand, afraid, because i f they obeyed their oath of office, they might find themse lves without a job. They are also lawmakers who do not have even the va guest idea of what Constitutional law is, and they do not seem to care. They pass \"laws\" that were never tested as to their constitutionality. The majority of the legislators do not know how to do this, anyway. As a result, anarchy prevai ls in Washington. It may well come as a shock to most can didates who run for the House and Senate, that each and eve ry one of them is carefully checked and profiled by the behav ior modification scientists at Tavistock, or one or mor e of its affiliates in the U.S. Any candidate who is pliable to suggestions and found to be easy to control is \"puf fed.\""},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140 Suffice to say that a spirit of unconstitutional la wlessness pertains in the Congress, which is why we are insul ted by such measures as the \"Brady\" bill and the Feinstein \"assault weapons\" bill. \"Assault weapons\" and in 2003 the \"Homeland Securit y Bill\" and the \"Patriot Act,\" do not appear anywhere in the Constitution and all are, therefore, a prohibition. Feinstein's \"law\" looks suspiciously like the work of the Tavis tock Institute. The Constitution being the supreme law o f the land, \"gun control\" laws are null and void. Guns are private property. Guns do not come under I nterstate Commerce. Every U.S. citizen of sound mind, of lega l age and not a felon has the right to keep and bear arms in any quantity and in any place. This was stated by the great St. George Tucker who declared: \"The Congress of the United States possesses no pow er to regulate or interfere with the domestic concerns of any of the States, it belongs to them (the States) to establis h any rules respecting the right of property, nor will the Cons titution permit any prohibition of arms to the people or pea ceful assembly by them for whatever purpose and in any nu mber, whatsoever they may see the occasion.\" (Blackstone' s Views on the Constitution, page 315) Any candidate who is not going to be easy to contro l or who does not fit the Tavistock profiles is ushered out.

Tavistock serves the Black Nobility in all of its elements, w orking to rob us of the victory of the American Revolution of 1776. If the reader is unfamiliar with the Black Nobility, o f course, the term does not refer to black people. It refers to a group of extremely wealthy people, dynasties, whose history dates back for more than five hundred years and who make up the backbone of the Committee of 300. On the international front, as well as in areas of those institutions in the U.S. who decide foreign policy, Tavistock does psychological profiling at all levels of gover nment, as well as intruding into private life, on a truly vas t scale. Tavistock developed profiles and programs for the C lub of Rome, the Cini Foundation, the German Marshall fund , the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bilderbergers, the CFR and the Trilateral Commission, the Ditchley Foundation, the Bank of International Settlements, the I.M.F. the United Na tions and the World Bank, Microsoft, Citibank, the New York S tock Exchange and so on. This is by no means a complete list of institutions in the hands of Tavistock planners. The propaganda barrage that preceded the 1991 Bush Gulf War was based around a psychological profile of hug e population groups in the U.S. prepared by Tavistock . The results were passed on to the opinion makers, also known as \"advertising agencies\" on Madison Avenue."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 So effective was this propaganda, that within two w eeks, people who didn't even know where Iraq was on the m ap, let alone who its leaders were, began to shout and clam or for war against \"a dictator who threatens America's int erests.\" Frightening? YES, but unfortunately 100 percent tru e! The very words \"gulf crisis\" were crafted by Tavistock Institute to arouse maximum support for the Bush war on behalf o f a Committee of 300-flagship company, British Petroleu m (BP). We now know—at least some of us know—just what a bi g role Tavistock plays when it comes to creating publ ic opinion based on obfuscation, lies, dissembling, misreprese ntation and outright fraud. There isn't any other instituti on in the world that can hold a candle to the Tavistock Insti tute for Human Relations. Quoting from my updated 1984 repor t: \"There are a few institutions and publishing busine sses that are catching on to the changes that are occurring. The latest issue of \"Esquire Magazine\" carries an article enti tled \"Discovering America.\" 'Esquire' did not mention Ta vistock by name, but this is what it said: During the socia l revolution (a very significant phrase) of the 70s, most of the rituals and personal inter-action and the institutional life we re radically altered. Naturally, these changes have affected the way we perceive the future... The economic base of America is changing and new services and products are being of fered.\" The article then went on to state that our professi onal lives, our leisure time, our educational systems are being altered, and more importantly, the thinking of our children is being altered. The writer of the \"Esquire\" article conclu ded:"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"143 \"America is being transformed as is the direction i t will take in the future...Occasionally our new American secti on (promised for future editions of Esquire), won't se em so new, since most of the new thinking has been creeping in to the main stream of American life, but until now, it has gone unnoticed.\" I could not have given a more fitting description o f the fallacy \"time changes things.\" Nothing changes on i ts own, all changes are engineered, whether in secret or in pub lic. While \"Esquire\" didn't say who is responsible for the cha nges - for the most part about unwanted changes - that We, the People, attempted to resist. (Capitals intended.) \"Esquire\" is not alone in its contention. Millions of American is living in total ignorance of the forces shaping their future. They are unaware that America is being thoroughly \"conditioned\" by Tavistock's \"inner directional lon g range penetration method.\" The worst part of it is that t hese millions, because of Tavistock conditioning (making Americans think in the way Tavistock would have the m think), no longer seem to care. They have been \"Inn er Conditioned\" through \"Long Range Penetration\"—the m aster control plan set up by Tavistock to brainwash the n ation for so long that they now suffer a constant state of \"s hellshock.\" As we shall see, there is good reason for this apat hy and ignorance.

This substantial number of our citizens is even tod ay totally unaware of how they have been manipulated and force d to accept \"new ideas\", \"new cultures\", and \"new religi ons\". They have been grossly violated and don't know it. They are still being violated and still don't know what is h appening, especially when it comes to opinion making through polling. To illustrate my contention, former President Clint on was able to survive scandal after scandal on the basis of the polls showing that the American people didn't care enough about his outlandish behavior to call for impeachment pro ceedings. Could this be right? Could it be true that people r eally don't care about public morals anymore? Of course not! The situation is a contrived one taught by Tavistoc k Institute and every polltaker is trained in Tavistock methods of opinion making and manipulation of public opinion, so that the answers \"come out right.\" We can add President G.W. Bush to the \"survivors\". He has not been removed from office notwithstanding the bl atant lies that were used to start an illegal (unconstitu tional) in Iraq. It is unconstitutional because war was never consti tutionally declared."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 Also, there is no provision in the U.S. Constitutio n for the United States to attack another nation that has not committed acts of belligerency against it. How has President Bush got away with not being impeached? The answers lie in t he Tavistock Institute and its mass brainwashing capab ilities. One of the early tasks undertaken by Tavistock afte r it launched total war on the U.S. in 1946 was to force acceptance of \"alternate life styles\" on the Americ an people. Tavistock documents showed how the leaders of a cam paign to force legal public acceptance of groups, whose b ehavior was until the changes were forced through by the Co ngress, recognized as a crime in almost every State in the Union, and in some States, remains as a crime. I am referring to the \"gay lifestyle\" as it has come to be known. The careful profiling that was done before this \"ch ange\" program was launched was not believed by the uninit iated, who dismissed it as \"lurid science fiction\", even t hough it were spelled out in the simplest of terms. A vast m ajority of Americans never heard (and still do not know in 200 5) that the Tavistock Institute went to war against them in 1946, nor that the people have been losing that war ever sinc e. Tavistock turned its attention to the United States at the close of WWII. The methods that brought Germany down, wer e now unleashed against the United States. The massiv e brainwashing of our nation was called \"Long Range Penetration \" and \"Inner Directional Conditioning.\" The main purpose of this endeavor was to install So cialist programs at every level of government; ushering in the New Dark Age a New World Order inside a One World Government Communist dictatorship."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"147 Particularly, it was designed to break down the san ctity of marriage and family life. And it was aimed at the Constitution, also, to \"make it of no effect.\" Homo sexuality, lesbianism, and abortion are Tavistock-designed pro grams, as are aimed at \"changing\" the U.S. Constitution. Much of Tavistock's programs are based on getting t he \"right\" candidates elected; this being achieved wit h the help of its trained pollsters with their cleverly loaded qu estions. Tavistock's \"gay lifestyle\" blueprint called for se veral \"task force\" units who would assist the media in painting over the homosexual onslaught and making the \"new lifestyle\" crusaders seem \"just like any other people.\" \"Talk shows\" are now an integral part of such plans , but back then, they were not as widely used to bring about s ocial changes as they are today. The leaders selected by Tavistock to promote tremendous changes on the social and pol itical scene via talk shows, were Phil Donahue and Geraldo Riviera, Bill O'Reilly, Barbara Walters and scores of other people whose names have become household names in America. It was they who presented people who were to run for office; people who hitherto, would have been la ughed off the platform. But now, thanks to the skillful use o f polling, such persons are taken seriously. The minuscule planning that went into priming the p ublic through T.V. talk show hosts, cost millions of doll ars spent in putting this Tavistock-forced social change long-ra nge plan into effect, and as the results show, Tavistock did its homework well. With all of my experience, I am stil l amazed at how this great coup was pulled off."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"148 Entire communities across the nation were profiled; guests for talk shows and their audiences were selected by pro file matching, without ever being aware of what was bein g done without their knowledge and consent. Americans were bamboozled on a grand scale and didn't know it then and still don't know it! Nor did they know that they were bei ng whipsawed by the Tavistock Institute for Human Rela tions. Finally, after three years of preparation, the Tavi stock sodomist / lesbian onslaught that was launched agai nst a totally unsuspecting American people can be likened to the storm that burst upon the unsuspecting French natio n at the time of the French Revolution. The well-planned and executed campaign began in Flo rida, according to plan, and, exactly as planned, Anita B ryant came forward to take up the cudgels against the inv aders from the \"gay community\" - words carefully selected by Tavistock, which have now become fully acceptable. Before this episode, the word \"gay\" was never used to desc ribe homosexuals or their behavior. Tavistock was founded in 1921 as a successor to Wel lington House that had pulled off a great coup in 1914 and 1917, and as already related, getting Britain and America int o a savage war against Germany. Tavistock was to serve as a primary research vehicl e for British intelligence services, still the best in th e world.

It now began to be called \"Interpol.\" During the Second World War, both the London and Su ssex facilities of Tavistock, served as headquarters for the British Army's Psychological Warfare Bureau. The significance of this is that through the \"best friend\" arrangement between Churchill and Roosevelt, Tavist ock was able to take full control of U.S. intelligence and military policies through Special Operations Executive (SOE) and maintained this control throughout the Second World War. Eisenhower was selected by the Committee of 300 to become the commanding general of the allied forces in Euro pe, but only after extensive profiling by Tavistock. He was then appointed to the White House. Eisenhower was allowe d to retain his seat in the White House until, with his usefulness expended, as memories of the war receded, he was du mped.

It isn't. Brainwashing da tes back to Tavistock as the originator of the art. The scie nce of behavioral modifications had its origin in Tavistoc k, which trained an army of intelligence personnel to go out and do likewise. The United States, perhaps more than any other coun try, has felt the weight of Tavistock's fist in our national life at almost every level, and its grip on this country has not b een lessened: If anything, with the advent of William Jefferson C linton, and Bush, father and son, it has been considerably tigh tened. We were truly brainwashed in 1992 and 1996. We are tru ly a brainwashed nation in 2005. The United States is th e principal victim of long-range penetration warfare using the Reese techniques.

The blitz eventually cost the lives of hundreds of thou sands of American soldiers and poured billions of dollars in to the coffers of the Wall Street and international banks and the arms merchants. Our loss in lives and national treasures cannot be recovered. Just prior to the assault on Iraq, the U.S. was sub jected to a propaganda blast only slightly below the level of t hat which was developed to shove the United States into the S econd World War.

During the Gulf War, an example of Tavistock method s was the way the State Department kept on referring to i ts embassy staff in Kuwait as \"hostages\", although none were e ver imprisoned. In fact, every single one of them was f ree to leave at any time, but were ordered to remain in Ku wait so that propaganda could be made out of their situatio n. In essence, the \"hostages\" were hostages of the Sta te Department! Unable to goad President Hussein into f iring the first shots, another \"contrived situation\" like Pea rl Harbor had to be mounted. April Glaspie's name will forever be associated with treachery and infamy. What followed was an elaborate theft of millions of barrels of Iraqi oil by Kuwait. Hussein was given the \"all clear\" by U.S. ambassado r to Baghdad April Gillespie, to attack Iraq and put an end to a situation that was costing the Iraqi people billion s of dollars. But when the attack was mounted, Bush the elder los t no time in a sending the U.S. military to help Kuwait. President Bush whipped up support against Iraq by u sing the fake \"hostage\" claim. This is where the Tavistock I nstitute will fail: While it has been able to convince the m ajority of Americans that our policies for the Middle East are right, Tavistock has not been able to gain control of Syri a, Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Saudi Arabia.

Yet this man and John Rawlings Ree se did more to damage the institutions upon which the U.S. Republic rests, than anything Hitler or Stalin could have ac complished. The way in which Tavistock unraveled the warp and w oof of our social fabric which holds the nation together, makes a chilling and frightening narrative of which the \"no rmalizing\" of homosexual and lesbian lifestyles is a small, bu t significant achievement; a far greater and more chi lling achievement was the success of mass brainwashing th rough opinion polling."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"156 Why do Reese's Tavistock techniques work so well in practice?

His p rogress was profiled throughout his career, and especially during the Vietnam War period.

Trent Lott, Dick Cheney, Charles Schumer , Barney Frank, Tom DeLay, Dennis Hastert, Dr. Frist, and so on are other examples of Tavistock \"graduates.\" The same technique is applied to actors, singers, musicians and entertainers. Heavy propaganda was used to convince the populatio n that unwelcome \"environmental social turbulences\" were t he result of the changing times in which we live, wher eas, as we now know, special new-science scientists designed p rograms (stress programs) to artificially create \"environme ntal social turbulences\" and then pass them off as resulting fr om a natural condition, best known as \"changing times.\""},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"158 Tavistock's new science scientists were confident t hat we would not apply the principle \"for every effect the re must be a cause\"— and they were right. For instance we meek ly accepted the \"Beatles\" and their \"novel music\" and lyrics-if one dare call it music and lyrics, having been told , that the group wrote it all themselves. Actually Tavistock graduate Theo Adorno, whose 12-a tonal discords were scientifically pitched to create mass \"environmental social turbulences\" all across Ameri ca, wrote the music. None of the Beatles could read music. Nevertheless, they were \"puffed\" day and night with out ceasing until everything about them, - lies and all , was accepted as truth. Tavistock proved over and over again, that when a l arge group is successfully profiled, it can be subjected to \"inner directional conditioning\" in just about every aspec t of social and political life. An integral part of Tavistock's mass mind control experiments in the U.S., which have been going on s ince 1946, poll taking-opinion making has been by far it 's most successful undertakings. America was whipsawed and did not know it. Just to prove the success of his techniques, Reese got Tavistock to test a large group of people on a cons piracy- related subject. It turned out that 97.6 percent of those who were questioned utterly rejected the idea that an o verall conspiracy exists. How much less then would our peo ple believe that they have been under direct attack by Tavistock for the past 56 years? We have radio talk show host s like Rush Limbaugh, who constantly tell audiences that t here is no conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"159 How many people would believe that for the past 56 years, Tavistock has been sending an invisible army of sho ck troops, into every hamlet, village, town and city a cross this nation? The task of the invisible army is to infilt rate, tamper with, and modify collective social behavior, by mea ns of \"inner directional conditioning.\" The Reese \"invisible army\" is made up of real profe ssionals who know their job and are dedicated to the task th ey were commissioned to do. They are found today in the hal ls of justice, police, churches, school boards, sports bo dies, newspapers, television studios, government advisory boards, town councils, state legislatures, and are legion i n Washington. They run for every office from county c ouncilor to sheriff to judge, from school board member to ci ty councilman, and even, for the office of the Preside nt of the United States of America. How this works was explai ned by John Rawlings Reese, back in 1954: \"Their job is to apply the advanced techniques of psychological warfare as we know them to whole popu lation groups that will grow ever larger, so that whole po pulations may be more easily controlled. In a world driven co mpletely mad, groups of Tavistock psychologists linked to ea ch other, capable of influencing the political and government al field must be arbiters, the power cabal.\" Will this frank confession convince conspiracy skep tics? Probably not, as it is doubtful whether such closed minds could have any real knowledge of these things. Such information is wasted on radio \"talking heads.\" A director of the Reese invisible army was Ronald L ippert, whose specialty was tinkering with the minds of chi ldren."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"160 Dr. Fred Emery was another of Tavistock's \"linked psychologists\" who was on the board of President Jo hnson's Kerner Commission. Emery was what Tavistock called a \"social environme ntal turbulence\" specialist, the bottom line of which is that when a whole population group is subjected to social crise s, it breaks down into synoptic idealism and finally fragments; that is to say, it just gives up trying to cope with the probl em or problems. The word \"environmental\" has nothing to do with eco logy issues, but has to do with the particular environme nt into which the specialist has injected himself with the specific intent of making trouble—\"turbulences\" or \"stress p atterns.\" This has already happened with rock and roll, drugs , free love (abortion), sodomy, lesbianism, pornography, street gangs, a constant attack on family life, on the institution of marriage, on social order, on the Constitution and especially on the 2 nd and 10 th Amendment. Where this has happened, we find communities powerl ess to cope with a broken-down justice system, school boar ds teaching evolution, minors being encouraged to buy condoms and even \"children's rights\" being pushed. \"Childre n's rights\", usually mean children should be allowed to disobey their parents, a key issue in every Socialist's \"child ca re\" program.

I believe California will be the \"role model\" for the rest of the nation. At present there are no laws on the books that make this type of conditioning illegal. Reese and Lewin researched the laws of England and the United States and concluded that it was legal to \"condition\" a person without his or her co nsent or knowledge. We need to change this. Polling is an integral part of \"conditioning.\" Tavistock's \"Invisible Army\" of sho ck troops has changed the way America thinks about rock, prem arital sex, drug taking, children born out of wedlock, pro miscuity, marriage, divorce, family life, abortion, homosexua lity and lesbianism, the Constitution and yes, even murder, not to mention that lack of morals is fine as long as one does a good job. In the early years of Tavistock, the \"Leaderless Gr oup Concept\" was used to lay the America we once knew, in the dust. In charge of the project was W.R. Bion, who r an the Wharton School of Economics for years, where such nonsense as free trade and Keynesian economics are taught. Japan stayed with the American model taught by Gene ral McArthur — not the Wharton School fraud—and look at Japan today.

They got it from Reese at Tavistock , from where they fanned out across America to sow their s eeds of \"environment social turbulence stress patterns.\" They fanned out into every level of American societ y, obtaining posts in places where they could exert th e influence they had been taught how to use by Reese. Decisions made by the members of the Invisible Army of shock troop s have profoundly affected America at every level, and the worst is yet to come. Just to give a few examples of who some the leading shock troops were, let's mention George Schultz, Alexande r Haig, Larry King, Phil Donahue, Admiral Burkley (deeply involved in the cover-up of the Kennedy assassins), Richard Armitage, Billy Graham, William Paley, William Buck ley, Pamela Harriman (since deceased,) Henry Kissinger, George Bush and the late Katherine Meyer Graham not to men tion the caravan that arrived in Washington from Arkansa s in 1992, headed by Mr. and Mrs. Clinton at whose hands the nation was soon to be torn apart.

Thousands of such Invisible Army shock troops of the Business Brigade were turned out at T avistock's U.S. facility, the National Training Laboratory (NT L), which began its existence on the huge, sprawling New York estate of Averill and Pamela Harriman.

Instead of rebelling against dragging this nation i nto a war against a friendly country with whom we had no quar rel, a war that was waged without a proper Congressional declaration of war, we were \"turned\" in its favor. In short, we were badly misled without knowing it, due to the \"l ong-range inner-directional conditioning\" the American people had been undergoing since 1946. Tavistock advised President Bush the elder to use t he following simple formula which Reese and Lewin inst ructed Allen Dulles to use back in 1941 when Roosevelt was preparing to drag America into the Second World War : (1) What is the state of the morale and its probable co urse in the targeted country? (This also applied to morale in the U.S.) (2) What is the state of susceptibility in the U.S. to the idea that war in the Persian Gulf is necessary? (3) What techniques could be used to weaken opposition in the U.S. to war in the Persian Gulf?"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"166 (4) What kind of techniques in psychological warfar e would succeed in undermining the morale of the Iraqi peop le? (It was here that Tavistock slipped up very badly.) Once Bush committed himself to Prime Minister Thatc her's 1991 Gulf War on behalf of Queen Elizabeth and her BP oil company, Tavistock put together a team, which inclu ded psychologists, public opinion makers, led by the br azen liars at Hill and Knowlton, and a host of Tavistock profi lers. Every single one of the speeches made by President Bush with the intention of promoting war against Iraq wa s crafted by multi-discipline teams of writers trained by Tav istock. Top-secret information on how the Gulf War was prop agated and how the American people were swung behind that nasty, corrupt war by President George Bush was given to a Congressional committee recently. The report said t hat at an early stage of the plan to take out Iraq, the Bush administration was advised that public support was paramount and that he did not have the American peo ple behind him. Rule one was to establish in the mind of the Americ an people the \"great need to protect Saudi oil fields threate ned by an Iraqi invasion under the leadership of a madman.\" T hus, although it was known from the beginning that Iraq had no designs on Saudi oil fields, the National Security Agency (NSA) gave out false and misleading information to the effect that the Saudi oil fields were the ultimate target of Iraq. This was a total fabrication, but it was the key to success. The National Security Agency has never been punishe d for its lying conduct."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"167 The report stated that an unprecedented amount of t elevision coverage would be needed to swing public support be hind the war. The Bush administration early on secured the f ull cooperation of the three major networks, ABC, CBS a nd NBC and later CNN. In later years a virtual propaga nda station, Fox News (also known as Faux News) was add ed. The amount of Gulf War and related subjects coverag e in 1990 by these stations was three times that of any subject covered in 1989, and once the war began; coverage w as five times greater than any other story, including Tiana nmen Square. In 2003, Bush the younger, followed very closely th e formula that had succeeded for his father, but with some additional adaptations. News mixed with fiction (se e the section about H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds\") becam e more fiction mixed with news and blatant lying was resor ted to so that straight reporting became impossible to distin guish from news mixed with fiction. One of the principal players in the coverage of the war was CNN, which contracted with the Bush administration to bring the Gulf War to American sitting rooms on a round-t he-clock basis. As a result of the mass of favorable, slante d news, the deployment of troops to the Gulf was favorably rece ived by about 90 percent of the American people. It was jus t another way to practice opinion-making polling on the Ameri can people, just another way to brainwash them. National Security Agency (NSA) advisors told the Bu sh administration that from the very start, the public had to be persuaded to go along with his Gulf War plans. It w as decided to create a parallel between Hitler and Sad dam Hussein, with the words \"Saddam Hussein must be sto pped\" repeated over and over again, followed by lie that the Iraqi President \"is acting like Hitler.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"168 Later a dire threat was added, that Iraq had the ca pability to strike at the U.S. with long-range weapons of mass destruction. It was the adaptation of Stalin's edic t that to capture and enslave your own people, first terroriz e them. British Prime Minister Blair went even further. Spe aking in Parliament, he told the British people that \"Saddam Hussein\" had the capability to strike Britain and could do s o within 45 minutes. He went as far as to warn British tourists vacationing in Cyprus to return to Britain as soon as possible as British intelligence had learned that Iraq was p reparing to launch a nuclear strike against the island. Blair m ade his announcement in the full knowledge that Iraq's nucl ear weapons program had been completely destroyed in 19 91. The first Bush administration's \"skill\" in communic ating the need for a war in the Gulf reached its height with the Hill and Knowlton fabricated \"incubator\" story tearfully tol d by the daughter of the ambassador of Kuwait to Washington. The Senate—and the entire country— swallowed this massi ve fraud. It was Kaiser Wilhelm II \"cutting off the arms of y oung Belgian children\" all over again, and with even gre ater success. After the Hill and Knowlton \"big lie,\" 77 percent of Americans surveyed said they approved of using U.S. troops against Iraq, even though 65 percent of those polle d did know where Iraq was on the map. All major polls found that Bush's sidestepping of t he Constitution was approved, because those polled had no idea of what a constitutional declaration of war was, no r that it was mandatory. The role played by the U.N. added to the \"communication skills\" of the Bush administration, the report said."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"169 The second Bush administration used the same Tavist ock methods and once again the American people went alo ng with the lies and distortions presented to them as fact. The war was vigorously promoted by Vice President Cheney wh o led a massive campaign to force public opinion onto the side of George Bush. No other Vice President in the history of the United States had ever taken such an active part in forcing the American people into a war with Iraq. Cheney appeared on television 15 times in one month and adamantly declared that the Taliban was behind the attack on the World Trade Towers in New York and that the Tal iban was under the control of President Hussein. \"The fi ght against terrorism had to be taken to the \"terrorists\" in Ir aq,\" Cheney said, \"before they could strike at the U.S. again.\" Cheney continued in the same vein long after his cl aim was proved absolutely false. Although the world's great est authorities came forward to announce that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 and that there were no Taliban fig hters in Iraq, Cheney kept up his drumbeat of lies, until Ha ns Blix, the former U.N. chief weapons inspector cut him off , and the Central Intelligence Agency reported to the U.S. Se nate that no connections had been discovered between Iraq and the Taliban and with 9/11. In fact, said the CIA report, Hussein hated the Tal iban and had driven them out of Iraq many years before. We p ublish this information in the hope that the American peop le will not be so gullible the next time their President wants to get them involved in a war. We would also like the American people to know that they are being grossly misled by a foreig n \"think tank\" that constantly misleads them on a multitude of issues."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"170 Let us examine some of the issues and let us hope t hat the American people will never be misled again by the s killed \"communicators.\" The American people have been grossly misled about five major wars, and that should be enough for any natio n. But unfortunately, the nonstop bombing of Iraq and Serb ia by U.S. - British aircraft showed that the American pe ople had learned nothing from the Gulf War and how it was in stigated, and how they were lied to and manipulated in an utt erly reprehensible manner. The second Gulf War was ample proof that Tavistock' s methods still work, so much so that blatant lying w as resorted to with the knowledge that even if discovered as li es, the Bush administration knew that their lies would just be shrugged off, because the American people were now thoroughly conditioned in a state of permanent \"she ll-shock,\" to display no concern over what was a very serious position for any nation to find itself in. What can be done about the grip Tavistock and its m any affiliated institutions have on the country, the Ch ristian Right, the Congress, our intelligence agencies and the State Department, a grip that extends all the way to the President and to our top military brass? As I previously stat ed, the main problem is to be able to convince the broad mass of Americans that what is happening to them and the co untry, is not a case of \"changing times\" due to circumstances beyond their control, but a carefully contrived plot, a re al menace to the future of all of us, and not just some \"conspir acy\" theory.

Ge n. John Rawlings Reese in 1921. It was Reese who evolved Tavistock's methods of mass \"brainwashing\". Tavisto ck was founded as a research center for British Special In telligence Service (SIS). It was Reese who launched the method of controlling political campaigns, as well as mind control techni ques, which continue to this very day, and it was Reese a nd Tavistock who taught the USSR, North Vietnam China and Vietnam how to apply his techniques—all they ever w anted to know about how to brain wash individuals or a mass of people. Reese was a close confidant of the late Margaret Me ade and her husband Gregory Bateson, both of whom played ma jor roles in shaping U.S. institutions that make govern ment policy. He was also a friend of Kurt Lewin, who was expelled from Germany after being accused of being an active Zionist. Lewin fled Germany when it became a pparent that the NSDP would control Germany. Lewin rose to become Tavistock's director in 1932. He played a ma jor role in preparing the American people for entry into WWI I. Lewin was responsible for organizing the greatest propaga nda machine known to mankind, which he directed against the whole German nation. Lewin's machine was responsibl e for whipping the American public opinion into favoring the war by engendering a climate of hatred against Germany. What was it that made the Reese method so successful? Ba sically, it was this: The same psychotherapy techniques used to cure a mentally sick individual could be applied in the op posite direction."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174 It could also used to make healthy people become me ntally ill. Reese began his long series of experiments in the 1 930s using British Army recruits as test cases. From there Ree se progressed to perfecting mass brainwashing techniqu es, which he was later to apply to countries slated for change. One such country was the United States, which remai ns the focus of attention of Tavistock. Reese began applyi ng his behavior modifications techniques against the Ameri can people in 1946. Few if any realized the extreme thr eat to America, which Reese posed. The British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau was s et up at Tavistock through secret agreements with Churchi ll, well before Churchill became prime minister. The agreeme nts gave the British Special Operations Executive, comm only known as the SOE, full control over the policies of the U.S. Armed Forces, acting through civilian channels, and which invariably, became official U.S. Government policy. That agreement is still firmly in place, as unaccep table to patriotic Americans today, as it was when establish ed. It was the discovery of this agreement that led Gen. Eisen hower to issue his historical warning about powers accumulat ed in the hands of the \"military industrial complex.\" So that we fully understand the influence of Tavist ock in the daily political, social, religious and economic lif e of the U.S., allow me to explain that it was Kurt Lewin, the sec ond in command who was responsible for founding the follow ing American institutions, many of whom were responsibl e for making profound changes in U.S. foreign and local p olicies:"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"175 * The Harvard Psychological Clinic * The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) * The Committee on National Morale * Rand Corporation * National Defense Resources Council * The National Institute for Mental health * The National Training Laboratories * The Stanford Research Center * The Wharton School of Economics. * The New York Police Department *The FBI *The CIA * The Rand Institute To Lewin fell the task of selecting key personnel f or these and other highly prestigious research institutions; including Esalen, the Rand Corporation; the United States Air Force, the Navy, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the State Depa rtment.

Their horrible d rug experiments were carried out from Stanford Research , McGill University, and Bethesda Naval Hospital and at U.S. Army locations scattered all across the land. It is worth repeating that the movement, which spro uted among our youth in the 1950s--1960s, known as the \" New Age\" and or the \"Age of Aquarius\", was a Tavistock program. There was noting spontaneous about it. Nud ity was introduced in conformity with the course taken to d emean women. By 2005 the \"new\" fad is called \"Hip-Hop\" a type of dance game played mainly by children in the poorest subur bs of America's cities.

Immediately after Winston Churchill became Britain' s Prime Minister after he ousted Neville Chamberlain becaus e he had succeeded in making a peace agreement with Germany; Churchill the great paragon of belief in respect fo r international law began breaking international laws that governed civilized conduct during wars. Acting on the advice of Tavistock theoretician Rich ard Crossman—Winston Churchill adopted Tavistock's plan for terror bombing of civilian population. (We were to see the same policy being carried out in Iraq and Serbia.) Churchill gave the Royal Air Force (RAF) orders to bomb the small German city of Freiberg, an undefended ci ty, one on the list of such cities in Germany and Britain, whi ch both sides had agreed in a written pact was an \"open, un defended city\" not to be bombed."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"186 On Saturday afternoon, February 27 1940, a raid on Freiberg was carried out by RAF \"Mosquito\" bombers, killing 300 civilians including 27 children at play in a school yard, plainly visible as a school.

Tavistock assured Churchill that su ch mass terror bombing would bring Germany to its knees onc e the target of destroying 65% of German worker housing w as reached.

Churchill was a war criminal and should have been p ut on trial for his hideous crimes against humanity.

Kurt Lewin, whose hatred of Germany knew no bounds, developed the policy of terror bombing of civilian housing.

To return to Reese and his early work at Tavistock involving brainwashing experiments on 80,000 British Army tro ops. After a five-year \"re-programming\" of these men, Re ese was confident that his system of making mentally stable people ill, would work on any mass group. Reese was sure that h e could give \"treatment\" to mass groups of people, whether it was desired by them or not, and without the victims eve n being aware of what was being done to their minds. When questioned about the propriety of his actions, Rees e responded that it was unnecessary to first obtain p ermission from the \"subjects\" before commencing with his expe riments. The modus operandi developed by Reese and his gurus , proved to be successful.

The American people do not vote for a president. They v ote for a party candidate chosen by the elect of the party, m ore often than not, entirely under the control of the Committ ee of 300. This is not a vote for a candidate of choice, as we are so often told. In truth, voters have no choice other than se lecting from pre-chosen candidates. The candidates the pubic think it is voting for by choice (our choice) have been thoroughly vetted by the Tavistoc k Institute, and we were then brainwashed into thinki ng of them in a virtuous manner. Such impressions or sound bites are created in the studious of think tanks like Yankelovich, Skalley and White, ru n by Tavistock graduate Daniel Yankelovich. Tavistock-co ntrolled \"think tanks\" tell us how to vote in their chosen m anner. Since the advent of Yankelovich, the number of prof iling\" industries has proliferated to over one hundred and fifty such institutions. Take the examples of James Earl Carte r, and George Bush. Carter came from relative obscurity to \"win\" the White House, which the media moguls said, prove d that the U.S. system works. In fact, what Carter's election proved was that Tav istock rules this country and can sway the majority of voters to vote for a man about whom they know almost nothing.

No thinking person would have wanted Skull and Bones man George Bush as Vice President, yet Bush is what we got. How did it come about that Carter was able to reach the White House? It h appened thusly: A certain Dr. Peter Bourne, Tavistock's in- house social psychologist was given the task of finding a candidate Tavistock could manipulate. In other words, Bourne was to find the \"right\" candidate for the job according to Tavistock's rule, one that could be sold to the voters. Bourne, knowing Carter's history, put forward his n ame for consideration. Once Carter's record was approved, A merican voters were given \"the treatment,\" that is to say; they were subjected to a sustained brainwashing campaign to p ersuade them that they had found Carter as their choice. In fact, by the time Tavistock was finished with the job, it was no t really necessary to hold an election. It became a mere for mality. Carter's victory was a personal victory for Reese, while Bush was a victory for Tavistock's methodology. An even greater \"success story\" was to follow in the selling of Wil liam Jefferson Clinton as a candidate for the White Hous e, a feat which might have been impossible in any other count ry. Then came the selling of George W. Bush, a failed businessman and one who had sidestepped serving in Vietnam and a man with very thin experience.

Reese continued to expand Tavistock's base of opera tions, taking on board Dorwin Cartwright, a highly skilled population profiler. One of his specialties was mea suring population reaction to a food shortage. The object was to gain experience when the food weapon is brought into pla y against a population group unwilling to conform to Tavistoc k regulations. Tavistock has planned it this way: The internationa l food cartels will corner food production and distributio n of the world's food resources. Famine is a weapon of war, just as weather modifications is a weapon of war. Tavistock will use the famine weapon without restraint, when the time is right. Continuing with the expansion of Tavistock, Reese r ecruited Ronald Lippert. What Tavistock had in mind when it hired Lippert, w as to get a foothold in the future control of education, star ting with young children. Lippert was an expert in tinkering with the minds of the very young. An ex-O.S.S. operative, he was highly skilled theoretician, and a specialist in ra ce mixing as a way of weakening national boundaries. Once instal led at Tavistock, Lippert began his work by establishing a \"think tank\" devoted to what he called, \"community interre lations,\" which involved seeking methods whereby natural race barriers might be dismantled.

Thus it is not a part of the U.S. Constitution and all laws predicated upon it are null and void. In essence there is no such constitutiona l provision for civil rights. Lippert established the rationale for Martin Luther King's \"civil rights\" over the fact that no basis for it e xisted in the Federal Constitution. Busing children past their sc hools was another Lippert-Reese brainwashing success. Busing children past their destination was certainly not a \"right.\" To sell the idea of \"civil rights\" to the American pop ulace at large, three \"think tanks\" were established: The Science Policy Research Center The Institute for Social Research The National Training Laboratories Through the Science Policy Research Unit, Lippert w as able to place thousands of his brainwashed \"graduates\" i n key positions throughout the United States, West Europe an (including Britain), France and Italy.

In 1983 I wrote a monograph entitled, \"The Death of the Steel Industry\" in which I provided details of how French aristocrat Etienne Davignon of the Club of Rome was given the task of downsizing the American steel industry. At the time this work was published, a lot of peopl e were skeptical, but based upon information about the Clu b of Rome—which most Americans and most writers had neve r even heard of prior to my 1970 article of the same title; I felt sure, that Nesbitt's prediction could happen, and i n the next seven years, it turned out to be accurate, although not in all ways. Although parts of Nesbitt's predictions were off—their time had not yet come - in many ways, he was correc t, in so far as the intentions of our secret government go. None of the captains of industry, who attended Tavi stock's EEC brainwashing sessions, saw fit to protest what Nesbitt was saying. That being the case how could I expect that an unknown writer like myself, nobody had ever heard o f, would make an impact? The executive conferences and training sessions at Tarrytown House proved that Reese's brainwashing techniques w ere flawless. Here was a forum attended by the captains of industry, the elite of America's corporate world, q uite happy to be participating in the demise of America's steel i ndustry, sacrificing its unique domestic market that had mad e America a great industrial nation, tearing up the Constitut ion and the Bill of Rights and embracing genocidal programs cal ling for the culling of half of the world's population; subs tituting Eastern mysticism and the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"208 Kabala for Christianity; applauding programs that w ould result in a breakdown of the morals of the nation a nd destruction of family life; a future Balkanized Ame rica. No one could deny, looking at the state of America today in 2005, that Reese and his Tavistock methods did an astonishing job in brainwashing the leaders of our corporate world, our political and religious leaders, our jud ges and our educators, and the guardians of the morals of the n ation, not to mention the U.S. House of Representatives and th e Senate. In 1974, Professor Harold Isaacson of the Massachus etts Institute of Technology (MIT) in his book, \"Idols o f the Tribe,\" laid bare Tavistock's blueprint to combine Mexico, Canada and the U.S. into Balkan-type states. I woul d remind my readers that MIT was founded by Kurt Lewin, the same Kurt Lewin who was forced out of Germany because of his brainwashing experiments; the same Lewin who planne d the Strategic Bombing Survey; Reese's number one theore tician. All that Isaacson did was to spell out the Aquarian blueprint in a more readable, detailed manner than the Stanfo rd-Willis Harmon Aquarian study. In 1981, seven years later, Isaacson's ideas (Tavistock's Aquarian blueprint) w ere presented to the public by Joel Gallo, editor of th e Washington Post, and the mouthpiece of Britain's Ho use of Windsor and the Club of Rome. Gallo called his pres entation, The Nine Nations of North America. Gallo's version of Tavistock's blueprint for a future America envisage d: * The death of the steel industry and a decline of industry in the industrial Northeast and the founding of the \"N ation of the North East.\""},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"209 * Dixie, the Emerging Nation of the South. * Etopia, consisting of the coastal fringes of the Northwest Pacific.

In all these latter areas there would be nothing in the way of large cities, conflicting with \"ecotopia\". Just to make sure that everybody understood that they knew what he wa s talking about, Gallo presented a map with his book. The problem is that the American people did not take Ga llo seriously. It was precisely the way Tavistock expec ted them to react in what it called a \"perfect maladaptive r esponse.\" The American right wing grew up on the Rockefeller, Warburgs, Freemasonry, the Illuminati, Council on F oreign Relations, the Federal Reserve conspiracy, and the Trilateral Commission.

The following is a list of Tavist ock brainwashing institutions in the United States, whi ch were noted in my monographs published in 1969: * Stanford Research Center. Employs 4,300 people and has an annual budget in excess of $200 million. * MIT/Sloane. Employs 5000 people and has an annual budget of $20 million. * University of Pennsylvania Wharton School.

Hopefully, this work will become a training manual in the hands of millions of Americans, who want to engage the enemy, but who have, hitherto, not been able to ide ntify that enemy.

No one who is interested in the future of America c an afford to ignore the manner in which Tavistock Institute h as whipsawed the American people and manipulated government, even as the majority of Americans remai n in ignorance of what is transpiring. With the almost c omplete control exercised over our nation by our upper-leve l, parallel, secret government, America has ceased to be a free and independent nation.

It has also been instrumental in advising key membe rs of the legislature that they have no further need for the U.S. Constitution, hence the mass of new laws enacted th at are not laws at all, since they do not meet the test of con stitutionality and fall to the ground. Tavistock remains the mother of all research facili ties in America and Britain, and the leader in behavior mod ification techniques, mind control and opinion making and sha ping. The Rand Institute at Santa Monica under the direct ion of Tavistock created the phenomena known as \"El Nino\" as a weather modification experiment. Tavistock is also heavily engaged in the New Age \"UFO\" experiments and sighti ng of aliens, under its mind control contracts with the C .I.A.

Rand and Tavistoc k successfully profiled the white population of South Africa as a preliminary to testing the waters for a Communist African National Congress takeover, assisted and strongly s upported by the U.S. State Department. \"Bishop\" Desmond Tutu , who played a leading role in the preamble to the fall o f the white government, is a creation of Tavistock."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"215 Georgetown University was taken over in its entiret y by Tavistock, back in 1938. Its structure and programs were reformatted to suit the Tavistock \"brain trust\" blu eprint as a center for higher learning. This has had great sign ificance for the United States when we consider that Georgetown University was where Mr. Clinton learned his art of mass manipulation and dissembling. All State Department field agents are trained at Ge orgetown. Three of its best-known graduates were Henry Kissin ger, William Jefferson Clinton and Richard Armitage. Georgetown's \"invisible army\" loyalists have done u ntold harm to the United States and will no doubt play th eir roles to the full until the end, a time when they will be up rooted, exposed and rendered harmless. Some of the ugliest and most horrifying actions tak en against America were planned at Tavistock. I am referring t o the bombing of the Marine compound at Beirut Airport, w hich took the lives of 200 of our finest young serviceme n. One person believed to have been aware of the impending attack by Lebanese terrorists, was Secretary of State Geor ge Schultz. As unconfirmed reports stated at the time, Schultz was tipped off in advance of the attack by the Moss ad, Israel's secret service agency. If Schultz did receive such a timely warning, he ne ver relayed it to the Marine base commander at Beirut. Schultz was, and still is, a loyal servant of the Committee of 300 t hrough the Bechtel Corporation. However, one year after I expressed my suspicions a bout Schultz and Bechtel (1989), a disaffected high-rank ing Mossad agent broke ranks and wrote a book on his experiences."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"216 Parts of the book included the very same informatio n I had printed a year earlier, which has led me to believe that the suspicions I voiced about Schultz in 1989, were not altogether without substance. The whole episode rem inds me of the treachery of Gen. Marshall, who deliberately kept information about a pending Japanese air attack aga inst Pearl Harbor from the commander at Hawaii. There is mounting evidence about an increase in the input and influence Tavistock is having at the CIA. There are great many other intelligence agencies receiving instruct ions from Tavistock, notably the National Reconnaissance Offi ce (NRO), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DJA), the T reasury Intelligence, and State Department Intelligence. Every year when the anniversary of the murder of Pr esident John Kennedy comes around I am reminded of the lead ing role played in the planning of his public execution ; particularly the part played by MI6. After a 20-yea r in-depth investigation into the murder of JFK, I think I hav e come very close to the truth, as detailed in the monogra ph \"The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \" The unsolved murder of Pres. Kennedy remains a gros s insult against everything the United States stands for. Ho w is it that we, a supposedly free and sovereign nation, allow t he cover up of a crime to remain in place, year after year? Surely our intelligence agencies know who the perpetrators of the crime are? Surely we know that the murder of Kennedy was carried out in broad daylight in front of millions of Ameri cans, as an insult, and a warning that the reach of the Committ ee of 300 goes far beyond what even our highest elected offic ial was able to defend himself against?"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"217 The perpetrators of the crime laugh at our confusio n secure in the knowledge that they will never be brought to ju stice, and glorifying in the success of the foul deed and the inability of We, the People, to pierce the corporate veil that h ides their faces from view. The massive cover-up of the Kennedy assassination r emains in place. We have full details of how the House Assassinations Committee failed to do its duty, ign oring strong evidence and latching onto flimsy here-say; ignoring the plain fact that the X-rays of Kennedy's head, t aken at Bethesda Hospital, were tampered with. The list of the sins of the Committee of 300 and it s servant, the Tavistock Institute is endless. Why did the Senate committee make no effort to investigate the strange disappear ance of Kennedy's death certificate; a vital piece of evide nce, which should have been found, no matter how long it took and no matter what the cost? Nor was Admiral Burkely, the naval officer who signed the certificate, seriously quest ioned about the circumstances surrounding the strange—very stra nge— unexplained disappearance of this vital piece of ev idence. Here I must leave the subject of the murder of John F. Kennedy (which in my opinion was a Tavistock -relat ed project) carried out by MI6 and the FBI Five Divisi on head, Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield. The CIA is a clien t of Tavistock's along with literally scores of other U. S. Government agencies. In the decades that have passe d since the murder, not one single one of these agencies ha s ceased to do business with Tavistock. In fact, - Tavistock ha s added many new names of government agencies to its client list."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"218 In looking through my documents, I discovered that in 1921 when Reese founded Tavistock, he was under the cont rol of British intelligence SIS. Thus from its inception, Tavistock has always been closely associated with intelligence work, even as it is to this very day. The case of Rudolph Hess may be of more than p assing interest to not a few of our readers. It will be re called that Hess was murdered by two SIS operatives in his Span dau prison cell, the night before he was to be released . The RIIA was afraid that Hess would blow the lid of f what had been kept a dark secret; the close relationship between members of the British oligarchy—including Winston Churchill—and the German Thule Society, of which He ss had been the leader. Of more than a passing interest is the fact, that t he Tavistock Institute was named after the 11 th Duke of Bedford, the Marquise of Tavistock. The title was passed on to h is son, the 12 th Marquise of Bedford. It was to his estate that Hes s flew in an attempt to end the war. But Churchill would h ave none of it and ordered Hess to be arrested and imprisone d. The Duke of Bedford's wife committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills, when it became apparent that Hess would never be released, even when the war ended. In my work \"Who Murdered Rudolph Hess\" and \"King Makers, King Breakers—The Cecils\", I reveal just ho w close was this virtual kinship with Hess and other import ant members of Hitler's inner-circle right up to the st art of WWII. Had Hess succeeded in his mission to the Duke of Be dford, Churchill and almost the entire British oligarchy w ould have been revealed as frauds."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"219 The same thing would have happened had Hess not bee n kept a solitary prisoner at Spandau in Berlin, guarded f or years after the end of WWII by troops drawn from Britain, the United States and the USSR, against all logic and a t a tremendous cost (estimated at $50,000 a day). Because a changed Russia felt they could embarrass America and Britain—especially Britain, they suddenly annou nced Hess would be released. The British could not affor d to run the risk of having their wartime leaders exposed, s o the order was given to kill Hess. Tavistock provides services of a sinister nature to those people we find all across the United States, in eve ry city of note. They have the leading personalities of those cities in the palm of their hand, whether it is in the police dep artment, city government or any other authority. This is the case in every city also, where the Illu minati and Freemasons join with Tavistock in exercising their secret powers to walk all over the Constitution and the Bi ll of Rights. One can only wonder just how many innocent people a re in prison today because they were not knowledgeable ab out their Constitution and the Bill of Rights; victims of Tavistock, one and all. Pay close attention to the television series, \"COPS.\" It is standard Tavistock mind control and opinion m aking fare. In it you find every possible violation of th e constitutional rights of persons stopped, and or ar rested by the police. It is my firm opinion and belief that \"COPS \" is meant to condition the public and make us believe that su ch gross violations of rights we witness is the norm; that t he police actually have such excessive powers, and that"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"220 constitutional safeguards to which every citizen is entitled, do not exist in practice. \"COPS\" is a most insidious brainwashing, opinion-making controlling program, a nd it would not be at all surprising to find Tavistock mi xed up in it, somewhere."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"221 CHAPTER 33 Interpol in the U.S.: Its origin and purpose exposed Among the many international agencies Tavistock ser ves, is David Rockefeller's private intelligence service, b etter known as INTERPOL. It is in total dereliction of its lega l duty that this illegal entity is allowed to go on functioning on Federal property in Washington, D.C. and under government protection. (U.S. law forbids private foreign polic e agencies from operating in America. INTERPOL is a private fo reign police agency operating on U.S. soil while Congress looks the other way, fearful that one day they might be force d to grasp this noxious nettle, and pull it up by the roots.) What is INTERPOL? The U.S. Justice Department tries to explain INTERPOL by sidestepping crucial issues. According to its 1988 manual, \"Interpol conducts intergovernmental activities, but is not based on a n international treaty, convention, or similar legal documents. It was founded upon a constitution drawn up and writte n by a group of police officers who did not submit it for diplomatic signatures, nor have they ever submitted it for rat ification by governments.\" How interesting! What an admission! If Interpol doe s not trample the U.S. Constitution, then nothing does. W here are watchdogs of the House and Senate? Is it that they are afraid of Tavistock and its powerful backer, David Rockefe ller? Is the Congress afraid of the Committee of 300?\" It ce rtainly seems that way. Interpol is an illegal entity opera ting within the borders of the United States, without the sanct ion and approval of We, the People in flagrant violation of the Constitution of the United States and the constitut ions of the 50 States."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"222 Its membership consist of individuals appointed by various national governments without any consultation with the government of the United States.

According to Beverly Sweatman of the U.S. Departmen t of Justice National Central Bureau (NCB), (whose exist ence is itself a violation of the Constitution), this U.S. Government agency exists solely to exchange information with I nterpol. Owned and controlled by David Rockefeller, Interpol is a private agency with a communications network stretc hing around the globe, heavily involved in one way or an other with the drug trade from Afghanistan to Pakistan to the United States. The interaction of Lt. Colonel Nivaldo Madrin of Pa nama, Gen. Guillermo Medina Sanchez of Colombia, and cert ain elements of Mexico's Federal police with Interpol s tatus, point in this direction. Their histories of involve ment with the drug trade while serving Interpol are too long to include here, but suffice to say that history is a sordid o ne. Yet, in spite of the fact that Interpol is a privat e organization, it was granted \"observer status\" by the United Nati ons (U.N.) in 1975, which stature (totally in violation of the U.N.

Accord ing to the U.N. Charter, only States (in the full definiti on of the word) can be members of the U.N. Since Interpol is not a state, why does the U.N. violate its Charter? It is believed that the U.N. is counting heavily on Interpol networks to help it find private arms in the hands of American citizens held by them under their Second Amendment rights, once the U.N. signs a \"treaty\" wi th the U.S. Government to disarm all civilian populations of member-states. Where are America's lawmakers who are supposed to u phold and defend the U.S. Constitution? Where are the gre at statesmen of yesteryear? Interpol demonstrates, tha t what we have in their place are politicians turned lawmaker s who do not enforce the laws they make, terrified to correc t the obvious mistakes that abound on every hand, because, if the were to uphold their oath of office, they would more than l ikely find themselves without their cushy cozy job. To recap on some of the information already provide d: Tavistock Institute was established in Sussex, Engl and, in 1921 by command of the British monarchy, for the pu rposes of mind control and public opinion making, and to e stablish on a carefully-examined scientific basis, at what p oint the human mind would break down under subjection to prolonged bouts of psychological distress. Elsewher e we shall show that it was first founded in pre-WWI times by the 11 th Duke of Bedford, the Marquise of Tavistock. In the early 1930s, the Rockefeller Brothers Founda tion Fund also contributed heavily to Tavistock."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"224 The fact that so many of the chief practitioners of mind control and behavioral modifications were, and are, closely associated with the secret societies that embrace c ults of many different ideas and beliefs, notably Isis-Orsi ris, Kabala, Sufi, Cathari, Bogomil and Bahai (Manichean) mystic ism should be noted. For the uninitiated, the very idea that prestigious institutions, and their scientists would be involved in cults and even with Satanism and Illuminists would be a very difficult thing to believe. But the connection is very real. We can se e just why Tavistock was so interested in these subjects. Random school shootings by young people subjected t o prolonged bouts of stress, and under the influence of habit- forming drugs, are remarkable in that in a large nu mber of these tragic happenings, the perpetrators nearly al ways claim that they were directed \"by voices\" to do their dea dly work. There can be no doubt that mind control was very mu ch at work in these tragic instances. Unfortunately, we s hall see many more such tragic episodes before the public re alizes what is going on. Cultism, mind control, psychological stress applica tion and behavioral modifications are very much a part of wh at is taught by Tavistock's scientists. In fact, alarmed by leaks showing its connection with Tavistock scientists, t he British House of Commons passed a law making it legal for p laces like Tavistock to conduct what the bill called, \"ph ysical research.\" Now, the term, \"physical research\" is so ambiguous as to give rise to serious doubts about what it truly mea ns, or whether, as some critics contended, is merely a ter m used to cover what really goes on."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"225 In any event, Tavistock was not about to take the p ublic into its confidence. But I can say with absolute certain ty that British intelligence MI6 and CIA operatives receive training at Tavistock in metaphysics, mind control, behavior modifications, ESP, hypnotism, the occult, Satanism and Illuminists and the Manichean cults. These are not just beliefs based on relics from the Middle- Ages. This is evil force being taught in a way that will make a difference to the level of mind control, such as would not have been thought possible a few short years ago. I will make this prediction without fear of contradiction: In l ater years we are going to discover that all of the random shooti ngs at schools, post offices, shopping malls, were not ran dom shootings at all. They were carried out by conditio ned, mind- controlled subjects who were carefully sought out a nd put on dangerous, mood-altering drugs like Prozac, AZT and Ritalin. The common denominator between several of the rando m shootings, starting with David Berkowitz, the so-ca lled \"Son of Sam\" murderer; all without exception, told inves tigators that they \"heard voices\" telling them to shoot peop le. The case of Klip Kinkel, the Oregon youth who shot his mother and father, before shooting up his high scho ol is his confession to investigators who interviewed him. As ked why he shot his father and his mother, Kinkel replied t hat he heard \"voices\" telling him to shoot them. Nobody will eve r be able to prove that Kinkel and the others were victims of mind control experiments carried out by the CIA or that they did indeed \"hear voices\" induced by through transferenc e carried out by DARPA computer programmers."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"226 The responsible House Oversight Committee must call for the CIA's documents covering mind control and search th em for a connection with the school shootings. I believe i t is imperative that such an order be sent out to the CI A without any further loss of time. Apart from my own research into the subject of \"phy sical research,\" Victor Marachetti, who was with the CIA for 14 years, revealed the existence of a Tavistock-design ed physical research program, where CIA operatives tri ed to contact the spirits of former agents who had died. As I said in my above mentioned monograph, I have had a great de al of personal experience in the \"metaphysical\" realms an d know for a fact, that a large number of British and Amer ican intelligence agents are indoctrinated in it. Tavistock calls it \"behavioral science,\" and it has advanced so rapidly in the last ten years that it has become on e of the most important types of training agents can undergo. In Tavistock's ESP programs, each participant is a \"volunteer\", wh o agrees to have his personality \"correlated\" with ESP; that is to say, they have agreed to help Tavistock find an answer a s to why certain people are psychic and others are gifted wi th ESP. The object of the exercise is to make each and ever y MI6 and CIA agent highly psychic with sharply developed ESP . Because a number of years have passed since I was d irectly involved in such matters, I consulted a colleague w ho is still in the \"service\", to find out how successful Tavist ock has been with its experiments? He told me that Tavistoc k has indeed perfected its techniques and that it was now possible to make selected MI6 and CIA operatives \"ESP-Perfec t.\" Here it is necessary to explain that the CIA and MI 6 maintain a very high degree of secrecy about such matters."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"227 The majority of intelligence agents who are in the programs are for the most part members of the Illuminati and or Freemasonry, or both. In short, the \"long range pen etration\" technique applied with such success to the normal w orld is now being applied to the spirit world! Tavistock's \"Long Range Penetration and Inner Direc tional Conditioning\", developed by Dr. Kurt Lewin, whom we have already met a few times, is primarily a program whe re thought control is practiced on mass groups. What gave rise to the program was the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau's all-pervasive use of propaganda in WWI. Th e extensive propaganda it ran was intended to convinc e the British workingman that war was necessary. Another part of it was to convince the British public that Germany was an enemy, and its leader a veritable demon. This massive effort had to be launched between 1912 and 1914 because the British working class did not beli eve that Germany wanted war, anymore than the British people wanted it, and did not even dislike the Germans. Al l that public perception had to be changed. A secondary, t hough no less important task for the bureau was to get Ameri ca into the war. A key element in that plan was to provoke Germ any into sinking the \"Lusitania\" a large trans-Atlantic line r built along the lines of the doomed Titanic. In spite of warnings in press advertisements in a N ew York newspaper that the ship had been converted into an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC) and was therefore fair game in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, the Lusitan ia sailed for Liverpool carrying a full compliment of passengers, among them many hundreds of American passengers."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"228 The ship's holds were packed with a large complimen t of munitions destined for the British Army, forbidden under international the rules of war to be carried by pas senger liners. At the time it was hit by a single torpedo, the Lus itania was essentially an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC). The pr ess on both sides of the Atlantic was filled with accounts of German barbarity and unprovoked attack on a defenseless pa ssenger liner, But the American and British public who stil l needed a lot more \"conditioning\" did not buy the story. They felt there was \"something rotten in the State of Denmark.\" The sinking of the Lusitania with heavy loss of life was the ty pe of \"contrived situation\" that President Wilson needed and it inflamed American public opinion against Germany. Profiting from this experience, the British Army Bu reau of Psychological Warfare set up the Tavistock Institut e for Human Relations on the orders of the British monarc hy and placed British newspaper magnate, Alfred Harmsworth , the son of a barrister born in Chapelizod near Dublin. He w as later awarded the title the 12 th Duke of Bedford, Lord Northcliffe. In 1897, as a run-up to the war that was coming, Ha rmsworth sent one of his writers by the name of G.W. Steeven s to Germany for the purpose of writing a serialized six teen part article entitled Under the Iron Heel. In true reverse psychology the articles were lavish in their praise of the German Army while in the same breath warning that the British nation would be defeated if war br oke out against Germany."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"229 In 1909, Northcliffe commissioned Robert Blatchford , a senior Socialist to go to Germany and write article s about what a danger the German Army posed to Britain. Blatchford's theme was that he believed from his observations that Germany was \"deliberately prepari ng to destroy the British Empire.\" It was in line with No rthcliffe's prediction published in the Daily Mail (one of his newspapers) in 1900 that there would be war between Germany and Britain. Northcliffe wrote an editorial saying that Britain needed to use a greater part of its bu dget for defense spending. When the war broke out, Northcliffe was accused by the editor of The Star newspaper of having propagated a climate of war. \"Next to the Kaiser, Lord Northcliffe has d one more than any living man to bring about the war.\" The poor editor did not know that he himself had be come a victim of propaganda, as the Kaiser had done little to promote war and was looked upon with some disdain b y the British military establishment. Historians are in g eneral agreement that the Kaiser was in no position to con trol the Germany Army. It was General Ludendorff to who The Star should have referred. It was Northcliffe, who began agitating for conscription from the very day that war broke o ut between the two nations. This was to be an institution where every aspect of mass brainwashing and public conditioning would be broug ht to a fine art.

This was a Tavistock conspiracy against bot h nations. In order to foster such an attack, Secreta ry of State Marshall refused to meet with Japan's envoys seekin g to head off the coming conflict. Marshall also deliberately delayed warning his comm ander at Pearl Harbor until after the attack had begun. In s hort, Roosevelt and Marshall both knew about the pending attack, but deliberately ordered the information to be with held from their officers on the ground at Pearl Harbor. Tavis tock had told Roosevelt that \"only a major incident\" would g et America into WWII. Stimson, Knox and Roosevelt knew about the impending attack, but did nothing to stop it.

Bulwer Lytton wrote \"The Secrets of the Egyptian Bo ok of the Dead\", and so many of Annie Besant's adherents of the Theosophist Society came from British upper classes , which even today is popular with them. The descendants of the Catharists and Albigensians of Southern France and Northern Italy had migrated to England and adopted the name \"Savoyard.\" Before them came the Bogomils of the Ba lkans and Pelicans of Asia Minor. All these sects had ori ginated from the Babylonian Manicheans. Inroads were made into this type of occultism by th e Tavistock Institute, using some of its mind control techniques developed by Kurt Lewin and his team of researchers . (See \"The Committee of 300\" for details.) The East India Company (EIC) and later, the British East India Company (BEIC) was the original \"300,\" whose descendants rule the world today. Opium and the dru g trade was the stock in trade then, and remained so. From this highly organized, complex structure, grew Socialism , Marxism, Communism and National Socialism and Fasci sm. Beginning in 1914, extensive mind control experimen ts were carried out at Cold Spring Harbor in New York, the race- eugenics center sponsored by Mrs. E.E, Harriman, mo ther of Averill Harriman, governor of New York State at the time, who became a prominent public and political figure in the U.S. and Europe."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"234 The grand lady poured millions of dollars of her mo ney into the project and invited German scientists to share the forum.

German scientists were invited to attend Cold Harbo r indoctrinations by Mrs. Harriman and her group, com prised of some of the leading citizens of the period (1915). After a year or two at Cold Spring Harbor, the German contingent returned to Germany, and under Hitler, put race eugenics lea rned at Cold Spring Harbor, into practice.

Tavistock mind conditioning techniques have been consistently in use in the United States by some of the highest and most important political figures in our history, beginning with Woodrow Wilson and continuing with P res. Roosevelt. Every U.S. President after Roosevelt has been under the control of the \"300\" and the Tavistock In stitute. Roosevelt was a typical mind-controlled programmed subject trained in Tavistock methodology. He would talk pea ce while preparing for war. He seized powers he was not enti tled to under the U.S. Constitution, citing the illegal act ions of President Wilson as his authority, and then explain ed away his actions through \"fireside chats,\" which"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"235 was a Tavistock idea to deceive the American people . Like another Tavistock robot, James Earl Carter, and Pre s.

This was unlike Roosevelt, who knew full well when he was doing wrong, but who nevertheless, reli shed his task and carried out his Tavistock-British royal fa mily mandate with gusto, and with total disregard for hu man life, as is common to all cultists. When Pres. Bush, the elder, ordered invasion of Pan ama, it was a blatantly unconstitutional action at the cost of the lives of 7,000 Panamanians over which Mr. Bush never lost any sleep, nor did he blink an eye over the death of 15 0.000 Iraqi soldiers in the undeclared (illegal) war against Ir aq that was to follow his \"trial run\" to gauge public opinion. Carter was no stranger to the occult; one of his si sters was a leading witch in America. Carter believed that he w as a \"born again Christian,\" even though his entire political career was shot through with Socialist and Communist ideals an d principles, which he never hesitated to put into pr actice. Carter is a true split personality product of Tavis tock. This was noted by Hugh Sidey, a well-known columnist for mainstream media who wrote in July of 1979: \"The Ji mmy Carter now at work behind the closed doors of the W hite House is not the Jimmy Carter we grew to know in th e first 30 days of his presidency.\" Carter, programmed by Tavistock graduate Dr. Peter Bourne, had been through the hands of another Tavistock psychologist, Admiral Hymen Rickover, during Carter 's stint at Annapolis."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"236 Carter was pre-selected by the Rothschilds as being admirably suitable for special training, and one wh o would be \"adaptable to changing circumstances\", willing t o depart from principles.

Dulles blatantly li ed to a U.S. Senate Committee during the United Nations (UN) hea rings, brazenly testifying under oath about the constituti onality of the U.S. belonging to this world body. Dulles dazzled and deceived the senators as to the constitutionality of the U.S. joining the U.N. and swayed enough senators to vote in favor if the so-called t reaty, which is not a treaty, but an ambiguous agreement. The U.S. Constitution does not recognize \"agreement s\", only treaties signed by the nations concerned.

George Herbert Walker Bush is another \"product trai ned\" certified graduate of Tavistock's mind control syst em. The actions of this 33 rd Degree Mason, in Panama and Iraq, speak volumes.

But notwithstanding the lack of empowerment, Bush repeated his gross violat ions of the U.S. Constitution in ordering the U.S. Armed fo rces to invade Iraq, again without a the mandated declarati on of war and in excess of his powers. The \"inner conditioned \" American public, the shell-shocked victims of Tavis tock's war on them, did not turn a hair as they watched th e Constitution being ripped to shreds.

While Attorney General Reno and Clinton carried out the actual policy of destruction for which Koresh was s lated, George Bush played a leading role in the ghastly ta bleaux in which Koresh and 87 of his followers died. Although it is not generally known, Tavistock had a hand in the planning and might even have directed the onsla ught by the FBI and the ATF on Koresh and the Davidians. Ta vistock was represented by units of the British SAS who had been involved in training the ATF and the FBI on how to destroy Koresh and his followers and burn their church to t he ground. Waco was unholy black arts Satanism in action, no m ore and no less.

The State of Texas did not step in and stop the violation of the 10 th Amendment that was in progress at Waco as it was the Governor's duty to d o under the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution of the S tate of Texas. Tavistock had come a long way since Ramsey McDonald was sent to the United States in 1895 to \"spy out t he land for Socialism.\" Ramsey reported back to the Fabians tha t for the U.S. to become a Socialist state, the State and Fed eral constitutions (in that order) had to be destroyed; Waco was the embodiment of that goal. John Marshall, the Third Chief Justice of the Unite d States, and the Lopez case decided by the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals, for once and for all made it clear that Fe deral Agents had no jurisdiction inside the borders of th e States except where counterfeiting of U.S. dollars was bei ng investigated. This in itself is an oxymoron, as so- called \"U.S. dollars\" are not U.S. dollars, but \"Federal Reserve Notes\"- not the currency of the United States—but the notes of a privately-owned non-governmental central bank. Why protect fraud, even if it is being perpetrated by the U.S. Government? When the Constitution was written, the Founding Fathers felt that their denial of a centra l bank would prevent any bogus operation like the Federal Reserve coming into being.

Just as the British lower and middle classes were i nflamed against Germany at the commencement of WWI, through propaganda lies that the Kaiser had ordered his sol diers to cut off the arms of little children when they invaded B elgium and Holland, just so Tavistock programmed Americans to hate Koresh. Tavistock's blast of lies about Koresh went out ove r the airwaves, day and night: Koresh was having sex with very young children in the \"compound.\" His church, a sim ple wooden structure, was labeled a \"compound\" by the m ind controllers at Tavistock. Another of Tavistock's gr oss lies was that the Davidians were running an amphetamine lab in the \"compound\". \"Compound\" became the Tavistock-coined buzzword. That Clinton gave the go-ahead to have the Davidian s, gassed, shot at, subjected to devilish music night and day, and finally, burnt alive, is not surprising. Throug h the late Pamela Harriman Mr. Clinton was introduced to Tavis tock and passed its mind control indoctrination initiati on, during his stay at Oxford.

These are, generally spea king, planted in right wing circles, where they grow and spread like wildfire. Tavistock has long known that the right w ing is a fertile breeding ground for rumors to grow and be s pread. In my experience, hardly a day passes that I am not asked to confirm some rumor or another, usually by people wh o should know better. The clever strategy of spreadin g disinformation through rumor has a double benefit: 1) It gives a semblance of credence to stories planted on conservatives. 2) By the time the information is proved to be false, the disinformation has tainted its purveyors to the ext ent where they may safely be described as \"crackpots\", \"the p aranoid fringe of the conservatives\", \"extremists\" and a wh ole lot worse.

The grisly spectacle of the public execution of Ken nedy was a message to the American people; one which they ma y not, even now, be aware of.

The foregoing information should give you, the read er, and some idea of the immense power this giant industry wields over our daily lives; how it is shaping the minds o f the youth of America.

The information I have provided should sh ake you to your very foundations when you come to the reali zation that Tavistock controls what \"news\" we see, what \"h ome movies\" and television network movies we are allowe d to see; what music we listen to. Behind this gigantic enterprise stands the Tavistoc k Institute for Human Relations. As I have clearly demonstrated , America is marching in lock-step with the gigantic movie- music industry; hitherto unknown forces— powerful f orces whose sole aim and object is to pervert, twist and distort the minds of our youth, to make it all the easier for t he Committee of 300 to usher in the Socialist New Worl d Order - One World Government, in which the new Communists rule of the world."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"253 The information I have put before you should be a s ource of great alarm as you contemplate the future of your c hildren and the youth of America, having come to the knowle dge and understanding that they are being fed a diet of ana rchistic ideas, revolutionary fervor, and incitement to take drugs, free sex, abortion, lesbianism and homosexual acceptance . Without this giant music and entertainment industry , Michael Jackson would only have been the puerile, insipid n onentity, but he was \"puffed\" and Tavistock told the youth of our land just how great he is, and how much they, - the yout h of the Western world love him! It also has to do with the power to control the media. Inasmuch as the music and entertainment industry is what I call an \"open secret\" designed by Tavistock, I do n ot expect my work on this vital subject to be accepted as the whole truth, at least up to the year 2015, which is the y ear I anticipate the outbreak of \"Armageddon\" the all-out nuclear- CAB war, when the full wrath of God will fall on th e United States of America. But with regard to massive media control it is not difficult for even the untrained observer to see, hear and read that indeed, the U.S. has a controlled med ia, the product of the Tavistock Institute. This factor is what got President Bush elected, and then, to the astonishme nt of all of Europe and at least half of the American voters, sa w him elected for a second term in spite of his deplorabl e record.

This was confirmed by a joint survey in 2004 carrie d out by the Center on Policy Studies, the Center on Policy Attitudes, the Program on International Policy Attitudes, and the Center for International and Security Studies. What they f ound is really the key to why Bush is still in the White Ho use, and a tribute to the power of professional propaganda: * 75 percent of the Bush faithful were not convince d by the President Commission's finding that Iraq had no thing to do with Al Qaeda. * The majority of Bush supporters believed that a g reater part of the Islamic world supported the U.S. in its inva sion of Iraq. This is totally at variance with the facts. Egypt, a Muslim state does not support the USA and the majority of Egypti ans want the U.S. out of Iraq.

But let there be no doubt that Tavistock, today, in 2005, is in full control of every aspect of life in America. Not one thing escapes its notice. In 2005 we are witness to the amazing influence and power of the Tavistock Institute and its upper-level masters , the Committee of 300 in the manner in which the United States is run by President George Bush and the acceptance of what Bush says and does without question or doubt. The reasons for these mistaken beliefs are not hard to find. The Bush administration told the American public ma ny times in 1994 that Iraq did have nuclear weapons re ady for use. Also passed off as truth were Bush administrat ion reports that President Hussein was supporting Al Qa eda units in Iraq and that Al Qaeda was responsible for the W orld Trade Center (WTC) attack, all of which was without foundation. Yet members of the Roaring Right Radio Network (RRRN) happily repeated these errors, notab ly Hannity and Combs and Fox News. Mr. Hannity obligin gly told his audience that the weapons had been moved t o Syria. He never offered a shred of evidence to support his statement.

Kurt Lewin Kurt Lewin's (1890-1947) work had a profound impact on social psychology and experiential learning, group dynamics and action research. Lewin was born on September 9, 1890 in the village of Mogilno in Prussia (now part of Pola nd). He was one of four children in a middle class Jewish f amily (his father owned a small general store and a farm). They moved to Berlin when he was fifteen and he was enrolled in the Gymnasium. In 1909 Kurt Lewin enter ed the University of Freiberg to study medicine. He then t ransferred to the University of Munich to study biology.

In 1921 Kurt Lewin joined t he Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin - where he gave seminars in both philosophy and psychology. He was starting to make a name for himself both in publish ing and teaching. His work became known in America and he w as invited to spend six months as a visiting professor at Stanford (1930). With the political position worsening consi derably in Germany in 1933 he and his wife and daughter left f or the United States. Thereafter he became involved at the Tavistock Inst itute in various applied research initiatives linked to the war effort (the Second World War.) These included influencing the morale of the fighting troops and psychological war fare. He was always a strong Socialist. He founded the Cente r for Group Dynamics at MIT. He was also engaged in a pro gram- the Commission of Community Interrelations in New Y ork. The \"T Groups\" for which Lewin had become known emerged from this program which was directed toward solving religious and racial prejudices.

Those ar e the credential of a \"court historian\" whose main purpos e is to protect the patriotic, political myths of his gover nment. Professor Fergusson, however has written an iconocl astic attack on one of the most venerable patriotic myths of the British, namely that of the First World War was a g reat and necessary war in which the British performed the no ble act of intervening to protect Belgian neutrality, Frenc h freedom, and the empires of both the French and British from the military aggression of the hated Hun. Politicians l ike Lloyd George and Churchill argued that the war was not on ly necessary, but inevitable. In this they were ably a ssisted by the propaganda factory at Wellington House, \"the ho use of lies\" as Toynbee called it. Ferguson asks and answers ten specific questions ab out the First World War, one of the most important being wh ether the war, with its total of ten million casualties, was worth it. Not only does he answer in the negative, but conclu des that the world war was not necessary or inevitable, but was instead the result of grossly erroneous decisions o f British political leaders based on an improper perception o f the \"threat\" to the British Empire posed by Germany.

British political leaders, Ferguson maintains, shou ld have realized that the Germans were mostly fearful of be ing surrounded the growing Russian industrial and milit ary might, as well as the large French army. He argues further, that the Kaiser would have honored his pledge to Lo ndon, offered on the eve of the war, to guarantee French and Belgium territorial integrity in exchange for Brita in's neutrality. Ferguson concludes that \"Britain's decision to inte rvene was the result of secret planning by her generals and d iplomats, which dated back to 1905\" and that it was based on a misreading of German intentions, \"which were imagin ed to be Napoleonic in scale.\" Political calculations als o played their part in bringing on war. Ferguson notes that Foreign Minister Edward Grey provided the leadership that p ut Britain on the bellicose path. Although a majority of the o ther ministers were hesitant. \"In the end they agreed to support Grey, partly for fear of being turned out of office and letting in the Tories.\" Such was the power of the lies and propaganda that flowed out of Wellington House, the forerunner of the Tavistoc k Institute of Human Relations.

Ferguson contends that in the absence of British in tervention, the most likely result would have been a quick Germ an victory with some territorial concessions in the ea st, but no Bolshevik Revolution. There would have been no Lenin - and no Hitler eith er. \"It was ultimately because of the war that both men wer e able to rise to establish barbaric despotisms which perpetr ated still more mass murder.\" Had the British stayed on the sidelines, Ferguson a rgues, their empire would still be strong and viable. He b elieves that the British could have easily coexisted with G ermany, with which it had good relations before the war. Bu t the British victory came at a price \"far in excess of t heir gains\" and \"undid the first golden age of economic 'global ization.'\" But ruthless anti-German propaganda turned those go od relations into enmity and hatred. World War I also led to a great loss of individual liberty. \"Wartime Britain ... became by stages a kind of pol ice state,\" Ferguson writes.

Tavistock predicts, as do philosophers and sociologists from Beaudrilliard to McLuhan, that th is simulation will soon be substituted for reality.
