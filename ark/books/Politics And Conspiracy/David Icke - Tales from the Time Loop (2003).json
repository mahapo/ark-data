That is especially important today with so many people urgently needing to understand where the world is being led, by whom, and to what end. I have structured the book to explore the various levels of the global conspiracy and the manipulation of our reality in this illusion I call the Matrix. Exposure of the Illuminati agenda has mostly focussed on the five-sense 'world', the names, dates, places, people level of the cosmic 'game'. You will find a lot of that in this book, especially with regard to the invasion of Iraq and the manufactured 'war on terrorism'. This information is important to know; but what is happening is far bigger than that. To understand the plot and deal with its five-sense expression we need to appreciate from what and from where it all emanates. I have, therefore, written the book in four sections to describe the distinct levels of manipulation and control mind how they connect with each other. The main emphasis is on the nature of reality - 4 and how we create it because this is the knowledge that will set us free. Once we know how the game works and how we are being manipulated to manifest our own prison, we can free ourselves from those chains of self-delusion. It has been essential to include information that readers of my other works will already be aware of. They may wish to skip those sections and concentrate only on the wealth of new information, but given the way everything fits into everything else it might be worth them reminding themselves of what they have read before to allow the relevance of the new revelations to be seen in its sharpest focus.

T. H. Huxley I said in my last book, Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster, that I was at the end of an era in my life and at the start of new one. I wrote: \"Changing reality from 'I can't' to 'I can', from 'small horizon' to 'no horizon', is where my journey takes me now. From exposing the conspiracy to thinking and feeling it out of existence. As the Morpheus character says in the movie, The Matrix: ”You have to let all go, Neo; fear, doubt, disbelief. Free your mind.'\" I have written some one and a half million words about the manipulation of the human race in this five-sense level of reality by a network of secret societies and groups controlled by unseen forces that place their puppets in political, economic, military and media power to advance an agenda for a centralised global fascist state. It is important that we know this information and continue to add to the knowledge of how we are imprisoned by our 'free world'. But there is more to know and do: much more. I knew that for me to take the story on and understand the even greater context in which this manipulation is unfolding, I would have to see into other dimensions of reality beyond the 'world' that we daily experience. This is exactly what happened to me in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil in 2003. What I learned from these journeys of the mind is the major focus of this book. Many of those who have been reading my work thus far will find some of this extremely challenging as we close in, still further, on the nature of the human condition and the force that seeks to control and imprison us in a manufactured illusion - 'the Matrix'. Born to be free What happened in the Amazon is the latest stage in a fantastic journey of discovery, or rediscovery, that I consciously began in 1990 when my life and perceptions were transformed by events that at one point threatened to destroy me., But all they were doing was setting me free from the delusions laid out to entrap us in this prison of the mind. I also realised that, while I only became consciously aware of a guiding force in 1989, the journey that I continue to travel began from the moment I was born, and in fact, as we measure 'time', long before. Many people ask me how I became involved in researching and exposing the global conspiracy. In this opening chapter I am going to summa rise the background to what happened to me. It is extremely relevant to my experiences in the Amazon and the way the information about the conspiracy has been presented to me day after day with such synchronicity since 1990. I was born in Leicester, England, at around 6.15pm on April 29th 1952. I grew up in what they call in Britain a 'working class' family. This is often another way of saying 'skint', and in our case it certainly was. My father was Beric, the product of the toughest of lives, and the biggest influence on me in those early years. He was extremely sharp intellectually, but his background of poverty and daily survival meant that he could never achieve his ambition to be a doctor. Only those with money had any chance of that and my father had to leave school to provide an income for his family after his own father did a runner and left them. These times left scars with him that he carried for the rest of his life and so did his experiences in the Great Depression of the 1930s when once he walked from London to Blackpool, a distance of some 200 miles, looking for work during the manufactured 'slump' in which unemployment soared while those responsible for it added massively to their wealth. He joined the Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and won the British Empire Medal for pulling airmen out of a blazing plane that crash-landed at the Chipping Warden Air Base in Oxfordshire in 1943. He also served in the Middle East and moved up through Italy as the fascists retreated. He was stunned to see Roman Catholic churches with untold wealth in places like Naples surrounded by unbelievable poverty while those in such dire need went on giving to their merciless religion. It made him vehemently anti-religion for the rest of his life, but unfortunately he also rejected any idea of life after 'death' because he equated that with the view of the religions he so despised. His Naples stories and many more that he told me, shaped my outlook on life from a very early age. Any expressions of unfairness, injustice and imposition have always pressed my buttons. From the start I was a rebel questioning the established order. My mother, Barbara, was the opposite of my father. He was dominating and wanted to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 2 control; she went quietly along doing whatever was necessary for her family. If you needed someone in a trench with you - she was among the first you should call. My earliest memory is sitting at an old battered table in a dark and dingy room. On the table was a bottle of sterilised milk, much used by the 'working class' of the 1950s because it lasted longer than the other sort. That memory has come flooding back whenever I have smelled the distinctive whiff of sterilised milk. The scene was in a tiny terraced slum of a house in Lead Street, just off Wharf Street, in the rundown centre of Leicester, an industrial city in the English East Midlands. I lived in Lead Street for the first three years or so of my life and the sterilised milk is all I can recall. My second memory is running for the bus when we moved to a big new council estate on the outskirts of Leicester and the house where my mother and younger brother, Paul, still live some 50 years on. It is right across the road from the Leicester General Hospital where I was born. Money was short, seriously short, throughout my childhood and I remember going with my mother around the back of the Gents clock factory on 'pay day' Thursdays, so my father could sneak out and hand over his wages to buy that night's dinner. Money in the bank? What's a bank?? As the old joke goes, until I was 14 I thought knives and forks were jewellery. On a number of occasions when there was a knock on the door my mother would tell me to hide under the window or behind a chair. There we would stay, still and quiet, until she gave the all clear. I had no idea what this was all about until later when I realised the knock was the council rent man coming to collect the money we didn't have and, when no. one answered, he would walk around the house looking in the windows. This happened many times and it's funny, I sometimes still get a knot in my stomach when there's a knock at the door. Throughout my childhood I always felt different, although I didn't know why. I felt there was something I was here to do, but what? I was a loner and I spent hours, day after day, playing by myself with little metal trains on the window-sill, lost f~\" my own world. My mother has often recalled how I was so shy that I would cross the street to avoid speaking to people I knew. All these years and many public professions later, I still prefer my own space and privacy and once a public event over I just want to get away and disappear from view. This has always been an apparent contradiction with me; in the public eye as a professional soccer player, national television presenter, politician and now author and challenger of conventional thought, yet all along I have been a person who dislikes 'limelight' and would prefer to be anonymous. This is not however, a contradiction, as I will explain later on. I have always been extremely sensitive emotionally, and from the earliest time I can remember I have been scanning the whole spectrum of human emotion, often flipping from one to another very quickly. Again there is a reason for this, I was later to understand. One thing I knew from childhood is that I was not going to be one of the crowd. I was going to be different and if I couldn't be different I didn't want to be here. I wasn't going to accept a future based on the fact that I was '.working class' and therefore destined for a factory or some low paid job doing what someone else told me to do. I am not knocking those who do that, far from it. Without such people all those things we buy in the shops, including food, would not be there and I think the wages paid in these essential and hugely undervalued jobs is a disgrace. Keep the streets clean and they pay you a pittance; play the casino in Wall Street or the City of London, gambling with the very survival of millions of people, and they pay you a fortune. So I am not demeaning those who work in factories and find themselves pawns in a dictatorial and unjust system; it is simply that I decided early in my life that this was not going to be for me. How I would escape from such a fate was not exactly clear, I just knew that I would. I failed the so-called Eleven-Plus exam that decided if my latter years at school would be in an elite grammar school (for the 'brightest and the best') or a secondary modem (for all the rest). I had no interest in school, it bored me rigid, and I only went because I had to and it allowed me to play for the soccer team. I rarely did more than average or less in exams, not least because I couldn't care less what grades I achieved. I really didn't give a damn about logarithms or algebra or binary systems or any of the other stuff they were telling me to absorb or believe. The only time I did well was one year at primary school when the teacher ridiculed and humiliated me in front of the class and said I was basically stupid. Immediately after this public put-down the teacher set a spelling test, hardly my best subject even to this day. But at the end of the lesson the poor guy had to somehow announce to the class that the child he had just ridiculed scored highest in the test. I can still hear him choking. That year I came top of the class in the annual exams, but with a point proven to myself and the miserable teacher I went back to snoring through the rest of my time in the appalling school system, which is not there to educate, but to indoctrinate. It is so splendidly captured in that superb song by Pink Floyd -,\"Hey teacher, leave those kids alone; all in all it's just another brick in the wall.\" I was not going to be in the wall. I would have jumped off it first. The soccer player Football, or soccer as they call it in the United States, was my salvation, my escape from the net that trawled the schools of 'working class' kids and poured them into the system's sausage machine. I was"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 3 spotted by a teacher at primary school playing in the kick-about soccer games in the playground. He asked me to go for a trial for the school team and if he hadn't asked I wouldn't have gone. The thought that David Icke would get in the team never occurred to me. I thought those things happened to others, not me. But I was picked and my self-confidence soared. I was about nine or ten and now I knew what my escape route would be. I was going to be a professional footballer. This would seem to have been a ridiculous ambition because the number of kids who make it to the professional game is an infinitesimal fraction of those who want to be footballers. But I was certain from the start that it was going to happen. I would spend hours every day with a football. My father would say on many occasions that I was never going to earn a living kicking a ball about and I should think about what I was really going to do when I left school. I didn't consider anything else, not once. I knew I was going to be a professional footballer and that was it. I was a goalkeeper, which suited my personality perfectly. Usually it's not easy finding kids who want to be goalkeepers because they all want to be outfield players scoring the goals. Often it was the lad who was the worst outfield player who got shoved in goal. But from the beginning I always wanted to be the goalkeeper. In many ways it is a loner position, a part of the team, yes, but with a very different role and different skills from the other players. That instinctively appealed to me and so did the responsibility of being the last line of defence. If outfield players make mistakes they still have you to get them out of trouble, but when a keeper makes an error it is invariably punished with a goal and recorded on the score sheet. I liked that sense of living on the edge with the difference between hero and villain so finely balanced. I went on playing for school teams, but by the time I was 13, just two years before I was to leave for the dreaded adult world, there was still no sign that I would be heading for a professional football club. Then, right on cue, a lucky break set me on my way. This has been such a feature of my life. Just when I have needed help to achieve something, bingo! There it is, often at a late hour when all seems lost. In those days if you wanted to attract the attention of the professional clubs you had to be playing for your town or city schools representative side, the best of all the schoolboy players in your area. The big clubs didn't bother looking below that level because they figured if you were not good enough to represent your city you would be of no interest to them. I was 13, a crucial time to impress the scouts looking for the best young talent, and I was nowhere near playing in the games they were watching. By now I was attending Crown Hills Secondary Modem school in Leicester and spending most of my time staring out of the classroom window daydreaming away the boredom of the curriculum, little of which ever registered. Then one day the sports teacher told me he was sending me for a trial for the Leicester schoolboys under-14 team, but I would be going as an outfield player. There was a highly-rated goalkeeper at the trial that was certain to be selected, h~\" said, and it wasn't worth me trying to compete with him. This was a lad who was already playing for the older under-IS Leicester team and so it was taken for granted that he would play for the younger side also. But 'fate', as usual in my life. was to intervene. I played outfield in the first trial game and was pretty hopeless. My heart was not in it because I only wanted to be a goalkeeper. I was asked to go and kick- around with other rejected boys while the second trial match was played. That's the end of that, I thought. Then I heard a shout from where the trial was continuing. \"Hey, can any of you lads play in goal?\" bellowed the team manager. \"Yes\", I shouted and I ran towards him as quickly as I could before anyone else could lay claim. One of the two goalkeepers had been injured and could not continue and when I took over I did so well that the manager asked me to come to the next trial a week later as a reserve goalkeeper to the one so highly rated. That day was to change my life. In the next trial game I played as well as I ever played in my entire career. The teams were seriously uneven and I was bombarded with shots from every angle. It was one of those days when if I had dived the wrong way the ball would have found the end of my foot and been deflected away. It was almost as if I could not let in a goal even if I tried. I was picked for the team above the lad everyone thought-was a certainty. The next year I played for the Leicester under-IS team and the professional clubs began to knock on my door. I signed for Coventry City, then in England's top division, and I left school to earn my living doing exactly what I wanted to do. I was a professional footballer, just as I knew I would always be. Awaking to a nightmare As it turned out, my football career was soon in trouble when I developed what they told me was rheumatoid arthritis at just 15 and a half. It started in the left knee and progressed to both knees and both ankles. In the years after my career ended, the pain and swelling went on to infiltrate my wrists, hands and all my fingers. For years I refused to bow to the doctors' verdict that I should stop playing. Staggeringly when I look back, I continued to play successfully for Coventry for four years despite the arthritis before I was told either to stop playing or to face life in a wheelchair. I was 19 when they gave me that verdict, but still determined to play on. I joined another club, Hereford United, and enjoyed a year of great success before the end came literally overnight. The arthritis was so bad in that final year that every daily training session was agony until the joints were warmed up. I would be limping at the start of each session and every day I would have some excuse to hide the common cause. It would be a blister or a stiff calf muscle or"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 4 something because I knew that if the club knew the real cause they would be looking for a new goalkeeper. The buzz and adrenalin would get me through the games and I was playing well, so no questions were asked. We won promotion to a higher division, I was playing in a professional league football team at just 20 and some bigger clubs were beginning to show an interest. Then one night I looked down at my knees before I got into bed and saw that the swelling in my left knee had disappeared for the first time since I was 15 was elated and thought to myself, \"Hey, I'm beating it.\" The following morning as I began to awaken in a half-sleep, I realised that I could not breathe. I tried for what seemed an age to take in air and I thought I was going to die. I tried to nudge my wife, Linda, lying beside me, but I was unable to move a single muscle. Suddenly I gasped a breath and, as my body came back to life, I realised that what seemed like every joint in my body was agony. I could not move on the bed, let alone walk and, although the pain and lack of mobility were to ease with the days, I was never to play football again. Media man I was just turned 21, an ex-professional footballer, virtually crippled at the time with arthritis, and, to my knowledge, with no other potential skill or profession to earn my living. Happy days. In such dire straights I did what anyone would do: I decided I was going to be a network television presenter. I was interviewed on a live TV programme about the ending of my soccer career and I loved the atmosphere and the whole~ deal. This is for me, I thought, and I set my target of presenting the BBC's Grandstand, then the biggest and best sports show on British television. This was apparently even more ludicrous than my ambitions to play soccer for a living. A least there were around a hundred goalkeepers in professional teams, but you could count the BBC sports presenters on one hand. So now this shy guy, who loves privacy and anonymity, wanted to be a national television anchorman. Bizarre on the face of it, but something just drove me on and, once again, I knew it was going to happen. I was told that the way to television news and sport would be by first working in newspapers and radio. There was an immediate problem, however. With no academic qualifications of any shape or form it was not going to be easy finding a paper to take me on. Having worked in the media and seen it from the outside I can safely confirm that academic qualifications are absolutely no measure of intelligence, but that's what the system demands because examination passes confirm that you have passed successfully through its indoctrination machine. Anyway, eventually I got a job, by 'coincidence' back in Leicester, on a weekly newspaper that was just about read by the people who wrote it. The paper was called the Leicester Advertiser and if its circulation had been human it would have been on a life support machine. I got the job because no one else wanted it. But soon I was moving on with doors opening and closing to perfection to speed me through to radio and then television. I worked as a news reporter and presenter with BBC regional and national news before, in 1982, becoming a nationally known anchorman with BBC Television. Sport, the very job I had targeted all those years earlier when I was told my soccer career was over. The day I first presented Grandstand I remember driving to the BBC in tears. It was nothing to do with fronting a TV show; it was achieving what I set out to do when my life and health were in tatters. My father used to say to me that you are never finished until you tell yourself you are finished, no matter what others may say. I would recall those words many times in the years to come. What he was saying, without knowing he was speaking a profound truth, is that we an. create our own reality. What we believe is what will manifest in our experience. Later I will discuss the simple process that allows this to happen. The 'politician' Soon after I had achieved my long-held ambition to work in television, the job lost its appeal. I found television to be a deeply insincere world full of insecure, often shallow and sometimes vicious people. Within a few years I wanted out. As someone once said to me, media people can get so confused they stab each other in the chest. There were, and are, many exceptions, but they are not usually in the positions of hire and fire because to make it that far you need to have no problem with trampling over others or licking arse, often both. I continued to work for the BBC, in body if not in spirit, for another eight years, but my real focus was now elsewhere. From childhood I had loved 'nature' and what has now been termed 'the environment'. I would ride for hours on my bike through the Leicestershire countryside enjoying the beauty and the solitude. As the 1980s progressed the protection of the environment became the centre of my life. I began an environmental pressure group on the Isle of Wight, just off England's south coast, where I have lived for more than 20 years. But I realised that no matter how good your arguments about an environmental issue the only thing that mattered was the number of hands in the air at the local council meetings w!1en the vote was taken. If you didn't have the majority supporting your case, its strength or validity was irrelevant. I also began to understand that often the councillors' decisions on which way to vote were being agreed at the local Freemasons' temple before the 'debate' in the council chamber had even been heard."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 5 I decided that the environment needed a voice on the council and my career, if you can call it that, in politics had begun. What happened next is another example of the way some unseen force has been weaving my life experience. I rejected all the major political parties because I didn't trust any of them. Instead, in 1988 I wrote to the little known UK Green Party, which made the protection of the environment the centre of its policies. They sent me some information that seemed to be sensible and I sent off my membership fee and began to organise public meetings to start a branch of the Greens on the Isle of Wight. Things began to move very fast. Within a couple of weeks I received a letter from the Green Party's regional organiser asking us to send a representative of the new Isle of Wight branch to their next meeting. I went along and at the end it was announced that their regional representative on the national party council was resigning and they needed nominations for his replacement. With no one wanting the job, I said I would do it and even so two people voted against me! I think they believed that being in television was 'ungreen'. Anyway, another two weeks later I turned up at my first national council meeting in a building near Regents Park in London and found it awash with naval contemplators who could talk for England while never reaching a conclusion. I could completely understand why the Green Party had been such a nonentity in British politics. Just before lunch the 'chairperson' said they were looking for party spokesmen and women, or 'Party Speakers' as ~ Greens called them, to represent the party in the media for the coming year, and nominations would be taken during the afternoon. During lunch I was approached by a guy who said he thought it would be good to have someone well known in the media to represent the party and would I be interested? I said, \"OK, I'll give 'it-a try.\" An hour or so later I was elected a National Speaker for the UK Green Party. I had been a member for a matter of weeks.\" My appointment coincided with a surge of interest in the environment, fuelled by a series of prime-time television programmes highlighting the plight of rainforests and the consequences of pollution. By the summer of 1989 this reached a peak of public concern and suddenly the UK Green Party was big news when we won 15 % of the national vote in elections to the European Parliament. Up to this point the party had rarely registered more than 1%. From empty press conferences and empty halls, the party, and its official speakers, were thrust onto the national news and into the political limelight. The Green Party had arrived, but, as it transpired, not for long. A battle ensued between those in the party who wanted to be true to its original beliefs (the 'fundis' or fundamentalists) and those who liked the success and were pressing to drop policies they believed were preventing even more support (the 'realos' or realists.) I was a 'fundi-realo' in that I wanted to stick with the values, but present them to the public in a much more effective way. I wrote a book called It Doesn't Have To Be Like This (Green Print, London, 1989) with this end in mind. But the infighting sickened me and more so when it became clear that while the Green Party claimed to be the 'new politics', it was just another \"version of the old politics with the same old methods, manipulations and reactions. The Green Party set out to challenge the system and ended up joining it. Many times it has been reported that I was \"sacked\" by the Green Party for what was now to unfold in my life, but the truth is that I never renewed my membership because the Greens were clearly not going to change anything. Ironically, another reason I distanced myself from the party in the months that followed was because some very strange things were happening to me and I knew that when I spoke about them publicly I was going to be in for some serious ridicule. I had reached the most pivotal point in my life and what I had experienced this far was going to be so important in what was to come. I had felt the emotional trauma of seeing my dreams of being a footballer shattered by arthritis. In pursuing a cure I had been introduced to the ancient Chinese healing art of acupuncture and that had opened me to an understanding that there is far more to the human being than just a physical body. Playing in such pain had triggered a determination to overcome adversity and to keep going, no matter what the challenges and the odds. Journalism had shown me how the media works and how much the 'news' is manipulated. I was able to see how the media is structured to confirm the official version of events and not to question or investigate this official reality. I could see that most journalists are some of the most uniformed, conditioned and imprisoned people you could ever meet. How can they report the world as it is when they have not got a clue how it is? Journalism also allowed me, through the demands of newspaper space, to develop the ability to write concisely and communicate to an audience spanning the whole spectrum of knowledge on the subjects in question. My television career presented insights into that medium's manipulations, techniques and often unbelievable shallowness, both on the screen and off. The national public profile it gave me also ensured that I would be widely reported when the time came for me to consciously awaken and see beyond the illusion. My time in the Green Party showed me politics from the inside and how it is a game of power not principle, no matter what the name on the door may be. I saw how many politicians who opposed and condemned each other in public 'debate' were very much closer in private. My life this far had given me all that I needed for what was to come. Wake up call "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 6 I began to be aware of strange happenings around me from the time I was writing my environmental book, It Doesn't Have To Be Like This, in 1989. I was writing very fast, often a chapter a day, and when I read it back each evening I would keep thinking to myself, \"Where did this come from?\" and \"I don't remember writing that line.\" It was like I was writing it all in a dream. At this same time I began to feel a presence around me. When I was in a room alone it felt as if someone else was there and this went on for months as I continued my work with the BBC. Eventually I was sitting on the side of the bed in a hotel room in London in early 1990 and the presence felt so strong that I said out loud: \"If you are there will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall.\" Soon afterwards events began to accelerate. In March 1990, I was playing soccer with my son Gareth, then aged eight, on the seafront at Ryde on the Isle of Wight and I said to him we would go for lunch at the railway station cafe nearby. The cafe was full and as we headed for an alternative someone recognised me from the television and began to ask me questions about soccer. When the conversation was over, I couldn't see Gareth, but I knew he would be in the newspaper shop at the station looking at books about steam trains in which we both have an interest. And so he was. I stood at the entrance to the shop and said to Gareth that we would go and find another cafe, but, as I turned to leave, my feet were stuck to the ground as if two magnets were anchoring them to the floor. It was a very weird feeling, almost as if, as I now understand, another reality had manifested around me. As I stood there, my feet fixed to the spot, I heard a very clear voice in my mind say: \"Go and look at the books on the far side.\" Shit, what was that? What the hell is going on here? I knew this news shop very well and the books in that 'far side' section were of no interest to me. They were invariably romantic fiction of the Barbara Cartland variety. But given what the voice said I went over to see what would happen, not least because that was the only direction my feet would move. I was immediately attracted to a book with a woman's face on the front. It was like this was the only book I could see, a feeling I have had endless times since. I turned it over to read the blurb and saw the word psychic. The author' was a professional psychic and 'hands on' healer and I thought at once of the presence I had been feeling around me for all these months. Would this lady be able to tell me what was going on? I read the book in 24 hours and contacted her to make an appointment. I said nothing about the presence, only that I had arthritis and I wanted to see if her healing could help. J was not going to say anything about what had been happening to me unless she pi2ked up the story psychically. Is anybody there? I only saw her four times and in the first two visits nothing happened of note, except that I talked with her about other dimensions or frequencies of existence and a much wider vision of life and Creation. I had always rejected religion and also the absurd idea pedalled by 'science' that we are all 'accidents' of 'evolution' who cease to exist at 'death'. Unbelievable rubbish, but that is largely still the claim of establishment 'science' despite the wealth of evidence and research, including that of open-minded real scientists, which demolishes such claptrap. Up to this point I had never really pondered on an alternative to this nonsense, but as I talked with the psychic I was immediately at one with what she was saying about the multidimensional nature of reality and the ability of one dimension to communicate with others. It was as if she was te1ling me that I already knew - which is exactly what she was doing. We all know this information, but we have been conditioned to forget who and what we really are because that suits the agenda of the manipulators. For those new to such ideas, some background is necessary. We don't live in a 'world' so much as a frequency range; the one that our five-senses can access and perceive and the five-sense range of perception is tiny. Creation is not structured like a chest of draws, one level on top of another. It is made up of frequencies sharing the same space in the same way that all the radio and television frequency do. Those broadcast frequencies are not just around your body at this moment, the) are sharing the same space. This is possible because they are operating on a different frequency range or wavelength to your body and each other. Only when the frequencies are really close do we get 'interference' and become aware of another station. Apart from that all are oblivious to each other's existence because they literally operate in different frequencies, different 'realities' or 'worlds'. When you tune your radio to a station, say Radio 1, that's what you get. You don't hear Radio 2, 3, or 4 because they are not broadcasting on the wavelength to which your radio is tuned. Move the dial from the frequency of Radio 1 to Radio 2 and now, obviously, you hear Radio 2. But Radio 1 did not cease to broadcast when you moved the dial from its wavelength. It goes on broadcasting - existing - while your focus, your consciousness, is tuned to something else. This is precisely the principle on which Creation operates, or at least the part that we are currently experiencing. The five-senses through which we see, hear, smell, touch and taste can perceive an infinitesimal fraction of that which exists in the space you think you are 'seeing' now. This is why animals, like cats, jump around reacting to what appears to us to be 'empty' space. To the cats, this space is not empty at all. They have a greater visual frequency range and they can see entities and scenes that are beyond the frequency limits of the human five-senses. When people say that everything is within you or, symbolically,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 7 the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, this is correct. All infinity is within us because all of infinity shares all space. The point is, however, that we can't see all of infinity with our five-senses\" just as you cannot hear all the radio stations available by tuning to one of them. W see only that tiny part of infinity that is vibrating to the frequency range of those senses - what we see, hear, touch, smell and taste. This is what I call the five-sense prison because most people are so trapped in its manufactured and manipulated illusions that they believe that this is all that exists and all that they are. It is their only reality. This is further ingrained and conditioned by the 'education' system, the media and 'science', all of which are dominated by the belief that the 'world' of the five-senses is basically all that there is. This is what the manipulators want us to believe for reasons I will explore in due course. When energy is vibrating slowly it appears to us to be 'dense' and 'solid', but look at it under a microscope and no matter how solid something seems to be it is still vibrating energy. As the speed of vibration increases the energy becomes less and less dense until it is vibrating so quickly that it leaves the frequency range of the five-senses and to human perception 'disappears'. It has not disappeared in fact; it has simply left the range that human senses can access. This is happening when people say they saw a ghost or a 'UFO' and it 'appeared' out of nowhere and then 'disappeared'. The conditioned five-sense reality thinks these people must be mad because such things are not possible. Oh, but they are the 'nowhere' from which such manifestations come and go is simply another frequency or wavelength of existence. Understanding all this is crucial to appreciating that the 'far out' world of the so-called 'paranormal' is perfectly and simply explainable. The longer this book goes on the simpler it will become. On the third visit to the psychic, I was lying on the couch during the healing session when I felt like a spider's web on my face. I had remembered reading in her ok that this can happen when 'spirits' are trying to make contact. Funnily enough I have never felt it since. I said nothing to her, but within ten to fifteen seconds she pushed her head back and said: \"This is powerful; I'll have to close my eyes for this one!\" She said she was seeing a Chinese-type figure in her mind, who said that \"Socrates is with me\". Socrates (469-399 BC) was the Greek philosopher and genius who's most famous pupil was Plato. At the age of 70, Socrates was charged by the authorities with heresy and corruption of local youth and he carried out the death sentence himself by drinking hemlock. Among a library of famous quotes, Socrates said, \"Wisdom is knowing how little we know.\" The 'Chinese figure' was only a projection from another dimension into the mind of the psychic to give her a familiar image to focus on. The communicator was consciousness from beyond the realm of the 'physical' body and can take any form it chooses. This is what we all are in our highest form, pure consciousness. The 'physical' body is only a vehicle for that consciousness to experience these dense 'five-sense' frequencies of existence. The other-dimensional communicator projects thought into a psychic's mind and he or she decodes that into human language. It is the same principle as the radio programmes that are broadcast from ~ transmitter in wave form and decoded into words by the radio. An Italian psychic will 'hear' the thought projections in Italian, an English one in English and so on. This is how the psychic reported some of what the 'Chinese' figure had to say to and about me: He is a healer who is here to heal the Earth and he will be world famous. He will face enormous opposition, but we will always be there to protect him. He is still a child spiritually, but he will be given the spiritual riches. Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will be our words. Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led to knowledge. He was chosen as a youngster for his courage. He has been tested and has passed all the tests. He was led into football learn discipline, but when that was learned it was time to move on. He also had to learn how to cope with disappointment, experience all the emotions and how to get up and get on with it. The spiritual way is tough and no one makes it easy. We know he wanted us to contact him, but the time wasn't right. He was led here to be contacted, not to be cured. But one day he will be completely cured. He will always have what he needs [this could have been \"wants\"], but no more. In the next session with the psychic the figure appeared to her again and these words were given to me: One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message that will change the world. Don't try to do it all alone. Go hand in hand with others, so you can pick each other up as you fall. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 8 He will write five books in three years. Politics is not for him. He is too spiritual. Politics is anti-spiritual and will make him very' unhappy. He will leave politics. He doesn't have to do anything. It will happen gradually over a year [exactly what happened.] There will be a different kind of flying machine, very different from the aircraft of today. Time will have no meaning. Where you want to be, you will be. I was a BBC television presenter introducing the sport and a national spokesman the Green Party. Yet here I was being told that I was a healer who was here to heal the Earth and that one man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message that will change the world. Ugh? Come again??? On one level it seemed so ridiculous, but something within me knew I had to go with this see where it led: What happened as a result of this unstoppable urge to walk path is that my life went through upheavals that were almost too much for my emotions to bear. But, all these years and so much pain later, what I was told would happen has either happened or is happening. The idea that I would write five books three years on subjects about which, at that time, I knew nothing seemed especially ridiculous. But I was to complete those books in three years to the very nth. When I told some of the Green Party leadership about these experiences, their reaction was just as closed-minded, ignorant and uninformed as you would anywhere in the system the Greens were claiming to challenge. \"David is going crazy\", said the rumours that began to circulate from those I had told. Yeah, right. Welcome to the new politics! It was a very mild precursor to what was to follow incidence would lead me to other psychics in this early awakening period and they did not know what the others had told me. Yet the themes were constant. There was a shadow across the world that had to be lifted, a story that had to be told, and I was going to tell it. Among these communications were: Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only have to follow the clues ... We are guiding you along a set path. You are learning according to our teaching of you. It was all organised, before you incarnated. True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier. He is a solidifier of thought who helps the Word to surface in people he meets. So you are being asked to change. You are being asked to change in a total way. It is not a matter of small changes, of a little thing here, a little thing there. You are really being asked to turn [yourself] inside out. There is a massive shadow which must be cleared and it is up to Light Workers such as yourself to focus ... on that challenge. Those of you who are in the forefront of this, you are rather like a snowplough. You are the thin end of the wedge. You really have, how shall I put this? To a certain extent, I suppose, you have the shitty end of the job. You have got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you are capable of doing an awful lot. That is why you have chosen to come, that is what you are here for, to really shovel some shit, and therefore make some space behind you to make it easier for the others. The theme of great upheavals and a transformation of human consciousness was another constant one and it continues to this day as I understand more and more of its nature and see the effect it is having on increasingly vast numbers of people. I was told that we had been trapped in a \"freeze vibration\" and that this low vibrational 'solidity' was being transformed. I learned much later that many ancient traditions say that the 'physical world' was once far more fluid and less dense than we experience today and the aborigines in Australia say the Earth is destined to return to this higher vibrational state they call 'Dream time'. We are certainly in the midst of enormous change that will set this 'world' free of its subservience, ignorance and density (in every sense). Bye, bye Beeb Within a few weeks of that first contact through the psychic healer, the BBC, or the 'Beeb' as it is known, told me they were not renewing my contract and, in effect, I was fired. This was a shock given all the letters I had received from BBC staff commending my work and the fact that I was still very young to be doing the job and should have had decades ahead of me. The main reason was clearly pressure from the BBC"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 9 hierarchy to get f1d of me because of my Green Party activities and especially my refusal to pay the Poll Tax introduced during the dictatorial reign of Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It demanded that rich and poor pay the same, a blatant injustice, and I was one of millions who withheld payment in protest at its unfairness. These millions eventually had to appear in court and there was enormous media interest when the first cases were heard. Now fate stepped in again. The first cases could have reached court anywhere in the United Kingdom, but where did it happen? At Newport, the little market town of the Isle of Wight, where my case was among those on the list. I arrived at the court to a blur of television cameras and newspaper reporters and photographers as they came to record the first Poll Tax protestors being prosecuted. Except that they weren't, it was to turn out. I waited for hours as row after row of protestors were dealt with for their refusal (often inability) to pay. They couldn't deal with them individually because there were so many. Then, at last, I was called and stood before the magistrates with six or seven others to face the charges. But one in the group, a guy I had met at Poll Tax protest meetings, put his hand in the air and asked a question. He pointed out the date by which the payments should have been made and the date on which the summonses were sent out to non-payers ordering them to appear in court. He then revealed that, according to the law, the period between the two dates was too short and the prosecutions happening that day were illegal. The atmosphere in the court changed immediately and the magistrates adjourned for discussions. When they returned around half an hour later they had to announce that the man was correct and all prosecutions that day were invalid and everyone was free to go. I pointed out to the magistrates that it was not that simple. People had been brought to court illegally and had lost a day's earnings and incurred transport costs as a result. What about the compensation? The authorities had no choice, but to agree. Loss of earnings was repaid and I was to receive a cheque for £2.50 for my bus fare. These events were blazed across the television news and the front pages of all the newspapers and Margaret Thatcher's Poll Tax was a national joke. From this point, with its credibility demolished, it had no chance of survival and had to be replaced with one more in tune with the ability to pay. The next morning I arrived at the BBC to see the corporation's head of sport to discuss my 'future'. All across his table were the morning papers recording the Poll Tax fiasco in Newport with my face on most of them. \"What I am going to say has nothing to do with that\", he said, pointing at the papers. Mmmm. I was told basically that I had no future at the BBC and a few weeks later we parted company after eleven years with not even a thank-you or a best of luck. The BBC is actually an arrogant and often vicious organisation that treats its staff like cattle. But then so do most other television companies, that's the nature of the beat. The new beginning My old life was over, just as it was meant to be, and while I was now out of a job with no alternative income, I felt liberated. Working in the Soulless media had become a daily nightmare and now I was free. I only survived these next few years financially because I lived well below my income from television and had enough money in the bank to see me and my family through - just. It was a time when trusting the flow of life was a major challenge with everything I had built now falling all around me and it was about to get a whole lot worse. My then wife Linda and my children were, of course, even more confused than I was. At least I had directly experienced the strange happenings; they knew only what I had told them. And here was their husband and father, a well-known face on national television for eight years, suddenly out of a job, talking about weird events and ideas and soon to be publicly ridiculed on a scale rarely seen in all British media history. The fact that they stood by me and did not once waver in their support no matter happened, was one of the key factors in my ability to survive what was about to unfold. So it was with my television agent, Paul Vaughan, who never ceased to support me even when it would have been much easier for him to walk away. My only desire was to follow the rapidly changing course of my life. Strange it all may have been, but there was a force within me that knew this was the way I had to go. Through the latter months of 1990 I wrote my first book about these events, Truth Vibrations. When it went to the printers just before the Christmas of 1990, the sequence began that led to the explosion in my consciousness that changed almost everything I had ever thought or believed. I suddenly had a tremendous urge to go to Peru, although I had no idea where this came from. I knew nothing about Peru and had never even thought about the place until now. In this same period I kept seeing the word 'Peru' everywhere, on books, in newspapers and in travel agent windows. I met another psychic lady who said without any prompting from me: \"Have you ever thought about visiting Peru?\" She said I would be going there and \"drinking of the ~Q1.y waters\". This comment came back to me a few weeks later when I was drinking water from the Urubamba River, the 'holy river', which flows through the Sacred Valley of Incas near Peru's ancient and formerly 'lost' city of Machu Picchu. Everything I was doing since I had those first communications through the psychic was based purely on intuition. I didn't know why I was going to Peru, for instance, only that ~had to for some reason. My head,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 10 my 'logic', told me that I should not be spending money I could not afford to make such an expensive trip, but by now my head was no match for my 'heart', from where our intuitive 'knowing' communicates with us. I don't mean the physical heart, but the spiritual one that can be felt in the centre of the chest. It is a vortex or \"charka\" (meaning 'wheel of light') that connects the 'physical' level with our higher consciousness beyond the five-senses. This is the true origin to why the physical heart is used today to symbolise love. It comes from a lost understanding of what the 'heart' really means in this context. When you feel great love or compassion notice how you feel it in the centre of the chest - that's the heart charka or vortex through which we also feel our intuitive 'knowing'. When someone is trying to make a decision we say: \"What does your heart tell you?\" or \"Does it feel right?\" The heart chakra is our connection to our higher consciousness beyond this 'world' while our 'head', our conditioned mind, is caught in the trap of 'thinking' in accordance with the rules and regulations of the five-sense reality. Most people are imprisoned by their 'head', which is indoctrinated to believe the official version of what is right and wrong, moral and immoral, sane and insane: the 'norms' of society. This is an expression of the Earth-bound consciousness, the 'lower' or 'five-sense' mind, that is daily manipulated to accept a version of reality and possibility that suits the agenda of those in control. It is based on limitation, rules and regulations and the \"I can't\", \"you can't\", mentality. It sees why something cannot be done or shouldn't be done and rarely why it can or should. It is also frozen by fear and this holds humanity in a mental and emotional prison cell. The 'heart', the intuition, however, is our connection with the Infinite self beyond the five-senses. The 'heart' feels rather than thinks and it has 'knowing' rather than second-hand 'knowledge' gleaned from the indoctrination machine. Most people have an inner 'war' going on between what they think and feel- what their head tells them to do and what they intuitively feel to do. Almost every time the head is the winner. It is easier that way, or appears to be, in a society founded on the imposition of thought and belief. Once the 'norms' of society are decided and imposed by the system through 'education', 'science', the media and so on, any rebels or freethinkers are subjected to ridicule or condemnation (in my case both) for the crime of being different or challenging this ludicrously limited version of reality and possibility. This process is captured superbly by a Japanese saying: \"Don't be the nail that stands out above the rest because that's the first one to get hit.\" Anyone who seriously follows their intuitive 'knowing' rather than their indoctrinated, fearful, head/mind is going to face the ridicule and condemnation of the psychological fascists. These are not only people in jackboots with silly moustaches; they are our parents, 'friends', colleagues at work, and, if you are ~the public eye, 'journalists' and the public in general. Anyone, in fact, who makes it difficult or unpleasant to be different. Most of the human race is so utterly indoctrinated by the externally implanted 'norms' that bombard their mind from cradle to grave that they have no comprehension that their 'normal' thinking their own individual and collective prison. Such is their bewilderment they not only contribute minute by minute to the building of their prison, they defend it ferociously from anyone who questions or challenges the foundations and assumptions on which it stands. It is what I term the \"flat Earth mentality\". When the norm was that the Earth was flat anyone who claimed it was round was subjected to ridicule and condemnation, even imprisonment and death. When the norm changed with the deluge of evidence to accept the Earth was a sphere, the roles immediately reversed and anyone who claimed it was flat then got the treatment. Norms rule, OK? Set the norms and you control human perception and behaviour. This is why exposing norms for the nonsense they are is so important. Those who live life through their intuition always attract the attention of the Thought Police because the 'head' and the 'heart', the lower 'mind' and the higher consciousness, view reality from a completely different point of observation. I will get into this in detail later, but symbolically you could put it like this: if the 'five-sense' mind was sailing down a river it could only see as far as the next bend. But the higher consciousness communicating through the intuition would see the whole' river from source to sea. It would know what was coming and the most effective course of action at any given point. It would know if there was bad weather ahead and if it was best to stop where you are until it passes. It would know if you were heading for a massive waterfall or if there were bandits lurking downstream and it could guide you to avoid them. None of this is available to the five-sense mind because it has such a limited vision and ability to see beyond its perceived 'norms'. \"There is no evidence that there are waterfalls or rapids in this river\", it might say, \"and until I see the proof we are going oooooh... aaaaaaahhhhh.\" The five-sense mind disconnected from its higher consciousness is engaged in a constant and furious battle with the intuition because if it surrendered its reality to the higher one it would lose its perceived power over events and behaviour. If someone on the boat said their intuition told them there were bandits around the comer, the lower minds of the others would ask them for the 'proof'. They would be told not to be so stupid and to stop spoiling the trip. In the same way people have refused to get on aircraft that were to crash because they had a 'feeling' - intuition from their higher consciousness. Even if these people had told the other passengers what they felt most would have still got on the plane because their head would tell them the chances of crashing were miniscule and, anyway, they needed to get to their destination to attend a business meeting or make a dinner date. Also, the great breakthroughs in understanding, including those in science, are invariably the result of an intuition, a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 11 'gut feeling', rather than the intellect working it all out. The intuitive is the inspiration 'and the intellect only confirms it. Daring to be different When we follow our intuition we often find ourselves behaving in ways that the conditioned, imprisoned, lower minds of people around us find impossible to understand. Because of this they have to rationalise your words and behaviour to themselves with claims that you are 'mad' or 'dangerous'. In fact you are merely different, viewing reality from a different point of observation. It is like that scene with Robin Williams in the 1989 movie, Dead Poets Society (Touchstone Pictures), when he told his pupils in the 'norm' -dominated school: \"I stand up on my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way. You see the world looks very different from up here ... just when you think you know something you have to look at it another way. Even though it may seem silly or 'wrong' you must try ... \" ... We all have a great need for acceptance, but you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go that's baaaaa-d.\" With perfect timing just before my 'awakening' I had some experiences that led me to decide that if ever my mind and my intuition, my head and my heart, were in conflict again I would always go with my intuition. I have never wavered from that to this day. As I was soon to find, this commitment to the intuitive can land you with serious challenges in a world that operates through head and mind. In the midst of such experiences the head is screaming at the heart: \"1 told you so!! Look what happens when you don't listen to me!!\" This is where most people pull back and return to the head, the experiment over. But when you stay with it and continue to follow your intuitive knowing in the face of all the consequences that may follow, a wonderful, liberating, transformation begins to manifest. The mind is judging events only by its perspective of seeing to the next bend, but your intuition is viewing the entire river. It knows that while things might seem bad at this point, the experience is leading somewhere really positive a little downstream. This has happened to me constantly and never more so than in the opening years of the 1990s. As a result of staying with my intuition no matter what, my lower or five-sense mind has been able to observe 'logically' that while following your intuition can throw up enormous challenges, the experience always turns out to be what was necessary from the bigger perspective. It sees that what seemed to be self destruction actually leads to a positive outcome that happens, not despite the 'self-destructive' experience, but because of it. With this realisation the head/mind moves into harmony with the intuition and the war between what you think and feel comes to an end. The two become the same. You follow your intuitive 'knowing' without the head symbolically banging its fist on the table. \"Did you have any dreams last night?\" Purely on intuition I flew to Lima, Peru, at the start of February 1991 for the experience that transformed my life. I had no idea why I was going, only that I needed to. When I walked off the plane at Lima Airport and collected my luggage, I was like a little boy lost. What now? I had a feeling to head for Cusco in the Andes, the centre of the ancient Inca civilisation, and I saw on the departure board that a plane was leaving for there in around 35 minutes. But the airport was a mass of people and I had yet to buy a ticket. No chance of getting that flight, I thought. Then a Peruvian guy speaking pretty good English emerged through the crowd and asked me where I was going. \"Cusco\", I said. \"You have hotel?\" \"No.\" \"You have ticket?\" ”No.” \"I get you ticket and hotel.\" This he did in very quick time, taking his commission on the way, of course. By now the flight was close to leaving and I went to the back of a long line waiting to check in. Again it was clearly impossible for me to make the departure time, now 20 minutes away. But as I prepared for a long wait, my fixer said: \"No, no, follow me.\" He took me down to the front of the queue where his friend was on the check in. The friend immediately stopped what he was doing and began to check me onto the flight. Considerably less than an hour after landing in Lima I was walking back across the tarmac to board the plane to Cusco. Such 'coincidences' were to be constantly repeated for the next three amazing weeks and, in fact, have continued ever since. I arrived at my rundown hotel and sat on the bed wondering what to do next. Someone I had met a few days earlier had given me the telephone number of a friend in Cusco and I made a call to see what would happen. She turned out to be the manager of a local travel agency and within an hour my basic travel"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 12 plans and arrangements for the next two weeks were sorted. She also called a Peruvian guide she knew who would show me around the country and the next day I arrived at his home to meet him and begin what was to be an incredible adventure. The door was open and I walked in to find him asleep on the floor. As he opened his eyes his first words were not hello or good morning, but \"did you have any dreams last night?\" After recovering from the surprise of his opening remarks, I said that yes I had. The dream was very vivid and included one of my front middle teeth falling out. \"Is your father or grandfather still alive?\" he asked. \"Well yes, my father is, why?\" \"That dream is often symbolic of your father or grandfather dying.\" Making an international phone call in Peru outside of Lima is far from easy, certainly then anyway, but a week later when I finally managed to ring later, I found that my father had died at that time back in England. His funeral had taken place before I even knew he had died. I was to stay longer than planned in Peru and for the next three weeks as I travelled around much of the country, a daily sequence began to repeat itself. Each morning I would tell the guide where I intuitively felt to go and he would invariably tell me it wasn't possible. But every day we would somehow end up there. I went to some stunning occasions, not just the famous tourist sites like the extraordinary Machu Picchu, but many other unforgettable places. Eventually we arrived in a town in southern Peru called Puno, not far from Lake Titicaca. The guide had booked us in a hotel called the Sillustani, named after an ancient Inca site about an hour's drive away. For-obvious reasons there were pictures of the place around the hotel and I told the guide I wanted to go there. True to form he said it was not possible at that time of year without spending a lot of money, but my intuition to go was so strong that I said I would do whatever was necessary. I had to hire a tourist mini-bus for myself (or so the guide told me) and off I went with him and the driver \"It will be over when you feel the rain\" The Sillustani ruins are located on a hill skirted on three sides by a beautiful lagoon. The area was uninhabited and surrounded by distant mountains. It was quiet with only a couple of children waiting with a Lama hoping to sell photographs to tourists. But there weren't any, apart from me. After I walked around the ruins for an hour or so under the piercing Peruvian Sun, I went back to the tourist bus to return to Puna. I though~ the trip was over and I felt deflated and disappointed because, lovely as this place was, what I had experienced did not begin to match the power of the intuition I had to' gC1 there. About three minutes down the road I was daydreaming out of the window when I saw a mound to the right. It caught my attention and as I looked at the mound, a voice in my head began to repeat: \"Come to me, come to me, come to me.\" What? That mound is talking to me?? I asked the driver to stop the bus and said I was going to walk up the mound. \"I'll only be a few minutes\", I said. Although I couldn't see it from the roa4, at the top of the mound there was a circle of standing stones about waist high and they had clearly been there a long time. I stood in the centre of the circle looking back across to Sillustani and the mountains way off in the distance. There was not a cloud in the sky and the Sun was extremely hot, burning my face. Suddenly, I felt my feet being pulled like magnets into the ground again. It was the same as in the newspaper shop in Ryde, but this time it was far more powerful. My arms then reached up above my head without any conscious decision from me. If you put your arms above your head, slightly outwards at about 45 degrees you'll see how they start to ache within a minute. My arms were like that for well over an hour and I felt nothing until it was over and then my shoulders were agony. I felt like a drill sensation in the top of my head and I could feel a flow of energy going the other way up from the ground through my feet and out through the top my head. I heard a voice in my mind that said, \"They will be talking about this moment a hundred ' years from now\" and then \"It will be over when you feel the rain.\" What was that about rain? What bloody rain? There was not a cloud to be seen anywhere, just a brilliant Sun in a clear blue sky. What was happening to me? I stood there unable to move as the energy increased to the point where my body was shaking as if plugged into an electrical socket. Time became meaningless; there was no 'time' as we perceive it, no past, no future, only the moment I was experiencing. I kept moving in and out of conscious awareness, much like you drive a car and wonder where the last few miles have gone. The car has been driven by your subconscious while the conscious was off in a daydream. In one of my returns to awareness I saw there was a light grey mist over the distant mountains and a~ I watched it got darker and darker. My god, it was raining over there, although far\" ~ away. Soon the rain clouds emerged from the mountains with ridiculous speed. I can only describe it as like pulling a curtain across the sky as a straight line of cloud I loved towards me covering the Sun. When it came closer I was seeing faces in the clouds, billowing like dry ice in a stage show. By now my body was shaking so fiercely from the energy passing through me that I could hardly stand. Eventually the clouds were overhead and it began to rain. As I felt the water on my face the surges of energy stopped as if a switch had been flicked. I staggered forward, my legs like jelly, my shoulder and arm muscles now stiff and painful. It was only at this point that I noticed that the Peruvian guide was standing next to the circle, tired of waiting for me in the bus. If a facial expression ever said \"mad Englishman\", his was it. Energy was pouring from my' hands with tremendous power and I went down to the bus to grab a crystal in effort to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 13 diffuse some of it. I only had the crystal because I had walked into a shop in Glastonbury, England, two weeks before and the owner had just picked it up and given it to me for free. \"I think you should have this\", he said. My feet also continued' to burn and vibrate for some 24 hours. I could hardly sleep that night because of it. The next day I arrived at an astonishing place called Sun Island in Lake Titicaca, which spans the Peruvian and Bolivian, borders and is claimed to be the highest navigable lake in the world at some 13,000 feet. According to legend, Sun Island and nearby Moon Island were the birthplace of the Sun and Moon and these bodies took human form as the first Inca, Manco Capac and his sister-wife Mama Ocllo. There is no electricity on the island and without the visual pollution of neon light the stars appear so close and in such incredible clarity. I stepped out of the little fishing boat and onto the shore, still trying to make sense of what had happened to me on that mound. There I met a blonde Argentine lady who had been in La Paz, Bolivia, the day before when she had felt strongly that she had to go to Sun Island. She arrived only half an hour before I did. When I shook her hand to say hello she wouldn't let go and, although she couldn't speak English, she made gestures to my hand saying something like \"What's this I can feel?\" What was she talking about? What could she feel? What had happened to me on that mound? For sure in the weeks that followed my life and perceptions went through a transformation that took me to the limits of mental and emotional survival. It was like a dam had burst in my consciousness. The five-sense mind was suddenly flooded with new perceptions, thoughts and ideas and it was just too much to process at once, and make any sense of it. \"He thinks he's Jesus\" Unfortunately for my short-term self-respect, but perfect for my long-term awakening, my book Truth Vibrations was published in early 1991 in precisely the period when I could hardly tell you what plane I was on. The book and my public behaviour and statements led to unimaginable national ridicule blasted across the front pages of the newspapers and on television and radio programmes galore. I could literally not walk down any street in Britain without being ridiculed by the people. I lived my life at this time to the sound Of-laughter. Going into a bar? Forget it. There was uproar. I would stop at traffic lights and look across to see whole families laughing at me in the car alongside and television comedians only had to say my name to trigger riotous laughter. My children were laughed at in the street and at school and they were followed by tabloid journalists trying to dig the dirt. One freelance 'journalist' on the Isle of Wight was especially appalling, gleefully taking money from the tabloids to do their dirty work while claiming to be my 'friend'. The hysteria reached its peak when I appeared on a live prime-time television chat show hosted by Britain's then best-known TV 'personality', Terry Wogan. He has since said publicly that he regrets how he handled the interview, which was big of him, really. But at the time he took the ridicule route. Such was the publicity in the media that the Wogan show audience were laughing within a minute or so of me sitting down and that pretty much continued for the whole of the interview. I became famous for wearing turquoise clothes because after the experience on the mound I began to want to wear only turquoise, which is a very powerful and sacred colour to many native and esoteric beliefs. Native Americans are one major example of this. Years later when I met my now great friend, Credo Mutwa, a Sanosi or shaman and the official historian of the Zulu nation in South Africa, he was decked from neck to toe in brilliant turquoise. At the time I knew nothing of esoteric meaning of turquoise, only that I felt strongly to wear it. Funny, some of the- media could not even get that right and many articles reported my obsession with \"purple\". The other foundation of the ridicule was that I had supposed to have called myself the Son of God, implying that I was Jesus or something. Ironically 'Jesus' is a 'man' I have no doubt did not exist as depicted by Christianity as I have explained in detail in some of my books. I used the term 'Son of God' in the sense of being an aspect, as I understood it at the time, of the Infinite consciousness that is everything. As I have written before, we are like droplets of water in an ocean of infinite consciousness. We are 'individual' on one level, but also part of the infinite whole. More than that, we are the infinite whole as I shall later explain. I was not trying to say I had come to save the world or anything, only that, like everyone and everything else in all existence, I was an aspect of the Infinite and not just a physical 'personality'. If you call the Infinite consciousness 'God', I was trying to say, we are all the symbolic 'sons' and 'daughters' of 'God'. Obviously my awareness of these matters has increased dramatically since then, but that was the basis of my comments about being a 'Son of God'. However, I was both misrepresented in the media and, with my mind downloading so much information following the mound in Peru, I wasn't grounded or 'here' enough to articulate clearly what I was trying to say and this led to even greater misrepresentation and misunderstanding among those who ridiculed and laughed. All I can say to 'Jesus' is that if you are there, mate, don't for goodness sake come back because they'll bloody crucify you - Christians as mlft11 as anyone. If you do return I would definitely do the cloud trick to give yourself any chance at all. Some comedians were funny rather than vindictive, though, and I recall the brilliant British comic, Jasper Carrot, saying that I couldn't be the Son of God because you'd never find three wise men and virgin in Leicester."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 14 My children were in hysterics when he was talking about me because it was done with good humour and wit.\" In two minds I remember clearly being aware during the Wogan interview of two very different levels of myself, what I now know to have been the lower mind caught in the conditioned illusions of this five-:-sense 'world' and my infinite consciousness that was observing these events from a very much higher perspective of knowing. The head/mind is the experiencer of this dense frequency range and, if the head listens to the heart, the higher consciousness is the intuitive 'guide' that observes this realm from beyond its prison walls and manipulated illusions. It is my experiencer level that dislikes the public spotlight and my higher consciousness that is totally at peace with talking off the cuff for hours to any number of people you care to assemble. While the audience were laughing at me on the Wogan show my five-sense mind, the illusory 'personality' called 'David Icke', was in emotional turmoil and agony. But there was another level of me I also recall very clearly. It was saying: \"It's OK, everything is fine, this is leading somewhere, don't worry.\" Many times I had a major problem believing these words, I must say, but so it has proved to be. I understand why people thought I had self-destructed and why, even now with the gathering recognition my books are enjoying, that the 'turquoise', 'Son of God', period is seen as an unfortunate disaster that has made my subsequent work far more difficult in terms of public credibility in Britain. But such people miss the point. This period of unbelievable ridicule did not make my subsequent work more difficult; it made it possible. Ridiculed to freedom Here again we have the two perspectives of the lower conditioned mind and the higher consciousness that communicates through intuition and knowing. The five-sense mind can see a few paragraphs on one page while the higher consciousness has read the book. In fact, it has written it. To do what I was to do years down the line I had to free myself from the prison that almost everyone on the planet lives in every day. It is a prison that disconnects lower mind from Infinite self and the one that daily holds humanity in slavery to a system created and orchestrated by the few to this very end. It is the fear of what other people think. Most people are not living the lives they want to lead or speaking their own undiluted truths because they are frightened of the reaction of others - parents, teachers, 'friends' and neighbours if their views and lifestyle are at odds with the 'norms' on which this lunatic asylum is founded. They keep their heads down and their mouths shut. Don't be the nail that stands out above the rest because that's the first one to get hit.\" In short, they are not living their truth or expressing their uniqueness and desires; they are conforming to what society and its parent, teacher, 'friend' and neighbour Thought Police dictate should be the limits of their lives and views. How could I write and talk about the challenging and often 'bizarre' concepts in my books if I still cared what anyone thought of met Impossible. I would be editing information, even leaving out great swathes altogether, because of my concern with what others would think. Thanks to that onslaught of ridicule in the early 1990s the prison door opened. I was going to speak my unfiltered truth and if people didn't like it, well that's just too bad. They must believe something else then, it's all the same with me. When you are faced with the level of ridicule that I endured year after year, you either go under and have a breakdown, or you ditch any concern with what other people think of you and have a breakthrough. You walk out of the sheep pen into the light of freedom. The ridicule may have been a nightmare at the time to my insecure lower mind, but my higher consciousness knew why it had to happen. It was to set me free. As that 'psychic' communication said in the earliest days of my awakening: \"True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier.\" So what was going on? It was many months before I began to understand what had happened to me and how it was happening to countless other people away from the public glare I had experienced a monumental 'kundalini' explosion. As I said earlier, the 'physical' body is connected to its other energy 'bodies' beyond the five-sense domain by those spinning vortexes known as 'chakras' from the ancient Sanskrit word meaning wheels of light. We have these all over the body, but there are seven main ones, as illustrated in Figure 1. Each chakra represents a different level of being. For instance, the one in the solar plexus is the connection to our emotional level and this is why we feel emotions like fear and worry in the belly. We call it having"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 15 \"butterflies in the tummy\" or \"getting the shits\", but really the sensation is coming from the solar plexus chakra. The chakras inter-connect with the physical body through the endocrine system and the vibrational state of the chakra affects the body in infinite ways. The balance point of the three lower ('physical') chakras and the three higher (mental and spiritual) ones is the heart chakra. It is from here that we can balance the physical and non-physical levels of being and this is our connection to our highest levels of intuitive knowing. A kundalini experience is when tremendously powerful energy is released through the base chakra at the bottom of the spine. This process is described by Itzhak Bentov in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum 2 \"The kundali ni, as described in yoga literature, is said to be an 'energy coiled up, like a serpent, at the base of the spine'. When this energy is 'awakened', it enters the spine, rises up along it, and is seen or perceived as a luminous serpent by the person having the experience. Once it has risen into the head, the luminous rod hopefully pierces the top of the head; that is, the rod-like energy beam is seen as projecting through the skull pointing upward. When this happens, the person is said to be 'illuminated'. Eventually, such a person may become highly intuitive and develop some psychic powers, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience or healing abilities.\" 3"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 16 This is what happened to me. It was the cause of my ‘dam burst’ and the process began on the mound in Peru. The kundalini exploded up through my spine, activating all the chakras and my brain into a higher level of contact with the ocean of infinite consciousness. With that initial explosion came the apparent chaos in my mind as I was transforming from one energy state to another. It was this activation that caused me to suddenly see the world and myself in a totally different way and my mind was bombarded with information and concepts I could not process for months. I felt like a computer that had locked up because too many keys had been pressed at once. This was my state on the Wogan show and public ignorance of these matters led me to be labelled \"mad\". This is the normal defence response to anyone who is significantly different and I was now seriously different. As Angela Monet said: \"Those who danced were thought to be quite insane by those who could not hear the music.\" What they called madness was really transformation. Itzhak Bentov points out that the psychological symptoms of the more extreme kundalini experience (and mine was) \"tend to mimic schizophrenia\" and many people are sent to mental institutions because 'modem' medicine does not understand what is happening. He goes on: \"It is ironic that persons in whom the evolutionary processes of Nature have begun to operate more rapidly, and who can be considered as advanced mutants of the human race, are institutionalised as subnormal by their 'normal' peers. I dare to guess, on the basis of discussions with my psychiatrist-friends, that this process is not as exotic and rare as one would like us to believe, and possibly 25 to 30 per cent of all institutionalised schizophrenics belong to this category - a tremendous waste of human potential.\" 4 Bentov says that the diagnosis of 'schizophrenia' stems from the kundalini activation of other levels of awareness: \"The reason for this is that they have been catapulted suddenly into a situation in which they are functioning in more than one reality. They can see and hear things occurring in our neighbouring realities, that is the astral or other higher realities, because their 'frequency response' has been broadened ... The onslaught of information may be overwhelming, and they begin to mix and confuse two or three realities.\" 5 I went through this process in public without understanding what the hell was happening to me. When eventually the nature and effects of the kundalini awakening were explained, 'it made complete sense of what I had experienced, although the emotional debris around me was no less painful. Figure 1.: The human 'chakra' or vortex system that interpenetrates our levels of being. The balance point is the heart chakra and when that is closed or imbalanced we disconnect from our Infinite Self and become dominated by the 'five-sense' mind. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 17 The inner eyes open For months after my mental and emotional 'dam' exploded, my life was in chaos. On every level there was turmoil and I said and did many things that the David Icke people thought they knew would never have contemplated. It was all reported across the front pages of the national newspapers and by the end of this experience there was little left of my old life and identity. Every bridge to the 'past' was ablaze and there was no going back. Not that I wanted to. A mess as my life seemed to be, something inside drove me on. I was not going to run. I knew that this was all meant to be, but why and to what end? After about three months the storm in my mind began to subside and I became 'normal' once again. Well, on the surface I did. Inside I was transformed. What happened to ~e on that mound in Peru began to integrate with that level known as 'David Icke' and I realised that I could see much that I hadn't seen before. I was looking through the same eyes and hearing through the same ears, but what I saw and heard were dramatically different. I began to see beyond the movie, the conditioned version of reality that those in power sell us as the 'truth'. I could see the manipulation with an increasing clarity and, as my understanding expanded, I could see that the world was not just a little bit different to what we had been led to believe. It was nothing like it. The 'world' we thought to be real was simply a manufactured illusion. But why and by whom' or by what? In mid-1991 my feet were back on the ground, but, of course, all the public and media remembered were the crazy days of my very public transition. Once you are labelled and placed in the pigeonhole, that's it. Once 'crazy' always 'crazy', black and white, no shades of grey. The ridicule and laughter continued wherever I went and the 'normal' course of action would have been to keep my head down. Instead I embarked on a speaking tour of British universities, aware of what my reception would be. Did I want to go? Of course not (five-sense mind). Did I know it was necessary? Yes (Infinite consciousness). The events were sold out sometimes weeks in advance because these 'decision makers of tomorrow' came to laugh and ridicule. One night it was 15 minutes before I could start to speak because of the uproar, noise and beer cups thrown at the stage. I waited for this to die down and then I said: \"You think I'm mentally ill, don't you?\" \"YEEEEESSS,\" came the collective reply. \"So what does that say about you then? You have paid to ridicule someone you have been conditioned to believe is mentally ill?\" You could hear a pin drop. It had dawned on them that their behaviour was not a statement about me, but about them. It is a revelation we would all do well to remember: what we do and say is not a reflection of those we ridicule and condemn, but of ourselves. I was heard in respectful silence for the rest of that night, apart from a small group at the back near the bar who continued to heckle in the darkness. I asked for the lights to be switched on so everyone could see where the noise was coming from and I asked for a microphone to be taken to the group so they could say what they wanted to say in the full view of the audience. You would have thought the mike was on fire such was the vehemence of their refusal to take it. These talks to university students showed me so much about myself and also the conditioned human responses that imprison both perpetrators and their targets. It confirmed that I had purged my concern with what other people thought of me because no matter how I was received I really didn't give a damn any more. What a freedom that is. I began to see what an illusion I was living in and how the entire human race, except for a few, was caught in a virtual reality game that dictated the rules. I had to smile to myself in this period whenever I was interviewed by a British TV host called Eamonn Holmes, a guy I knew from my days in television. He could not get his head around why anyone would give up a successful career in TV to do what I had done. The fact that television was not the be all and end all of life, or that such a version of 'success' was illusory, seemed beyond his comprehension: \"But you could still be in television\". Yes, Eamonn, but I don't want to be, mate. \"But ... \" Right 'time', right 'place' Those first 'psychic' communications in 1990 have proved to be prophecy indeed, not least the one about \"knowledge will be put into his mind, and at other times he will be led to knowledge.\" I embarked upon a daily journey of often staggering synchronicity in which I would meet people or have experiences that would continually increase my appreciation of what was actually going on in the world and the nature of life itself. Alongside this have been the thoughts that have suddenly appeared in my mind about people and events that later are shown by hindsight or 'five-sense' research to have been correct. I have been guided with a synchronistic precision that is often breathtaking. Without this, I could never have compiled so much information and made so many connections so quickly. There is a force that wants to open the mind of humanity, that's for sure. It has certainly opened mine and I am passing on what I discover to those who wish to hear."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 18 I'll give you one example of the outrageous 'coincidences' that have become commonplace since the mound in Peru. By mid-1995 I had completed the manuscript for And The Truth Shall Set You Free in which I had mentioned quite extensively the background to former US President Jimmy Carter. As the book was about to go to press I travelled to Ireland to see the brilliant show called Riverdance at the Point Theatre in Dublin. The tickets were bought through the box office like everyone else and I walked up the steps into the arena to find my seat. I had a friend who worked on the show and when I reached the top of the steps I was surprised to see her standing there. She was looking bewildered and bemused. She said she should have been backstage, but had felt intuitively to come and wait for me. While she waited she had overheard a security guard say the \"security seats\" were row S numbers 25, 26, 27 and 28. I could now understand why she was bemused because she knew from an earlier conversation that the tickets for a mutual friend and me were row S 25 and 26. I was in the 'security' seats? What was going on? She also said that she had never seen these security people before because they were not the ones that normally worked at the theatre. I decided to go to the seats and see what happened. By now it was only minutes to the start of the show and the arena was packed, but when I reached row S it was empty from end to end. Spooky. I sat down with the mutual friend and suddenly the people in front of us began to turn around and look to the back of the theatre. When I looked I could see a ring of heavies coming down the stairs surrounding someone and there were flash cameras going off like machine gun fire among the audience. Clearly someone famous was involved here. This entourage then stopped at the far end of my empty row and the people inside the circle of security men began to walk towards me. As they got closer I could see that it was President Jimmy Carter and his wife who proceeded to sit down beside me in the other two security seats! Unbelievable. According to the newspapers I read the next day, Carter was in Ireland to meet with the then Irish President, Mary Robinson, and had taken the opportunity to see Riverdance. And here were he and his wife sitting next to me in 'security seats' when my tickets had been bought in the same way as every other member of the audience that night and no-one at the theatre knew who they were for. I stood up and shook Carter's hand because something urged me to look into his eyes. To my astonishment, and I can only describe this from my own experience, it was like looking into an empty shell. It seemed to me that there was no one home and it was a weird experience. I resisted the urge to tell him I had a book out soon that he might like to read. I sat there contemplating the hilarious thought that here I was sitting in security seats next to an American president I was exposing in my books while surrounded by CIA security men. I couldn't watch the show for a while because I was laughing so much. Higher consciousness, as I have experienced many times, has a terrific sense of humour. This is the kind of 'coincidence' that has happened constantly since I began to follow my heart in 1990 and investigate what was really happening in this world, who was really in control and to what end. When people ask how I have compiled so such information ~ these subjects, this is how. I don't have to look for it; it comes to me. As I was told in those early days: .”Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only have to\" follow the clues ... We are guiding you along a set path ... It was all organised before you incarnated.\" This is not to say it is easy. It takes a tremendous amount of work and ' commitment and some days my head could explode with all the information that needs to be processed, assimilated and fitted together. But it is this guiding force that makes it possible to lift a veil of secrecy that is desperate to remain hidden from public view and has managed to be so for thousands of years. On my part it has been vital that I have followed my intuition at all times because that is the means through which the higher consciousness 'speaks' to all of us if we are prepared to listen. If my intuition says I must go here, do something or meet a person, this is what I do. No questions, no consultations with the 'logical' head, I just do it. There is always a good reason, either obviously at the time or with hindsight, for why that action was necessary. Upward and onward The big audiences that came to ridicule me in the immediate aftermath of the 'turquoise period' soon drifted away once it became clear that there was actually nothing to laugh at when the information was explained at length. For years after that I would speak to a handful of people in small, cold, halls and leave poorer than when I arrived because income from the 'audience' rarely matched the expenses of the event. At the same time I heard people say that I was \"only doing it for the money\". My determination to continue was seriously challenged in this period, I can tell you. It all seemed so pointless, but that inner 'knowing' never left me and constantly assured me that all would be well. So it has turned out. Even when I was earning little or no money through most of the 1990s I managed through out-of-the blue invitations to visit more than 40 countries. This helped me to compile an increasingly vast library of information about the background, methods and personnel behind the global manipulation that I had begun to see was no wacky 'theory', as portrayed by the media. At first the information was mostly about the manipulation of the 'five-sense' reality - the one we daily experience. It was about names, dates, people and the secret connections between the apparently unconnected. Later the journey revealed to me the other-dimensional expression of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 19 the manipulation and I realised that the manipulators in physical 'bodies' are pawns of a force that most people cannot see with the severe limitations of the human senses. I have written a long series of books through these years since the publication of Truth Vibrations. They include Heal the World, Days of Decision, The Robots' Rebellion, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free, The Biggest Secret, Children of the Matrix and Alice in Wonderland and the World 1i.fJ.de Center Disaster, Why the Official Story of 9/11 is a Monumental Lie. Since the latter years of the 1990s I have had fantastic support from a great guy called Royal Adams, who's planning and organisation has made possible the publication of many of my books against the financial odds. Especially since the publicatiol1-of The Biggest Secret in 1999, there has been a gathering of interest in what I am communicating. My website, www.davidicke.com. attracts millions of visits a month and my talks all over the world enjoy large and rapidly-growing attendances. It is all a long way from the time I spoke at a venue near Chicago to eight people or had to cancel events to avoid having to talk to myself. People are beginning to wake up and I have almost been a barometer of this with the interest in my own work. One of the first things I was told about in 1990, in fact the very theme of Truth Vibrations, was that a transformation, an awakening, of human consciousness was upon us and I can no\", see this manifesting more obviously every day. It is not the majority yet, but we are getting there. Minds, or more importantly hearts, are opening to a truth that we all know, but have been manipulated to forget. I will now describe the multi-levels of the global and cosmic conspiracy as they have been revealed to me since the mound in Peru. Firstly, I was led to the five-sense information of how the world we see is being manipulated towards a global fascist state; this was followed with the revelations about the other-dimensional control of the five-sense manipulators; and then, in the Amazon rainforest in 2003, I was shown how and why our daily experience is only a dream of our own making. It was in Brazil that my mind-was opened to an even greater appreciation of the human plight and the amazing transformation that is going to take us home. This knowledge is the key to our freedom and I will go into that in considerable detail later.

Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is 'dishonest, insane and intolerable. H. L. Mencken, American Writer 1880-1956 To understand the background to current and historical world events, including what happened on September 11th 2001, I have had to research and understand so many subjects, some of them considered bizarre or crazy to our conditioned reality. As the puzzle pieces began to emerge, it became clear that a network of interbreeding bloodlines going back to the ancient world has expanded its control over the human population, until today, a full-blown global dictatorship is within its sight and within its grasp. Or at least it would be if the awakening of the human heart and mind were not about to blow the house down. Unless people know the real background to what is happening they can easily be deceived by the official versions of 9/11 and other atrocities, wars, famine and strife that are daily ‘reported’ by the media. The official story of September 11th is a monumental lie, as I reveal in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, but most people have believed it, and the wars of conquest that have followed have been 'justified' by the official version being true. This has included the deaths of at least five thousand Afghan civilians. These were men, women and children, like those who live in your street, who were slaughtered by US and British bombing to \"get Bin Laden\" - the man who was supposed to have organised 9/11 from a cave in Afghanistan. It's a lie, but the lie was believed and, therefore, led to the reaction that killed and maimed still more people in the name of 'peace' and 'justice'. Some idiot interviewers in the mainstream media have asked me what was the point of people knowing what is going on. Well, if the public realised who the true perpetrators of 9/11 really were we would not have had our freedoms destroyed by the day since those planes hit, and thousands of civilians in Afghanistan would still be with us. Nor would we have had the invasion of Iraq with more than seven thousand civilians killed and tens of thousands maimed, if the people had known the true background to why that happened. From Strand to web People come into an understanding about the global conspiracy through many different routes. Some begin to investigate the legalised corruption and theft orchestrated through the banking system and go on to see that this is just one strand of an enormous conspiracy that pervades all areas of human life. Others come to this knowledge by researching the suppression of information about 'UFOs' or the corruption of governments, arms sales, 'Third World debt and the actions of translational corporations that lead to death, hunger and suffering across Africa, Central and South America and elsewhere. If you pursue any of these investigations far enough, and with an open mind, it will inevitably lead you into the enormous spider's web of inter-connected and coordinated manipulation, mass murder and corruption that is the global conspiracy. I was guided into this understanding by the desire to know why alternative explanations for life were being suppressed while the versions presented by 'science' and religion were given free reign. When my awakening began to express itself I realised there were explanations that challenged those of 'science' and religion and made far more sense in solving the 'mysteries' of life. Why was this information not made available to children and students in the schools and universities? Where were the television programmes about these concepts in the mainstream media? Why was anyone who talked about them either ridiculed by 'science' or condemned by 'religion'? As my investigations continued a whole universe of knowledge began to be unleashed as I realised that the suppression of the very nature of our existence was a part, a fundamental part, of a global conspiracy of simply astonishing proportions. I found myself involved in years of highly detailed and painstaking research on which I would often spend eight hours or more a day, week after week, month after month. That's how well hidden the conspiracy has been - but not any longer. Before we move on to the specifics of current events, I will outline the basic background to the five-sense manipulation. You can find the sources and far more information and detail in my books: And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret, Children of the Matrix and Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. 'Illuminated ones' "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 22 The conspiracy to create a centralised global fascist state is orchestrated in the five-sense 'world' by a secret network known collectively as the Illuminati or 'Illuminated ones'. They manipulate through secret societies and groupings like the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar and the Jesuits. These and others feed carefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and they are installed in positions of power throughout the world, infesting all colours, races, creeds and countries. It is not that everyone in the secret societies is aware of the plot; the overwhelming majority are not. The Illuminati operate like a cancer to infiltrate and covertly control other organisations. Most Freemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levels of degree, the so-called Blue Degrees and they don't realise what their organisation is being used for. This was confirmed by Albert Pike, one of the most pre-eminent figures in world Freemasonry who died in 1891. Among his titles were Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry. In his book, Morals and Dogma written for higher-degree Freemasons, he reveals the way the lower levels are misled: \"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. \" 2 Even most of those who make it to the apparently highest level, like the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite, can know relatively little unless they are 'chosen'. Only the tiny few, all from particular bloodlines and their offshoots, progress through the official peak of their 'individual' secret society into the Illuminati degrees above that. I reckon some 95% of Freemasons are not aware that these levels exist, never mind who is in them and what happens there. Illuminati operatives are manipulated into the positions of power and influence to introduce the agenda for global domination. It is actually remarkable how few people you need to directly control in. order to dictate your agenda through the whole system. It can be done if they are (a) in the key positions of decision-making and (b) they have the power to appoint those in the important positions below them. An example: you control the chief of police who decides the policy and he can appoint the heads of the various departments in his force. He introduces Illuminati policy and chooses his major subordinates from secret society initiates. They, in turn, can appoint the people within their departments, and can choose more secret society initiates for the positions below them. So it goes on. Once you have control of the top man in any organisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminator’s, image. Governments are structured in the same way, as are 'security' organisations like the FBI, CIA, British Intelligence and those who control the Pentagon. The need for centralisation is obvious. If there are only a relatively few manipulators compared with the target population, they have to centralise decision making affecting the lives and choices of the many. The more diverse the decision making, the less control the few are going to have over what is decided. It is like a guy on a stage with lots of plates spinning on sticks. Eventually he is going to lose control running around from one to the other and the plates will begin to crash around him. It would be so much easier if he only had 'one big plate' on 'one big stick' because he could keep that going indefinitely. Diversity is , the controllers' nightmare and they have sought to centralise decision-making and increase their power. The reason that centralisation in all areas of our lives; political, economic, business, military and media, has progressed with a faster and faster pace is another simple equation. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 23 Figure 2: The Illuminati structure for global fascist government. 'Globalisation' and the 'war on terrorism' are the Agenda advancing to this end The more you centralise power the more power you have to centralise even quicker. The Illuminati want a world government, army, central bank and currency that will dictate to a microchipped population (Figure 2). The world government would make all the major decisions politically, financially and militarily and enforce their introduction in every country. We are now witnessing the formation of this structure through the United States dictatorship. This is officially headed by George W. Bush, but it is really controlled by the Illuminati hierarchy. America is their major vehicle for global conquest, as it was always planned to be. The war on terrorism' is a manufactured excuse to take over any country they can demonise through their truly pathetic mainstream media. The Left in politics, which has long ridiculed and even condemned what I say about the conspiracy, has now discovered the brutal policy of 'globalisation'. This involves bringing down trade barriers to allow the Illuminati multinationals to produce their products for pennies in the poorest countries by paying the employees poverty wages, and then shipping them to the rich West (rich for some) and selling them at a vast, obscene profit. The Left limit their explanations of this to simply greedy giant corporations wanting more power and money. I understand this limitation of vision because the Left, too, are caught in the system's game while believing they are rebelling against it. But globalisation is really an expression of the Illuminati agenda for the global state in which everything will be dictated by the few at the centre and any dissenter countries will get the treatment of Afghanistan, Iraq and others as the fodder troops are sent in to 'liberate' them. Blood brothers The Illuminati can be traced back thousands of years to Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and still further into what we call pre-history. Through the centuries they have been working constantly to centralise global power and complete their 'Great Work' global dictatorship. Behind the apparent randomness of world events has been the Illuminati secret network that is privy to knowledge the rest of the people never hear about. The network is controlled by ancient interbreeding bloodlines and their offshoots headed today by some thirteen 'elite families', which are structured in a DNA hierarchy. These include the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, House of Lorraine, Habsburgs and the Thurn und Taxis dynasty from Bergamo, Italy, which expanded into Belgium, Bavaria and wider a field. The Thurn und Taxis bloodline is highly significant to the Illuminati although not mentioned by researchers as often as some of the others. The bloodlines are often referred to as the Black Nobility. These families that control the system that controls the people have a different DNA to the rest of the population. The DNA is the blueprint for our physical traits and much more. Contacts who have experienced some of the inner levels of the conspiracy have described this to me as a DNA 'corruption'. This 'corruption' will be barely, if at all, perceptible at the level of DNA knowledge currently available because, frankly, human science knows damn all about DNA compared with what there-is to know. It is this DNA difference that led to the age-old claims by 'royal' bloodlines around the world of their 'Divine right to rule'\" This 'Divine right' is simply the right to rule by DNA. We have a head of state in Britain to this day who is only there because of her DNA and the whole freeloading hierarchy of the royal family is structured according to a person's DNA relationship to the king or queen. It is all based on their genetics and this is written into the law of the land that also condemns racism and makes it a criminal offence!!! But what is royal rule by DNA if not outrageous racial and genetic elitism? This 'Divine' right to rule has nothing to do with the 'Divine' and everything to do with the real origin of these bloodlines. They claim to descend from the 'gods' of the ancient world and who or what these 'gods' were and are, I will explain in detail later. The 'royal' families have interbred incessantly with each other since ancient times because they are seeking to retain the DNA corruption that can apparently be quickly diluted by breeding outside of itself. How interesting that the families of the Illuminati and the power elite do the same to this day. Why? They are the same bloodlines. The royal 'Divine' bloodlines of ancient Sumer and Babylon (now Iraq), Egypt, the Indus Valley and elsewhere expanded into Europe to become the royal and aristocratic families that ruled that continent and most of the world through the British Empire and those of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and so on. As the people began to challenge and reject the open dictatorship of royal rule the bloodlines began to move 'underground' by operating among the population in all the areas that control modern society. Some researchers talk of one 'royal' bloodline originating from one place - often ancient Egypt. I don't agree with that. Egypt is enormously important to the Illuminati bloodlines for sure, but they were seeded in many parts of the world. They have travelled in all directions and been cross-matched with other expressions of the original source. Egypt, Sumer, Babylon, Asia and China are common themes for the major Illuminati bloodlines and they do not relate to one Earth race. Instead, they have impregnated many nations to advance their power and the main carrier of the 'Illuminati' DNA is the female line. History has concentrated on the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 24 male line when it is the female, 'the Goddess' in Illuminati parlance, which has carried it through the centuries in the so-called mitochondrial DNA. His Royal Highness, Mr President These ancient Illuminati bloodlines have since become the presidents of the United States, the prime ministers, the leading banking and business families, the media owners and those who control the military. Look at the US presidents as an example. There are more than 280 million people in the United States today and many hundreds of millions more have lived there since the leading Freemason George Washington was inaugurated as the first President in 1789. The American nation was also formed from a vastly diverse genetic pool from across the world. If it really is the Land of the Free and if, as is claimed, anyone really can become the president, you would fairly expect that the 43 presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush would express that genetic diversity. You're having a laugh. The presidents of the United States are as much a royal dynasty as anything in Europe, from whence their bloodlines came. Of those 43 presidents so far, 34 alone go back genetically to Charlemagne (742-814), an Illuminati bloodline and the most famous monarch of what we now call France. He was leader of the Franks, after whom we get the name France, and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, an Illuminati operation that controlled Europe for centuries. Burke's Peerage, the blue blood 'bible' of royal and aristocratic genealogy, is one of many genealogical sources to have highlighted the royal connections of US presidents. In the 1996 presidential election campaign involving Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Burke's Peerage revealed that the candidate with the most royal genes had won every single presidential election in US history. Clinton's victory over Dole and the illegal election of George W. Bush over Al Gore in 2000 have continued this sequence. Burkes Peerage confirmed in a Reuters report on October 17th 2000 that Bush and Gore had an \"unusual\" number of royal connections with Bush the most prominently connected. According to the report, Bush is related to every European monarch on and off the throne and has \"kinship\" (kingship) with every member of Britain's royal family. He is a 13th cousin of Britain's Queen Mother, who died in 2002 at the age of 101, and her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, once removed, of the heir to the throne Prince Charles, and has a direct descent from Henry III and from Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudor, who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. Bush is further descended from Charles II of England. Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said in the Reuters report: \"It is now clear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush have an unusually large number of royal and noble descents.\" After all these years of research it was far from unusual to me. Brooks-Baker said there had always been a significant \"royal factor\" in presidential elections with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue-blood links. Bush and Gore are especially well connected, it seems. \"In point of fact\", said Brooks-Baker, \"never in the history of the United States have two presidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances.\" Gore, a cousin of former President Richard Nixon, is a descendant of England's Edward I with direct links to the Holy Roman Empire through Emperors Louis II, Charles II and Louis 1. This made him another descendant of Charlemagne and a cousin of George W. Bush. Gary Boyd Roberts is a genealogist at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston and one of the foremost authorities on the royal ancestry of American presidents. He has confirmed that George W. Bush is descended from British royalty going as far back as the 12th century to King Henry I, the son of William the Conqueror. It was William who invaded Britain from France and won the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Prominent on William’s side were members of the St Clair family, a major Illuminati bloodline, a strand of which moved to Scotland and became known as Sinclair with their base at Roslyn Castle near Edinburgh. The St Clairs/Sinclairs were major players in the formation of the Knights Templar secret society, one of the most influential vehicles for the Illuminati for the best part of a thousand years. In other books I have detailed many other royal and aristocratic connections to the Bush family from their origins with the powerful Percy family in England that changed their name to Pierce when they fled to America after their involvement in the failed 'Gunpowder Plot' to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. Both father George Bush and his wife Barbara are from the Pierce line. The Gunpowder Plot was organised by the Jesuits, the secret society that controls the Roman Catholic Church and remains one of the most powerful expressions of the Illuminati to this day. The Bushes are also related to the aristocratic Anglo-American Grosvenor family from which come the Dukes of Westminster. They own great swathes of the most valuable real estate in London, much of it in the City of London financial district, a global centre for the Illuminati. In 2002, many years after I began writing about these blood connections of the Illuminati families, a genealogical website, www.Myfamily.com. revealed the bloodline links between the Bush family and British royalty, the aristocratic Spencer family of Princess Diana, and wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, who was an offshoot of the elite aristocratic dynasty, the Marlborough family of Blenheim Palace"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 25 in Oxfordshire. Another Illuminati front man, US Secretary of State Colin Powell, was revealed to have British royal connections together with Richard Nixon, the cousin of Gore. You will find a similar story all over the world. Credo Mutwa, the official historian of the Zulu nation, told me how so many black African leaders that were placed in power after the colonial masters gave the continent 'independence', came from the bloodlines of African kings and queens who claimed to descend from the same 'gods' as their white counterparts. Hiding the secrets Official history has been changed to hide the fact that the world has been controlled by the same interbreeding tribe for thousands of years. This is never more so than with the major religions. They all have inner and outer levels of knowledge. The inner level carries the secrets going back to the ancient Mystery schools of places like Sumer, Babylon and Egypt. These include\" the secrets of the bloodline and only the chosen few are initiated into this awareness. The outer level is where the secrets are hidden in code and allegory and sold, with a deity, to the masses as the 'truth'. The New Testament Gospel stories are based on the initiation ceremonies and esoteric secrets - including astrology and Sun worship - that were performed and communicated in the Mystery schools. But they are presented as a literal story to fool the people. The religions, not least Christianity, Judaism and Islam (all spawned from the same source) are carriers of the secrets (inner) and controllers of the people by hiding the secrets with allegedly 'literal' stories (outer). The same basic 'Jesus' tale of the Son of God who died for humanity was told around the world thousands of years before Christianity. This is related to the winter solstice or midwinter festival when the Sun is at the least powerful point in its cycle in the northern hemisphere. They said that on the solstice, our December 21/22nd, the Sun had 'died'. Three days later - the 25th - they said the Sun was born or born again. Thus we have a long line of Sun gods given the 'birthday' of December 25th. The Jesus of the Gospels in a symbol of the Sun and the stories include a host of other Mystery school knowledge and esoteric concepts. The theme of the open tomb or coffin is another example of what I mean. In the ancient Mystery schools, the chosen would lie in an open tomb to symbolise their death and rebirth into the secrets. This is why they have found a tomb in the Great Pyramid at Giza, but no mummies have been discovered either there or in any other pyramid. They were not burial chambers, but places of initiation in which the tomb / coffin- 're-birth' into the secrets - played a central part. Therefore, you find these tomb themes repeating through history in the secret societies and, in allegory form, in religious stories and ceremonies. Long before Christianity they had a ritual in Persia in which a young man, apparently dead, was restored to life. He was called the Saviour and his sufferings were said to have ensured the salvation of the people. His priests would shout \"Rejoice, O sacred initiated! Your God is risen. His death and sufferings have worked your salvation. I the same tale was told in Egypt about Horus, their Son of God, and in India it was told about Krishna a thousand years before Christianity. In the Gospels we have the story of Lazarus lying in his tomb and then 'rising from the dead'. The story of Jesus being laid dead in his tomb and then 'rising' is the same allegory for the initiation ceremonies in the Mystery schools. It is for this reason that the tomb or coffin ritual is performed by Freemasons and other secret societies to this day although it is only the very top levels of the network that know the real secrets and entry to that inner sanctum is by bloodline only. The blood in bloodline The bloodline families manipulate through this network of secret societies, ultimately controlled by the Illuminati. Many of these secret inter-connecting groups are bizarre in the extreme and the infamous Skull and Bones Society is one example of this. This is based in a windowless mausoleum appropriately known as 'The Tomb' alongside Yale University at New Haven, Connecticut and it was the inspiration for the Skulls movies. The Bushes are related to the Tafts, who provided President William Howard Taft and it was his father, Alphonso Taft, and another Illuminati bloodline, William Harrison Russell, who established the Skull and Bones Society. George W. Bush and his father are both members, as was the President's grandfather, the Hitler supporter and funder, Prescott Bush (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The Skull and Bones Society initiates 15 Yale students (bloodline) into its ranks' every year and they pledge allegiance to the society above all else for the rest of their lives. When its initiates become president of the United States or enter other positions of power, their first allegiance is to the agenda of the secret society, not what is best for the people or country they are claiming to serve. As I write, one of the Democratic presidential candidates planning to 'oppose' the Skull and Bones initiate, George Bush, is the Skull and Bones initiate, John. Kerry. In 2000, Ron Rosenbaum of the New York Observer and a team of others used high-tech night vision equipment to record a Skull and Bones initiation ceremony in the inner courtyard of 'The Tomb'. They witnessed a robed Bonesman posing as George W. Bush haranguing initiates in an \"eerily accurate Texas drawl\" saying: \"I'm gonna ream you like I reamed Al Gore\" and \"I'm gonna kill you like I"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 26 killed Al Gore.\" Rosenbaum reported that the Bush sound-alike appeared a bit disgruntled with his role and he complained: \"1 got the power to bomb the crap out of China and they give me this station?\" He also said, \"I'm the President of the motha-fuckin' USA\", sounding more and more like Bush, said Rosenbaum. Others were heard to shout, \"Take that plunger out of my ass!\" and initiates hurled sexual insults at each other like \"lick my bumhole neophyte (new initiate)\" as they were forced to kneel and kiss a skull at the feet of the initiator \"Lick my ass, neophyte!\" and \"Do you like my bum, neophyte?\" were also heard. Remember George W. Bush and his father have been through these rituals. Initiates were witnessed by the New' York Observer team acting out \"the tableau of a throat-cutting ritual murder.\" 4 One of the Patriarchs of The Order said: \"We ought to get better blood than this fuckin' syrup, man.\" Rosenbaum writes: \"[The initiates] were forced face-to-face with a shocking tableau: ,a guy holding what seemed like a butcher's knife, wearing a kind of animal-skin 'barbarian' look, stood over what seemed to be a woman covered in fake blood and not much else. The neophyte then approached a skull a few feet away from the knife-wielder-and-victim tableau. The neophyte knelt and kissed the skull, at which point the guy with the knife knelt and cut the throat of the prone figure. (Well, pretended to cut the throat.)\" 5 The rituals are full of death imagery and the initiates are told they must 'die to the barbarian world' and be reborn in the Elysian company of the elect of what they call 'The Order'. The ceremony of 're-birth' includes lying in a coffin (of course) and revealing all your sexual secrets to your fellow initiates. Another witness said he had seen a figure dressed like the devil, another in a hooded-skeleton costume and others in robes. The ritual also included the death mantra:. \"The Hangman equals death! The Devil equals death! Death equals death!\" It involved orders for the initiates to fetch bones, including the femur or thigh bone, and this is just one of the black magic secret societies that provide the personnel that control global events: As Rosenbaum said: \"It's an initiation ceremony that has bonded diplomats, media moguls, bankers and spies into a lifelong, multi-generational fellowship far more influential than any fraternity. It was - and still remains - the heart of the heart of the American establishment. \"But the relationships are first forged by the rituals and the fact that the founders of Time Inc. and the CIA, as well as several Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors - the men who made the decision to drop the Hiroshima bomb, invade the Bay of Pigs and plunge us into Vietnam, the Tafts, the Bundys, the Buckleys, the Harrimans, the Lovetts all took part in this initiation ritual may have something to do with'1M real world power of those bonds. The unspoken understanding, the comfort level with the clandestine, the nods and winks with which power is exercised.\" 6 If you think the Skull and Bones initiation is bizarre, you might consult some of my other books. What you have just read is mild compared with other rituals in which these people are involved. The Illuminati bloodlines have engaged in human sacrifice and blood-drinking ceremonies since ancient times and they still do. I am talking about the most famous people on the planet that you see on the news every day. When you realise what they do in these sacrifice rituals, often to children, you no longer need to ask how these people can order the slaughter of thousands and think nothing of it. The travelling empire The bloodlines, and the Illuminati secret society network through which they manipulate, has been the force behind many of the major Empires of history. In ancient times Sumer and Babylon were both headquarters for the 'Illuminati' in the land now called Iraq, and Egypt was extremely important to them also. It was the accounts, text~ and artefacts from Sumer and Babylon that were burned or looted from Iraqi museums in the wake of the American and British invasion. After Babylon, the Illuminati bloodline network moved its headquarters to Rome and it was during this time that we had the Roman Empire and the creation of the Roman Church or institutionalised Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church structure' controlled by the Jesuit secret society remains at the heart of Illuminati operations. The 'operational' headquarters moved into northern Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This was when the Dutch began to build their empire through the Dutch East India Company and they settled South Africa. In 1688, William of Orange, one of the bloodlines, invaded England from the Netherlands and took the throne as William III in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after her death in 169-l. In that year William signed the charter that created the Bank of England, and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking and manufactured debt has always been one of the main vehicles used by the bloodlines to control humanity. From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret society network moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course, \"vas the 'great' and enormous British Empire. This was not the Empire of the 'British' in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 27 This expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts of the world exported the bloodlines to every continent, including, most importantly today, North America. When the European empires began to recede and collapse, especially in the twentieth century, it appeared that these colony continents, like the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia, had won their 'independence'. Instead, the Illuminati bloodlines were merely exchanging open control for the far more effective covert control - manipulation of events by the Hidden Hand that the public has no idea exists. While these empires-were apparently being dismantled, the Illuminati left in their 'former' colonies, including the United States, the bloodline and the secret society network through which they operate. They have continued to control events in these 'former' colonies ever since, as part of a long planned agenda to impose centralised control of the planet and its people. This is designed to be secured through the structure I have outlined - a world government, army, central bank and currency; a microchipped population connected to a global computer; and a society based on constant and total surveillance of every man, woman and child. A ridiculous conspiracy 'theory'? Well have another look around and you'll see that this is happening now and never more blatantly than since September 11. The UK crime prevention charity Nacro says that the British government and local authorities have spent some £4 billion on surveillance in the last decade and involved up to three quarters of the Home Office crime prevention budget in the late 1990s. There are now more than two million cameras and the British are the most watched nation on Earth. But there has been only one Home Official study into their effectiveness and that concluded they are not always the best option. They are not being installed to stop crime, but to track the people, A spokesman for campaign group Liberty said: \"Our Government has developed an almost obsessive desire to gather and control more and more data on its citizens.\" 9 A stepping stone to the microchip is the identity card. These are being planned by Britain's freedom destroying Home Secretary, David Blunkett, under the name 'entitlement card'. Blunkett wants every resident aged 16 and over to have a compulsory card. It will have a photograph, personal computer-readable identification, including fingerprints and iris recognition, and a high-tech strip that allows civil servants and the police to link it into the Government’s national computer databases. Figure 3: Pyramids of Manipulation Hiding the real meaning of identity with entitlement is straight from the Orwellian Guide to the manipulation of language. This is appropriate because we are seeing unfold by the day, the very Big Brother society described by George Orwell (real name Eric Blair) in his famous book, 1984. Orwell was well aware that the society he described was possible, given the way the world was moving in his lifetime and the connections that he had. Pyramids within pyramids The Illuminati structure can be symbolised as a web or as a pyramid in which the few at the top dictate to the man at the bottom. The many are kept in ignorance of what is really going on. The pyramid structure of secret societies is mirrored in government, banking, business and every other organisation and institution. Society is structured like Russian dolls with one doll inside a bigger one until the biggest doll encompasses them all. The Illuminati replace the 'dolls' with pyramids (Figure 3). Only the few at the top of the pyramids know the real agenda and what the organisation is trying to achieve. The further you go down the pyramid the more people are working for the organisation but the less they know about its real agenda. They are only aware of the individual job they do every day. They don't know how their contribution (apparently innocent"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 28 in isolation) connects with those of other employees in other areas of the company government or whatever. They are 'compartmentalised' and the only people who know how it all fits together are the very few sitting at the top - the bloodline families and their lackeys. The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger and bigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all of the banks. It is the same with the translational corporations, political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military. If you go high enough in this structure all the translational corporations (like the oil cartel), major political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military (via NATO, for instance), are controlled by the same families who sit atop the biggest pyramids. In the end there is a global pyramid that includes all the others, the biggest' doll' if you like. At the capstone of this you will find the most elite of the Illuminati, the 'purest' of their bloodlines. In this way, they can coordinate through apparently unconnected, even 'opposing' areas of society, the same policies. All roads lead eventually to them - everything from the food we eat; the water we drink; the 'medical care' we receive, including vaccines; the 'news' we watch, hear and read; the 'entertainment' we are given; the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will of the governments; and the drug-running network aimed at destroying young people. The same families and their gofers control all of these areas and much more. This pyramid structure is how they have manipulated the explosion of centralisation in every area of life, government, finance, business, media and military. It is not by accident or natural occurrence, but by coldly calculated design. The outstanding Australian journalist John Pilger produced a rare and excellent expose of globalisation for British Independent Television in July 2001 in which he pointed out that just 200 corporations are now responsible for a quarter of the world's economic activity. But there is another level to this that we urgently need to understand. This pyramid system means that those '200' corporations are, in effect, one Corporation controlled by the same force. Globalisation is not just a group of greedy corporations seeking to maximise profit, it is far bigger than that. A perfect example of the Illuminati's compartmentalised pyramids was the infamous Freemasonry lodge in Rome called Propaganda Masonica Due or P-2. It was officially headed by the Mussolini fascist. Licio Gelli, who was a close confidant and financial advisor to the Argentina dictator, Juan Peron, and was invited to the inaugurations of Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Gelli called himself a friend of father George Bush, but then he was sure to be an associate of Bush given that he was a fascist orchestrating terror and murder. When Gelli's premises were raided by police in March 1981, they discovered 962 names on the P2 membership lists in his office safe and a suitcase. There were three cabinet ministers and 40 other MPs, 43 generals, eight admirals and hundreds of civil servants and diplomats, heads of the security services, the chiefs of police in Italy's four biggest cities, industrialists, TV stars and 24 journalists. P-2 also had a powerful foreign membership, including one of the most active Illuminati operatives of the last 40 years, Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary of State and war criminal. The CIA and Nazi International were also closely connected to P-2 (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more background). Like the Illuminati structure in every country, P-2 was a state within a state. The names of the P-2 members were only known to Gelli and his closest associates. Not even the other members knew all of the others. Gelli divided the membership into two divisions and then sub-divided them into a series of smaller groups. Only the leaders of these groups knew who their members were and they did not know the members of the other groups. P-2 members were controlled by the terror of knowing the horrific penalties of not doing as they were told. In this way, different Illuminati members and stooges can playa part in events like 9/11 without knowing how their contribution connected with those of other compartrmentalised people like themselves. Once the deed is done and they realise what has occurred they are too frightened to say anything because they know the consequences. Incidentally, Silyio Berlusconi, the crook, media tycoon and current Prime Minister of Italy, was a member of P_2.12 His friendship and 'meeting of minds' with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is, therefore, no surprise at all to me. Manipulating the herd Most people find it impossible to accept that a few people can manipulate the billions and operate through all institutions and countries. I understand that; but once you have the pyramids in place and you know how to condition the mind and reality of the population, it is relatively straightforward. When a few people wish to control and direct a mass of humanity, there are certain structures that have to be in place. These are the same whether you are seeking to manipulate an individual, family, tribe, town, country, continent or planet. First you haw to impose the 'norms', what are considered right and wrong, possible or impossible, sane or insane, good and bad. Most of the people will follow those 'norms' without question because of the baa-baa, herd mentality that has prevailed within the collective human mind for at least thousands of years. Second, you have to make life very unpleasant for those few who challenge your imposed 'norms'. The 'norms', or 'consensus reality', are essential to our control and, when I get to the main focus of this book a little later, this will be even more obvious and placed in an even greater context."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 29 The most effective way to do this in order to ensure compliance with these norms, is to make it difficult to be different. You make those who voice a different view, version of 'truth' and lifestyle, stand out like a black sheep in the human herd. You have already conditioned the herd to accept your norms as its reality and, through arrogance and ignorance, they ridicule or condemn those with a different spin on life. This pressurises the black sheep to conform and selves as a warning to those others in the herd who are also thinking of breaking away or challenging the prevailing reality. As I outlined earlier, this fear of being different and voicing a view that challenges the 'norms' is overwhelmingly the fear of what other people will think of us. In reality, the fear of what the sheep around us will say and do if we seek to leave the herd and question its conditioned assumptions. This mentality means that the masses are policing themselves and keeping each other in line. The sheep become the sheepdog for the rest of the herd. This is nothing less than psychological fascism - the Thought Police with agents in every home, everywhere. They are agents so deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unpaid mind-controllers. \"I'm just doing what's right for my children\", I hear them say. No, what you have been programmed to believe is right for them and the belief, also, that only you know best. This is all part of the divide and rule strategy so vital to the few controlling the many. Everyone plays a part in everyone else's mental, emotional and physical imprisonment. All the controllers have to do is set the 'norms', pull the right strings at the right time and make their human puppets dance to the appropriate tune. This they do by dictating what is taught in what we barely call 'education' and controlling what passes for 'news' through the Illuminati media. In this way they can dictate to the unthinking, unquestioning herd what it should believe about itself, other people, life, history and current events. Once you set the 'norms' there is no need to control every journalist or reporter or government official. The media and the institutions take their 'truth' from those same 'norms' and official statements, and ridicule and condemn by reflex action anyone who offers another vision of reality'. Sheeple wars The self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniform or administrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who impose their conditioning on their children and pressure them to follow their religious, political, economic and cultural norms. One extreme example is those who insist that their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because of the rules of their ludicrous religion. There are the children of Jehovah's Witnesses who have been denied lifesaving blood transfusions because their brain-dead parents insist on conducting every aspect of tl1eir lives according to the contradictory dictates of a book purveying so many stories of pure fantasy. The creation of the mental and emotional sheep pen of norms that imprisons 99% of humanity goes on minute by minute in subtle and less subtle ways. There are children of Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu parents who don't accept the religion, but still follow it because they don't want to upset their family. The sheep are keeping the other sheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyone who tries to escape. It is easy for a small group of interbreeding family bloodlines to control the lives (the minds) of billions, once the major institutions of 'information' are in place, as they have been for thousands of years in their various forms. There are not enough of these manipulators and their stooges to control the population physically and they have had to create a structure in which humans control themselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical imposition. Once you have the herd mentality policing itself, there is a third phase in this entrapment of human consciousness. You create factions within the herd and set them to war with each other. This is done by creating 'different' belief systems (which are not different at all) and bringing them into conflict. These belief systems are known as religions, political parties, economic theories and \"isms\" of endless variety. These beliefs are perceived as 'opposites' when, as I pointed out in my book, I Am Me, I Am Free, they are Opposi7!1les. Look at the opposames in politics. The far left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia, introduced centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. The 'opposite' of this was the far right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler. What did he impose? Centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. Yet these two opposames are set at war with each other amid propaganda that claimed they were opposites. The only difference between the Soviet Union and the so-called 'West' during the Cold War was that the Soviet Union was openly controlled by the few and the West was secretly controlled by the few. When you get to the capstone of the pyramid you find they were the same few controlling both 'sides'. The same force operating through Wall Street and the City of London funded all 'sides' in the two world wars and that's provable (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). So the methods of manipulation can be summarised like this: You need to first imprison the human mind with a rigid belief and a fundamentally limited sense of reality - the sheep pen. It doesn't much matter what these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigid and discourage free thought and open-minded questioning. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all the rest each make their contribution to human servitude while apparently~~, claiming different 'truths'."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 30 You encourage those who follow these rigid beliefs to impose them on others and make life very difficult and unpleasant for anyone who does not conform. You bring these beliefs into cont1ict to ensure the divide and rule you so desperately need for control by the few. While the masses are busy fighting each other, and seeking to impose their beliefs and idea's on each other, they don't see that the Illuminati have strings attached to all of them. Problem - Reaction – Solution There are techniques of mass manipulation thi1t people need to understand if they are to begin to see through the game. The main one I have dubbed 'problem-reaction-solution'. This has been used for thousands of years to advance the agenda and is one the most effective weapons of the Illuminati. Problem-reaction-solution is the key to understanding what really happened on September 11th 2001 and why. It works like this: you know that if you openly propose to basic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there will be a public reaction against it. So you don't openly and honestly propose such plans, you play the P-R-S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could be a coup attacking another, a government or economic collapse, or a 'terrorist attack. Anything in fact that the public will think requires a 'solution'. At stage two, you report the 'problems' you have covertly created in the way you wish the people to perceive them. Crucially you find someone to blame for the problem, a 'patsy' like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy was assassinated, or Osama bin Laden. You spin the background to these events in a way that encouri1ges the people to demand thi1t \"something must be done\". These are the words you want to hear because they allow you to move on to stage three, the sting. At this point you openly offer the solutions to the problems you have yourself created. These solutions, of course, involve the centralisation of power, the sacking of officials or politicians that are getting in your way, and the removal of more basic freedoms as you advance further to your global fascist state. Just think of the freedoms that have been removed because of 9/11. A more subtle part of the technique is to propose far more extreme changes than you expect to get away with because this allows any opposition to think you have compromised and met them halfway. But you know that you have other 'problems' in the pipeline to push the agenda on .. With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people will demand or at least allow you to introduce what, in normal circumstances, they would vehemently oppose. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19th 1995 was a problem-reaction-solution classic, as I explained in And the Truth Shall Set You Free and Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Ce1lter Disaster. What followed the death and destruction in Oklahoma were 'anti-terrorism' laws that sailed through Congress without challenge ~ removed fundamental freedoms from American people. Since September 11th, this agenda has been advanced in gigantic leaps. I don't share the attitudes of people like Timothy McVeigh, nor do I defend disturbed people like Osama bin Laden, but that's not the point. Establishing the truth of what happened is the point, no matter what the views and attitudes of those involved. It is called justice. The two most effective problem-reaction-solutions in the twentieth century were the two global wars. They changed the face of the world, as wars always do, and led to a massive centralisation of power. The United Nations, like its predecessor the League of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojan horse, or stalking horse, for world government. \"Journalistic\" junk The media play their part to perfection in these 'problem-reaction-solution' scenarios. At ownership level, people like Conrad Black at the Hollinger Group and Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation know what is going on. The editors they appoint might know something about it, as may certain columnists, but most of the journalists will have no idea. The editor is always there to block anything they write that is against the interests of the Illuminati - as directed by the owner-and if they insist on pursuing an unwelcome story they find themselves looking for another job. Most of the 'information' that journalists present comes from official (Illuminati) sources anyway. In the immediate aftermath of a major event such as September 11 th, where are the reporters getting their information from? Official sources! Name me a single piece of relevant information broadcast by the mainstream media about what happened on 9/11, how it was done, who did it and what the retaliation should be, that did not come from official sources. Not one! We are told that White House sources say this, FBI sources say that, and OA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminati transmit through the media the version of events they wish the public to believe. These reports are blazed across the front pages of newspapers and the top of radio and television news bulletins throughout the world, and what they say becomes the 'norm', the official 'history'. In the weeks and months that followed, researchers who are interested in the real truth begin to dig away. Over and Over the establish and document the proof of how the official version was a lie from start to finish. But where are their reports published? In small-circulation newsletters, self-published books, on the Internet and radio stations that operate with a fraction of the money and potential audience of the Illuminati empires. Therefore, years after"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 31 the official version has been demolished it still pre\\'ails in the public mind. Stop anyone in London, New York, Cape Town, Sydney, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September 11th, or in Oklahoma, the Second World War or Kosovo. Almost every time they'll give you the official story because that is the only one they have heard. If \\\\\"e had real mainstream journalism the problem-reaction-solution technique could not work. The official version of events would be investigated and shown to have no foundation. This fact would be communicated to the people and the public reaction, desired by the authorities, would not be forthcoming. But instead, we have media that is little more than a public relations office for the official version of life and that makes problem-reaction-solution a breeze for the manipulators. The 9/11 fairytale When I first heard about the attacks of September 11 th, 2001, I knew it was another problem-reaction-solution. It contained every element of the technique: the 'problem' of four airliners hijacked over two hours with no effective response from the military or government until the deeds been done; the immediate naming of the 'villain', Osama bin Laden, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever; the reaction of the people in accepting the official story and demanding that \"something must be done\"; and the 'solution', the destruction of basic rights, freedoms and privacy in the name of a 'war on terrorism' that has so tar cost the lives of more than 12 thousand (minimum) civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. From the day those planes crashed I began to investigate the official stony and not one strand of it fits with another. It is the Big Lie and I document the background, in great detail over 500 pages in Alice in Wonderland And the World Trade Center Disaster. The mainstream media merely repeated the lies of the US authorities and this became the accepted truth. It is a lie. When a copy of my book was sent to every major newspaper, radio and television news and current affairs show in the United States and United Kingdom they all ignored it, saw for one Scottish newspaper that interviewed me, but did not report the content. Osama bin Laden, a long-time asset of the CIA, was no more the orchestrator of 9/11 than 1 was, It was organised through the very agencies that gave the media the official version, How many people know that at least seven of the 19 hijackers named by the FBI are still alive? What did they do, parachute? How many know that the Bush family and the Bin Laden family have long been extremely close7 Or that the former head of the family construction business, Salem bin Laden, brother of Osama, ,vas an investor in President Bush's first oil company? Or that an investor in a later Bush company was Khalid bin Mahfouz, an associate of Bin Laden, who was named by the US State Department during the Clinton administration as a funder of the al-Qaeda terrorist network? Or that al-Qaeda was funded into existence by the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan? Or that the 'al-Qaeda' tunnel systems in Afghanistan were built by Bin Laden Construction with CIA money funnelled through Pakistan military intelligence, the ISI, which is the CIA branch in Pakistan? Yet again it is a case of the same force controlling two apparent 'sides' to the same end. President Bashar Assad of Syria has even doubted the continuing existence of al-Qaeda and I understand that. \"Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?\" he asked. Assad said Osama bin Laden\" cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world?\" As he pointed out, this is not 10gical.13 The official story of 9/11 is so blatantly preposterous that every effort has been made by the Bush administration to stop any inquiry into what happened. When he was forced into placating such demands, he announced an investigation to be headed by Henry Kissinger, one of the most prominent Illuminati operatives of the last more than 40 years. This was so outrageous even for Bush that Kissinger was forced by public pressure to stand down when he refused to name the clients of his Illuminati 'consulting firm', Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more about its activities). In May 2003, it \\\\ras revealed that Bush and the US intelligence agencies were blocking the release of sensitive information about the attacks and delaying publication of a 900-page congressional report on how the terrorist assault happened.1\" \"The White House is continuing a trend of presenting obstacles to us rather than cooperating with us\", said Tim Roemer, a former House member who participated in the congressional inquiry.]; They were trying to suppress the findings of a report that accepts as its basic premise that the foundations of the official story (Osama bin Laden did it) are true. Not even that level of inquiry is acceptable, never mind one that uncovers the real story - it was planned and carried out by forces within the United States. When the Congressional 'Inquiry' into 9/11 published its report in July 2003 the content was truly pathetic. 'Anti-terrorist' terrorists Once again I emphasise that what appear to be 'sides' in a conflict are invariably controlled or manipulated by the same force (Figure 4). The Illuminati operate through Islamic terror groups as they do through American and British terror groups, i.e. the US and UK governments. They appear to be two 'sides' on the nightly news, but at the top of the pyramid they answer to the same masters. As I was writing this book, a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 32 report by the United Kingdom's most senior police officer, Sir John Stevens, revealed what researchers had long known - the British Army and the Northern Ireland police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), had colluded with the largest loyalist terrorist group, the Ulster Defense Association (UDA), to murder Catholics. Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said that British military intelligence informants and agents \"were allowed to operate without effective control and to participate in terrorist crimes\". He also found that British military intelligence in Northern Ireland had helped to prolong the conflict and murder known as the 'Troubles' in the late 1980s. The Stevens Report detailed how: Actions or omissions by 'security forces' led to deaths of innocent people. Collusion by the 'security forces' was involved in the murders of solicitor Pat Finucane and student Adam Lambert. Three official inquiries into these events were wilfully obstructed and misled by the authorities responsible. Stevens defined collusion as the wilful failure to keep records; absence of accountability; withholding intelligence; and evidence and agents involved in murder. The inquiry established that the British Army's secret agent handling team, the Force Research Unit, recruited a former terrorist paramilitary called Brian Nelson to return to Northern Ireland and rejoin the terrorist Ulster Defense Association. Nelson, codenamed 6137, became the UDA's head of intelligence and supplied the army chiefs with the group's possible targets. Army Intelligence then basica14l' decided who was murdered. The Stevens team planned to arrest Nelson on January 10th 1990. When they returned to their secure headquarters before the arrest they found their offices ablaze. Fire alarms, telephones and heat-sensitive intruder alarms had been disabled. The fire destroyed many of their files, but fortunately others had been copied and moved to England. Brian Nelson fled Northern Ireland, but was later caught and jailed for ten years for conspiracy to murder, despite pleas on his behalf by Colonel Gordon Kerr of the British Army’s Force Research Unit. Nelson was released in 1999 and lived at a secret location in England. In April 2003 he died of a brain haemorrhage only days before the Stevens Report was published. How convenient. Such was the obstruction of the Stevens inquiry that the report took 14 years to deliver. Stevens said that he and his team were constantly spied upon and betrayed by police and army colleagues. He added that he was still determined to try to bring Pat Finucane's killers to justice and he was still investigating just how far up the chain of command the collusion might have gone. Try the top. Figure 4: The same force manipulates through both 'sides' to control the outcome and produce a 'movie' version of events to fool the people I highlight these findings because while it may have caused a stir in the United Kingdom to know that British Army Intelligence and the Northern Ireland police authority were colluding with terrorists to kill people, this is the rule not the exception across the world. It is happening all the time on a massive scale because the Illuminati agenda is the focus of these crackpots, not preventing terrorism and murder. This is what happened on September 11th. The 'anti-terrorist' organisations like the (top level of) the National Security Agency, CIA, FBI, the United States government and military, etc., were the forces through which the 9/11 attacks were both planned and allowed to happen. Genuine FBI agents were incensed to have their inquiries into terror groups in the United States blocked by FBI headquarters before 9/11 and President Bush ordered an end to investigations into the terrorist activities of the Bin Laden family in the United States in the months before the attacks (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 33 Days after September 11 th, at least 11 members of the Bin Laden family in America were allowed to leave for Saudi Arabia in a private jet from Boston Logan Airport. This was at a time when Osama bin Laden was the world's most wanted man and thousands of Arabs were being arrested and jailed without trial across the country just because of their name and skin colour. Why did this happen? The Bushes and Bin Ladens are long-time bosom buddies working to basically the same end. Personnel from the military and intelligence community have been placed in key posts in the Bush administration since 9/11, including General John A. Gordon, former deputy CIA director, as White House 'homeland-security [control] advisor'. The horrors of September 11th have been used, as intended, to further the agenda for global control and the destruction of freedom. Amnesty International's 2003 annual report says: \"The 'war on terror', far from making the world a safer place, has made it more dangerous by curtailing human rights, undermining the rule of international law and shielding governments from scrutiny.\" 16 The report accused governments of \"trampling over human rights in the name of fighting terrorism\". Put another way: problem-reaction-solution. Amnesty's secretary general, Irene Khan, said: \"What would have been unacceptable on September 10th, 2001, is now becoming almost the norm. What would have been an outrage in Western countries during the Cold War - torture, detention without trial, truncated justice - is readily accepted in some countries today for some people.\" 17 The report continues: \"Governments have spent billions to strengthen national security and the 'war on terror'. Yet for millions of people, the real sources of insecurity are corruption, repression, discrimination, extreme poverty and preventable diseases.\" IS But it does not suit the agenda to address such issues, quite the reverse, and so the suffering goes on. Totalitarian tip-toe The bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach or the totalitarian tip-toe as I call it. You know where you intend to lead people, but you realise that if you gave them the true picture or went there in one giant leap, you would face substantial opposition. So you travel to your destination in little steps and each one is presented in isolation and unconnected to all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to global centralisation. This technique was used most obviously with the super-state now known as the European Union. After the war if the politicians had suggested a centralised Europe with common laws and currency', there would have been an outcry. People would have said they had been fighting Hitler to stop just such a European dictatorship and there was no way they were accepting another. To overcome this, the Illuminati offered a 'free trade area' and even used the problem of their manipulated \"'odd \"'wars to encourage more cooperation between the countries of Europe. Once they had the free trade area their foot in the door, they began to expand its powers until it became the full fledged political and economic dictatorship that it is today. As I write, the plans have been released to introduce a new 'European Constitution' that would install a President of the European Union, a Foreign Secretary, and turn the countries of Europe into mere regions of the super-state. One of the organisations within the Illuminati web is called the Bilderberg Group and it has had a policy for a centrally-controlled United States of Europe since its official formation in May, 1954. Britain was taken into the European trap by Prime Minister Ted Heath (Bilderberg Group), and this policy was supported by his 'opposition' Labour Party of Harold Wilson (Bilderberg Group), James Callaghan (Bilderberg Group) and Denis Healey (Bilderberg Group). The new' European Union constitution was officially proposed by former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing (Bilderberg Group) and is supported by Tony Blair (Bilderberg Group). I have been writing for years that one of the reasons Tony Blair was placed in office was to take Britain into the single European currency, the Euro and a centrally-dictated United States of Europe. This is who, no matter what tilt' arguments are against this surrender of freedom, or the public feeling about these plans, he will seek to press the changes through. He has refused demands for referendum on the European constitution because he knows he would lose. The referendum he was forced to promise on the euro will involve Illuminati operatives from all areas of society, frightening the public into agreement with threats of economic disaster if we don't give up the sterling. The same superstate structure is planned to be introduced through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), the 'free trade area' for Asia and Australia; and the African Union that replaced the Organisation of African Unity in 2001. I said in And The Truth Shall Set You Free in 1995 that the AFTA 'free trade area' would be expanded to the whole of the Americas as the next stepping stone to a centrally controlled American Union. In 200], George \\Y Bush attended the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, at which this expansion of NAFL\\ throughout the Americas was agreed. Look at today's newspapers and television news bulletins and you see problem-reaction-solution and the totalitarian tip-toe played out day after day. One extremely effective way to see through this manipulation is to keep asking yourself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: \"Who benefits from me believing this version of events, or accepting the solutions and changes being offered as a result?\" The answer will be almost every time: anyone who wishes to centralise power and suppress more of our"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 34 freedoms. Politics, economics, big business, the military, the media, religion and all the rest are part of a vast web of inter-connected manipulation designed to persuade the masses to put themselves in prison and throwaway the key. The Illuminati work through every belief system, religious, political, economic, racial and cultural- and through every side in the major 'debates'. If you want to know the outcome of a game before the game has even started, you need to control all sides. The manager of a football team cannot dictate the result if he only controls one side. If, however, he is managing both sides, he can ensure the result he wants before a ball is kicked. So it is with the Illuminati, the Hidden Hand behind the events that affect our lives and our world every day. We should be aware, when contemplating what happened in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11 the, that the Illuminati operate through secret societies in the Near and Middle East every bit as much as they do in the United States and the so-called 'West'. We see this manipulation of both sides in the protests against globalisation. To control the public perception of these gathering protests the Illuminati have organised their own agents provocateur to start the violence we see on the news broadcasts. See my website www.davidicke.com for more background to this, including the account of how mainstream journalists watched the police lines open up at a protest in Spain to allow a group with weapons and masked faces to walk through to the peacefully protesting crowd. This group then started to attack each other, thus 'justifying' a police charge on the peaceful gathering in which people were battered by these uniformed head cases. Once the police intervention had begun, the journalists watched the group who started the trouble walk calmly back through the police lines to be driven away in police vehicles. One was asked if he was a policeman. \"Yes\" was his first reply when caught off-guard, but he then denied it. Done deal It is the totalitarian tip-toe that explains why political leaders push ahead with policies no matter what the evidence or the views of the people. They are following the agenda and nothing is allowed to get in the way. The invasion of Iraq is an obvious case. This was decided long before it happened, as we shall see, but George Bush and Tony Blair continued to say that war was not inevitable when they knew the date the troops were going in. Public 'debate' is just part of the smokescreen to hide the agenda and give the people the illusion that they live in a free and open society. The European superstate, fluoride in public drinking water and genetically modified food are all examples of the 'done deal' with regard to Britain while Tony Blair tells the people they are not. The manipulation of the 'debate' in the United Kingdom on genetically modified or 'GM' food is a classic of its kind. Blair said he wanted a public debate on the issue and then delayed all scientific reports into the potential (lethal) dangers of it until after the 'debate' had taken place. Michael Meacher, the Secretary of State for the Environment sacked by Blair in 2003, has since highlighted the lack of research and the serious risk posed by GM food. He has also confirmed that Tony Blair appeared uninterested in the science and was determined that GM food be given the go ahead. Of course that is the case. G\\1 food worldwide is the Illuminati plan because it will (a) create the health and genetic changes in humans that they want to introduce; (b) undermine the human immune system; and (c) make every grower on the planet no matter how' poor, dependent on the seeds of the translational (Illuminati) and the prices they charge for them. Control and population reduction is \\\\'hat G\\1 food is all about. The corporation behind GM foods is the appalling Monsanto in St Louis, Missouri, that has been featured many times in my books, It is Illuminati to its fingertips and the Bush administration is awash with its personnel. When you question the Blair (Illuminati) line, as with Bush in the United States, the consequences can be brutal. Dr Arpad Pusztai is considered the world expert on GM food with more than 270 published studies relating to the subject. He was working at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, when he was inteviewed for a World in Action television documentary on August 10 th, 1998. What he said was to destroy his career because of the reaction of Tony Blair. Dr Pusztai told a programme that rats fed on certain GM potatoes had suffered stunted growth, damage to the immune system and their liver, heart and other organs got smaller. He said this was also the case with the brain, but he had not mentioned that to avoid being \"alarmist\". He said of GM food: \"If I had the choice I would certainly not eat it.\" 19 On the evening the interview was broadcast, Dr Pusztai was congratulated for his contribution by Professor Philip James, Director of the Rowett Institute. The next morning the Institute issued a press release highlighting the \"range of carefully controlled studies underlie the basis of Dr Pusztai's concerns Forty eight hours later he was suspended and ordered to hand over all his data. His research team was disbanded and he was threatened with legal action if he spoke to anyone on the subject. Eyen his personal assistant was banned from talking to him and he was alerted to an Institute press release that his contract was not being renewed. His wife was also sacked. Dr Pusztai was to have two heart attacks and his wife was put on permanent medication for high b1ood pressure. The Rowett Institute lied and lied about the reasons for their disgraceful treatment of Dr Pusztai, as was later proved. The truth was that his comments on GM food, coming from such a world class source, had threatened to b10w apart the Illuminati plan. He had to be destroyed with the usual vindictiveness. Dr Pusztai is certain that his demise was G1Used by Tony B1air."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 35 He says that the day after the World ill Action programme, two phone calls were made by Blair's office to his boss, Philip James, and the next din he was fired.' Dr Pusztai says he was told by a senior manager at Rowett that Blair's intention was prompted by a phone call from United States President Bill Clinton. The story was confirmed by Professor Robert Orskov, one the Britain's top nutrition researchers, who worked for Rowett for 33 years. He said he was told that phone calls went from Monsanto to Clinton and then to Blair. \"Clinton rang Blair and Blair rang James\", he said. \"There is no doubt he was pushed by Blair to do something. It was damaging the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom because it was going to be a huge blow for Monsanto.\" 21 David Hill, the director of Good Relations, the Monsanto public relations company in the UK, ran the media campaign for Blair's Labour Party in the General Election victories of 1997 and 2001.23 Another eminent researcher, Stanley Ewen, said that he was told the same story by another senior figure at Rowett: \"That conversation is sealed in my mind. My jaw dropped to the floor. I suddenly saw it all - it was the missing link. Until then, I couldn't understand how on Monday Arpad had made the most wonderful breakthrough. and on Tuesday it was the most dreadful piece of work and rejected out of hand.\" 24 The vicious campaign against Dr Pusztai was as coordinated as it was callous. Reports attacking him were published by the Illuminati Royal Society - the scientific establishment exposed in my other books - and by the Science and Technology select committee of the House of Commons with its pro-Blair majority. Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham, another Blair , condemned Dr Pusztai's \"wholly misleading results\" and said that all GM food in Britain would be safe to eat.25 But how does a prat like Cunningham know-that, compared with the world's leading authority? It has nothing to do with truth or protecting the public. It is political business. GM food is a done deal. The Blair government is one of the most corrupt in all British history and it has fundamental ties to the biotech industry. In its first two years in office GM food companies met government officials and ministers 81 times.26 Blair's unelected Science Minister, Lord Sainsbury, is a dedicated supporter of GM food. When he was appointed he held large shareholdings in the biotech companies, Diatech and Innotech, which were placed in a 'blind trust' so that he could not knowingly benefit from decisions he makes in government. Oh please. Has he forgotten he has them then? He made £20 million profit in four years from Innotech and such wealth allows him to be the biggest single donor to Blair's Labour Party with payments of more than £8 million since it came to power.27 But what of Professor James, the head of Rowett, who also felt the wrath of dictator Blair? At the time he enjoyed good relations with Blair and had been chosen to head the planned Food Standards Agency. But that changed after Dr Pusztai made his comments. \"You destroyed me\", he told Dr Pusztai.28 This is how the Illuminati work to stifle dissent and mislead the public. You want to advance your career? OK, do what we want and you'll be fine. Speak your mind and we'll destroy you. Anyone still wonder why only sycophants surround these people? Fresh air money One of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control of humanity is the money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple and spans the period from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based on creating money that doesn't exist and lending it to people and businesses in return for interest. This creates an enormous debt for governments, business and the general population and allows you to control them. Vital to this has been permitting bankers to lend money they do not have. If you or I have a million pounds we can lend a million pounds. But if a bank has a million pounds it can lend ten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction of the people who theoretically have money deposited in a bank went today to remove it, the banks would slam the door in half an hour because they don't have it. Money in the bank is a myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bank does not print a single new note, nor mint a single new coin. It merely types the amount of the loan into your account. From that moment you are paying interest to the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, if you fail to pay back that non-existent loan, the bank can come along and quite legally take your wealth that does exist, your home, land, car and possessions, to the estimated value of whatever figure was typed on to that screen - plus interest. More than that, because money is not brought into circulation by governments, but by private banks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money is in circulation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money is in circulation. What is the difference between an economic boom (prosperity) and an economic depression (poverty)? One thing only - the amount of money in circulation. Through this system, the private banks, controlled by the same Illuminati families, decide how much money will be in circulation. They can create booms and busts at will. It is the same with the stock markets through which these families are making trillions of dollars a day around the financial and banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash. Stock market crashes don't just happen - they are made to happen. Why would the Illuminati do this when they have so"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 36 much money invested in these markets? If you know the crash is coming because you are going to cause it, you know to sell at the highest point and buy back in once the crash has happened. In this way you can increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at a fraction of the cost before your manipulated collapse. Most of the 'money' in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It is represented by figures passing from one computer account to another electronical1y via money transfers, credit cards and cheque-books. The more money, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economic activity can take place and the more products are bought and sold, the more income people ha\\'e and the more jobs are available. But a constant theme of this Illuminati financial coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loans and then pulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economists and economic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tell you that boom and bust is part of some natural 'economic cycle'. It is not. It is systematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth of the world. During a boom many people get themselves into more debt. The vibrant economic activity means that businesses borrow more for new technology to increase production to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house and a more expensive car because they are so confident of their economic prospects. Then, at the most opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by the Illuminati network, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans and begin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewer loans than before. This has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in its various forms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leads to fewer jobs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate the necessary economic activity. People and businesses can no longer earn enough to repay their loans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their real wealth, their business, home, land, car and other possessions in return for non-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen. This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the last few centuries, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of the population and into the hands of those who control the banking system - the Illuminati bloodline families. The same applies to countries. Instead of creating their own interest-free money, governments borrow it from the private banking cartel and pay the interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation of the people. A fantastic amount of the money that you pay in taxes goes straight to the private banks to pay back loans of 'money', which governments could create themselves interest free! Why don't they do it? The Illuminati control the governments as much as they control the banks. What we call 'privatisation' is the selling of state assets in response to bank-created debt. The world's poorest countries are handing over control of their land and resources to the Illuminatl\"\"1:iankers because they can't pay back the loans made, on purpose, by the banks to ensnare them in this very situation. The world/does not have to be in poverty and conflict. It is manipulated to be that way because it serves the agenda. 'Third World' debt was manufactured to replace physical occupation of resource-rich or strategically situated countries under colonialism with today's financial occupation. The way they created this situation is told in detail in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Once a country is indebted to foreign banks, even though the money is non-existent credit, they are forced to hand over control of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy at every level. It all leads to the same cabal, the Illuminati, and the same word: control. One other point to emphasise is the way that we are paying for our own prison at every turn. The Illuminati own the banking system and every time we put money in a bank or borrow from one we are funding the agenda for global dictatorship. It is the same when we buy from translational corporations, like the food, fuel and drugs that people purchase from the food, oil and pharmaceutical cartels- Think of everything we buy from the Illuminati global network of companies - including television and the rest of the media - and every time we are filling the coffers of our prison builders. But it doesn't stop there. The Illuminati also control the governments and how their money is spent. Our tax money funds the agenda and we are taxed on everything: our income, what we buy, even what we insure. Almost every human activity is taxed. If you worked out how much of our income we actually keep when we take all this into account we would be staggered at how much is taken by those who claim to be serving us. Even sex is taxed -and how. When the rubber is imported for a condom, the government charges a tax. The company making the condom is taxed for buying the rubber and on the profit it makes from the sale, and the employees are taxed on their wages. The company transporting the condom to the shops is taxed on the profit and there are taxes for using their vehicles. The driver is taxed on his income. The shop selling the condoms is taxed on the profit and the person who makes the sale is taxed on their wages. The customer is then charged sales tax, what we call VAT in Britain, for the privilege of buying the condom. No doubt there will soon be a tax on using it. Speeding and parking fines are another form of taxation and on-road parking is a perfect example of how we are manipulated to pay for the same thing many times. In this case we pay through taxation for the roads to be built and maintained (when often they are not); we pay road tax for the right to use our car; we pay massive tax to the government in the fuel we buy and when we have our vehicles serviced and repaired; then, having paid out all this, we are forced to pay to park our cars on the very roads we have already paid"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 37 for. If we don't we are fined and that money also goes to the Illuminati governmental system. Speed cameras are not there to stop accidents; they are another source of revenue for the authorities to use to further imprison us. Everywhere you look we are financing our own prison cell. Criminal bankruptcy When you begin to look behind the movie screen or more appropriately under the stone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN. Some researchers and lawyers reveal that in the 1930s the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many others officially declared bankruptcy, but somehow forgot to tell the people. This apparently happened during the five years of the Geneva conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and 1932, but it seems that they don't publish the volume containing the details of the bankruptcy declarations. The bankers said that either the countries declared bankruptcy to the Illuminati banks or there would be no loans to get them out of the deep global depression at that time. They accepted official bankruptcy to the global banking system and this meant, in effect, that the banks have owned those countries ever since.:' Actual\"', I say countries, but the United States is not actually a country, but a corporation, as revealed in my previous books and many other published works and studies. ~o doubt we will find that the situation is the same in other countries too. This bankruptcy is in the United States Congressional Record of March 17th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303). James Traficant Jr of Ohio told the House: \"Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any Bankrupt entity in world history. the US Government. We are setting forth hopefully, a blueprint for our future. There are some who say it is a coroner's report that will lead to our demise. \"It is an established fact that the United States Federal Government has been dissolved by the Emergency Banking Act. March 9. 1933, 48 Stat. 1. Public Law 89· 719; declared by President Roosevelt. being bankrupt and insolvent. H.J.R. 192. 73rd Congress m session June 5, 1933 ? Joint Resolution To Suspend The Gold Standard and Abrogate The Gold Clause dissolved the Sovereign Authority of the United States and the official capacities of all United States Governmental Offices, Officers, and Departments and is further evidence that the United States Federal Government exists today in name only. \"The receivers of the United States Bankruptcy are the International Bankers, via the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. All United States Offices, Officials, and Departments are now operating within a de facto status in name only under Emergency War Powers. With the Constitutional Republican form of Government now dissolved, the receivers of the Bankruptcy have adopted a new form of government for the United States. This new form of government is known as a Democracy, being an established Socialist/Communist order under a new governor for America. This act was instituted and established by transferring and/or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund. Public Law 94-564, page 8, Section H.R. 1~5 reads in part: 'The US Secretary of Treasury receives no compensation for representing the United States'. \"Why are 90% of Americans mortgaged to the hilt and have little or no assets after all debts and liabilities have been paid? Why does it feel like you are working harder and harder and getting less and less? We are reaping what has been sown, and the results of our harvest is a painful bankruptcy, and a foreclosure on American property, precious liberties, and a way of life. Few of our elected representatives in Washington DC have dared to tell the truth. The federal United States is bankrupt. Our children will inherit this un-payable debt, and the tyranny to enforce paying it.\" James Traficant was later jailed for alleged bribery and corruption because he was getting too close to the truth on many issues affecting the Illuminati agenda. The United States corporation was created behind the screen of a 'Federal Government' when, after the manufactured 'victory' in the American War of 'Independence', the British colonies exchanged overt dictatorship from London with the far more effective covert dictatorship that has been in place ever since. In effect, the Virginia Company, the corporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the 'former' colonies, simply changed its name to the United States and other related pseudonyms. These include the US, USA, United States of America, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and 'Feds'. The United States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia and the current president of the corporation is a man called George W. Bush. He is not the president of the people or the country as they are led to believe, that's just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a 'war on terrorism' on behalf of a private corporation to further the goals of that corporation. It had nothing to do with' America' or 'Americans' because these are very different legal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the United States military and everything else that comes under the term 'federal'. This includes the Federal Reserve, the 'central bank' of the United States, which is, in reality, a private bank owned by controlling stockholders (and controllers of the US Corporation) that are not eyen American."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 38 This is the bank from which the United States Corporation borrows 'money'. The Federal Reserve was manipulated into existence in 1913 and dictates the United States interest rate that has a massive knock-on effect on the rest of the world. The Federal Reserve or 'Fed' is currently headed by Alan Greenspan, a member of Illuminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. His predecessor was Paul W. Volker of ... the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The United States Corporation is owned by families and forces in Europe and the Jesuit-controlled Vatican is at the heart of this covert ownership, of not only the United States, but major European 'countries' like the United Kingdom also (see Appendix I). 'Floating' courts The privately owned corporation known as the United States is the holding company, if you like, and the 50 states are its subsidiaries. This means that these states also declared bankruptcy, or had it declared for them by the holding company, the 'Federal Government', but the people never knew and still don't. You can get the detail about this elsewhere and I am only summarising the situation to give people an idea of how deep this conspiracy really goes, The sting has been set up so that when you register with the 'Federal Government' in any \"' by accepting a Social Security number, driver's licence, or any of the other official federal documents, you are, unknowingly, agreeing to become an asset-employee of the United States Corporation. From that moment you become responsible for financing the corporation's state of bankruptcy, When you pay taxes or a court or parking fine and such like, you are servicing the bankruptcy by paying that money to government agencies that are nothing more than debt-collecting agencies for the creditor banks. The US court system operates under corporate law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to administer the bankruptcy and fleece the sheep to pay back the ongoing debt. This is also known as British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always has a gold fringe when displayed in the courts of the United States. You find the same in government buildings and federally funded schools. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sitting under British Maritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code - military and merchant law not common or constitutional law, under the Admiralty Law of Flags, the flag displayed gives notice of the law under which the ship (in this case the court) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship (court) accepts by doing so that they are submitting to the law indicated by that flag, Judges refuse to replace the flag with one without a fringe when asked by defendants who know the score because that changes the law' under which the court is sitting. If you appear in a court with a gold-fringed flag your constitutional rights are suspended and you are being tried under British Maritime (military /merchant) Law. The Uniform Commercial Code was approved the American Bar Association, which is a franchise, a subordinate branch, of the British legal system and its hierarchy based in London's Temple Bar (named after the Illuminati Knights Templar secret society). As I have been writing for many years, the power that controls America is based in Britain and Europe because that is where the power is located that owns the United States Corporation. By the way, if you think it is strange that a court on dry land could be administered under Maritime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicable in the following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the state. In other words, mainland America. All this is founded on Roman law because the Illuminati have been playing this same game throughout the centuries wherever they have gone. The major politicians know that this is how things are and so do the government administrators, judges, lawyers and insider 'journalists'. Those who realise what is happening and ask the court for the name of the true creditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the 'legal system' are always refused this information by the judge. The true creditors in such cases, and the ultimate recipient of the fines, are the bankers to which the corporation 'country' is bankrupt. More and more people in the United States are refusing to register in any way with the Federal Government, as news and documentation of this bizarre situation continues to circulate. If the authorities can keep this fantastic deceit from the mass of the people since the 1930s, you can appreciate why they were confident they could ensure that what really happened on September 11th stays comfortably under wraps. Throughout this book I will refer to what is thought to be the government of 'America' as the United States or the US and when I talk of the 'US government' and similar terms, I am referring to the privately owned United States Corporation that is masquerading as the 'government'. It is not the government of a nation or country, it is a private corporation acting purely in the interests of the families that own and control it. The' American' president is the corporation's chief executive officer. The (shitty) City "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 39 It is the same story in the United Kingdom. When the authorities talk of the 'The Crown', they are not referring to the King or Queen, but 'The City', a privately owned Corporation (sovereign sh1te) consisting of 677 acres at the heart of the urban sprawl known as 'Greater London'. 'The City' has a population of 5,000 while Greater London is home to eight million, but in that small area massive global power is wielded. 'The Crown' is a actually committee of 12 to 14 men who rule the independent sovereign state known as 'The City', which is not a part of England and not subject to the Sovereign nor the rule of Parliament. It is headed by a Lord Mayor who is elected for one year and is always a Freemason. The sitting monarch has to bow to the Mayor when he or she wishes to enter the City and must ask for his permission. He meets the monarch at Temple Bar, named after the Knights Templar. I have included more background to the City and its secret society web in The Biggest Secret, but this is where the United Kingdom and much of the wider \"( world is governed from - including the United States and Canada. Figure 5: Two track reality: the Illuminati agenda hides behind a -movie' version of events sold to the people through the media, \"Bin Laden did it\" and \"weapons of mass destruction\" are perfect examples The British Prime Minister and his or her government are subordinate to these people just like the Monarch. The British monarch is also a subordinate representative of the Pope (in other words the Illuminati network that controls the Vatican, especially the \" Jesuits). One confirmation of this was the Peace Treaty between the American Colonies and the British 'Crown' ('the City') in 17~3, which states the following: \"It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by the grace of God, king of Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc., and of the United States of America ... \" (My emphasis.) The United Kingdom, or rather 'the City', controls the United States, yes, but as a vassal of the Roman Church, which owns Great Britain and Ireland (see Appendix I). There you have a summary of the background and history to the global conspiracy and the techniques used to hoodwink the people into believing they are free when their most fundamental rights to freedom of expression and freedom of choice are being curtailed by the day. The Illuminati agenda for the centralised global dictatorship and the 'movie' to fool the people are running side by side. They are two 'tracks' or story boards (Figure 5). Track one is the 'agenda' - the secret agenda for global control; track two is the public 'movie' - the version of events 'reported' through the mainstream media that is designed to hide the agenda and justify its introduction. When the 'agenda' requires something to be done, the 'movie' is scripted to sell the people a cover story for why that needs to happen. When the 'agenda' requires the conquest of Iraq, the movie bangs out the mantra of 'weapons of mass destruction'. When it demands the conquest of Afghanistan, the 'movie' tells the populous that Bin Laden was behind 9/11 and he is based in Afghanistan supported by the Taliban. The reason so many lies can be identified in the cover stories is because that is just what they are: stories. They are inventions to dupe the people into accepting another stage of an agenda they have no ideas exists. These 'double tracks' also explain why you find the people involved with the secret 'agenda' are also supplying weapons to the very dictators they say must be removed because of those weapons. Once you realise how the game works it is no longer a mystery why those offering the solutions are those creating the problems in the first place.

All the oil. Anywhere. Michel Collon The pioneers of a warless world are the youth who refuse military service. Albert Einstein Since September 11th, the Illuminati agenda and manipulation techniques have become ever 1nore blatant as they have used the United States and Britain to impose their global control. I am going to look in detail at the appalling events that have followed 9/11, especially the invasion of Iraq and the 'war on terrorism', because the hidden hand of the Illuminati and their methods of operation could not be more obvious. Understanding this is vital to preventing a repeat throughout the world. I have described the background to the invasion of Afghanistan in considerable detail in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. They used the excuse of their own terrorist attacks on September 11th to invade a stone-age country in the middle of a famine and impose their own regime under the puppet leadership of Hamid Karsai. He is a former advisor to the major Texas-based oil company, Unocal, which planned to build an oil and gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea region across western Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan, but could not do so while the Taliban were in power. There is an Illuminati frenzy to control and tap the enormous reserves of oil and gas around the Caspian Sea and, because it is land locked, they need to build pipelines to transport it to world markets. Countries like Afghanistan and Iran are on the potential pipeline routes (Figure 6). Unocal had no problem negotiating with the Taliban through the 1990s to build their pipelines across Afghanistan and nor did the US State Department. However, public opposition to the deal in the face of the Taliban's human rights abuses, not least against women, made the deal impossible. Unocal pulled out of the project in 1997 saying that the pipeline could not be built until an internationally recognised regime was in power in Afghanistan. Thanks to 9/11 and the claims that the 'Afghanistan-located' CIA-asset, Osama bin Laden, was responsible (based on no evidence), the Illuminati-controlled United States and British governments could send in the bombers to remove the Taliban and replace 'them with the Unocal employed Hamid Karsai. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 42 Figure 6: The pig-trough frenzy to control the massive Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves is one major reason why the US government, supported by Britain's Tony Blair, targeted Afghanistan after 9/11, This is the approximate route of the Unocal pipeline On December 31st 2002, after the removal of the Taliban George W. Bush appointed a man called Zalmay Khalilzad as his 'special envoy' to Afghanistan to oversee the 'transition' to the new post-Taliban regime. Khalilzad, an Illuminati operative, was chief consultant to Unocal on the Afghanistan pipeline project! He co-wrote in the winter 2000 issue of The Washington Quarterly: “Afghanistan could prove a valuable corridor for this [Caspian Sea] energy as well as for access to markets in Central Asia.\" He had tried to overcome the problem that the Taliban was not internationally recognised by publicly lobbying for the US government to 'reengage' with the regime that caused untold murder, torture and suffering, and he defended the Taliban against allegations of sponsoring terrorism.! It was partly on Khalilzad's advice that the Clinton Administration funded the Taliban through Pakistan intelligence, even paying the salaries of high-ranking Taliban officials.2 So long as the Taliban played the game with the pipeline, who cares what they do to their people? When this plan went pear-shaped and the pipeline had to be shelved, Khalilzad changed his position to suit the circumstance~. As a State and Defense Department official during the Reagan-Bush administrator, he helped to supply the Mujahadeen with weapons during the occupation by the Soviet Union, the period when Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were funded and armed by the United States. As Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan, it was Khalilzad who helped to oversee the change-over from the 'transitional' government led by fellow Unocal front man, Hamid Karsai, to the fully-fledged' Afghanistan' government with Karsai again the puppet president answerable to the United States. As a result of this, the pipeline that Karsai and Khalilzad were both employed to make happen, is now going ahead. Surprised? Khalilzad comes from one of the old ruling elite families in Afghanistan and his father was an aide to King Zahir Shah, who ruled the country until he went into exile in 1973. Thanks to the installation of Hamid Karsai, a representative of Zahir Shah, the king returned to the Presidential Palace in Kabul in 2002. Since the removal of the Taliban the opium production in Afghanistan has soared to fuel the heroin market, controlled by the Bush family and their associates and masters, exactly as planned. Zalmay Khalilzad was later appointed by Bush to be his envoy to Iraq, so he could play the same scam there in arranging for a US-controlled 'Iraqi' government to replace Saddam Hussein. More about Khalilzad shortly - there is plenty to know. According to plan The invasion of Afghanistan, like 9/11, had been planned for a long time and it was the same with the conquest of Iraq in the spring of 2003. Time magazine reported that during a briefing for three senators by the National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, in March 2002, President Bush poked his head into a White House meeting room and bellowed, \"Fuck Saddam. We're taking him out!\" 3 This was a year before the invasion and yet, only weeks before the troops went in, we had Bush, Blair and their fellow travellers in government still saying that war was not inevitable!! If they ever told the truth they would have a seizure from the shock The plan to take Control of the Gulf region using Saddam Hussein as the excuse was in place long before Bush and the rest of his Illuminati mafia were illegally placed in power against the will of the people in late 2000. An article by writer Nicholas Lemann in the New Yorker revealed that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Dick Cheney, now the Vice President, formed a group to plan a strategy for the 1990s and beyond.4 This group included the current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the current Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the current Secretary of State Colin Powell and Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, Cheney's chief 0 staff. The aim was to 'shape' the world in their desired image or, as another ~. member, Zalmay Khalilzad, put it ... to \"preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future\". Yes, the same Zalmay 'Unocal' Khalilzad who would be named Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan before 9/11 followed by the same role in Iraq at the time of the invasion. Lemann says he was shown a copy of the document Cheney's group put together called Defense Strategy for the 19905: The Regional Defense Strategy, Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, January 1993. This was the month that Bill Clinton was inaugurated and Cheney and father Bush left office. This 'strategy', planned in the early 1990s, is pretty much what the boy Bush and Cheney government is doing today - a government controlled by the people who put the document together. The 'war on terrorism' was a response to September 11 th? Sure. Still more confirmation of this came with the publication of a secret document produced for the yet-to-be-not-elected Bush administration in September 2000, a year before 9/11 and two and half years before the troops were sent into Iraq. The document was called Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources For A New Century; and was produced in September 2000 by the neo-conservative 'think-tank' called The Project for the New American Century (PNAC). You can read it in full at the PNAC website.5 This organisation was created in 1997 by people like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and the report was produced for ~ themselves and other highly significant names that are today at the heart of the Bush administration, including Paul Wolfowitz, now Rumsfeld's deputy at the Pentagon, and Lewis Libby,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 43 Cheney's chief of staff. Bush's younger brother, Jeb, the governor of Florida during the rigged presidential election, was also involved. The usual crowd in other words. Details of the document were published by the Sunday Herald in Scotland 6 and the contents precisely~ mirror events instigated since Bush and his controllers came to power. It is a blueprint for US (Illuminati) global domination that reveals how Bush and his cabinet were planning to invade Iraq to secure 'regime change' even before they entered the White House in January 2001. The PNAC report says: \"The United States has for decades sought to playa more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\" 7 Note that phrase \"provides the immediate justification\". This is why Bush, Blair, Powell and Co lied and lied and used bogus \"inte11igeitce'~to desperately make a . case for the war in Iraq. They didn't have a reason, so t1'\\ey had to invent one, as they did with Afghanistan, to follow the hidden agenda. Their first choice was 'weapons of mass destruction', a term that was repeated over and over on the basis of the more times you say something the more people are likely to believe you. As with 'Bin Laden did it', there was no proof or even evidence, only constant repetition of what they want the public to believe (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster for the Bin Laden background). When Hans Blix and his UN weapons inspectors found nothing to support the claims about weapons of mass destruction, Blair and Powell became ever more desperate, detailing \"compelling intelligence\" that the weapons existed. This I evidence' turned out to be stolen virtually word for word from an analysis written 12 years earlier by a postgraduate student in California, but it was presented to· the public as the work of British intelligence. It was lifted from an article by Ibrahim al Mirashi and even spelling and punctuation errors from the original were repeated. They did, however, change words to· make them sound more sinister. Iraqi intelligence \"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq\", became \"spying on foreign embassies in Iraq\". Even that is nothing more than the CIA and British Intelligence do themselves. \"Aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes\", was upgraded to \"supporting terrorist organizations in hostile regimes\" .. I'm too sexy for my lies Andrew Gilligan, a BBC Defense and Diplomatic correspondent, said he had been told by a significant source (later confirmed as British weapons inspector, Dr David Kelly) that a dossier on the Saddam 'threat' was changed by Blair's office on the orders of his minder and Spinner-in-Chief, Alastair Campbell.8 The intelligence report had not been \"very revelatory\" when it arrived at Downing Street, Gilligan says Kelly told him, but it was\" transformed to make it sexier\". It was embellished to manipulate the people into supporting the war and included the outrageous claim that Saddam could deploy weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes. Two other BBC reporters were told by Kelly in milder terms than the Blair press office (controlled by Campbell) changed the wording of the dossier. Blair said the BBC story was\" as serious' an attack on my integrity as there could possibly be\".9 But how can you attack something that does not exist? Campbell was 'cleared' of the 'sexing up' allegation by a committee of MPs only on the casting vote of the chairman, a member of Blair's own Labour Party. This was done even though the committee acknowledged that its work had been \"hampered\" by the refusal to allow them access to intelligence papers and security services personnel! Hampered?? How can they make a decision about Campbell when they can't even interview1those involved? They have to take his word for it, basically. Outrageous. Campbell later announced he was resigning as Blair's 'Mr Spin', but the manipulation of the public mind will continue because lies are essential to the cover story. ' Then came the strange death of Dr Kelly, the source of Gilligan's report. He was 'outed' by Geoff Hoon's Ministry of Defence after he told them that he met Gilligan and could be the source of the report that had caused the government to make concerted attacks on the BBC. Kelly was given a rough time by the Blair-controlled House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee when he appeared before then\\. to be questioned about what happened; A few days later he went for a walk in the countryside near his home in Oxfordshire .and did not return. He was found in a secluded wood with his wrist cut and the official story was that he committed suicide and bled to death. The inference was that the pressure had made him do it. But this is the same David Kelly who faced the wrath of the Sad dam regime as a weapons inspector after the 1991 Gulf War and coped with something similar from Russian officials during an investigation there. This guy could stand his ground. Shortly before he left on his 'suicide walk' he emailed associates with \"combative\" comments about the pressure he was under from \"many dark actors playing games\". He said he hoped it would all blow over and he could get back to Baghdad and get on with the work that really mattered. When he left his home, his wife, Janice, was unconcerned. Although she knew her 59-year-old husband was deeply upset, his mental state did not seem to be too down. Walking was a hobby and he often disappeared for up to two or three hours. Paul Weaver, a local farmer, greeted Kelly as he strode through the fields close to his home and there was nothing to suggest a suicidal man. \"He smiled and said hello\", Weaver recalled"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 44 lO Kelly had family matters to look forward to like the marriage of one of his daughters in October. He was devoted to his wife and family and he did not show signs of someone who was about to kill himself. But then he was found dead, the police say, in an isolated wood with his wrist slashed with a pen knife. There was no goodbye to his wife and family, nothing. Does this make sense to you? Me neither. Blair's Ministry of Mendacity also said there was a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda until intelligence sources leaked the news that they had found no such connection. Intelligence professionals in the United States have taken a similar line. A group of retired intelligence operatives said in a letter to President Bush: \"There is one unpardonable sin. Cooking intelligence to the recipe of high policy. There is ample evidence that this has been done in Iraq.\" 11 A member of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency told the New York Times: \"The American people-were manipulated.\" 12 Clare Short, who resigned as Blair's international development secretary in protest at the spin, said he had misled the public over the scale of the threat posed by Iraq to ensure support for the war. \"I have concluded that the PM decided to go to war in August sometime and he duped us all along\", she told the Sunday Telegraph. \"He had decided for reasons that he alone knows to go to war over Iraq and to create this sense of urgency and drive it - the way the intelligence was spun was part of that drive.\" 13 His reasons were to follow the agenda of his unseen masters who put him into power and can either keep him there or cause his downfall. Short said that Blair secretly agreed with George Bush in the autumn of 2002 that they would invade Iraq the following spring \"come what may\".14 The secrecy that followed, in which even Blair's cabinet was kept out of the loop, hampered the planning for the aftermath of the war and helped to produce the \"chaos and suffering\" that ensued, she said. Decisions were~~ made in Blair's office in calls to President Bush, Short revealed, and in phone conversations between Blair's foreign policy advisor, Sir David Manning and 1J~National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice. Short said Blair had lied ~bout wanting a second United Nations resolution supporting the invasion; he had lied by claiming that Iraq was \"an immediate threat to us in 45 minutes\"; and he lied that French President Jacques Chirac would veto a second resolution under any circumstances. This was not true, said Short,15 Tony Blair lies more often and more obviously than any other British politician of modem times (despite the fierce competition) and one reason he gets away with it is because it is beyond the comprehension of many that anyone could lie so constantly and blatantly to the people he is supposed to serve. Well, he can and does - every day. So do Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell and their cabal. They are following the techniques of the Nazis, as outlined by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf: \"All propaganda must be so popular and on such an intellectual level that even the most stupid of those toward whom it is directed will understand it. People can be made to perceive paradise as hell, and the other way round, to consider the most wretched sort of life as paradise.\" 16 In the United States, leaked information from the Department of Defense revealed that a top secret report by the Defense Intelligence Agency in September 2002 concluded they could find no evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq. Some CIA officials distanced themselves from the Bush administration claims that Iraq posed an imminent threat. They said these claims were based on information given directly to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld by Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the CIA-funded Iraqi National Congress and the man the Pentagon would like to be leader of Iraqi. More about him later. Reports quoted CIA sources as saying that Chalabi's 'information' was deeply suspect and largely based on hearsay from other defectors with vested interests in regime change (they made it up). Bob Graham, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the media that classified evidence that supported the Bush claims about Iraqi weapons was made public, but he said that as a member of the Intelligence Committee he saw much evidence that didn't support its case. \"That evidence was never declassified\", he said. All this when the United States and Britain have access to a satellite surveillance system that can read your number plate from space and this is how the Airman magazine described the capabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq: \"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake~, California. The images it gathered were so clear that an electro optical image stands out next to a FA-18 Fighter. An infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\" And they couldn't locate :weapons of mass destruction'? Or find Bin Laden? Or Saddam Hussein? Fakes and fantasy Colin Powell and the United States claimed that a document existed to show that Niger had sold uranium to Iraq for nuclear weapons. This' document' was exposed as a crude fake by the International Atomic Agency. Joseph Wilson, the US ambassador to Gabon from 1992 to 1995, wrote in the New York Times how he had been hired by the CIA to investigate the alleged Niger connection and had found\" no evidence. He communicated his findings to the US government and he said:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 45 \"Based on my experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war, I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.”18 They lied. Powell told NBC: “It was the information that we had. We provided it. If that information is inaccurate, fine.”19 No, darlin', it was information you made up to manipulate the people and that's not fine. Quite simply, you were caught lying, Mr. Powell, the exposure of which is hardly brain surgery. Remember how Powell presented his 'evidence' to the United Nations Security Council with his make-believe charts, 'intelligence' satellite photographs and recordings of phone calls by Iraqi officials? All bullshit - and he knew it. It was the same with the drone aircraft that we were told could attack the East Coast of the United States. Pure invention to sell a lie. When Bush and Co were caught out on the 'Iraq nuclear plans' fabrication they arranged for the CIA chief, George Tenet, to take the blame to protect them. He said it had been a CIA “error” At the same time the Americans were distancing themselves from the 'nuclear' statements, Tony Blair was still saying that the intelligence was correct. Mixed up the song sheets there then? Powell told the United Nations in February 2003 that Saddam had authorised his field commanders to use chemical weapons. So why weren't they used when the US and Britain invaded? And why weren't the weapons he authorised found when the Iraqi 'army' was overrun? The United States Army commander in Iraq said after the war that nothing had been found to show the country's military was prepared to use them on US forces. Lieutenant-General William Wallace, commander of the army's 5th Corps, said US forces had uncovered \"no evidence of him trying to employ them directly against US troopS”.20 Why the hell not? I thought Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' were a threat to the world and yet they aren't even used to defend their own country from invasion and takeover? Powell was lying, as he was with his claims that Saddam's weapon-making units were housed in trucks moving from place to place. It would be laughable if the outcome of the mendacity had not been so tragic for the people of Iraq. Behind Powell when he made his UN address were blue drapes hung that morning to cover a massive tapestry reproduction of Picasso's famous anti-war painting called Guernica. The UN's Stephane Dujaric, said: “We needed the right background that would work on television.\" Yeah, OK. Powell also said that they had intelligence proof. that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, but could not give details for fear of exposing the informants to danger. Excuse me if I fail to believe that people like Powell really give a damn about exposing anyone to danger so long as the agenda is served. And hold on. How would it expose informants to danger if the US had simply told the UN inspectors where to look? With Saddam's regime removed, there was no danger at all to informants. So why didn't the Americans immediately follow their 'intelligence proof' and find the weapons? Months after the war began, there was still nothing. The British cabinet minister, David Blunkett, is a former 'socialist' and now, in my view, the most right wing Home Secretary of modem times. He said even while the war was going on that no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction may be found, and yet this was the 'justification' for the war. He said that, in any case, he rejoiced at the 'fall' of Saddam Hussein and his regime regardless of whether any weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq or not.21 Unbelievable. But I still would not be surprised to see 'weapons' of some kind 'found' once they have managed to ship them there! As the lies were exposed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that Saddam may have destroyed the weapons before the war started! Err, so why was there a war? Why didn't Sad dam make this mass destruction very public to avoid being invaded? Rumsfeld's 'deputy' and the real power in the Pentagon, Paul Wolfowitz, told Vanity Fair that the claims about Sad dam's weapons capability were used to justify the war for \"bureaucraticreasons\".22 It was \"the one \" reason everyone could agree on\", he said. The other factor he described as \"huge\" was that an attack would allow America to pull its troops from Saudi Arabia and resolve a major grievance held by al-Qaeda. Oh, so the 'war on terrorism' involves giving in to the alleged terrorists, then? What nonsense. Pulling the troops out of Saudi Arabia is part of a strategy that will eventually send them back in again to take the country over. But the best excuse for not finding weapons of mass destruction came, naturally, from George W. Bush. He said in his weekly radio address on Sunday, June 22nd 2003, that they had been looted!! When the alleged weapons were not found in Iraq -or had not yet been planted - it was claimed that the finding of mass graves were justification enough for the war. What they didn't tell you was that those graves were overwhelmingly the result of uprisings being put down by Saddam after the 1991 Gulf conflict. These rebellions were the result of encouragement from President father George Bush, who then refused to support them and left the people to their fate - mass graves. Shooting the messenger The United Nation's Hans Blix said that American officials tried to discredit the work of his weapons inspectors in Iraq to further their own case for war. He told the BBC of his \"disquiet\" at how the documents the International Atomic Energy Agency \"had no great difficulty finding out were fake\", managed to get"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 46 through US and UK intelligence analysis. Also disturbing, he said, was the question of who was responsible for the falsif~cation.23 As usual the fake documents to make the case for an Illuminati war did not\" get 'through US and UK intelligence analysis\"; they faked them in the first place, as per normal. After the conflict the United States and Britain refused to allow Blix and UN inspectors to return to Iraq to search for the alleged weapons. Instead, the provided its own inspection teams. Blix called for experts 'to return to the country to determine whether the weapons allegations had any foundation. Are you kidding? Does he really think the criminals in the US and British administrations are really going to allow him back to prove they have been lying all along? Tony Blair dismissed demands from members of his own Labour Party for an inquiry into how the public was misled about Saddam's 'weapons of mass destruction' that were cited as the reason why the war was necessary. He knows a proper, truly independent inquiry, would expose his mendacity. Retired CIA intelligence analyst Ray McGovern, a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, said: \"Some of my colleagues are virtually certain that there will be some weapons of mass destruction found, even though they might have to be planted. I'm just as sure that some few will be found, but not in an amount that by any stretch would justify the charge of a threat against the US or anyone else. Even if the planting was discovered by and by, they'll say, 'OK, the weapon were planted fine”. And remember: these genetic liars are the same people who have told the world what happened on September 11th, who did it, and how - the official story of 9/11 that has been used to 'justify' all that has followed. The idea that the invasion was about 'liberating' Iraqis is a grotesque joke. They were so desperate to sell the idea of an international 'coalition' that they included in their laughable list of supporting countries the Solomon Islands and Tonga. The Solomon Islands doesn't even have a military! By March 30th 2003, Donald Rumsfeld was telling Fox [propaganda] News that the 'coalition' had now ~ to 66 countries. It was simply another lie. Allan Kemakeza, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, said his country was not part of the coalition,' despite being listed.25 The Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rop said the same and Croatia was listed even though its president, Stipe Mesic, condemned the war on Iraq as ~-\"illegitimate\".26 The Czech Republic was listed when its president, Vaclav Klaus, said that anyone who 'thinks democracy can be imposed on Iraq is \"from another universe\".27 Or as investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen wrote in Counter Punch: \"Klaus means that people like Bush, Tony Blair, Rumsfeld and the other neo-Crusaders are just plain nuts. Indeed they are.\"28 But if you haven't got support, invent some. If you haven't got an enemy, invent one. Author Joseph Schumpeter said of the [Illuminati] Roman Empire: \"There was no comer of the known world where some interest was not alleged to be in danger or under actual attack. If the interests were not Roman, they were those of Rome's allies; and if Rome had no allies, the allies would be invented.\" 29 The Bush message was: \"If you support us we are going to war with Iraq, if you don't support us we are going to war with Iraq.\" It’s the mentality of the playground bully. People have asked why Bush and Blair would not listen to arguments for allowing UN weapons inspectors more time to search for the alleged 'weapons of mass destruction' and took no account of-the Massive global protests or opinions of other governments. The answer is that they were following the agenda of their unseen masters and nothing was going to divert them from that. They wouldn't dare. Inmates control the asylum Blair, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and their like, knew they were peddling false information for no other reason than to provide the \"immediate justification\" to move into the Gulf in line with the Illuminati's long-time strategy for global control. The Project for the New American Century report for the Bush cabal in September 2000 planned a \"blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests\".3O What it calls this \"American grand strategy\" must be advanced for\" as far into the future as possible\" and it says that the US must \"fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars\" as a \"core mission\",31 American armed forces are described as \"the cavalry on the new American frontier\".32 The report also said: Allies like the UK are \"the most effective and efficient means of exercising American . global leadership\" . Peacekeeping missions demand \"American political leadership rather than that of the United Nations\" .. Even should Saddam pass from the scene, bases Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will remain permanently, despite domestic opposition in the Gulf regimes to the stationing of US troops, as \"Iran may well prove as large a threat to US interests as 1raq has\", North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iran are dangerous regimes and their existence justifies the creation of a \"world-wide command-and-control system\" [World Army] China should be targeted for \"regime change\" and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 47 the report says \"it is time to increase the presence of American forces in Southeast Asia\" that may lead to \"American and allied power providing the spur to the process of democratisation in China\". \"US Space Forces\" should dominate space and it calls for the total control of cyberspace to prevent \"enemies\" [anyone exposing the agenda] using the Internet against the US [Illuminati], \"The US should consider the use of biological weapons and that “new” methods of attack –electronic, ‘non-lethal’, biological – will be more widely available ... combat likely will take place in new dimensions, in space, cyberspace, and perhaps the world of microbes .. advanced form of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of the terror to a politically useful tool,.\" 33 Once again, note the language: \"specific genotypes\" - the biological targeting of particular races. Who said Hitler was dead? A major target for Illuminati genocide are the black peoples, especially of Africa, and that is why the manufactured I Aids' plague has been visited on that continent. I found it so sad that Live Aid's Bob Geldof could be so naive as to praise President Bush for helping Africa when the forces working through Bush are determined to destroy its people. The strings attached money Bush pledged to \"fight Aids\" in Africa is a round of drinks compared with the wealth stolen and extorted from that continent by the 'West' every year. The sick minds behind this biological warfare targeting \"specific genotypes\" are the same people who had the nerve to say that Iraq must be invaded because it had biological weapons or, as their Newspeak mantra puts it: ''Weapons of mass destruction.\" The veteran Labour Member of Parliament, Tam Dalyell, said of the PNAC report: \"This is a blueprint for US world domination - a new world order of their making. These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world. I am appalled that a British Labour Prime Minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing.\" 34 But they are not fantasist Americans as such. They are fantasist initiates and pawns of the Illuminati that have placed their operatives in positions of power within the US government. Their focus is not with being American or what is best for Americans, but with using that nation to progress the Illuminati agenda for the gobal fascist state. The reason that Tony Blair is so slavishly supporting the 'US' no matter . what happens is because he is also an Illuminati placeman who is there to serve his hidden masters, just like Bush. Do as you are told, guys, and you'll be fine. Fail to deliver and \"Houston, we have a problem\". They are far more terrified of those ~who control them than they are of the consequences in public popularity. The Bush group's blueprint for global domination summarised above is clearly unfolding by the month with the Iraq phase underway and Syria, Iran and North Korea already being targeted by the spinners who demonise countries as a prelude to invasion. The resistance they are facing in Iraq, however, is making their plans far more difficult and . the lack of 'weapons of mass destruction' has produced an increasingly sceptical public. Blair's credibility is in tatters. It's not as straightforward as they thought it was going to be. People may find the mention of China as a target to be a staggering suggestion, but, as I have mentioned in my books, talks and interviews for years, many different contacts have told me that it was all leading to a manipulated conflict with China. In my book, The Biggest Secret, published two years before the Project for the New American Century document, I wrote: \" ... The plan is to engineer events, real and staged to create enormous fear in the countdown years to 2012. This includes a plan to start a ·third world war either by stimulating the Muslim world into a 'holy war' against the. West or by using the Chinese to cause global conflict. Maybe both.\" 35 A CIA scientist I met in 1997 was only one of many people who have told me that a conflict with China is where the agenda is leading. They want a global war for the same reason they wanted the two in the 20th century. A global problem opens the way to a global solution - the creation of a world government and army to \"prevent another war\". With the world economy in a catastrophic state after such a conflict the way would be open for a world central bank and currency to \"rebuild the financial system\". And, of course, we would need to microchip the people to protect them from the baddies. Who benefits from 9/11? Now what was the trigger for the 'war on terrorism'? What has been the foundation of the cover story for global conquest by what is nothing less than the Fourth Reich? Why, of course, it is the attacks of September 11th, which President Bush called \"Our Pearl Harbour\". Welt well, well. The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) document, produced a year before 9/11, says that their blueprint for conquest or their \"process of transformation\" was likely to be long and slow\" absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -like a new Pearl Harbor\". And what happened at just the right moment to advance their plans dramatically? 9 /11. The American Free Press asked Christopher Maletz, assistant director of the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 48 PNAC, what was meant by the need for\" a new Pearl Harbor\". He said they needed more money to increase the defense budget for new arms and future capabilities. \"Without some disaster or catastrophic event the politicians and the military w~ have not have approved this\", Maletz said.36 Thanks to 9/11, Congress allocated $40 billion to fund the 'war ( on terrorism' and the 2002 military budget alone was,$34S.7 billion with further massive rises to come. This is exactly what the PNAC document called for and, because of 9/11 it is happening. Coincidence? Can a ~hale fit in a matchbox? In truth, this is not an 'American' agenda for global conquest, that's just the cover to hide the fact that what we are seeing happen is the Illuminati agenda that I, and many others, have been exposing all these years. The United States is just their vehicle, that's all. They couldn't care less about those who call themselves American any more 'than they could those in any other country. Neither is the Project for the New American Century report just the work of a few loony right-wing fanatics, as is claimed. It is a summary of part of the Illuminati agenda as it is planned to' ' proceed over the next few years. Look at the personnel of the PNAC and the network of connecting organisations. They have become known as 'neo-cons': Donald Rumsfeld (PNAC founding member): Defense Secretary in the 'war on terrorism', who is ensuring that the blueprint produced by his own organisation comes to pass. Rumsfeld visited Baghdad in 1983 to arrange for the shipment of chemical and biological weapons Saddam Hussein from the Reagan-Bush administration and in 2000 he was on the board of the European engineering company, ABB, when it supplied nuclear technology to North Korea. This is yet another example of the secret agenda and the movie running alongside each other. Rumsfeld was involved in supplying the 'problems' that the movie could later claim made action necessary against Iraq and North Korea. Paul Wolfowitz (PNAC founding member): Deputy Defense Secretary, whom Bush calls \"Wolfie\". He is a far right supporter of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) - 'a \"think-tank that puts Israel and its security at the heart of US foreign policy\".37 Wolfowitz, who has relatives in Israel, has also served as the Bush administration's liaison to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and has extremely close ties to the government of Israel. This is just the background you need to be seen as impartial on Middle East policy. Wolfowitz is the real power at the Pentagon, more so than Rumsfeld. Rarely is the person officially in charge the one who is really in control. Dick Cheney (PNAC founding member): Vice President and on the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ijinsa. He was Defense Secretary to father George Bush during the 1991 Gulf War and he's the real power in the White House behind the village idiot. Cheney was head of the oil services giant, Halliburton, -from 1995 to 2000 when the company enjoyed contracts with Saddam Hussein's Iraq and worked with other terrorist dictatorships to line their pockets. Cheney is a very disturbed entity indeed (see my other books). Lewis Libby (PNAC founding member): Chief of Staff to Cheney, close friend, confidant and protégé of Wolfowitz. He served in father George 13ush's Defense Department and is closely connected with the Illuminati Rand Corporation, or companies, and the defense contractor, Northrop Grumman, which, like the Rand Corporation, enjoys massive contracts with the Pentagon. Libby was a lawyer for convicted felon and Israeli spy Mark Rich, who was pardoned by Illuminati front. man and crook, Bill Clinton, in his last days as president. James Woolsey: another Jinsa member and former director of the CIA-from 1993-95, who was apparently lined up to become the minister of 'information' in the post-war Iraq. Can you imagine a CIA chief as minister for 'information'? Woolsey, a member of the US Policy Defense Board at the Pentagon, said he believes the United States is going to be involved for several decades in helping to \"change the face\" of the Middle East.38 He also said: \"We will make a lot of people very nervous and we will hear, for example, the Mubarak regime in Egypt or the Saudi royal family thinking about the idea of these Americans spreading of democracy in this part of the world. They will say you make us very nervous. Our response should be ... good.\" 39 Woolsey studied at Oxford University between 1963 and 1965 when he was awarded an Illuminati Rhodes Scholarship (just like ~ill Clinton). See And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more on the Rhodes Scholar network. John Bolton: served with the State Department, Justice Department and the government's international 'aid' agency, USAID, under father George Bush. He is now under-:secretary for arms control and international security in the State Department. Bolton is a major player in the policy on Iraq and was also one of Bush's chad-counters during the rigged election in Florida. He is a member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ijinsa) and is a vice-president at the far-right American Enterprise Institute as well as being involved with the Project for the New American Century. Bolton is reported to think the 'war on terrorism' is World War Four and could take 40 years to finish."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 49 Jeb Bush: brother of the brain cell and Governor of Florida during the election fraud that stopped Al Gore becoming president. The Bush family is corrupt to its core and fundamentally' connected into the Illuminati web as my other books have extensively detailed. Zalmay Khalilzad: the Afghanistan-born American who was made special envoy to Afghanistan before the war that installed his fellow Unocal employee, Hamid Karsai, as leader. Khalilzad authored a book on Saddam with Wolfowitz called Overthrow Him and encouraged his close friend, George 'Illuminati' Shultz, the former Reagan-Bush Secretary of State, to use Iran to bring down Sad dam. Like Lewis Libby, he has worked for the Illuminati Rand Corporation and he also served under National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, when she was a director of Chevron, a company that stands to benefit enormously from the conquest of Iraq and the pipelines across Afghanistan now that the Taliban have gone. Khalilzad has close connections to both events. Once his job was done in Afghanistan, Khalilzad was appointed Bush's 'special envoy' to Iraq to play a similar role by installing a US puppet-government. He was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, an 'intellectual' centre for the American right wing. He became a special advisor to the State Department under Reagan-Bush when he was very much involved in the arming of the Mujahadeen fighting the Russian occupation and this included Osama bin Laden and what became al-Qaeda. He later became undersecretary of defense to father George Bush and headed the .transition team for the Defense Department, advising Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after boy Bush was manipulated into power. He was then appointed to the National Security Council and reports to his old. friend at Chevron, Condoleezza Rice. Elliott Abrams: pleaded guilty on two counts of lying to Congress about the IranContra arms-for-drugs scandal, but was pardoned by father George Bush. Abrams tried to cover up the murder of hundreds of civilians at EI Mooted by an elite US trained military unit in EI Salvador. In 1993 a UN truth commission, which investigated 22,000 atrocities during the twelve-year El Salvador civil war, found that 85% of the abuses were the 'work of the Reagan-Bush-Abrams-supported rightwing military. Condoleezza Rice appointed Abrams, as, get this, Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights and International Operations at the National Security Council in 2001. A year later she\"n1.ade him Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs, including Arab-Israel relations and American efforts to promote \"peace and security\" in the region. Abrams is on the advisory board of the Media Research Center, an organization that opposes liberalism on television or in films. John Negroponte: the Bush ambassador to the United Nations with a horrific history. He was a major aide to the US embassy in Vietnam from 1964, an advisor to the war criminal Henry Kissinger, and in charge of Vietnam policy on the US National Security Council. In the 1980s he carried out the covert policy of Reagan-Bush to destroy the elected Sandinista government in Nicaragua and in Honduras he administered a massive increase in US military support for the right-wing government. It soared from $4m to $77m and the country became known as USS Honduras. Negroponte was also fundamentally involved with the infamous Battalion 3-16 in Honduras that ran a terror campaign of murder and torture against the people. Richard Perle (PNAC founding member): former Assistant Defense Secretary to Reagan-Bush, a leading member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) and the chairman of the far-right American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on 17th Street in Washington, which has Cheney's wife, Lynne, among its membership. Fourteen members of this AEI organisation are in the Bush cabinet and others are elsewhere in the administration. Bush told an AEI conference on February 26th, 2003: \"At the American Enterprise Institute some of the finest minds in our nation are at work in some of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my administration has borrowed 20 such minds.\"41 Perle has so many of his associates in the Bush government that they are known as the \"string of Perles\".42 At the Pentagon, Perle was nicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness\" for his hard-~e beliefs and he introduced a number of staunchly pro-Israel activists who dramatically increased weapons sales to Israel. He is a former employee of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, Soltam. Perle is a member of several other ~-wing groups like the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (along with James Woolsey, the former CIA chief and member .9f the Project for the New American Century), and he is referred to as the \"neo-cons political godfather\". Perle is a former aide to one-time Israeli premier, ·Benjamin Netanyahu, and in 1996 he simultaneously advised both the Bob Dole campaign in the United States and the Netanyahu campaign in Israel. Perle was also advisor to the lobbying firm run by Douglas J. Feith, the Pentagon's under-secretary of defense. Before the invasion of Iraq, Perle advised clients of the investment house, Goldman Sachs, about investment opportunities in Iraq when the US was in control. He is a director of the software company, Autonomy Corp, which includes the Pentagon among its clients. Autonomy says it expected its profits to increase dramatically after the war. Perle is a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the Pentagon. Another member is Henry Kissinger, a major Illuminati operative of the last 40 years. Perle had to resign as chairman of the Board when conflicts of-interest were exposed. My god, how many? He resigned"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 50 after it was reported he had worked as s consultant to the bankrupt telecommunications company, Global Crossing Ltd., which was trying to get Pentagon approval to be sold to Asian investors. The Los Angeles Times revealed that Perle briefed an investment seminar on ways to profit from the conflict in Iraq and North Korea just weeks after he received a top-secret government briefing on the two countries.44 The Defense Intelligence Agency briefing that Perle attended took place in February 2003, the Times reported, and he held his seminar three weeks later. The Times further cited agendas of the meetings· and other ·documents to show that Perle and fellow advisers received a classified address about military communications systems. Perle runs Trireme Partners, a venture capital firm that has been exploring such high-tech investments.45 \"The guiding principle here is that you do not give advice in the Defense Policy Board on any particular matter in Which you have an interest\", Perle said. \"And I don't do that. I haven't done that.\" 46 I think old Rich has another guiding principle, myself, although principle is not the word that comes immediately to mind. Perle told the BBC: \"The President of the United States on issue after issue has reflected the views of neo-conservatives. I think he comes to his view in his own way and through his own experience, but it happens to track very closely with the outlook of neoconservatives, especially since 9/11.\"47 Firstly, Bush doesn't have any experience, nor a mind that could assimilate it; and second, the 'neo-cons' manipulated Bush into the presidency to front their agenda and he does whatever they tell him. Michael Ledeen: Wow. Another member of the American Enterprise Institute and involved in the 1970s in the \"shadowy world of right-wing Italian politics\".48 Ledeen has close ties to Henry Kissinger, the Illuminati 'Roman Catholic' front, Opus Dei, and the Italian P-2 Masonic Lodge involving his associate, Licio Gelli, a far, far, :right Illuminati operator (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free).49 As I mentioned earlier, Gelli, a Mussolini fascist and Knight of Malta, was the Grand Master of P-2. It was involved in the murder of the Italian politician, Aldo Moro, and other terrorist outrages by the so-called Red Brigade. P-2 and Gelli-were behind the Vatican banking scandal featuring \"God's Banker\" Roberto Calvi who was silenced by being ritually murdered under Blackfriars Bridge at the entrance to the City of London (And the Truth Shall Set You Free has the background). Francesco Pazienza, who is also reported to be close to Michael Ledeen ,so was suspected of setting up Calvi for murder and at the time of his death Calvi's family said he was killed by Opus Dei. Gelli and Pazienza, both associates of Ledeen, were jailed for their crimes, but not before Gelli was invited to the inauguration ceremony for President Ronald Reagan, the puppet for father George Bush, in 1981. Gelli and P-2 were closely connected with the Priory of Sino, the secret society going back with the Knights Templar to the 12th century and dedicated to the advancement of the Merovingian (big-time Illuminati) bloodline (see The Biggest Secret). When the Italian authorities raided Gelli's Roman villa in 1~~1, they found files listing members of affiliated secret societies that formed a “cabal within a cabal”. These included Opus Dei with its thousands of initiates worldwide and the membership lists of the Knights Templar. Among the P-2 members was the current Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi. Surprised? No, nor me. This is the real background to those now controlling the American and British governments on the 'war on terrorism'. Michael Ledeen also had secret meetings with the Israeli government in the 1980s that led, \"inadvertently\" he says, to the Iran-Contra guns for drugs affair coordinated through the Reagan-Bush White House.51 Now, since 9/11, as the BBC reported, Ledeen's \"shadowy neo-con talents are back in favour\".52 In 2001, Ledeen was co-chair of the US - China Economic and Security Review Commission. This is significant given the neo-Nazi plan for a conflict with China. Ledeen says: \"All the great scholars who have studied the American character have come to the conclusion that we are a war-like people. We love war.\" 53 He talks of the need to \"free\" Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya and North Korea after the invasion of Iraq. \"No-one would have imagined that the United States could, and maybe should, consider France and Germany as strategic enemies\", he said, \"and yet they have behaved now for several months as if they are strategic enemies.\" Ledeen, who has a model of Darth Vader on his desk, naturally says he is a student of the arch manipulator Machiavelli and his attitude was encapsulated by this remark: \"Richard [Perle] says he doesn't think Americans are vindictive. Well I hope he's wrong.\" 55 Jim Lobe of the Inter Press Service in Washington has been compiling files on the 'neo-cons' since~ the 1970s when he realised how influential they could be. He says of Michael Ledeen: \"People were very surprised to see that of the [very few] people who Karl Rove, Bush's closest advisor, ... talks to ... that are knowledgeable in foreign affairs ... one of them is Michael Ledeen and that will be a cause for sleepless nights for many people I would think. He is a provocateur and he's written more than once that the thing he really dislikes about the foreign policy establishment is that it thinks in terms of stability rather than revolution and radical change. \" 56 As Ledeen told the UK Daily Telegraph: \"Undermining the governments of other countries? No big deal.\" Douglas J. Feith: under-secretary for policy at the Pentagon, who selects the. members of the Defense Policy Board. He is on the board of advisers of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs Jinsa) and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 51 was a lawyer to defense contractors, Northrop Grumman. Feith was given an award by the Zionist Organisation of America, citing him as a \"pro-Israel activist\".58 He is a, representative of an \"Israeli armaments manufacturer\", Dov Zakheim.59 I saw him interviewed on British television as I was completing this book and it seemed to me that he had undergone a charisma by-pass. Michael Joyce: the former president of the massively influential Bradley Foundation that created The Project for a New American Century. It has also provided millions in funding for the PNAC, the American Enterprise Institute and a long list of other neo-~on organisations and authors. One such writer claimed that poverty was due to the genetic traits of a sub class of human beings - classic Illuminati racism. Joyce is a close associate of the paedophile William Bennett, the Education Secretary to Ronald Reagan, and the paedophile father George Bush. Bennett was rumoured to be involved in the education system in Iraq after the war. God help the kids, then. Joyce claims to be a \"moral guardian\" of American family values and he is an advisor to Americans for Victory over Terrorism, a group that wants to prevent criticism of American military policy. A fellow advisor is James Woolsey, the former head of the CIA, who was reported to be in line to be the minister of 'information' in the post-war Iraq. Meyrav Wurmser: a neo-Conservative \"writer\" with the Illuminati Hudson Institute, who monitors the Arab Press for \"anti-Semitic\" remarks. Her husband, David, is an advisor at the State Department and both are with the far right-wing, give-war-a-chance, American Enterprise Institute. Joshua Muravchik: a member of the American Enterprise Institute who has no problem with a devastating war on the Korean peninsular, so long as, like the rest of these sad people, they don't have to take part themselves. Muravchik told the BBC that removing the \"nuclear threat\" of North Korea\" ... might include having to try to destroy it by military strikes.\" He said such a war would be \"far worse than in Iraq, it'd be a war in which thousands arid thousands of Koreans would die and maybe thousands of Americans as well\". But who gives a shit, Josh; you won't be there will you? David Frum: wrote Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech that targeted Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He is a 'scholar' at the American Enterprise Institute. From was a Bush speech-writer for two years from 2001. He wrote a sycophantic book about Bush called The Right Man that was hailed on all the television networks a\"controversial\". He would then appear and tell the viewers what a wonderful president Bush was. From said on the eve of the Iraqi slaughter: \"I pray for the success of American arms. n 61 Oh, I'm sure the gods will oblige. William Kristol: former chief of staff to Dan Quayle, the vice president to father Bush, and was known as \"Quayle's brain\". Not much to do there, then. He organised the formation of the Project for the New American Century, of which he is chairman, on behalf of the Bradley Foundation. With this background, no wonder he is a political 'pundit' on Murdoch's Fox/Fix News. He is chairman of the New Citizenship Project that connects with the Project for the New American Century. It claims to be a non-profit, \"educational\" organization promoting American global leadership. Kristol told the BBC: \"American power should not just be used in defense of American interests, but for the promotion of American principles ... we are going to have to bring d0wn a series of regimes who are sponsors of a network of various terrorist organisations.\" 62 He names them as Iran, Syria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and North Korea was this not a tyranny to expand the control of America? \"No\", said Kristol, \"lli1J about freedom and democracy, not about capitalism.\" \"No\", said Icke, it is about global conquest for the Hidden Hand. Kristol, like Perle, says that their ideological poodle in London, Tony Blair, is a \"kind of neo-conservative\". 63 Kind of?? Kristol said the mass killing in Iraq was\" the end of the beginning of this part of the war, it is not the end of the end\".64 They. would give Iraq a new government \"and then really work to remove other dictators with weapons of mass destruction\". The neo-cons - neo-Nazis - say that democracies (tyrannies in which you can cast a meaningless vote) don't harbour international terrorists. But what about the White House and Downing Street for a start? Kristol runs the Rupert Murdoch-financed Weekly Standard in Washington, five floors below the American Enterprise Institute . The publication slavishly supports the Bush and Israel line. A regular contributor to the paper is John Bolton, the Iraq war manipulator, who loves to attack UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Others include Perle, Wolfowitz, Feith and Woolsey. In 1998, it was Kristol, Bolton, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Khalilzad, Bennett, Woolsey, Perle and current Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, who signed a letter calling on President Bill Clinton to instigate military action ~ Iraq.66 What a bunch these are and they are\" running our world on behalf of forces we never see. Kristol is very close to Vice President Cheney and is at the heart of the agenda with regard to the Bush government. In that case it doesn't look good either for Saudi Arabia or Egypt. Reporting an interview with Kristol, the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, said: ••... his opinion is that it is impossible to let Saudi Arabia just continue what\\ it is doing. It is impossible to accept the anti-Americanism it is disseminating . The fanatic Wahhabism that Saudi Arabia engenders is undermining the stability of the entire region. It's the same with Egypt, he says: we mustn't accept the status quo there. For Egypt, too, the horizon has to be liberal democracy:\" 67 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 52 Richard Perle, one of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's closest advisers and a vocal advocate of war against Iraq, has also publicly questioned the \"reliability\" (we intend to invade) of long-time US ally, Saudi Arabia.68 As I said in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, Saudi Arabia has long been a puppet state of the US, but I felt there were plans to move in eventually and take complete control, as with Iraq. While I was writing this chapter, the United States announced it was withdrawing most of its troops from Saudi Arabia. You can bet this is part of a strategy that will include the demonisation of Saudi Arabia and the return of the troops to take over the country and its oil. As per usual, terrorist bombs exploded in Saudi Arabia killing many people just before Colin Powell was due to arrive, providing the backdrop of devastation that he could exploit with his 'war on terror' propaganda. In the predictable style of manipulators, William Kristol seeks to present everything as black and white. You are J~1ilier with us or for the terrorists, and so on. He told Haaretz that the choice was between\" extremist Islam, secular fascism or democracy\", and because of September 11 th he said, \"Americans understood that\". No, America has been told that over and over by people like Kristol since those planes struck the twin towers. \"America is in a position where it . has no choice\", Kristolludicrously said. \"It is obliged to be far more aggressive in promoting democracy, hence this war.\" For\" democracy\" read\" American control\". He claimed that this policy was based on the new American understanding that if the United States does not shape the world in its image, the world will shape the United States in its own image. Once again we see that the whole foundation for the justification of this fascist expansionism of the Fourth Reich is believing the official story of the attacks that happened on September 11th to be true. But it is not; the official story is a lie. Who told us what happened, who did it, how they did it, and why? The same forces that are using their false version of the story to follow their long-planned agenda for global conquest. Charles Krauthammer, a columnist for the Washington Post, Time, and Kristol's Weekly Standard, is close to the Project for the New American Century and he took the same line in his interview with Haaretz: \" ... the sea-change ... took place here on September 11, 2001. Since that morning, Americans have understood that if they don't act now. and if weapons of mass destruction rea ch extremist terrorist organizations, millions of Americans will die. Therefore, because they understand that those others want to kill them by the millions, the Americans prefer to take to the field of battle and fight, rather than sit idly by and die at home.\" 69 The familiar technique of frightening the people into acquiescence is all based on the acceptance that the official story of 9 /11 is what really happened. The situation is presented as open and shut, black and white, no middle ground, no room for debate. As always, there is the \" Americans have understood\", \"Americans know\", when the truth is that is simply what people like Krauthammer, Kristol, Murdoch, Perle, Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney and Bush have told them. The New York Times columnist, Thomas Friedman, said: \"Is the Iraq war the great neoconservative war? It's \"the war the neoconservatives wanted. It's the war the neoconservatives marketed. Those people had an idea to sell when September 11 th came, and they sold it. Oh boy, did they sell it. So this is not a war that the masses demanded. This is a war of an elite. I could give you the names of 25 people (all of whom are at this moment within a five-block radius of this office) who, if you had exiled them to a desert island a year and a half ago, the Iraq war would not have happened.\"70 Khalid Saffuri of the Islamic Institute said of the nee-con cabal: \"They are a disaster for this country and many members of Congress believe that, but they .don't dare say it. They'll take on everyone, it's like a gang, you know, it's like a Mafia.\" 71 Syria's deputy US ambassador, Imad Moustapha said: \"Sometimes they are really terrifying in way they think, the way they would like to shape the world, the way they can impose their doctrine on everyone else, even if force is needed.\" 72 Moustapha said he was not worried about them implementing their policies because of Syria’s friends and allies. Oh, Imad. Look again, mate. A former US ambassador and White House aide said: \"This bunch of interlopers who've. latched on to George are stark, staring bonkers. Their policies are insane.\" 73 And Arthur Schlesinger, the historian and former special assistant to President Kennedy, also referred to them as \"lunatics\": \"They lack any decent respect for the opinions of the rest of mankind; and cast themselves as the world's jury, judge and executioner in deciding which country to attack, which people to bomb.\" 74 SOURCES 1 \"USA: Unocal Advisor Named Representative to Afghanistan-.

Abraham Lincoln Six months before the invasion of Iraq, journalist Brian Whitaker reported in the UK's Guardian newspaper that an Israeli '~tank', the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies, had produced a document in 1996 called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. The document was written for the incoming Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, an aide to whom was that constantly recurring name, Richard Perle, who is now at the heart of the Bush administration's plans for the conquest of the Middle East and ~north Africa (except for Israel). The document advised the rightwing Netanyahu to adopt a new strategy ''based on 'an entirely new intellectual foundation, one that restores strategic initiative and provides the nation the room to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism\".2 It called for Israel to abandon any policy of trading land for peace with the Arabs because this, it said, was\" cultural, economic, political, diplomatic and military retreat\". The Clean Break was a virtual replica of the blueprint produced four years later for the incoming Bush administration by the Project for the New American Century. This is no surprise when you realise that the authors of the two documents were pretty much the same and they are now at the heart of the Bush government. I wi1llook further at the Clean Break document and its authors shortly, but first there are some extremely important points to make about the re-writing of history with relation to Israel and other informat16.rt ,he-neo-con manipulators wish to suppress. For example, the Clean Break paper makes this assertion: \"Our claim to the land - to which we have Clung for hope for 2,000 years - is legitimate and noble. Only the unconditional acceptance by Arabs of our rights, especially in their territorial dimension, 'peace for peace'; is a solid basis for the future.\" 3 It turns out, however, to be anything but legitimate and noble. The Zionist\" claim to the land of Israel is based on Old Testament texts, the true authorship of which is unknown. Put simply: \"God gave the 'Promised Land' to us, his 'chosen people', and so the land is ours.\" Er, that's it. But it gets even more insane. As some brave Jewish writers like Arthur Koestler4 have confirmed, the overwhelming majority of 'Jewish' people, and certainly those that control Israel and 'advise' Bush, have no historical connection at all to the land of Israel. They are not genetically Jewish and they are certainly not 'Semites'!! They don't originate from Biblical Israel, but from a people called the Khazars in what became southern Russia down to the Caucasus Mountains. This is why the so-called 'Jewish nose' is not a genetic trait of Israel, but the Caucasus! Alfred M. Lilienthal, a former American State Department official, called these facts \"Israel's Achilles heel\", because it destroys Zionist claims to the land of the Biblical Hebrews.5 Historians believe the Khazars to be descendents of the Turkik tribe known as the Huns or Hun that invaded and savaged Europe from Asia around 450 AD. The Huns' territories stretched at one time from Central Asia to Central Europe, from Siberia and China to North India. They were a grouping of tribes and bloodlines from the interbreeding with many peoples, including the Chinese and the Sumerians. The Huns are best remembered for their leader, Attila the Hun, who seized power by killing his brother, Buda, after whom the Hungarian city of Budapest was named. Like the Huns, the Khazars spoke the Turkik language and are believed to be the same people. The Khazars controlled a large and powerful 'Pagan' empire across most of Russia to the Ural Mountains in the East and the Caucasus Mountains in the south and they made their living as ••. - ~ traders and 'middlemen', levying taxes on the goods carried on the trade routes through their lands. Their influence in Eastern Europe extended well into the countries we now know as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria (Figure 7, overleaf). The Khazars were phallic worshippers and engaged in human sacrifice rituals. In a series of wars, the first from 642 to 652 AD, and the second from 722 to 739 AD, some 300,000 Khazar warriors prevailed against invading Muslims. They saved Russia and Eastern Europe for Christianity, which had also been defended on other fronts by the armies of Charles Martel (\"the Hammer\"), the leader of the Merovingian Franks. Martel was the grandfather of Charlemagne, to whom 34 of the 43 presidents of the United States are descended, together with the royal families of Europe The \"circumcised unicorn\" "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 56 In about 740 AD, King Bulan, the King of Khazaria, adopted the religion of Judaism and the whole nation did the same. Legend says that King Bulan was told to do this in dreams or visions, but it was clearly a political move to avoid being absorbed by the Christian or Islamic world on either side. What is for certain is that the Khazars, the ancestors of at least 90 per cent of those calling themselves 'Jewish' today, had nothing whatsoever to do with the land called Israel. Their home was not the Dead Sea, but the Caspian Sea, which became known as 'The Khazar Sea'. This is the area targeted by the Illuminati today for its immense oil and gas reserves. Arthur Kessler writes that a \"warrior nation of Turkish Jews must have seemed to the rabbis as strange as a circumcised unicorn\".6 There were, apparently, two streams of Khazar known as the Kara or \"black\" .Khazars and the Ak or \"white\" Khazars, although Arthur Koestler says this may not have been related to the colour of their skin. But an Arab Chronicler, Said al-Maghribi, wrote: “As to the Khazars, they are to the north of the inhabited Earth towards the 7th clime, having over their heads the constellation of the Plough. Their land is cold and wet. Accordingly their complexions are white, their eyes blue, their hair flowing and predominantly reddish, their bodies large and their natures cold. Their general aspect is wild.” 7 Figure 7: The Empire of the Khazars with the Christian and Muslim worlds on either side. The Khazars converted to Judaism in about 740 AD and these are the origins of people like the Rothschilds. Henry Kissinger. the 'neo-con' leadership in the United States and those who have controlled Israel since it was formed in 1948. They are not Semitic people and do not have any connection to the land of Israel. Certainly the Caucasus region is so associated with the white race that in North America white people are still referred to as \"Caucasian\". The Khazars fought, made alliances and interbred with peoples like the Viking Rus (who became the Russians) and the Magyars with whom they had extremely close relations. The Khazars were instrumental in the creation of the Magyar homeland of Hungary. Names like the Russian Cossack and the Hungarian Hussar came from 'Khazar', as did the German for heretic, Ketzer.8 The Khazars also had close connections with the Byzantine Christian/Roman Empire and there was interbreeding between them. A Khazar princess married Emperor Constantine V and their son became Emperor Leo ~ known as Leo the Khazar, who ruled Byzantium from 775 to 8OO. The deposed Emperor Justinian II fled to Khazaria in 70S, where the king (the \"Khagan\" or \"Kagan\") gave him shelter and allowed him to marry his sister. She took the name Theodora and became Empress when Justinian was restored to the Byzantine throne. The Khazar Sumerians "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 57 The Khazars and their close associates and subordinates, the Magyars, were related to the Sumerians, a people that will become increasingly important in this story as we progress. The Sumerians were said to be the first settlers of southern Mesopotamia about 5,000 BC and came from ~e mountainous regions to the North and East. There they built what hist9rians call \"the cradle of civilisation\" an~ an Empire that stretched in all directions, including north of the Caucasus Mountains where the Khazars were to develop their own empire and have their mass 'conversion' to the Jewish faith. It was believed that the Magyars were a nomadic people from the north with a language of Finnish-Ugrian origin. But Dr Sandor Nagy writes in The Forgotten Cradle of the Hungarian Culture,9 that the people who later became known as Magyars were Sumerians ·that were pushed out of the Fertile Crescent of what is now Iraq. Dr Nagy uses extensive examples to confirm the linguistic similarities between the Sumerian, Old Magyar and the current Magyar language. He also refers to several works written during the first millennium including the Arpad Codices and the De Administrando Imperio, and completed 50 years of his own research. He says that that while there are only two hundred Magyar words related to the Finno-Ugric language, there are over two thousand words related to the Sumerian. British, French and German archaeologists and linguists concluded that the language of ancient. Sumerian inscriptions was not· Indo-European nor Semitic, but a language which demonstrated significant similarities with the group of languages known at the time as the Turanian ethno-linguistic group that included Hungarian, Turkic Mongolian and Finnic (later referred to as the Ural-Altaic group );10 Research has indicated that the Sumerian-Hungarian languages have over a thousand common word roots and are very similar grammatical structure. Kalman Gosztony, professor of Sumerian philology at the Sorbonne, demonstrated in Sumerian Etymological Dictionary and Comparative Grammar that the structure of the Hungarian language is the closest to that of the Sumerian. Of the 53 characteristics of Sumerian grammar, 51 matched in the Hungarian, compared with 29 in the Turkic languages, 24 in the Caucasian, 21 in the Uralic languages in the Semitic languages and 4 in the Indo-European. The linguistic similarities between Sumerian, Hungarian and other languages are confirmed by the archaeological and anthropological evidence, Dr Sandor Nagy says there were two separate migrations of the Sumerian people out of the Mesopotamia one through Turkey to the Carpathian Basin and the other went east and then north across the Caucasus Mountains into the area between the Caspian and Black Seas. This was the land occupied by the Khazar Empire to such an extent that the Caspian became known as the Khazar Sea. The Khazars were descended from the Huns and the Huns are said to be descended, like the Magyars, from the Sumerians. An ancient pre-Christian traditional account of Hungarian origins says they are the descendents of Nimrod (the legendary founder of Babylon), the son of Cush. The legend claims that Nimrod and Eneth had twp sons, Magor and Hunor. It is said that Magor was the ancestor of the Magyars and Hunor was the ancestor of the Huns, so providing the common origin of the Magyars and the Huns (Khazars). Ancient Byzantine sources say the Magyars were also called the Sabirs and originated from Mesopotamia, the land of Sumer. Numerous other ancient and medieval sources refer to the Scythians, Huns (Khazars), Avars and Magyars as the same peoples, even though the Hungarian authorities appear desperate to deny this. In previous books I have highlighted the movement of the former Sumerians through the Caucasus Mountains under different names, like the Scythians. Now we have further confirmation of the importance of the Caucasus region where, as again I have emphasised before, some highly significant ill1erbreeding occurred between bloodlines from Sumer and those from the Far East and China. This Caucasian Chinese-Turkish combination produced very important bloodlines from the Illuminati's point of view. A writer on a Jewish website, using the name 1m nin'alu, says: \"The Huns' origin is directly connected with two well-known peoples of the ancient Middle East: the Sumerians and the Scythians, namely, in the kingdom founded by Nimrod. Even though they belong to the Japhetic $stock and their most creditable ancestor is Magog, the Sumerian heritage has been kept by them more than by any other people, which implies that they are in fact the result of a mixed background. According to their own legendry accounts (legends that are anyway founded on true facts), it is very feasible that they kept close ties with Sumerians even for a long time' after the Sumerians disappeared from Mesopotamia as a national entity. Their particular link with ancient Sumerians was found through the comparison of modern Hungarian (Magyar) and other related languages with documents of the ancient Middle East that revealed a possible common origin. \"The ancient Sumerians, that in the dawn of history settled in Southern Mesopotamia, in the land commonly known as Shin'ar or Chaldea, arrived there from the north, precisely from the Ararat region [now Turkey], that they called 'Subar- Ki' or 'Subar-Tu'. This area was also named after one of the peoples that inhabited there, the Hurri, whose language was agglutinative like Sumerian and had many words in common, even being a totally different tongue. Modern Hungarian shares many terms with both Sumerian and Hurrian, as well as with Elamite.\" 11 The real exodus "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 58 The Khazar Empire, the first feudal state in Eastern Europe, broke up in a series of wars and invasions culminating in the arrival of the Mongol 'Golden Horde', best remembered for their inspiration, Genghis Khan. Over the centuries of w~ power and influence, the Khazar peoples began to emigrate in many directions. S.W. Baron said of Khazaria in A Social and Religious History of the Jews: \"Its population was largely absorbed by the Golden Horde which had established the centre of its empire in Khazar territory. But before and after the Mongol 'upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centres of Eastern Europe.\" 12 Khazars took their Judaistic or Talmudic faith and settled in many East European and Alpine lands, especially Poland-Lithuania. There are many ancient place names in Poland and the Ukraine inspired by the name \"Khazar\" or \"Zhid\", a term meaning Jew.13 These include Kozarzewek, Kozara, Kozarzow and Zydowo. As the Khazar Empire collapsed in the period after 960, a number of Slavonic tribes, led by, the Polans, formed an alliance that became the state called Poland. 'Jews' (Khazars) played an important role in the Polish legends about the formation of the country. One says that a 'Jew' called Abraham Prokownik was elected by the tribes to rule them.14 Certainly Khazar 'Jews' became pro1llinent in many countries of Eastern Europe. Arthur Koestler writes: \"Both the Hungarian and Polish sources refer to Jews employed as mintmasters, administrators of the royal revenue, controllers of the salt monopoly, tax-collectors and 'money-lenders' - i.e., bankers. This parallel suggests a common origin of those two immigrant communities; and as we can trace the origins of the bulk of Hungarian Jewry to the Magyar-Khazar nexus, the conclusion seems self-evident.\" 15 Koestler points out that the traditional garb of Polish Jewry is of unmistakably Eastern origin - \"The skull-cap (yarmolka) is worn to this day by orthodox Jews and by the Uzbeks and other Turkish people in the Soviet Union\"~ What happened in this period is that the people formerly known for centuries as the Khazars became known simply as 'Jews' and their true origin was lost. In its place their leaders sold to them - and the rest of the world - a false history. This was the belief that they were the Biblical Jews and the fallacy continues to this day with devastating' consequences for peace in the Middle East. The Khazar 'Jews' were confined to ghettos as a \"result of Papal dictat in the mid-16th century and this, together with the17th century Cossack (ironically) massacres in the Ukraine, led to another mass exodus into Hungary, Bohemia, Rumania and Germany. There were hardly any Jews in Germany until this time.16 \"Thus the great trek to the West was resumed\", says Koestler, \"It as to continue through nearly three centuries until the Second World War, and became the principle source of the existing Jewish communities in Europe, the United States and Israel.\" 17 So what does all this mean for the official history of the Jewish people? Koestler, who was himself born in Budapest, writes: \" ... [It] would mean that the ir ancestors came not from the Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan but from the Caucasus, once believed to be the cradle of the Aryan race; and that genetically they are more closely connected to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Should this turn out to be the case, then the term 'anti-Semitism' would be void of meaning; based on a misapprehension shared by both the killers and their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax which history has ever perpetrated.\" 18 Benjamin H. Freedman was a one-time Jewish·businessman in New York and a long time 'insider' before speaking out vociferously against Zionism after World War Two. He was personally acquainted with lead~ American political figures like Bernard Baruch, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy and John F. Kennedy. Freedman went much further in his assessment of the Khazar revelation: \"What are the facts about the Jews? (I call them Jews to you, because they are known as Jews, I don't call them Jews myself. I refer to them as so-called Jews, because I know what they are.) ., .. There wasn't one of them [the Khazars] who had an ancestor who ever put a toe in the Holy Land. Not only in Old Testament history, but back to the beginning of time. Not one of them! And yet they come to the Christians and ask us to support their armed insurrections in Palestine by saying, 'You want to help repatriate God's Chosen People to their Promised Land, their ancestral home, don't you? It's your Christian duty. We gave you one of our boys as your Lord and Saviour ... It is as ridiculous to call them 'people of the Holy Land,' as it would be to call the 54 million Chinese Moslems 'Arabs' .... \" 19 The former Khazar people are known as the Ashkenazi Jews (plural Ashkenazim) and some Writers estimate that perhaps 90% to 95% of those calling\" themselves 'Jewish' worldwide are ancestors of the Khazars. Others are known as Sephardic Jews and they do have historical connection to the Middle East, although even then the idea of a 'chosen race' going back to Biblical Israel still doesn't stand up, as we shall see. The Ashkenazim ('Khazars') are actually the minority in Israel itself, but they hold the reins of power and have always done so since the country was created in 1948. The name Ashkenazi is said by some to originate from Ashkenaz, the Hebrew word for Germany. In fact, the Bible refers to the Ashkenaz as a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 59 people living in the region of Mount Ararat (now Turkey) and Armenia. That would certainly fit the basic location of the Khazars.20 There is also a Biblical reference to Ashkenaz, brother of Togarma and nephew of Magog.21 Joseph, the Khaiar King in the second half of the tenth century, wrote in correspondence that they were ancestors of Togarma, who, he said, had ten sons that seeded all the Turkish tribes, including the Huns, Khazars and Bulgars. In the centuries after the demise of Khazaria, the Ashkenazi as a people did not speak the Semitic language . of Hebrew, which is no surprise at all because they are not Hebrews. They developed their own tongue called Yiddish. This began as a Germanic language from south eastern dialects of Middle High German and expanded into central and Eastern Europe starting in the 12th century. Later it evolved to include elements of Hebrew, Aramaic, Slavic languages and other influences. Once again, Yiddish, the language of the Ashkenazi, did not come from Israel, but Eastern Europe.22 Heading \"home\" It was the Ashkenazi (Khazar) 'Jews' who were persecuted by the Rothschild controlled Nazis in Germany in the 20th century, a persecution that led to the support for a 'Jewish' homeland in Israel. It was on the spurious historical claim that these people originated from Israel and that 'God' had promised them the land, that the House of Rothschild (Ashkenazim/Khazars) orchestrated the takeover of Palestine that has set the Middle East ablaze with violence ever since (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for much more on the Rothschilds' involvement). The Balfour Declaration in 1917, in which the British Foreign Secretary gave his government's support for a 'Jewish' homeland in Palestine, took the form of a letter from Lord Balfour to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. The letter was in fact drafted by Lord Rothschild and his employee, the banker, Alfred Milner. It said: \"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\" 23 What a sick joke the bit about the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities turned out to be. One of the most important secret societies within the Illuminati web is called the Round Table. It is based in Britain with branches across the world, and it is the Round Table that orchestrates the network of the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs detailed in my other books. How fascinating then, that Lord Balfour was an inner circle member of the Round Table; Alfred Milner was the Round Table's official leader after the death of its founder, Cecil Rhodes; and the Round Table was funded by ... Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. These were the very three people involved in the Balfour Declaration. Two years later, in 1919, .came the Versailles Peace Conference near Paris when the elite of the Round Table from Britain and the United States, people like Alfred Milner, Edward Mandel House and Bernard Baruch, were appointed to represent their countries at the meetings that decided how the world would be changed as a result of the war these same people had engineered. They decided to impose impossible reparations payments on Germany, so ensuring the collapse of the post-war Weimar Republic amid unbelievable economic collapse and thus create the very circumstances that brought Hitler and the Nazis to power. It was at the Versailles conference that these Illuminati front men agreed to support the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and every one of them was either a Rothschild bloodline or controlled by them. Today it is still the same. The Rothschilds are extremely close to people in 'power' like the Bushes, Hillary Clinton, British royal family, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Peter Mandelson, the long-time Blair 'guru'. Evelyn de Rothschild and his wife, the American-born businesswoman, Lynn Forester, spent their wedding night at the White House at the invitation 'of Bill and Hilary Clinton and Lady de Rothschild has publicly stated her support for Blair and his Labour Party. This includes fundraising. She says she is a supporter of 'Third Way' politics, the \"balance\" (it claims) between Left and Right.24 The Third Way is actually an example of the Illuminati technique called the Hegelian Dialect when you playoff one extreme against another and fuse them together. Zionism is a political movement, not a people Zionism was the creation of the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, especially the House of Rothschild. What most people don't realise is that Jewish people and the political movement called Zionism are not the same thing. It is like saying the Republican Party in the United States is the American nation or Blair's Labour Party is the Biitish nation. Large numbers of Jewish people are deeply opposed to the goals and claims of Zionism, but their views don't get reported. An example is the Neturei Karta movement, a grouping of Jewish people campaigning to expose the truth about Zionism. Their spokesman, Rabbi Ahron Cohen,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 60 issued a statement to members of the UK parliament saying that they expressed\" a religious and I humanitarian philosophy held in essence by large numbers (hundreds of thousands) and possibly the majority of \"authentic Orthodox Jews\". It was a philosophy \"totally opposed to the attitude adopted by the Zionists and to Zionism as a whole\".25 Rabbi Cehen said the Zionist movement founded about 100 years ago based on secular nationalistic aims, was a \"complete abandonment of our religious teachings and faith ... \" The ideology of Zionism was to take the law into one's own hands and to try to force the outcome in the form of State irrespective of the cost in life and property to anyone who stands in the way. \"The Palestinians stood in the way\", he said. Rabbi Cohen condemned the practical outcome of Zionism \"in the form of the State known as Israel\" as \"completely alien to Judaism and the Jewish' Faith\". It had been, and continued to be, the cause of untold suffering and bloodshed, both Jewish and non-Jewish: \"The apparent connection between Judaism and Zionism is false. The connection has been nurtured by the Zionists in order to ensnare as many Jews as possible within their net.\" 26 Many will be surprised at those words because we only hear in the media from Zionist fronts like the Anti-Defamation League, which, in true Orwellian fashion, spends its time defaming people, including me. Is the Illuminati agenda a Jewish plot, as some claim? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. But, is the political movement called Zionism involved? Absolutely it is. See the articles by Henry Makow, whose family suffered under the Nazis, for more background to this;27 and the works of Jewish writers such as Israel Shamir28 and Norman Finkelstein.29 The Zionists are furious when such people speak out because they cannot credibly accuse them of being anti-Jewish or 'anti-Semitic' - the usual defense against exposure. Finkelstein, the New York-born son of concentration camp survivors, says that Jewish organisations are \"huckstering\" the Holocaust by extracting huge sums in compensation through the Zionist-controlled 'Claims Conference' and other agencies that the survivors never see. He says his father received compensation from the German government totalling $250,000, yet his mother's compensation, channelled through American Jewish organisations, came to a total of just $3,500 and no pension.30 \"What they <have done, by turning the central tragedy of Jews in the 20th century into.-weap6n for shaking down people for money is pretty disgusting; it's wretched\", he said.31 Finkelstein writes: \"The reported annual salary of Saul Kagan ['Kagan' was the name for the Khazar king] long-time Executive Secretary of the Claims Conference is $105,000. Between stints at the Conference, Kagan was convicted of 33 counts of wilfully misapplying funds and credit while heading a New York bank. (The conviction was overturned only after multiple appeals.) Alfonse D'Amato, the ex-Senator from New York, mediates Holocaust lawsuits against German and Austrian banks for $350 an hour plus expenses. For the first 6 months of his labours, he took $103,000 ... Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State under President [father] Bush [and executive of the notorious Kissinger Associates], earns an annual salary of $300';000 as chair of the International Commissior On Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims ... Kagan rings up in 12 days, Eagleburger in 4 days, and D' Amato in 10 hours what my mother received in suffering six years of Nazi persecution.\" 32 Finkelstein estimates that more than $20 billion has been collected in compensation claims arising from the Holocaust, including the $1.25 billion he says was extorted from Swiss banks before the evidence to support the claim of stealing funds from Jewish victims of the Nazis was produced. When an official inquiry later reported, it did not support the allegations on which the money had been demanded - and paid under the threat of an economic boycott - in a campaign led by Edgar Bronfman, the President of the World Jewish Congress (WJC). Bronfman said the money had to be paid before the inquiry reported because the victims were old and needed the money before they died. Once the money was in the coffer however, handing it out to the victims was suddenly not nearly so urgent. Bronfman told the US House Banking Committee that the Swiss should \"not be allowed to make a profit from the ashes of the Holocaust\". But he later acknowledged that the \"WJC treasury has amassed no less than 'roughly $7 billion' in compensation monies\".33 Readers of my other books will have come across the multi-billionaire Bronfman family in Canada who built their media and liquor empire on the back of illegal booze running and organized crime. The Bronfmans are connected to_ the unbelievably corrupt Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a major Illuminati operation. A taxpayer sued the Canadian government's tax-collecting scam, Revenue Canada, for allowing the Bronfmans to transfer huge sums of money to a cross-border trust fund without paying an estimated $300 to $600 million in taxes. I'm sure the Bronfman 'influence' on the Canadian government machine had nothing to do with this. I thoroughly recommend Finkelstein's book, The Holocaust Industry, if you wish to see the levels to which self-styled, self-appointed 'Jewish leaders' can sink in \\ their unspeakable abuse and manipulation of genuine survivors of Nazi Germany. The Israeli writer, Boas Evron, concluded: \"Holocaust awareness is an official, propagandistic indoctrination, a churning out of slogans and a false view of the world, the real aim of which is not at all an understanding of the past, but a manipulation of the present.\" 34 Finkelste~"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 61 emphasises the difference between what he calls the \"Nazi Holocaust\" and the extortion racket he terms, \"The Holocaust\", which fills the coffers of Jewish organisations and pt.0jects and not the pockets of those who genuinely suffered. Finkelstein accuses Jewish organisations of behaving \"like a caricature from Der Sturmer\" - the infamous racist magazine of the Nazis. He refers to them as \"crooks\" and has described Elie Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, as the \"resident clown of the Holocaust circus\". He goes on: \"Before June 1967 [the Arab-Israeli war] the universalist message of concentration camp survivor Bruno Bettelheim resonated among American Jews. After the June war, Bettelheim was shunted aside in favour of Wiesel. Wiesel's prominence is a function of his ideological utility. Uniqueness of Jewish suffering/uniqueness of the Jews, ever-guilty Gentiles/ever- innocent Jews, unconditional defense of Israel/unconditional defense of Jewish interests: Elie Wiesel is The Holocaust.\" 35 When the Holocaust museum was planned for Washington DC, Wiesel led the campaign to commemorate onn1y Jewish victims and not the others targeted by the Nazis, including thehandlcapped.36 Wiesel rebuked Israel's Shimon Peres for speaking of two holocausts of the 20th century, Auschwitz and Hiroshima.37 Finkelstein highlights some of Wiesel's strange remarks. Wiesel said in his memoirs that he read a book called The Critique of Pure Reason in Yiddish, while saying that he was \"wholly ignorant of Yiddish grammar\".38 Even worse, the book was never translated into Yiddish. Wiesel also told a New York Times reporter that he was hit by a car in Times Square at 45th Street and \"flew an entire block\" to land in 44th.39 He's definitely a man you can believe. It was Wiesel who wrote in the New York Times Book Review that a tome called The Painted Bird by \"Holocaust survivor\", Jerzy Kosinski, was \"one of the best incitements of the Nazi era\" and \"written with deep sincerity and sensitivity\".40 Well not exactly because Kosinski turned out to be a fraud who made it all up. Another book on the same subject called Fragments won the Jewish National Book Award before its \"Holocaust surviving\" author, Binjamin Wilkomirski, was exposed as (a) not being Jewish and (b) spending the entire war in Switzerland. But, as Finkelstein writes, questioning is not allowed. It's racist: \"To question a survivor's testimony, to denounce the role of Jewish collaborators, to suggest that Germans suffered during the bombing of Dresden or that any state except Germany committed crimes in World War 11- this is all [claimed to be] evidence ..• of Holocaust denial. And to suggest that Wiesel has profited from the Holocaust Industry, or even to question him, .amounts to Holocaust denial.\" 41 Norman Finkelstein has faced the wrath of his targets and says the New York Times gave a more hostile review to his book, The Holocaust Industry, than it did to Hitler's Mein Kampf \"I don't want to play the martyr, but if you look at my history I didn't make out so well\", he said, \"I'm in exile in [DePaul University] Chicago because I was thrown out of every [University] school in New York.:' 42 Jewish people as a whole are being conned as much; if hot more, than anyone. Jack Bernstein, who is, like Arthur Koestler, an Ashkenazi, confirms the background I have highlighted: \"The powerful Zionist propaganda machine has led the American people to believe that a Jew is a Jew - one race of people and that they are 'God's Chosen People' ... First, it is important for you to understand that Jews are not one race of people. There are two distinct groups of Jews in the world and they come from two different areas of the world the Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and North Africa, and the Ashkenazi Jews come -from Eastern [and later Western] Europe. The Sephardic is the oldest group and it is they, if any, who are the Jews described in the Bible. They are blood relatives to the Arabs - the only difference between them is religion. \"The Ashkenazi Jews, who now comprise 90% of the Jews in the world, had a rather strange beginning. According to historians, many of them Jewish, the Ashkenazi Jews came into existence about 1200 years ago· ... [as the Khazars] ... Some time during the 13th century, the Khazars were driven from their and they migrated westward with most of them settling in Poland and Russia. The Khazars are now known Ashkenazi Jews. Because these' Khazar (Ashkenazi) Jews merely chose Judaism, they are not really Jews - at least not blood Jews.\" 43 It is the Ashkenazi leadership ~ who are not Jewish by blood and are not historically-connected to the lands of Israel- that took over Palestine on an historical fabrication and have controlled the country ever since!! Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US State Department and former editor of Third World News in Washington, took up this theme in an Internet article.44 He wrote that \"actual genetic Jews\" were born in the Middle East and were known as Sephardic Jews. These Jews did speak a Semitic language, Hebrew, from their earliest incarnation, but later also spoke Aramaic, Arabic and Amharic because of their location in Jerusalem and other Middle Eastern cities like what is now Addis Ababa, Cairo, Baghdad and Damascus. \"One rarely hears a Sephardic Jew yelling, 'anti-Semite\"', he said, \"because they know better and because he is aware of his own history within Semitic language speaking lands.\" Hamod continued:"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 62 \" ... most of those Ashkenazim Jews who were born and raised in America, such as Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Feith, are not even Jews genetically, because they are descended from Slavic tribes known as the Khazars who converted to Judaism and whose native language was Slavic and whose first language in America has been English ... I am not saying all Ashkenazim are not Jews, but the way some of them I behave is certainly not in the way Moses brought Judaism from God through the Torah. One has but to look at the haters and war-mongers in the Bush circle of influence and this is evident; no God would want them to be associated with his name. Thus, as a ' friend of mine, Rabbi Shmuel Handelman put it, 'They may call themselves Jews but I doubt very much if I'd call them that, and if r did, M:1'say they were the worst of what any person might be. I'd rather not be associated with them.\" 4\" Rabbi Handelman is not alone. In an impassioned article headed \"Because We Are Jews\", Rabbi Mordechi Weberman pledged his support for the just treatment of the Palestinian people. I have included the full text in Appendix III because it is important to know that all people calling themselves Jewish do not think the same. But this is what the Ashkenazi/Khazar leadership, like the Rothschilds, want the world to think. If they can sell the belief in 'one Jewish voice' it means they can promote their own 'voice' and their own agenda under the banner of the 'Jewish people'. Rabbi Weberman said there were those who asked why they marched with the Palestinians. Why did they raise the Palestinian flag? Why did they support the Palestinian, cause? \"You are Jews!\" they said. \"What are you doing?\" His response was simple: \"It is precisely because we are Jews that we march with the Palestinians and raise their flag! It is precisely 6ecause we are Jews that we demand that the Palestinian peoples be returned to their homes and Properties! Yes, in our Torah we are commanded to be fair. We are called upon to pursue justice. And what could be more unjust than the century-old attempt of the Zionist movement to invade another people's land, to drive them out and steal their property? \"We have no doubt that would Jewish refugees have come to Palestine not with the intention of dominating, not with the intention of making a Jewish state, not with the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving the Palestinians of their basic rights, that they would have been welcomed by the Palestinians, with the same hospitality ,that Islamic peoples have shown Jews throughout history. And we would have 'lived together as Jews and Muslims lived before in Palestine in peace and harmony.\" 46 In a message to \"our Islamic and Palestinian friends\", Rabbi Weberman said there are Jews around the world that supported their cause. \"There should be an apology to the Palestinian people which is clear and precise\", he wrote. \"Zionism did you wrong. Zionism stole your homes. Zionism stole your land.\" He said they proclaimed before the world that they' are the people of the Torah and that their faith demanded that they be honest and fair, good and kind: \"We have attended hundreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years and everywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of Middle Eastern hospitality. What a lie it is to say that Palestinians in particular or Muslims in general hate Jews. You hate injustice. Not Jews. \" 47 Rabbi Ahron Cohen in his statement for the Neturei Karta group said the Zionists have made themselves appear to be representatives and spokespeople of all Jews and thus their actions aroused animosity against the Jew's. \"But, this is simply not true! Zionism is not Judaism. Zionists cannot speak in the n~ of Jews.\" According to the Torah and the Jewish faith, he said, the present Palestinian Arab claim to rule in Palestine was right and just - the Zionist claim was wrong and criminal: \"One must add to this wrong, the fact that in order to achieve an ill conceived nationalistic ambition, a shocking contrave61tion of natural and humanitarian justice was committed by the Zionists in setting up an illegitimate regime in Palestine completely against the wishes of the established population, the Palestinians, which inevitably had to be based on loss of life, killing and stealing.\" 49 He said this was a tragedy for the Palestinians and also for the Jewish people. When did you last hear these authentic voices of the Jewish faith express these values in the mainstream media? Of course not, because this view is suppressed by the supporters of the Illuminati political movement called Zionism that must advance the lie that they speak for all Jewish people. When non-Jews challenge their actions they are dubbed an \"anti-Semite\" and when Jewish people do the same they are dubbed \"self-haters\" by these students of Machiavelli and Goebbels. For a Jewish person to speak out for universal Justice is to be “a self hater''? What? These guys are sick. Now that Israel exists, the Israelis and Palestinians will have to live together in mutual respect if the violence is to end. However, peace is not wanted by the zealots behind the takeover of the Middle East and their murderous and manipulating intelligence arm, Mossad. Only the destruction 'Of the Arab world is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 63 enough for them. To make these points is not \"anti-Semitism\" - the label used to stop legitimate debate and research. It is simply provable fact as the documents highlighted in this book reveal. The irony of this abusive term, \"anti-Semitic\", is that the overwhelming majority of 'Jewish' people are not Semitic because they come from southern Russia, not the Middle East. And, anyway, 'Semitic' refers to language- speaking, not genetics. The major Semite peoples of the Middle East are actually the Arabs! Greg Felton, a Canadian writer and specialist on Middle East affairs, said: \" ... What we know as the 'Jewish State' of Israel is really an ethnocentric garrison state established by a non-Semitic people for the declared purpose of dispossessing and terrorizing a civilian Semitic people. \"In fact from Nov. 27, 1947, to May 15, 1948, more that 300,000 Arabs were forced from their homes and villages. By the end of the year, the number was close to 800,000 by Israeli estimates. Today, Palestinian refugees number in the millions.\" 50 Supporting the nazis Another irony is that those calling themselves Jewish have suffered terribly over the years from the manipulations and agenda of those who rule them. Look at Nazi Germany where the mass of the Ashkenazi people were treated grotesquely while their leaders collaborated with their fascist persecutors, who were funded by Ashkenazi bankers and the British and American elite, including the Bush family. President Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was involved with the H9-rriman Empire in the funding of the Nazis through a company called the Union Banking Corporation (UBC) and virtually all the Nazi trade With the United States was under the control of the Harriman interests and the stewardship of Prescott Bush. The Union Bank interfaced with the steel and banking empire of Hitler funder, Fritz Thyssen, whose factories built the Nazi war machinery. The UBC was closed down for trading with the enemy and one might ask why professional 'Nazi hunters' like Simon Wiesenthal have never pursued the Bush family?? The Bush-Nazi connection has been highlighted by John Loftus, the president of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bush derived a portion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with the UBC. Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's Nazi War Crimes Unit, said that leading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the 'Harriman/Bush' bank and they were moving money into the UBC through a second bank of Holland even after the United States declared war on Germany. The bank was liquidated in 1951, Loftus said, and President Bush's grandfather and great-grandfather received $1.5 million as part of that dissolution. He said he had a file of paperwork linking the bank and Prescott Bush to Nazi money. \"That's where the Bush family fortune came from: It came from the Third Reich\", Loftus said in a speech during the Sarasota Reading Festival. The German publishing giant, Bertelsmann, is owned by the Thielens, who are reported to be related to Fritz Thyssen. Bertelsmann published Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, and was the biggest printer for the German army through its close ties to the Nazi Propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goebbels., In, 2002, the company was exposed for its Nazi connections and for using Jewish slave labour.52 (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret for the Illuminati background to the Nazi concentration camps and the Bush family and House of Windsor connections to the Third Reich). A Bertelsmann subsidiary in California has refused to print my books on the command of the German headquarters. Good. The majority of JewishAmericans apparently voted against Bush in 2000 and the number would have been even higher had they known the family connections to the Nazis and who and what was behind his rise to the presidency. Canadian writer Greg Felton said this of the Zionist support for the Nazis: \"Israel would not be possible today if the World Zionist Congress and other Zionist agencies hadn't formed common cause with Hitler's exterminators to rid Europe of Jews. In exchange for helping round up non-Zionist Jews, sabotage Jewish resistance movements and betray the trust of Jews, Zionists secured for themselves safe passage to Palestine. This arrangement was formalized in a number of emigration agreements signed in 1938. The most notorious case of Zionist collusion concerned Dr Rudolf Kastner, Chairman of the Zionist Organization in [Khazar] Hungary from 194345. To secure the safe passage of 600 Zionists to Palestine, he helped the Nazis send 800,000 Hungarian Jews to their deaths. The Israeli Supreme Court virtually whitewashed Kastner's crimes because to admit them would have denied Israel the moral right to exist .” 53 Or as David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, said in a letter to the Zionist executive on December 17th 1938: \"The saving of Jewish lives from Hitler is considered here as a potential threat to Zionism, unless they are brought to Palestine. When Zionism had to choose between the Jewish people and the Jewish state, it unhesitatingly preferred the latter.\" 54 Alfred Rosenberg, the \"intellectual leader\" of the Nazi Party, is reported to have had 'Jewish'[that is Ashkenazi] ancestry.55 It was Rosenberg who gave the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion to Hitler. These"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 64 were purported to reveal plans for world domination alleged to have been presented at the Jewish World Congress held in Basel in 1897 and were used to 'justify' the horrific persecution of Jews in Germany although not the Ashkenazi leaders involved with the Nazi Party). Rosenberg, who was born in Estonia, became editor of the Voelkischer Beebachter, the official Nazi Party newspaper, and he wrote The Myth-of the Twentieth Century, which claimed that the Aryan race was the creator of all values and culture while the Jews were agents of cultural corruption. Under Rosenberg's command Jewish libraries throughout Europe were ransacked and the spoils delivered to him in Frankfurt. He also headed a special unit, Einsatzstab Rosenberg, which plundered art and furniture belonging to Jews in occupied Western Europe.56 Ernst Hanfstaengl, a close friend of US president Franklin Roosevelt, was also a close associate of Hitler before the war. He says he was warned by the Austrian writer, Rudolf Kommer, that \"if any political party emerges with an anti-Semitic programme directed by Jewish or half Jewish fanatics we shall have to watch out\". Hanfstaengl wrote that later, after experiencing ~e influence that Alfred Rosenberg had over Hitler, he began to realise what that remark really meant: \"I thought back to Rudolf Kommer's remark about an anti-Semitic programme directed by Jewish or half Jewish fanatics - Rosenberg was distinctly Jewish in appearance, although he would have been the first to protest furiously if anyone had questioned his ancestry. Yet I used to see him most mornings sitting in a dingy cafe at the corner of Briennerstrasse and Augustenstrasse with a Hungarian Jew named Holoschi, who was one of his principle assistants. The man called himself Hollander in Germany and was another of these Jewish anti-Semites ... I suspected the [alleged] Aryan background of many of the others. Strasser and Streicher looked Jewish to me as well as figures like Ley, Frank and even Goebbels, who would have had difficulty in proving their pedigree,\" 57 Rosenberg and Goebbels worked closely together at the Propaganda Ministry. Never mind Rosenberg's own ancestry, what was he doing with a \"principle assistant\" that was Jewish when Rosenberg was one of the major architects of the master race madness and the persecution of Jews? This is only one of endless 'anomalies'. The German Ashkenazi banker, Max Warburg, was a director of I.G. Farben the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, that ~ the concentration camp at Auschwitz and was at the heart of Hitler's war machine (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free). His brother, Paul Warburg, who was behind the creation of the Illuminati's Federal Reserve banking system that controls the American economy, was a director of the US arm of 1.G. Farben. Moshe G01tlieb reveals in his book, American Anti-Nazi Resistance '33 -'41, that Max Warburg's son, Erich, cabled his cousin, Frederick Wartmrg, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, telling him to use all his influence to stop all anti-Nazi propaganda and activity in America, including atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in foreign press, mass meetings, etc\". Frederick cabled back to Erich: \"No responsible groups here [are] urging [a] boycott [of] German goods, merely excited individuals.\" Two days later, on March 31st, 1933, the Warburg-controlled American Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'rith, heavily influenced by the Sultzbergers of the New York Times, issued an official joint statement saying \"no American boycott against Germany be encouraged,\" and advised \"no further mass meetings be held or similar forms of agitation be employed\".} Journalist John L. Spivak exposed the Warburg connections to the Nazis in an article ('ID 1934 headed \"Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy\",58 He revealed that the Warburg controlled the American Jewish Committee that , opposed the anti-Nazi boycott, while their Kuhn Loeb and Co. had underwritten Nazi shipping, He further exposed the Warburg financing of pro-fascist political activities with their partners and allies, many of whom were major figures in the American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith (which formed the Illuminati Anti Defamation League in 1913). Support for the Nazis by the Ashkenazi leadership was fundamental to Hitler! s war machine and this then led directly to the unimaginable suffering of the Ashkenazi masses in Germany. It was this very suffering that the Ashkenazi 'leaders', most notably the Rothschilds, used to campaign for a homeland in Israel ~ a land to which they had no blood or historical connection whatsoever. After the war, leading Zionist fronts continued to support right-wing groups or ignore their actions when it suited them, Norman Finkelstein writes that, “Jewish elites even enlisted in, and financially sustained, right-wing extremist organisations like the All American Conference to Combat Communism and turned a blind eye as veterans of the Nazi 55 entered the country.lI59 Why would the Rothschilds and other leading 'Jewish' families do all this to their own people? It is a horrendous thought and doesn't make sense, surely? To understand why this can happen - and why the Bush family can so abuse 'fellow' Americans - we need to appreciate that the Illuminati elite have a different bloodline to the general population. They are a group unto themselves who are 'hiding' within other races and nations. The Rothschild family and company may have come out of the Khazar Empire, but we should not confuse that with the mass - of the former Khazar, now Ashkenazim, peoples. The Rothschild allegiance is not to them, but to the agenda of their real family, the nature of which I will reveal later. In other words, a Rothschild plot isn't a 'Jewish' plot. Erased from history"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 65 There is another important question that arises from all this. Even withou4Qe 'Jewish' - Ashkenazi connection, the Khazar Empire was enormously significant to world history. As Arthur Koestler says, ''The Khazars had their fingers in many historic pies\". The way the Khazars secured Eastern Europe from the invading Muslims alone is of massive significance. But were you ever told the history of the Khazars at school or anywhere else? Isn't it one hell of a coincidence that on one hand the Khazar story challenges the entire foundation of Zionism and on the other the Khazars and their background have been pretty much erased from history? Benjamin H. Freedman, the former 'Jewish' businessman who campaigned ceaselessly against Zionism, said that in 1948, the year that Israel was founded, he addressed the large assembly of the highest ranking officers of the United States Army\" at the Pentagon and told them about the Khazars and their relationship to the people of Israel. Afterwards, he said, he was approached by a lieutenant Colonel, the head of the history department of II one of the largest and highest scholastic rated institutions of higher education in the United States\". The man had taught history there for 16 years, Freedman said, but he had never in all his career as a history teacher or otherwise heard the word ‘Khazar' before that day. Freedman told this story in correspondence with a Dr. David Goldstein in 1954. He went on: \"Research ... revealed that [the Khazar 'Jews'] were never 'Semites', are not 'Semites' now, nor can they ever be regarded as 'Semites' at any future time by any stretch of the imagination. Exhaustive research also irrevocably rejects as a fantastic fabrication the generally accepted belief by Christians that the so-called or self-styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe are the legendary 'Chosen People' so very vocally publicized by the Christian clergy from their pulpits. Maybe you can explain to me, my dear Dr Goldstein, the reason why and just how the origin and the history of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom was so well concealed from the world for so many centuries? What secret mysterious power has been able for countless generations to keep the origin and the history of the Khazars and, Khazar Kingdom out of history text-books and out of class-room courses in ' history throughout the world? “The origin and history of the Khazars and Khazar Kingdom are certainly incontestable historical facts; these ... facts also establish beyond any question of doubt the origin and history of the so-called or self-styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe. The origin and history of the Khazars and Khazar kingdom and their relationship to the origin and early history of the so-called or self styled 'Jews' in Eastern Europe was one of history's best kept secrets until wide publicity was given in recent years to my research on this subject. Do you not think, my dear Dr Goldstein, that it is time this whole subject was, dragged out of its hiding place?” 61 That was written in 1954. We are still waiting. There Is no Jewish 'race' The evidence insists that we must go even further than suggesting the Ashkenazim are not genetically 'Jewish'. There is, in fact, no such thing as a Jewish 'race', just as there is no Aryan 'race' in the way it is portrayed, by the white supremacists. These are fabrications of history. What should 'race' matter anyway? It's all illusion and childish beyond belief. Later in the book, when we explore the illusory nature of reality, we can appreciate even more profoundly the , nonsense of 'race' and how stupid it is to judge people on the genetics of their body. In truth, no race exists, except in the minds of the people, as we shall see. It is all illusion. Unfortunately 'race' and its related historical rights and claims are used as a political tool and source of mind manipulation. This is why I am spending time exposing some of the background. There are people who follow the Jewish faith al~ over the world. There are white 'Jews', brown 'Jews', black 'Jews', Spanish 'Jews', Chinese 'Jews' etc., etc, that follow that belief system and good luck to 'them so long as they don't force it on anyone else. If they want to call themselves 'Jewish' on the basis of their faith then please feel free; it's none of my business. But there is not a Jewish 'race', let alone a 'chosen people'. Arthur Koestler points out that people calling themselves 'Jewish' across the globe have fat mote in common genetically with the \"host\" population than they do with each other. This was highlighted by Professor Juan Comas in his work, The Race Question in Modern Science, published, by UNESCO, and by Raphael Patai in the Encyclopaedia 'Britannica: \"The findings of physical anthropology show that, contrary to popular view, there is no Jewish race. Anthropometric measurements of Jewish groups in many parts of the world indicate that they differ greatly from one another with respect to all the important physical characteristics - stature, weight, skin colour, cephalic index; facial index, blood groups, etc.\" 62 \" Harry Shapiro produced the same assessment in his UNESCO work, The Jewish, People: A Biological History: "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 66 \"The wide range of variation between Jewish populations in their physical characteristics and the diversity of the gene frequencies of their blood groups render any unified classification for them a contradiction in terms. For although modern racial theory admits some degree of polymorphism or variation within a racial group, it does not permit distinctly different groups, measured by its own criteria of race, to be identified as one. To do so would make the biological purposes of racial classification futile and the whole procedure arbitrary and meaningless. Unfortunately, this subject is rarely wholly divorced from non-biological considerations, and despite the evidence efforts con tinue to be made to somehow segregate Jews as a distinct racial entity. 63 The reason for the latter is obvious by now. It is to sell a false history and biology both to the mass of those who consider themselves 'Jewish' and to the rest of humanity. How can you claim to be a special race, a 'chosen people' considered by 'God' to be above all others; and with special rights given by 'God' to own a certain piece of land, when there is no such thing as a 'Jewish race'? Even the 'Jewish nose' is only a facial feature of a fraction of 'Jewish' people and, here's the point, the same \"Jewish nose\" is found in far greater numbers today among the Caucasian tribes and the Turks of Asia Minor. Among the truly Semite peoples it is not seen at all. For goodness sake, when you go back to the Biblical stories you find that Abraham, the alleged 'father' of the Jews, is claimed to have had a child with Hagar, an Egyptian, and the same theme applies to other heroes like Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon. Their Biblical wives, sexual partners 'or parents came from peoples like the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites, Geshurites and so on. During the Babylonian exile the 'Israelites', including members of the priestly families, married Gentiles. As Koestler says, even before the Diaspora (the 'Scattering') the Israelites were a thoroughly hybridized race'. (I will explore the origins of the 'Israelites' and their/star' names later). This 'hybridization' applied to most historic nations, writes Koestler, \"and the point would not need stressing if it were not for the persistent myth of the-i3iblical Tribe having preserved its racial purity throughout the ages.\" 64 He concludes his excellent book: \"To sum up, the Jews of our day have no cultural-tradition in common, merely certain habits and behaviour-patterns, derived by social inheritance from the traumatic experience of the ghetto, and from a religion which th~ majority does not practice or believe in, but nevertheless confers on them a pseudo-national status ... the lingering influence of Judaism's racial and historical message, though based on illusion, acts as a powerful emotional break by appealing to tribal loyalty.\" 65 This emotion and fear, engendered not least by the events of Nazi Germany, are mercilessly exploited by their self-appointed 'leaders' who know the real background. The Ashkenazi 'leaders' have no more concern for the plight of Jewish people than the Bushes have for Americans. They are following an agenda and all people, no matter what their race or label, are fodder to be used and abused in its name. If those leaders were not so obsessed with race, and special rights through race, this section of the book would not have been necessary, but the record needs to be straightened for racist and 'anti-racist' alike. To think that what happened in Germany is being used to advance a fascist agenda turns my stomach. But it is. I have detailed some of the' background to Israel and its prominent supporters because the suppression of these facts is being used in the manipulation of the 'war on terrorism' and the conquest of the Arab world. Familiar faces It was Ashkenazi ancestors of. the Khazar people who were behind-the Clean Break document produced for Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996 that called for Israel to \"shape its strategic environment\", starting with the removal of Saddam Hussein and the installation of Hashemite monarchy in Baghdad. With Iraq brought under Jordanian Hashemite influence, Jordan and Turkey would form an axis along with Israel to weaken and \"roll back\" Syria, it said. Jordan could also undermine Lebanon by \"weaning\" the Shia Muslim population away from Syria and Iran and re-establishing their former ties with the Shia in the new Hashemite kingdom of Iraq, the document said. \"Israel will not only contain its foes; it will transcend them.\" 66 To achieve this, the document stated Israel would have to win broad American support for these new policies and it advised Netanyahu to present them \"in language familiar to the Americans by tapping into themes of American administrations during the Cold War which apply well to Israel\" .67 The Guardian article revealing the contents of the document pointed out that there is little to distinguish the 1996 Clean Break paper from the outpourings of other \"right-wing and ultra-Zionist think-tanks\". Nor do the similarities-end there; The leader of the 'prominent opinion makers' who wrote the paper for Netanyahu was Richard Perle, now-chairman of the Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon and a major player in the orchestration of th war against Iraq (and whoever next). Another author was ... Douglas Feith, the neo-conservative lawyer, now under-secretary of policy at the Pentagon, who is also at the forefront of the US agenda for the conquest of the Middle East. Two others were David Wurmser and his wife, Meyrav, who was co-founder of Memri, a Washington-based charity that “distributes articles translated from Arabic newspapers portraying Arabs in a bad light\".68 David Wurmser worked with Perle. at the American"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 67 Enterprise Institute and is now at the State Department as a special assistant to John Bolton, the Under-Secretary for arms control and international security. Bolton is yet another front-line manipulator of the invasion of Iraq, as I mentioned earlier. Meyrav Wurmser told the BBC that the Clean Break document was: \"No more than a mental exercise done in a think tank by a group of people. Yes man of us [behind the Bush policies] are Jewish, there's no need to apologise to anyone for that. Most of us, all of us in fact, are pro-Israel, some of us more seriously so than others, but we have no problem at all with criticising Israel.\" 69 James Colbert of the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) was also an author of the Israeli Clean Break report in 1996. It says that one of its aims is \"to inform the American defense and foreign affairs community about the important role Israel can and does play in bolstering democratic interests in the Mediterranean and the Middle East\". In practice, as the Guardian article pointed out, this largely involves\" ... sending retired American military brass on jaunts to Israel after which many of them write suitably hawkish newspaper articles ' or letters to the editor\" .70 There are also business relationships between retired US military officers' on the Jinsa board and American companies supplying weapons to Israel, but don't ever mention Israel's massive stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Shhhhh! They don't exist, OK? Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US State Department, said: \"Israel at this time has a huge stock of atomic weapons, thanks to our assistance. Israel also has major supplies of anthrax and other poison weapons, again, thanks to th~ assistance of the US Government who at one time feared Arab attacks on Israel These are the reasons that Israel will not allow atomic inspectors into Israel and will not sign the vaunted, American-pushed, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that America wants everyone else to sign, and uses pressure to achieve this, but never on Israel. \"As to the poison weapons, neither America nor Israel will sign this accord banning poison weapons because they have so many in their security vaults. Thus, to many experts in the world, the US attack on Iraq for WMD and poison weapons, was very much a bald-faced farce, without merit, when two of the biggest abusers of atomic proliferation and poison weapons were the ones calling for the war, America and Israel (and of course, followed by the poodle himself, Tony Blair, who has his own weapons secrets that have not yet seen the light of day).\" 71 When Saddam Hussein offered in 1990 to destroy such weapons, if Israel: did the same with theirs, the United States government said it was not willing to negotiate on that subject - not least because to publicly accept that Israel has a massive nuclear capability would make illegal the billions of dollars of US aid to that country every year. They all know of Israel’s nuclear stockpile, but if no one officially admits it exists they can go on with business as usual. This was further exposed in a BBC television documentary in the Correspondent series in 2003 that revealed how this you-don't-say-anything-and-I-won't agreement is known as \"nuclear expediency\". The programme highlighted the inhuman treatment of Mordechai Vanunu who had already been jailed for 17 years, 11 of them in isolation, for warning the world about the production of atomic weapons in Israel. Vanunu worked for ten years in the Dimona 'Atomic Research Reactor' in the Israeli southern desert region and told a reporter from the London Sunday Times about the secret production of nuclear weapons in underground levels under that reactor. The report was published in October 1986 and Vanunu was kidnapped in Rome by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and shipped to Israel, where he was secretly, tried and convicted. In retaliation for the programme, the Israeli government press office, a department of the Prime Minister's Office, banned BBC correspondents in Israel from contact with government ministers and officials and from official press conferences.73 Daniel Seaman, the head of the press office, said the broadcast had served those who \"demonise Israel and anti-Semitic elements\". Here w~ go, yawn, yawn. The truth is that the behaviour of the Israeli government demonises Israel without any help from anyone else. Seaman also added that the broadcast was something a 'democratic' [sic] State like Israel cannot tolerate.74 The Jinsa pincer The Israeli Clean Break document called for the very agenda that has been unfolding since the Bush administration came illegally to power.' The authors of the paper were closely connected with Jinsa, the Ashkenazi-controlled Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs: Today, at the heart of the Bush administration's policy on, the conquest in the Middle East, are: Dick Cheney, Vice-President, Jinsa member, formerly on its advisory board: Paul Wolfowitz deputy Defense Secretary, and a highly prominent member of Jinsa; Richard Perle, Clean Break report author, Iraq war architect, who serves on the Pentagon Policy Board, Jinsa member; Douglas Feith, Clean Break report author, Jinsa member David Wurmser, Clean Break report author, Jinsa member, who is now special assistant to John Bolton, the Under Secretary for arms control and international security, another Jinsa member; James Woolsey, Jinsa ~ember and former director of the CIA who was reported to be lined up to become the minister of 'information' in the post-war Iraq. These, in turn, connect into the far-right '~think tanks\" in the United States like the Project for a New"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 68 American Century that produced the blueprint for conquest in September 2000. This was a mirror of the Clean Break document and has formed the basis for the Bush administration's policy of mass murder and acquisition in the Middle and Near East. How can these facts not be fundamentally connected and what chance do the Arab nations have of being treated justly find with respect given the agenda of those in control of the gathering war against them? These people wanted to see the invasion and takeover of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and that list is now being ticked 6ff. Tom Neumann, executive director of Jinsa, told the Bush dominated, Moonie.:-~~',Washington Times, how he believed (knew) the face of the Middle East would be changed: “Jordan will likely survive the coming war with US assistance, so will some of the· sheikhdoms. The current Saudi regime will likely not. The Iran dissident movemen t would be helped enormously by the demise of Saddam, and the Palestinians would have to know that the future lies with the West. Syria's Ba'athist dictatorship will likely fall unmourned, liberating Lebanon as well. Israel and Turkey, the only current democracies in the region, will find themselves in a far better neighbourhood.\" 75 As I write, the demonisation of Syria and Iran is underway through people like the 'dove' (you must-be bloody joking) 'Colon' Powell and Jinsa member Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary. The US government accused the Syrian: regime of President Bashar al-Assad of state terrorism, developing weapons of mass destruction and harbouring fugitive Iraqi officials. Colon said: \"We will examine possible measures of a diplomatic, economic or other nature as we move forward.\" 76 White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer branded Syria a terrorist state; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld claimed Syria had carried out a chemical weapons test\" over the past 12, 15 months\"; and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel 'Khazar' Sharon joined the offensive, describing Assad as \"dangerous\", He urged Washington to put \"very heavy ... political and economic pressure\" on Syria.77 It is history repeating, the same technique they used with Iraq: lies, lies, lies. Wolfowitz told the Senate armed services committee: “The Syrians are behaving badly. They need to be reminded of that, and if they continue then we need to think about what our policy is with respect toa country that harbours terrorists or harbours war criminals; or was in recent times shipping things to Iraq.\" 78 You can't speak the truth - it's racist It has all been planned for a long time and they now have to invent the excuses to carry out the agenda of mass slaughter and control. The way this inhUIl1tulopolicy was played out against Iraq is due to be repeated over and over on the road to global domination. But speak or write an of these highly relevant facts and you are labelled (inaccurately from every angle) an anti-Semite. What, for telling the truth? Yes, especially for telling the truth, that's the point of the smear. Tam Dalyell is a veteran Labour MP who has campaigned against countless wars and, like his colleague George Galloway, was a vocal opponent of the invasion of Iraq. Dalyell said that Bush and Blair were being unduly influenced by Jewish ministers and officials who had an agenda for Israel that did not allow fair and equal treatment of the Arab world. He referred to a cabal in the United States based on the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) and later said he was referring to people like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, John Bolton, Douglas Feith and Ari Fleischer, Bush's press spokesman. \"Those people drive this policy\", he said.79 He also highlighted the role of Blair's unelected Middle, East envoy, Lord Levy, who is not a member of the government and cannot be questioned by parliament. Were these fair points made with freedom of speech? Oh no, not in the brave new world. Professor Eric Moonman, president of the Zionist Federation, who was a Labour MP from 1966 to 1979, said he was seeking advice on whether there was a case for referring Dalyell's remarks to the Commission for Racial Equality under the law of inciting racial hatred. \"I believe there is\", hesaid.80 Well, let me tell you what I believe, Professor Moonman. I believe that if Dalyell had said that Bush and Blair were being unduly influenced by Arab, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Dutch, German or French etc., etc., ministers and officials, Professor Moonman's silence would have been deafening. So where's the real racism? Indeed what can be more racist than to claim you are the \"Chosen People\" and above all others? , Anti-Semitism' is a smokescreen used to stop legitimate debate and Dalyell's treatment is just another example. It is very enlightening to look into the cesspits in which wallow the major organisations behind the 'anti-Semitic' smear campaigns. The Anti-Defamation League, which has tried hard to stop me having a public platform in countries like Canada, operates by defaming people in line with its Orwellian remit. The ADL manipulates unthinking, unquestioning mind fodder to man the 'anti-Semite' protests, most of them gleaned from the ludicrous 'Left' (as opposed to the ridiculous 'Right'). Too many on the Left wear their hearts on their sleeves and their brains in a dark place where the Sun don't shine. They are child's play for the manipulators. Ironically, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the major orchestrator of 'anti-Semite' protests, is about as far from 'the Left as you could imagine. It connects into Mossad and the global 'intelligence' network and to organised crime '(mostly the same thing, anyway). The ADL gave Mo Dalitz,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 69 the Las Vegas gangster, their 'Torch of Freedom' award in 1985 for donating millions of dollars to Israel. Dalitz Was an associate of the infamous mega-criminal, Meyer Lansky. In 1993, ADL offices were raided by San Francisco police and the-evidence came to light that the 'anti-racist' organisation had illegally obtained information from Tom Gerard, a corrupt police officer, and Roy Bullock, a political informant and infiltrator on the ADL payroll since 1960. Bullock was employed as a 'fact-finder' or what we would call a spy. He would infiltrate not only openly 'anti-Semitic' groups, but also labour unions, pro-Palestinian, American Arab and anti-apartheid organizations, usually under false pretences. Bullock, who was not Jewish, would then pass that information to the ADL. What a thought: an 'anti-racist' organisation keeping files on anti-apartheid campaigners. The ADL even kept\" file upon file\" on liberal San Francisco Jews who disagreed with Israeli policies. The files included Social Security numbers, driver's licence numbers, addresses, phone numbers and group memberships. Some of the information was sold to foreign governments, including Israeli and South African intelligence groups. Pete McCloskey, a former Republican congressman from San Mateo County, was an attorney in the law suits against the ADL. He Wants the government to revoke its tax-exempt status (no chance). Since they obviously are working in conjunction with the Israeli government, he said, they should register as such. \"Referring to themselves as an education group is simply a sham\", the attorney said.81 Dr Alfred M. Lilienthal the author of There Goes the Middle East, The Other Side of the Coin; and The Zionist Connection, said the ADL was \"ever ready to apply the smear and vilification to censure and silence, thus building an iron curtain over America that would bar any criticism, however constructive, of Israel, Zionists, or Jews (Judaism is rarely, if ever, involved), ... \" 82 He said that without exaggeration the ADL was the single most influential organization in the United States: \"It works closely with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, and sometimes with the FBI or CIA. Through its multi-fold activities and ability to crush dissent, it is probably more responsible for American attitudes and American foreign policy toward the Middle East than any other single force ... Through its multiple private and public reports and publications, allegedly directed against prejudice and bigotry, the ADL can exert enormous influence and intimidation, often bordering on blackmail, in organizations and individuals, particularly people in public life. It provides an indispensable backup for ... effective lobbying of the Congress and White House on behalf of an ever- increasing economic and military aid to Israel ... Many ADL charges against critics of Israel and Zionism are totally inaccurate, questionable, or based upon half-truths. Its secret and confidential reports, widely distributed in liberal circles, often attribute the stock quotation, 'but some of my best friends are Jews,' to its subjects, implying anti-Semitism. Odious .impressions are created by twisting or distorting a few words, or the context in which they were uttered.\" 83 I sure know that to be true. After Israel's attacks on Lebanon in 1996, with the massacre of more than a hundred civilians at Qana, Ari Shavit, a columnist with the newspaper, Haaretz, said that Israel could act with impunity because \"we have the Anti-Defamation League ... \"84 Its key role is to target those who are challenging the Illuminati agenda by branding them racists and the ADL definition of 'anti-Semitic' gets wider by the day. The ADL's Nathan Perlmutter claimed that the \"real anti-Semitism\" in America consisted of policy initiatives \"corrosive of Jewish interests\", such as affirmative action, cuts in the defense budgets, and neo-isolationf1t1I\\~ as well as opposition to nuclear power and even electoral reform.55 Any questioning of the ADL is racist, or, as sociologist John Murray Cuddihy, put it: \"Not only does anything Jews do or refrain from doing have nothing to do with anti-Semitism, but any attempt to explain anti-Semitism by referring to the Jewish contribution to anti-Semitism is itself an instance of anti-Semitism!\" 86 The ADL is headed by an Ashkenazi called Abraham' Abe' Foxman, who claims to be a \"Holocaust survivor\", but never saw the inside of a concentration camp or suffered persecution by the Nazis because they believed he was a Christian. Foxman accepted $100,000 for the ADL from the mega-crook billionaire, Mark Rich, and then advised him to seek a pardon for his crimes. Months later Rich's lawyers filed for a pardon and Foxman wrote to President Bill Clinton on ADL notepaper in support of the application. The pardon was granted by Clinton in his last hours in office amid enormous ontroversy.87 Foxman had suggested the pardon to his friend, Avner Azulay, an agent for Israel’s Ashkenazi spy agency, Mossad, who was head of the Rich Foundation that has donated a total of at least $250,000 to the ADL.88 Rich's lawyer was Lewis Libby, Cheney's Chief of Staff, and a member of the Project for the New American Century. The web is enormous. The brilliant Israeli writer, Israel Shamir, highlights the Zionist (Ashkenazi/Khazar) Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in an article on his website.89 Shamir says of Foxman and other 'anti-Semite' propagandists: \"The chief proponent of this well-endowed movement is an American [Ashkenazi] Jew, the head of ADL, Abe Foxman. Two years ago he was caught taking large sums of money from the super- thief Marc Rich, a crook who cheated the American taxpayer and found refuge in Switzerland. For years Foxman and his organisation collected dossiers on people who objected to apartheid and sold them to Mossad and to the South Africa of Forster. They broke into houses, stole documents and ran professional surveillance of the left activists in California."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 70 \"Last year, Foxman and ADL were found guilty in the US court of law, and paid millions of dollars to people they intimidated and smeared. Foxman's best chum is Ariel Sharon, the mass murderer of Sabra, Shatila, Kibie and Jenin. A new book by Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, 'The Assassination of Robert Maxwell: Israel's Super Spy' confirms the professional philo-Semites [those who brand their opponents \"anti-Semites\"] have permanent ties with Mossad, the long arm of Israeli apartheid, memorable to you by the Lillehammer murders. In brief, the philo-Semites are sleazy guys taking money from sleazy crooks in order to cover up the creeping genocide of Palestinians ... \" .;. It’s not strange, as the very emphasis on 'anti-Semitism' is disgustingly racist, as if it were worse than racism against anyone else. People who decry 'anti-Semitism', instead of 'racism' or 'ethnic-prejudice', are actually saying that there is something really special - and particularly bad - about discrimination against this one particular group. In other words, they are racists.\" 90 Sam Hamod, a former advisor to the US State Department, said the Anti Defamation League (ADL) had made a fortune in donations by conning most media networks and most people in the world into believing an untruth about Jewish history and suppressing the Khazar origins. He said that when the ADL called someone critical of Israel, Zionists or Zionism, an \"anti-Semite\", this was pure nonsense. He said he was not \"touting for people who are anti-Jewish or anti-Arab or anti-any ethnic or racial group\". Those who stereotyped or attacked others based on their race or ethnicity were dead wrong and should be condemned, he said: \"But so too should those who abuse labels and use them wrongly to stop others from being justifiably critical should also be condemned (and in this case, I am referring to the ADL and other groups of that sort who label people with impunity and carelessness, sometimes wrecking their careers, their reputations, their businesses and their lives! \"Unfortunately, the misuse of the label, 'anti-Semitic' and its consequences have been so bad that even presidents, senators, congress people, media giants and all others in the world cringe at being labelled, 'anti-Semitic' by some Zionist, Israeli or ignorant religious, media or social group. Little do they know they are, being victimized by charlatans of the language who have found a label\" that they throw around with impunity and for which there has been little or no come-back.\" 92 It was time for media people and non-linguistically literate scholars, politicians, religious leaders and others to become educated about the truths about \"Semitic\" and its misuse, he said. \"If not, we'll continue to allow charlatans to abuse our language and to continue their name-calling, abusing others, including Jews, Arabs, Americans, Brits and others by calling them 'anti-Semites' if they speak against Israel (which is not a Semitic state) or Zionists (a political group, not exclusively Jewish and which has nothing to do with Semitic).\" 93 The claims of \"anti-Semitism\" have served the Ashkenazi leadership magnificently. Dr Nahun Goldman, former president of the World Jewish Congress, said: \"Current decline of overt anti-Semitism might constitute a new danger to Jewish survival ... The disappearance of anti-Semitism in its classic meaning, while beneficial to the political and material situation of Jewish communities has had a very negative effect on our internal life.\" 94 Leo Pfeffer of the American Jewish Congress also said it was possible that some anti-Semitism is necessary in order to insure Jewish survivap5 Or rather the survival of Zionism. Norman Finkelstein has seen it all before: \"By the 1970s, anti-Semitism was no longer a salient feature of American life. Nonetheless, Jewish leaders started sounding alarm bells that American Jewry was threatened by a virulent 'new anti-Semitism'. The main exhibits of a prominent ADL study ('for those. who have died because they are Jews') included the ,Broadway show, Jesus Christ Superstar and a counterculture tabloid that 'portrayed Kissinger as a fawning sycophant, coward, bully, flatterer, tyrant, social climber, evil manipulator, insecure snob, unprincipled seeker after power' - in the event, an understatement. \"For organised American Jewry, this contrived hysteria over a new anti-Semitism served multiple purposes. It boosted Israel's stock as the refuge of last resort if and when American Jews needed one. Moreover, t he fund-raising appeals of Jewish organisations purportedly combating anti-Semitism [like the ADL] fell on more receptive ears. 'The anti-Semite is in the unhappy position', Sartre once observed, 'of having a vital need for the very enemy he wishes to destroy. For these Jewish organisations the reverse is equally true. With anti-Semitism in short supply, a cutthroat rivalry between major Jewish 'defense' organisations - in particular, the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Center - has erupted in recent years.\" 96 Don't do as I do - do as I say These are the organisations and methods used to ~top·tt1.Vestigation into those at the heart of power as I, and many others, have found. Those on the Left who fall for this are helping to create the very fascist society they claim to be opposing. Here is a definition of fascism: a system of government marked by centralisation of authority under a dictator, stringent socio-economic controls, suppression of the opposition"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 71 through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism; a political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government.; oppressive, dictatorial control. Recognise it? This is the world we are living in now and they have hardly started yet. Fascism is not a race and it is not a body, it is a state of mind. Anyone of any race is capable of promoting fascism. The Left does not seem able to grasp that simple reality. BBC reporter Steve Bradshaw said in his Panorama documentary on the neo-cons': \"By no w we had picked up a recurrent theme of insider talk in Washington. Some ' leading neo-cons, people whisper, are strongly pro-Zionist and want to topple regimes in the Middle East to help Israel as well as the US.\" But he said he had been told by “a congressional staffer” to be careful how he used the word neo-conservative because people might say he was being anti-Semitic. We have reached such, an the outrageous stage ill the destruction of free speech that it is now 'anti-Semitic' to point out that the Bush administration is carrying out a campaign of conquest that suits Israel perfectly while controlled by people with fundamental loyalties to Israel. Professor Eliot Cohen, the close friend of his former college dean, Paul Wolfowitz, is on the US Defense Policy Board and involved with both the American Enterprise Institute and the Project for the New American Century. He took the same old tired line when asked by Steve Bradshaw why he was concerned about the suggestion that American policy was all a conspiracy whipped up by a group of neo-conservative hawks, who are somehow allied to Israel\". Cohen replied: \"Well sometimes the word neo-Conservative is used when what they would really like to say is Jews.\"; 'They' being who?\" \"People that use that kind of language and as a Jew I find that offensive. There are two things that are despicable about it. The first the implication of duel .loyalty ... and speaking as someone who's father served in the United States army, who served the United States army himself, Who has a son in the United States army, I find it deeply, deeply, offensive and untrue. And the other thing I find deeply offensive about it is it contains anti-Semitic cadre. Which is that the Jews, this scattered little people around the world, have these occult powers and are pulling the strings of the naive and duped non-Jews. And it wasn't that long ago that those kind of beliefs led to hideous things that impinged upon me very directly. So yes, I feel very strongly about it. \" 97 I wonder if Arabs, the truly Semitic people, are deeply, deeply offended by Cohen saying that the Third World War was against communism and the Fourth World War is against militant Islam?\" 98 Can you imagine what Cohen would say if the neo-cons were called agents of militant Zionism?\" Or if the Israeli army that has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians was referred to as Jewish terrorists\". No, no, that's anti-Semitic\". But what is the difference? Rabbi Yaacov Perrin was quoted in the New York Daily News as saying, One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.\" 99 That is actually anti-Semitism against the truly Semitic people, the Arabs. If anyone said that about a person calling themselves Jewish they would be dubbed racist and, in some countries like Canada, arrested under 'Hate Crime' laws. Why is it racist to use the words Jewish or Israel, but not when you do the same with Arabs or Islam? Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for the orthodox Jewish, anti-Zionist, Neturei Karta group: \"It must be clear that opposition to Zionism and its crimes does not imply hatred of Jews. On the contrary Zionism itself and its deeds are the biggest threat to Judaism.\" 100 But as I write, Rick Santorum, the Republican Senator of Pennsylvania, bas proposed a law that, in effect, prohibits the criticism of Israel on American college campuses by threatening the universities with federal funding cuts if they allow students and staff to publicly criticise Israel. 101 Santorum was the guy who supported the 'Syrian Accountability Act', which accuses Syria of backing 'terrorism' and devel9ping weapons of mass destruction. In true Orwellian fashion, his plan to ban freedom of expression was called \"ideological diversity\" legislation while actually seeking to suppress such diversity. Criticism of Israel would be an act of \"anti-Semitism\" (impossible when Israel is controlled by people that are not Semitic!. The Kansas Senator, ~ Brownback, who is known as a staunch backer of Israel, called for a federal commission to be established under the Higher Education Act to investigate any \"anti-Semitic\" incidents on US campuses.102 Better watch criticism of Arab people, the!)., because they are the Semites. According to the New York Sun, the proposals followed a meeting attended by the Illuminati Anti-Defamation League exposed earlier by Israel Shilmir.103The ADL is the creation of B'nai B'rith that issued a statement in 1933 opposing any boycott or exposure of the Nazi regime in Germany. Once again, can you imagine what would happen if it was proposed that criticism of Arab countries should be banned from American campuses under the threat of stopping education funding? The same people proposing it with regard to Israel would be screaming and hurling abuse about anti-Semitism. What better example could there be of Israel Shamir's point? To propose a ban on criticising Israel without demanding the same for"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 72 Arab countries and, indeed, every other, is sheer undiluted racism! It is illusory racism, mind, when there is no such thing as a 'Jewish race'. Israel's apartheid The extreme forms of Jewish or Ashkenazi belief; as outlined, for instance, in the Babylonian Talmud, are stunningly racist and what c1ffi*you say about statements like this from Rafael Eitan, a Likud leader of the Tsomet faction: \"The only good Arab is a dead Arab ... When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.\"I04 Of course, this is not the view of the people in general, not at all. But this is the view of the extreme group that was connected to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and, have controlled the State of Israel since it was terrorised into existence in 1948 by Ashkenazi terror groups like Irgun and the Stern Gang (also called Lehi) that produced later prime ministers such as Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin. Shamir once wrote in Hazit, the journal of Lehi: \"Neither Jewish morality nor Jewish tradition can be used to disallow terror as a means of war ... We are very far from any moral hesitations when concerned with the national struggle. First and foremost, terror is for us a part of the political war appropriate for the circumstances of today.\" 105 So it is more than a bit rich for these same people to issue their holier-than-thou condemnations of terrorism and racism when Israel was created through terrorism· and is based on institutional racism written into the law of the land. 'Jewish' or Ashkenazi people can travel to Israel, declare citizenship, and be granted all the privileges that are denied to Palestinians who have lived in that land for hundreds of years. Even the 'Jewish' population is divided into levels of privilege decided by genetic origin. The white Ashkenazim from Europe and America are by law at the top of the pyramid of privilege. Below them in Israel's genetic caste system are the Sephardic Jews or Mizrahim (the \"Eastern Ones\"), who came from Arab countries and do have an historical connection to the Middle East. Sephardic people are descended from 'Jews' who were expelled from Spain in 1492. They lived in peace with the Arabs for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years before the Ashkenazi arrived in numbers from Europe in the mid-20th century under the banner of the Rothschild-controlled political movement called Zionism. Rabbi Ahron Cohen said in a statement for the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta group that the connection between Muslims and Jews goes right back into ancient history. \"Mostly the relationship was friendly and mutually beneficial\", he said, \"Historically, the situation frequently was that when Jews were being persecuted in Europe they found refuge in the various Muslim countries. Our attitude to Muslims and Arabs can only be one of friendliness and respect.\" 106 The Sephardic Jews were kept in corrugated iron transit camps where Ashkenazi officials tried to strip them of their\" Arabness\" by replacing their \"unpronounceable\" Arab names with good 'Jewish' names. Most had to work ten to twelve hours a day in disease and squalor. Their high death rate was explained by one Zionist official as a “common and natural thing\".107 Yemeni\" Jews in particular faced extraordinary discrimination as they were transported, often against their wishes, from Yemen to Israel and held in primitive camps. Yemeni babies were stolen from their mothers and given for adoption to Ashkenazi families. Doctors, social workers and nurses worked together to kidnap 600 Yemeni-Jewish babies, telling their parents they had died and giving them to childless Ashkenazi couples. In the early 1990s, a high-profile campaign began to try to reunite some of those shattered families. Professor Ella Habiba Shohat, an Iraqi-Jewish Israeli who teaches at City University of New York in Manhattan, has highlighted the suppression of 4 Sephardic Jews in Israel Her 1992 book, Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation, shook the Israeli establishment with its exposure of racism. She said of her upbringing in Israel: \"It was taboo to speak Arabic in school and whenever teachers wanted to chastise us, they would refer to us as 'you Moroccan' or 'you Iraqi' or 'you Yemeni', ... Jews from the Middle East were expected to abandon their Middle Eastern traits, so we grew up without studying our history or culture. It was all the more tragic for Palestinian Israelis, who couldn't even read about Arab history in textbooks. \"108 At the bottom of the genetic pile in the apartheid of 'free, democratic' Israel, come the black Jews from Ethiopia, who are treated appallingly. But even they are placed by la~ above the Palestinians. Israel is a fundamentally racist state in which the minority, the Ashkenazim, dominate and dictate to the Sephardic/ Arab majority on the basis of genetic origin. A report by the US organisation, Human Rights Watch, said: \"There is no general prohibition of discrimination or guarantee of equality in any of Israel's Basic Laws. Indeed, equality was explicitly excluded from the Basic Law: Human Freedom and Dignity when it was drafted. 109 A personal story Jack Bernstein, an American Ashkenazi, moved to Israel from the United States, lured by the propaganda about the Jewish homeland. What he experience sickened him and he detailed what he witnessed in an"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 73 article entitled lithe Life Of An American Jew In Racist-Marxist Israel\".110 He said that Zionist propaganda has led the American people to believe that Zionism and Judaism are one and the same and that they are religious in nature. This, he said, was a blatant lie. \"Judaism is a religion; but Zionism is a political movement started mainly by East European (Ashkenazi) Jews who for centuries have been the main force behind communism and socialism\", he writes. The ultimate goal of the Zionists, said Bernstein, is a one-world government under the control of the Zionists and the Zionist-oriented International Bankers.11I He said that after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war Jews in. America were filled with pride that\" our homeland\" had become so powerful and successful. They had also been manipulated by false propaganda that Jews in America were being persecuted, he said. \"50, between 1967 and 1970, approximately 50,000 American Jews fell for this Zionist propaganda and migrated to Israel. I was one of those suckers\". Bernstein had no emotional conflict with leaving the United States because those calling themselves Jews are allowed to have citizenship of both Israel and America, although this does not apply to any other Americans. Soon after arriving in Israel, Bernstein fell in love with Ziva. She was a \"Sephardic Jewess from Iraq who, like myself had for the Zionist propaganda and had migrated to Israel\". Jack and Ziva were married and that's when he realised he was living in a racist state. He said that for the first three years of their marriage they had to live with Ziva's aunt ,because of the critical housing shortage in Israel and because of racism\". He said this was the genetic system used to allot housing: 1) First choice goes to Ashkenazim who have lived in Israel for many years. 2) Second in line are Ashkenazim from Europe, especially if they marry an Israel-born Ashkenazi. Third are Ashkenazim from the United States, even better if they marry an. Israel-born Ashkenazi. 3) Third are Ashkenazi from the United States, even better if they marry an Israel-born Ashkenazi. 4) Only after all of the above are housed do Sephardic Jews, with an historical connection to this region, have a choice of whatever is left. 5) At the bottom of the list come the Muslims, Druze and Christians. Jack Bernstein writes that even though he was an Ashkenazi from the United States, he was placed lower on the list for housing because he had married a Sephardic Jewess. He said that employment opportunities were allocated in the same way: the Ashkenazim get the best job~; Sephardic Jews are next; while Muslims, Druze and Christians filled the menial jobs with ~ great many left unemployed. The Shas Party in Israel was specifically formed to address the discrimination against Sephardic people by the Ashkenazi elite. Israel is founded on outrageous racism of the most appalling and sinister nature. It is no less $an apartheid and yet Ashkenazi organisations like the Anti-Defamation League go around hurling the label \"racist\" and\" anti-Semite\" at everyone else. Bernstein dismissed the very idea that Israel is either free or democratic. It is, he said, a racist state: \"The Ashkenazi Jews, who migrated to Israel from Germany, while sympathetic to communism and support it, tend to favour the practices of. Nazi-style fascism. During World Warp in Germany these elite Zionist Ashkenazi Jews worked closely with Hitler's Gestapo in persecuting the lower class German Jews and delivering them to concentration camps. Now living in Israel, these elite Zionist Jews, who were well trained in Nazi style fascism and favor it, have imposed many facets of fascism on Israel. \"To give the impression that Israel is a democracy, members of the Knesset (Israel's Congress) are elected - butj1::S an odd kind of election. This is where Israel's so-called democracy stops. It doesn't make any difference which party wins an election, the Likud or the Labor party, the elite Zionist Jews rule in a dictatorial manner - giving favors to the elite clique and brutally suppressing any dissent. \"Concerning Nazism/fascism ease let me clear a point. Germans are an admirable people - I dare say even great. But in Germany, the general population were victims of the Nazis who through cunning and brutality gained power. In Germany, the average Jews were victims of the Zionist elite who worked hand in hand with the Nazis. Many of those same Zionist Jews, who, in Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined hands with the Zionist/communist Jews from Poland and Russia. It is the two faces of communism and Nazi-style fascism that rule Israel. Democracy is merely an illusion. \"Regarding the tie between the elite Ashkenazi Jews and .the Nazis, take a look at the word 'Ashkenazi' -,look again - 'Ashkenazi,' Interesting isn't it?\" Norman Finklestein, in his book, Image And Reality Of The Israel-Palestine Conflict, compares Israel's treatment of the Palestinians to the apartheid of South Africa and the view of the American settlers to native Americans. Asked if Israel was a democracy, he said: "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 74 \"Was South Africa a democracy in the old days? it was a democracy. or whites, for the 'superior people'. Similarly, Israel, for the larger part, of its history, has been a society where half the population has all the rights and half the population has none.\" 113 There can be no more blatant example of this in Israel than the 'wall', actually part-wall, part-fence, cutting off Israel from the Palestinian areas along a 150 mile 'border' decided by the Israeli government. This has parted Palestinian families, including fathers and mothers, from their wives, husbands and children, and destroyed the livelihoods of Palestinian farmers by putting their land on the Israeli side of the wall Qalqilya, once known as the West Bank's \"fruit basket\", is cut off . on three sides from the farms which supply its markets and the second-largest water sources in the region. Access to the 40,OOO inhabitant town consists of a single Israeli checkpoint. But don't say anything, it's anti-Semitic. The many defamed by the few The terrible potential irony is that the manipulations of the neo-cons in America on Israel's behalf, and the actions of Israel, are going to be seen as a 'Jewish plot' when the overwhelming majority of such people on this planet are victims of the plot, not perpetrators of it. Indeed the Ashkenazi neo-cons and those in control of Israel are . not even Jewish. But all 'Jewish' people get tarred by the uninformed and the truly racist with the same label as the manipulating few. Washington, journalist Jim Lobe, a long-standing opponent of anti-Semitism and an investigator of the neo-cons since the 1970s, made this same point: \"It's no secret; the majority of neo-conservatives have been and remain Jewish. That is a fact. They do not represent the view of a majority of the American Jewish community.\" He was asked if it was legitimate to talk about the pro-Israeli politics of so many neo-conservatives. \"Well, I think it's very difficult to understand them if you don't begin at that point. I would think people would want to talk about that rather openly because to the extent that you suppress it; I think then it festers.\" 114 Well said Jim. But how can the Ashkenazim from what is now southern Russia, who converted to Judaism and have no genetic or historical connection to the land of Israel, really be regarded as 'Jewish' in the sense that they claim? How can they be? Is a German or Russian who converts to the Church of England regarded as English? Of course not. The fact is that the American and Israeli governments are currently so close you can't see the join, but you are a racist if you say that this relationship is clearly not going to' produce a policy that gives justice to the Palestinians or other Arab nations. John Hamre, who runs the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was only stating the obvious when he pointed out that, . \"We're so close to Israel so one-sided, that people in the Middle East don't take us seriously\" .115 A former US ambassador and White House aide quoted in the UK Daily Telegraph said: \"One congressman, Jim Moran, said that if it weren't for Israel, we wouldn't have been going to war, and he was accused of anti-Semitism. Because of the atmosphere of war, deference to the President and the huge power of the Israeli lobby, we didn't even have a debate about whether we should go to war. We simply jumped into it.\" 116 Arthur Schlesinger, the former special assistant to President Kennedy, said the United States was totally dominant \"except in the case of Israel- Israel dominates US\".117 People should be free to makes all the points because it is highly relevant to what is happening in the Middle East and affects us all. This is not a Jewish plot for global control as some suggest. It is a conspiracy by a fascist mind-set that can infest the consciousness of anyone no matter what their racial or ethnic background. There are white American, British and Europe fascists; Arab fascists; black African fascists; Chinese fascists; Argentine fascists; and there are Ashkenazi fascists. If we ire going to expose the web that is daily entrapping more of our basic freedoms, we must refuse to have that fact edited by those who use the smokescreen of 'racism' to stop the exposure of those involved in the global dictatorship. The Fourth Reich, or the overt re-emergence of the Third, is now imposing itself on our lives. It is time to face up and grow up arid stop seeing the world in the juvenile polarities of black and white, us and them, good guys and bad guys, good race and bad race, at programmes the reality of the political Left, , Right and Centre. There are shades of grey and that's where we need to look if we want to find out what is really happening .

Galileo Galilei There is so much to know' before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 can be fully understood and it goes back a long way. The idea that the conquest of Iraq was decided in a matter of weeks because of the imminent-danger to tl1e world of Saddam Hussein should insult the intelligence of a pea: It was .part of a long planned strategy for global conquest. In 2003 we had the Bush family in the White House, Dick Cheney as Vice President and Colin Powell as Secretary of State, and a United States international 'coalition' went to 'war' with Iraq. In 1991 the Bush family was in the White House, Cheney was Defense Secretary and Powell was head of the US forces as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a United States international coalition' went to war with Iraq. If you add together the casualties from the initial conflict, and the economic sanctions and bombing that followed, the '91 Gulf war cost the lives of a million Iraqi children, even without the child casualties, immediate and long-term, of the invasion of 2003. The Gulf War of father George Bush, like the latest one fronted by his idiot son, was a coldly manipulated set-up. The apparent cause was a dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, a country that has been under British and Illuminati control back to the days when the economic potential of oil was discovered. Iraq has one of the world' s larges oil deposits and has attracted the constant attention of the US and British elite. In fact, countries like Kuwait, Iraq and others in the Middle East, were created by the British and their fellow European powers drawing lines in the sand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, an unpleasant one, and the idea that the Gulf War was to 'free' Kuwaitis just as ridiculous as the claim that the 2003 invasion of Iraqi was to 'liberate' the people. After the first Gulf conflict what happened? Saddam was left in power in Iraq and the Kuwaiti royal dictatorship was brought back with American and British support to continue their policy of the murder and torture of 'dissidents' who campaign for little luxuries like freedom and a say in the running of their own country. Saddam Hussein, the designated villain of both conflicts, was in fact one of the gang. He was a member of the elite Safari Club, which began as a consortium also involving SAVAK, the CIA-connected secret police of the Shah of Iran; Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated. President of Egypt and Saudi Arabian Intelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa to further its goals and is heavily involved in arms trading and supply. Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French Prime Minister, Antoine Pinay. He was a major Illuminati asset who attended the first official meeting of the Bilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Others involved with Le Cercle included the Habsburg family, a major Illuminati bloodline. To give you an idea of its make-up. and range of influence, the Le Cercle membership has included Nicholas Elliot, a department head at Britain’s MI6; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta of Swiss Military Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of the Italian Secret Service and Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger's friend, the former Italian Prime Minister from the notoriousP-2 Freemasonry lodge. No doubt neo-con Michael Ledeen knows him well; Silva Munoz, a former minister for the fascist Franco in Spain and a member of the elite secret society within the Roman Catholic network, Opus Dei; Franz Josef Strauss, the German Defence Minister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent to the Vatican. In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation in Washington. Look at the potential for such an organisation to be a coordinating force between apparently different agencies and countries to achieve a common aim. Le Cercle and the Safari Club are basically the same entity, which is why, as the Wall Street Journal reported on August 16th)990, it was the CIA who supported the Ba'ath Party in Iraq and orchestrated a coup that installed Saddam Hussein as dictator in 1968, just.i1S they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. But, it is important to remember that everyone is expendable to the cause if tl1eir subsequent removal best serves the agenda. Bush - Saddam connections Father George. Bush had more than political associations with Saddam Hussein before the 1991 Gulf conflict. Bush had considerable involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), according to the Chicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. The BCCI, or the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International as it was rightly dubbed, crashed in 1991 amid an enormous-scandal that cost its customers multi-billions. One of the controllers of the bank Khalid bin"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 79 Mahfouz. He was named by the Clinton State Department as funder of Mr of Osama bin Laden and he was also an investor in Harken Energy, one of boy George Bush's oil companies {see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). James Bath~ a close friend of George W. Bush for decades was the Texas representative of Bin Mahfouz. The purpose of the BCCI was to wash drug money and provide a channel for the funding by government agencies like the CIA of the terrorist groups that are used to serve the agenda. Sherman Skolnick has claimed publicly, including an interview on Radio Free \" America, that father Bush, Saddam Hussein and others, used the BCCI to split $250 billion in oil 'kick backs', the skimming-off of money paid by western oil companies in the Gulf. Other researchers and insiders have said the same. Skolnick claims that the records implicating Bush in deals with Sad dam and former Panama President Manuel Noriega were in the hands of the Bank of England and that the money was channelled through the BCCI and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) branches in the USA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, identified links between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer Tom Valentine on Radio Free America: \"[The BCCI] ... was formed in the 1970swith seed money from the Bank of America, the largest shareholders of which are the Rothschilds of Chicago, Paris, London and ,Switzerland , .. The bank is also linked to the financial affairs of former President Jimmy Carter and his friend, and one-time budget director banker Bert Lance. ' \"Some of the ... Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have been , published, for example, in tHe May 3rd issue of the Wall Street Journal. During the 1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major financiers of the Michael Dukakis campaign ... BCCI financed the Democratic Party in the United States and arranged deals for Republicans outside the United States. \"1 Skolnick said records detailing the alleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in the Chicago branch of the BCCI, which was seized by the Federal government in 1988. He went on: \"The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between General Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama I and George Bush. In January of 1990, the Federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida's branch on trial. They were allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the wrist and a small penalty. Here's why: they told the Justice Department that if they were going to prison, they had documents from their bank showing that George Bush had private business ventures through their bank with a series of dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well ... \" ... Saddam's oil was shipped to Texas. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of Pennzoil, issued the largest damages verdict in American history against Texaco. Pennzoil claimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil. Who owns Pennzoil? [Father] George Bush and his friends ... as a result, Texaco fell under the domination and supervision of Pennzoil. Where did the kickbacks to Saddam reportedly come from? They came from deals between Texaco and its subsidiaries purchasing oil from Iraq.\" 2 Who supplied Saddam's chemical weapons? The USA - didn't they Donald? One of the loudest voices calling for the 2003 invasion of Iraq was the Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, a man whose inability to tell the truth never ceases to stagger. Yet this same Rumsfeld was sent to meet Saddam Hussein by the Reagan-Bush White House in 1983 to arrange for the supply of chemical and biological weapons to Iraq for the war against Iran, which Iraq started in 1980 and continued for eight devastating years. These. US-supplied 'weapons' included anthrax and bubonic plague cultures. Conspiracy theory? No, no, this information is contained in declassified US State Department documents that came to light in late 2002. Rumsfeld's meeting with Saddam, preceded by a warm handshake, was part of the Reagan-Bush (in other words Bush) policy of close cooperation with the Iraqi dictator. The documents reveal that the United States increased arms supplies to Saddam even after he had used US-supplied poison gas against the Kurds in 1987 and 1988.3 President Boy George Bush and Tony Blair constantly repeated in 'justifying' the 2003 invasion of Iraq that Saddam had used chemical weapons \"against his own people\" when, in truth, the US and Britain had supplied the means to do it. This US support for Saddam continued for seven years and only a week before Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the US ambassador to Baghdad assured him that the then President father George Bush \"wanted better and deeper relations\". An investigation in 1994 by the Senate Banking Committee disclosed that dozens of biological agents were shipped to Iraq in the mid~80s under licence from the US Commerce Department. These included strains of anthrax that Rumsfeld, Bush and Powell cited in 2003 as one of the reasons they must invade Iraq. A month before Rumsfeld's visit to Baghdad, George (Illuminati) Shultz, the Secretary of State, was given intelligence reports showing that Iraqi troops were resorting to \"almost daily use of CW (chemical weapons) against the Itanians\".4 Rumsfeld claimed he had \"cautioned\" Saddam about the use of chemical weapons at the 1983 meeting. So why supply them in the first place? Once again Rumsfeld is lying. Of course he is; he's speaking isn't he? When Rumsfeld's lie was contradicted by the declassified State Department note of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 80 his meeting with Saddam, a Pentagon spokesman said that Mr Rumsfeld issued the caution to Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister. If you are caught out on one lie, what do you do? You tell another. Howard Teicher, a former National Security Council official during the Reagan Administration, said in a sworn affidavit that the United States \"actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars of credits, by providing military intelligence and advice to the Iraqis, and by closely monitoring third country arms sale to Iraq to make sure Iraq had the military weaponry required\".5 Teicher said that William Casey, the former CIA Director, supplied Saddam with cluster bomb through a front company in Chile. Who supplied North Korea with nuclear technology? Donald Rumsfeld's company But while we are on the subject of Rumsfeld, there's more. In the year 2000, he was a director of the European engineering giant ABB when it sold nuclear reactors to North Korea in a deal worth $200 million and this was the same nuclear capability cited by Rumsfeld, Bush and Co in 2002 as proof that North Korea was part of an \"axis of evil' that had to be confronted.6 Rumsfeld was on the ABB board for eleven years until he left to join the Bush administration in 2001. At the time of the nuclear deal ABB's then chief executive Goran Lindahl, announced a \"wide-ranging, long- term cooperation agreement\" with the communist government. The type of reactors involved produce plutonium that needs refining before it can be weaponised. One US congressman and critic of the North Korean regime described the reactors as \"nuclear bomb factories\".7 When questioned about this outrageous hypocrisy, Rumsfeld's office~ said that the defense secretary did not \"recall it being brought before the board at any time\".8 Still more diplomatic amnesia. Sorry, lying. A spokesman for ABB said that all board members were informed about the deal. It is worth emphasising this again: These liars and cheats are the very same people who have told you what happened on September 11th, who did it, and how. Father Bush funded Saddam The public were also not told that it was the Bush government that had funded the very Saddam military that father George sent US troops to fight in 1991. Much of the funding was channelled through a branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Congressman Henry Gonzales exposed the BNL scandal in 1991 after he noticed that this little branch of the Italian government bank had loaned Iraq $5 billion. This money was dispatched to Sad dam after November 1989 when the Bush \"White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraq if they were to be used for the purchase for US farm products. If Saddam defaulted, the US taxpayers picked up the tab for\" the loan and, since he was always defaulting, that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. As planned, Saddam spent the money on arms, including purchases from the Matrix Churchill machine tool company in England. This company was the subject of a court case in which the British government was implicated. Although many US investigators warned Bush that the money was being used for arms, the loans were allowed \"to continue. The aim was obvious\" when you look of the other evidence. Bush was doing the same as his father did with Hitler. He was funding an aggressor so he could start-a war with him. Some of the money was spent on buying poison gas from a CIA front called Cardeon Industries in Chile.9 When the war started, Saddam defaulted on the loans and the US taxpayers footed the bill for Iraq to fight their own sons and daughters. The cover-up of this, as usual, led to the targeting of the small fry. The whole thing was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL's Atlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogoul, who could never have sanctioned that sort of money without the highest authorisation. A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he was involved at one time with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton, Florida, and with Ishan Barbouti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, the chemical and biological weapons complex in Rabta, Libya.10 His experiences led him to investigate what was going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI and operated for the US government under a code name because they told him these people were international terrorists and that they were going to prosecute them. Kawaja said that he did his own investigation, however, which included \"bugging telephone lines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the United States\". He said he intercepted communications to the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said he saw the letters of credit of the BNL, which , came from Switzerland, and a lot of other communications regarding the Gulf War that was to come\" .. ~e said he recorded calls going to and coming from Baghdad, to and from the United States and London, CIA, FBI, FBI counterintelligence, US Customs, certain politicians and numerous other individuals. \"This is my information\", he said in the radio interview. \"It is not second-hand.\" US District Judge Marvin Shoob said the claim that the Atlanta branch of the BNL could 'loan $5 billion to Iraq without the approval of the head office in Rome could only come out of \"never-never land\". The judge said of manager Drogoul and four other employees at the branch: "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 81 “[They] were pawns or bit players in a far larger< and wider ranging sophisticated conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American and foreign corporations and the governments of the United St~, England; Italy and Iraq ... smoke is coming out of every window. I have to conclude that the building is on fire.\" 11 This is the last thing the father Bush administration and the Illuminati wanted to hear. Judge Shoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge Ernest Tidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA and the Bush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded to plead guilty even though he wasn't. The funding of th~ Iraqi arms build-up before the Gulf War and the supplying of weapons involved the Bush administration, the British government, the Italian government, the Soviet Union and other leading governments and corporations controlled by the Illuminati. One of the network of Illuminati private 'armies' is called the Wackenhut Corporation and investigative journalist John Connolly exposed in a Spy Magazine article12 that Wackenhut had been involved in the arming of Iraq before the first Gulf War by transporting the means to produce the very chemical weapons that father George Bush and Co were saying posed such a tl1!~at. to. the world. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company with other FBI associates in 1954 and its board has been packed over the years with recruits from the FBI, CIA and the military. It has since merged with Group 4 Falck, the world's second largest provider of Security Services. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of father George Bush and has contributed generously to his political campaigns and those of boy George and Florida governor Jeb Bush. Journalist John Connolly wrote: •.... After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more than 300 people, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] truck did contain equipment necessary for the manufacture of chemical weapons and where it was headed [in the \" Winter of 1990]: to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And the Wackenhut Corporation - a publicly traded company with strong ties to the CIA and federal contracts worth $200 million a year was making sure Saddam would be getting his equipment intact.\" 13 The supply of weapons and money involved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to Richard Nixon at the time of the Watergate scandal and a genocide maniac who is now threatened with arrest in several countries for war crimes. As early as 1984 his company Kissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL to Iraq to finance its arms purchases from a little-known subsidiary of Fiat, which was headed by major Illuminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, a former Justice Department investigator, was quoted about this in the US Spotlight newspaper on November 9th 1992. The report said: \"Barletta added that Federal probers had collected dozens of such incriminating case histories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger seems to possess a kind of immunity. I'm not sure how he does it, but Kissinger wields as much power over the Washington National Security bureaucracy now as' in the days when he was the Nixon administration's foreign policy czar. He gets the pay-off; others get the blame. Kissinger , will remain unscathed until Congress finds the courage to convene a full-dress\"\",, investigation into this Teflon power broker.\" \"We love you Sad, go get 'em, boy\" Saddam Hussein was encouraged by the American and British governments to go to war with the CIA/British intelligence-imposed regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 1980. The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering and loss of life. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (all controlled by the Illuminati) and for divide' and rule. In 1990-91 Saddam would be used again, knowingly or otherwise, to start another war in the Gulf, another conflict planned long before. Author and researcher George C. Andrews reported: \"A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our Declaration of War on December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker, signed the US Army Report from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested]. This report describes in detail how extensively Kuwait will be destroyed, how the oil wells will be set on'fire;\"¼\\qd,t/:1enJ1.qw it will ail be rebuilt 'better than before', with despotism, instead of dem09r~cy, even more entrenched than it had been before. The report includes a list of US corporations who want be assigned the profitable task of rebuilding Kuwait and extinguishing the oil fires, as well as the Arab names they will be operating under. [Exactly the same was done before the 'war' in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.] \"Why have none of his political opponents thought of asking the obvious questions ... [such as] ... Why are the huge business deals between Bush and Hussein still off-limits to the public's right to know?\" 14 To readers of my books, the answers to these questions will be obvious."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 82 The sting On July 25th 1990, Saddam Hussein met with the US ambassador in Baghdad, April Glaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions of President Bush. She said the Bush government had \"no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflict like your border disagreement with Kuwait\". Glaspie added that she had instructions from the President to seek better relations with Iraq. She then left for a summer holiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans were not interested in his plan to invade Kuwait.15 Tuning is everything to the Illuminati. They have a specific agenda with a specific timescale. As former Blair cabinet minister Clare Short has said, the date of the second invasion of Iraq was known long before it happened and events were manipulated to hit the deadline. This was the reason for the weapons inspectors of H~ Blix being denied the time to complete their inspections. It was the same in 1991. Suddenly father Bush changed his stance and labelled Saddam \"the new Hitler\". He said the Second World War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. He might have added that it is also not the answer to fund both sides in a conflict and to help finance Hitler's war machine, as his father had done. For those who knew the game plan, it was easy to see what was ~ happening. Bush announced on November 8th 1~90 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would be substantially increased.1pe 'defensive' force was now to switch to offensive mode and the Bush 'UN forces' attacked on Wednesday, January 16th 1991, as planned all along. 120,000 air sorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, it turned out, against civilian areas. Bush's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who has ancestral links with many old American and British families, headed the operation. The number of dead and injured from the bombing of Iraq, the resulting disease and the economic sanctions can hardly be comprehended. Conditions for the civilians in Iraq have been unimaginable under the economic stranglehold that .was imposed through the United Nations by America and Britain after the Gulf War. Home of the brave ... The 'wars' against Iraq\" as with Afghanistan; cannot truly be described as wars at all My understanding of a war; is that you need two sides and under that definition the Gulf War was not a war, and soldiers have described it as a \"turkey shoot\", which is precisely what happened. The Iraqi army, mainly conscripts who had no choice, may have been armed by the US and Britain, but not with the level of firepower that they have. Iraqi men, women and children were subjected to the most intense bombing blitz in human history. At least tens of thousands died in the bombardment and while the media were showing us pictures provided by the US military of 'smart bombs' that could target a building and go through a toilet window, the truth that was being suppressed daily by the military censors was very different. At least 93% of the bombs that rained from the Iraqi skies were not 'smart' and that's according to the Pentagon's own numbers, and 70% of them missed their target. Other civilian targets were struck under the guise of being military or weapon-making centres. A civilian bomb shelter was hit because \"intelligence told us it was a military headquarters\". Reporter Peter Arnett, then with CNN, visited the civilian bomb shelter in Iraq and found it was ... a bomb shelter. He also visited a milk factory bombed because it was a \"chemical weapons factory\" and found it was ... a milk factory. In fact he had been there a year before and it was producing ... milk. Mistakes? Please. Look again at how the Airman magazine described the capabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq: \"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear that an electro optical image stands out next to an FjA-18 fighter. An infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\" 16 There are no mistakes about locations when you. have that level of surveillance technology. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive in 1991 as 'UN' forces used bulldozers to fill in their trenches in blatant contravention of international law. But nothing encapsulates the mentality of these deeply sick people currently waging the war on terrorism' better than the almost unimaginable attacks on the \"Highway of Death'''. The Iraqi army was in retreat in the wake of the air bombardment and headed out of Kuwait across the border to Basra. With them were civilians and prisoners. US pilots attacked the vehicles at the front and back of the seven mile retreating human convoy, so forcing it to a standstill on the open road. They then systematically bombed the convoy, constantly racing back to their 'aircraft carrier to r~-arm and return to continue the mass murder. As one pilot said, it was .like \"shooting fish in a barrel\" and thousands died at the hands of the very people who now 'fight terrorism' and promote themselves as morally superior to. those they target. Barry McCaffrey, one of the generals involved in this mass murder, was later appointed by President Clinton to head his 'War on Drugs'. Yet, as he conducted these crimes against humanity, father"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 83 George Bush approval ratings soared, just as they did for his son when he continued the long, long, family association with human genocide. The blatant defiance of the Geneva Convention on the Highway of Death produced no action against the Bush adIJ1inistration because there is one law for America, Britain and other 'Western' and English speaking nations, and a very different one for those they choose to bomb, kill.<!I\\dJl'\\1Jti!ate. An International War Crimes Tribunal found President George Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker and military leaders Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, guilty of war crime. But what was done as a result? Nothing. These are the people who have the audacity to put others on trial for war crimes, like the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Dark knights The Illuminati Queen of England was most grateful to these maniacs, however, and she made Bush's military chiefs Colin Powell and \"Stormin'\" Norman Schwarzkopf, (the commander of Operation Desert Storm) Honorary Knights of the British Empire. Schwarzkopf has lied through his teeth about the 'mystery' disease known as Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted veterans of that slaughter. His father would have been proud of him. Norman Schwarzkopf senior had been an important player in the British-American Intelligence coup called Operation AJAX, which removed the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. The Illuminati wanted him ousted after he nationalised oil production and removed the oil cartel's power over his people. The British bloodline Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was also behind the coup. Mossadegh was replaced by the dictatorship of the Shah of Iran who reversed the oil nationalisation (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). It is rare for the Queen to give Honorary Knighthoods and other honours to people outside the Commonwealth, but those she has chosen read like an Illuminati Who's Who. The titles are dubbed \"honorary\" because the American Constitution forbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch of a foreign state without the permission of Congress. So few of these honours are given because, as a British government official put it: \"One must not debase the currency.\" I wonder if you think the following names debase the currency: George Bush, the paedophile, child killer, mass murderer, Satanist and close friend of the Windsors, was made Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as was Ronald Reagan, Bush's lapdog 'President'; Henry Kissinger, the 'orchestrator of genocide on a monumental scale worldwide, was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George at a ceremony at Windsor Castle Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and top adviser to George Bush, was ma-de an Honorary Knight of the British Empire; and Casper Weinberger, another Bush clone who was charged with offences in the Iran-Contra arms scandal and pardoned by Bush, is another Honorary Knight of the British Empire. After the September 11th atrocities, the insider mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for doing nothing more than the job he was paid handsomely to do. So why was he such a chosen one? For some more, realistic background to 'hero' Giu\\i,ani and his activities see the website of Robert Lederman, a street artist in New York and a regular columnist for the Greenwich Village Gazette.17 Burying the truth The crimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates are responsible rarely comet to light because the media, at the top level, is controlled by the Illuminati and most Journalists either don't realise they are pawns in a game or they accept it to protect their careers. The accounts are legion of how evidence and footage that expose the lies, especially in wartime, are banned or confiscated. One example during the 1991 Gulf Slaughter was when the American TV networks NBC and CBS refused to air pictures shot in Iraq of the destruction of civilian areas that revealed the Bush government and military accounts to be a grotesque fiction - just as they are In the 'war on terrorism'. The story was blocked by the President of NBC Michael Gartner and the producers offered it to CBS, where Tom Bettag, the .' Executive Editor of the CBS Evening News, said one of them would appear on the show the following day to tell their story. That evening Bettag was sacked and the story buried. This is the real background to the TV news.18 Footage of the Highway of Death was also suppressed. Father Bush's lies about Iraqi troop deployments in Kuwait, provable by satellite images, were also never shown. This satellite 'loophole in the lies' was the reason why the US government purchased all rights to satellite pictures of Afghanistan while that country was subjected to another insane American and British bombing onslaught. We should note, of course, that having said that the CIA-installed dictator Saddam Hussein was a there it to the world, and with the Iraqi' army' destroyed, father George Bush suddenly called an end to the 'war' and pulled the troops out leaving Saddam still intact. As Norman Schwarzkopf said with an air of disappointment: \"We could have completely closed the door and made it a battle of annihilation ... [it was] literally about to become the battle of Cannae, a battle of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 84 annihilation.\" Ah, never mind Norman, but you see your president and those who controlled him wanted Hussein to stay put, or at least appear to, so they could play that card again more than a decade later. Bombing is not enough ... The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1991, but in fact it was only beginning. Using the 'threat' of Sad dam, the 'threat' Bush chose not to remove when it was there for the taking, the United States and the United Kingdom, the diabolical duo of world terrorism, led a campaign of 'sanctions' against Iraq. They also continued, unreported, the bombing of civilian targets, a policy maintained by the Clinton and boy George Bush administrations. Investigative journalist John Pilger wrote of a woman he met in northern Iraq who had lost her husband, children and father-in-law when they were bombed by two US planes while tending their sheep on open land.9 The sanctions against a country that imports 70% of its food were imposed on a people already devastated by the mass bombing of their electricity, water supply, transport and sewer systems, which the British and American governments refused to allow them to rebuild. A public health team from Harvard University went into Iraq soon after the official bombing and estimated that over 46,000 children under the age of five had already died by August 1991 because of the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.2o But the nightmare was only beginning. Writer Thomas J Nagy exposed the coldly calculated way the US military targeted the Iraqi. water supply in the full knowledge of the gruesome effect this would have on the people, especially children. In an article headed \"The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supply\", he wrote that the United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis, mostly children, would pay, and it went ahead anyway.\":! Nagy, who lectures at the School of Business and Public Management at George Washington University uncovered documents from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunning disregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 1991 says: \"Iraq depends on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify it~ water supply ... Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of pure drinking water for much of the population. This could lead to increased incidences, if not epidemics, of disease ... [the] most likely diseases during [the] next 90 days [include]: diarrhoeal diseases (particularly children); acute respiratory illnesses (colds and influenza); typhoid; hepatitis A (particularly children); measles, diphtheria and pertussis (particularly children); meningitis, including meningococcal (particularly children cholera (possible, but less likely).\" 22 This is a massive violation of the Geneva Convention, which says: \"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive.\" The US/British-led UN sanctions against I have done all of these things. By 1995 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the Sixty Minutes television programme that these sanctions had already cost the lives of half a million Iraqi children and that was only up to then. Albright said on Sixty Minutes that she thought the consequences for those children were worth it to stop Saddam. That is stunning enough, but, of course, by invading Iraq a second time in 2003 they. were saying that the sanctions and all that death and suffering was for nothing. This is the mentality that controls our world. A report by Richard Garfield of Columbia University concluded that the increase in child death rates in Iraq was virtually unique in modem health studies.23 Denis Halliday, coordinator of the so-called 'Oil- for-Food Programme' resigned in September 1998 and spoke out against the genocidal effects of the sanctions. His successor, Hans von Sponeck, did the same in February 2000. The US government response was to try to discredit the two men. The 'oil for food' farce provided the oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil. Forty per cent of Iraq's oil, exchanged to buy food, ended up in the United States at knock-down prices because of the sanctions imposed by the United States and Britain to the immense benefit of the Illuminati oil cartel. The forces of freedom and 1iberty have also been bombing Iraq with weapons containing spent uranium and this has led to the birth of babies with horrible deformities and disease (Figures 8 and 9). Since this bombardment began in 1991 Iraq has developed the world's highest rate of childhood leukaemia. At the same time there was an embargo on medicines and technology that would help to reduce the radiation. The genocidal attacks on the Iraqi population began with 'Republican' father George Bush, continued with 'Democrat' Bill Clinton, and within a month of taking office at ,the start of 2001, George W. Bush, another ,'Republican', was ordering (being told to order) more \"routine\" bombing of Iraq: In h11th they are just lackeys for the same one-party state and that's why the policies never change no matter who is in the White House. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 85 Don't do as I do ... The sanctions were 'justified' in part because 9f the 'weapons of mass destruction', . including biological weapons, claimed to be stockpiled by Saddam Hussein in 2003. But the Iraqi arsenal was funded and. supplied by the US and British governments and their allies, and the biggest owner of weapons of mass destruction on the planet is the US government. What's more, by far the greatest user of them is ... the US government. Only one nation has dropped nuclear weapons on another country at the time of writing ... the United States. Add to that the voting record of the United States at the United Nations where it has consistently opposed resolutions to limit the production and testing of biological and nuclear weapons, as it has on a stream of humanitarian and freedom issues. While the US government was lying about the threat to the world from Saddam's chemical weap.'6ns, in one location alone in the United States, Anniston, Alabama, were 873,020 pounds ,of sarin, 1,657,480 pounds of VX nerve agent and 1,~76,760 pounds of mustara.~gent.2t\"1\\cross America the military is storing 23,415 tons of liquid sarin nerve agent blister-causing mustard agent, a deadly nerve liquid called VX and variants - 46,830,000 pounds of chemicals.25 A teaspoon is enough to kill or maim. The United States is required by . international treaty to destroy all chemical weapons by 2007, but nearly 75 per cent of the nation's now-banned arms still exist. The moralising of the United States government and the brain-dead people who support the continuing death and destruction is sickening beyond measure. The US is the only country to have bombed more than 20 countries since 1945; the only country to use nuclear weapons; it withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in December 2001; refused to support efforts to create a verification process for the Biological Weapons Convention and brought an international conference on the matter to a halt in July 2001; refused to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; it is the only Western country to allow the death penalty for children; it refused to sign the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, forbidding the use of landmines; and joined Israel in opposing a 1987 General Assembly resolution condemning international terrorism.26 Amnesty International said in 1996: \"Throughout the world, on any given day, a man, woman or child is likely to be displaced, tortured, killed or 'disappeared', at the hands of governments or armed political groups. More often than not, the United States shares the blame.\" 27 British leaders, too, have an appalling record of mass murder. As far back as 1919, when Winston Churchill was Secretary of State at the War Office, they were using chemical weapons against Iraq. When poison gas was used to put down an Iraqi rebellion against colonial rule, Churchill said: \"I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. I am story in favour of using [it] against uncivilised tribes.\" 28 A soldier who fought with the British army in the Gulf War of 1991 told me that chemical weapons were used against the Iraqi troops in that conflict. Robert Cooper, a former diplomat and personal assistant for foreign affairs to British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted in The Post-Modern State and the World Order: \"We need to get used to the idea of double standards ... [in other words] ... get over it, we a~ hypocrites (but powerful ones).\" Cooper said that the 1991 conflict with Iraq was to maintain control of oil supplies and\" ... the reasons for fighting the Gulf War were not that Iraq had violated the norms of international behaviour ... \" Exactly. They just use any excuse to sell a lie to the people to introduce their agenda - as they have with September 11th and the second 'war' with Iraq."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 86 Weapons of mass deception It was long planned, as these things are, that 'weapons of mass destruction' was to be the excuse for the second war against Iraq in 2003. Having supplied Saddam's chemical and biological arsenal they were not going to let him negotiate it away or acknowledge it was no longer there. Even so, Scott Ritter, former head of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, made it clear that by the late 1990s Saddam's regime was no threat. Ritter said in the June 2000 edition of Arms Control Today: \"Given the comprehensive nature of the monitoring regime put in place by UNSCOM, which included a strict export-import control regime, it was possible as early as 1997 to determine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed. Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities of chemical or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrial means to produce these agents had either been eliminated or were subject to stringent monitoring. The same was true of Iraq's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.’’ \" ... By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a level unprecedented in modern history, but UNSCOM and the Security Council were unable - and in some instances unwilling - to acknowledge this accomplishment.\" They were unwilling because it would have destroyed the cover story necessary to continue the mass killing and 'sell' the planned invasion of 2003. The consequences for the people of Iraq of the 1991 war and the sanctions that followed were beyond comprehension. The country was already in a desperate state even before the US and British blitzkrieg was visited upon them for the second time. Arundhati Roy wrote in the UK Guardian: \"After using the 'good offices' of UN diplomacy (economic sanctions and weapons inspections) to ensure that Iraq was brought to its knees, its people starved, half a million of its children killed, its infrastructure severely damaged, after making sure that most of its weapons have been destroyed, in an act of cowardice that must surely be unrivalled in history, the 'Allies' Coalition of the Willing' (better known as the Coalition of the Bullied and Bought) - sent in an invading army! \"Operation Iraqi Freedom? I don't think so. It's more like Operation Let's Run a Race, but First Let Me Break Your Knees.\" 29 Precisely. SOURCES 1 Radio Free America, March 28th 1991.

Herbert Agar You can't say that civilization don't advance, however, for in every war they kill you in a new way. Will Rogers After the invasion of Afghanistan in 200lJlin which at least 5,000 civilians were killed for no other reason than oil and Illuminati conquest, they began to prepare the way for the next stage in the plan for global domination. It was back to Iraq or back again to their ancient headquarters in the land of Sumer and Babylon (Figure 10). Boy George Bush was given the speech to read (as best he can) for the State of the Union (it's shit) address on January 28th 2002. This contained the phrase, the \"axis of evil\", written by neo-con David Frum of the American Enterprise Institute. It referred to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, three countries specifically named in the September 2000 document produced for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Co by the Project for the New American Century. First on the list was Iraq and the lies began to flood from the White House, the Pentagon and Downing Street in an effort to sell an invasion to the public. They had to justify the war with spurious claims about 'weapons of mass destruction' and also portray th~ 'victory' as the liberation of grateful Iraqis, freed by American heroes. This was important because the better the spin in Iraq the easier the next invasion would be to deliver. In this endeavour they were supported magnificently by the American television networks. I was watching CNN in America on the day the statue of Sad dam Hussein was famously pulled to the ground by US troops amid crowds of cheering Iraqis in Baghdad. Or, at least, that is what they told me I was seeing. CNN stayed live on the statue for some two hours waiting for this event to take place in the square right in front of the Palestine Hotel, which just happened to be home to the international journalists and TV crews. It was all a set up. The TV pictures focussed on the close- up of the statue and th~ cheering people, but a wide shot revealed that only a handful of Iraqis were there and the rest of the square was empty (Figures 11 and 12). Many of these \"cheering Iraqis\" were connected to the CIA-funded Iraqi National Congress of Ahmed Chalabi, who is the US puppet-of-choice to 'lead' occupied Iraq. The whole event was carefully planned and stage-managed to provide a defining moment of the 'war' in the minds of the masses: Iraq had been liberated from oppression by the glorious United States (played by John Wayne). Dr Susan Block, an author and sex educator, compared the scene to a rape: \"The supreme victory for the rapist is proof that his victim 'enjoyed' it. Though he may force his way into her property, demolish her home, murder her loved ones, pillage her belongings, though he may terrify and humiliate her, beat and batter her, break her bones and tear her flesh, spill her blood, wound her organs and lay waste to her very soul, if, in the midst of the rape, between tears and shrieks of agony, if his victim should, for a moment, for some reason, any reason, if she should smile, or, better yet, orgasm, the rapist is redeemed; he is even (in his mind) heroic ...’’ .. ... And still the cozily embedded mainstream media keep playing the image of the toppling statue and the smiling Iraqis. CNN might as well be anchored by Ari Reischer [the White House press spokesman]. The jacked-up newscasters revel in the soft-core porn of war, 'tastefully' showing very little of the rampant hardcore death and dismemberment, just lots of handsome, stalwart troops and beguiling, brown-faced grins that communicate: Freedom! Liberation! Smiles! They love us! We may have brutally, systematically raped their country (and the rape continues), but they want it! They really want us to bomb the shit out of them. They like that. .. 1 Yes, the media fell for the propaganda as usual and, indeed, many US network executives and owners were involved in the plot. Television stations and newspapers across the world blazed the picture of the toppling Saddam and the cheering Iraqis acro~ their screens and front pages to give the mind manipulators exactly what they wanted. Spin doctors: 33,666,911,000; the truth: O. On March 19th, just before the slaughter began,I wrote the following on my website, www.davidicke.com.

Carefully shot close ups gave the impression of cheering Iraqi crowds. But where are they? Of course that is what happened and it hardly took a genius to see it coming because the plan is the same every time: emphasise \\A,\\hat you want the people to believe and suppress or downplay anything that would give them a different perspective. For this reason it was vital to focus on Saddam's toppling statue while talking as little as possible about the \"collateral damage\" - dead and horrifically maimed parents and children. Most of the mainstream media gave the spinners all the support they needed. Would CNN have had a live camera pointing for two hours at a dead and dismembered child? Or inside a devastated hospital trying to treat the children with scorched bodies and missing limbs like those in Figures 13, 14 and 15? That would have provided the truly defining moment and reality of this slaughter, but that is not the idea. Instead the image the spinners wanted people to remember was the one that got the coverage and Arab stations were condemned for showing the true price of war. Everything is spin and aimed at the cameras and the minds of the people. It has nothing to do with truth or facts. Journalist Robert Fisk reported on how American troops opened fire on the car of Quiz al-Selman, a Danish engineer in Baghdad. He was carrying his Danish passport, driving license and medical records, but that didn't matter to the troops who approached him. He said he told them he was a scientific researcher, but they made him lie down in the street, tied his arms behind his back with plastic-and-steel cuffs and tied his feet before putting him into a military vehicle. This is what happened next: \"After 10 minutes in the vehicle, I was taken out again. There were journalists with cameras. The group of Americans untied me, then made me lie on the road again. Then, in front of the cameras, they tied my hands and feet all over again and put me back in the vehicle.\" 3 It's a mind game.

In Britain, the tabloid Sun is owned, like Fox/Fix News and William Kristol's Weekly Standard, by Rupert Murdoch. The Sun ran this headline about the Iraqis: \"Show them no pity: they have stains on their souls.\"4 Better than not having one at all, I guess, because you have sold it to Rupert Murdoch. Sun feature writer Katy Weitz quit in protest at the paper's coverage of the war. The Sun was supporting the Murdoch line, she said, and no one was going to challenge that. \"I want to be proud of the work I help to produce, not shudder in shame at its front-page blood lust\", she wrote in The Guardian.s Some of her fellow journalists felt the same, but they wouldn't leave because they needed the job, while others said she should keep her views to herself. \"I can't bear to hear people knocking their paper - it's like hearing them bad-mouth their family\", one \"journalist\" told her. What about the families in Iraq? Katy Weitz is a rare exception. As she said, the general reaction from colleagues was: \"Goodness me ... a journalist with principles. Wonders will never cease.\" 6 MSNBC correspondent Ashleigh Banfield angered her employers when she gave a lecture at Kansas State University on April 24th 2003 about the war coverage and what she called the \"big show\" / She described what the global audience was not allowed to see. Nobody witnessed the real horrors of what happened, she said, and so people could not \"seriously revisit the concept of warfare the next time we have to deal with it\". There had been a lot of dissenting voices before the conflict about the horrors o~ war, but she was very concerned that the \"three-week TV show\" may have changed people's opinions: \"It was very sanitized\", she said: \"You didn't see where those bullets landed. You didn't see what happened when the mortar landed. A puff of smoke is not what a mortar looks like when it explodes, believe me. There are horrors that were completely left out of this war. So was this journalism or was this coverage? There is a grand difference between journalism and coverage, and getting access does not mean you're getting the story, it just means you're getting one more arm or leg of the story. And that's what we got, and it was a glorious, wonderful picture that had a lot of people watching and a lot of advertisers excited about cable news. But it wasn't journalism, because I'm not so sure that we in America are hesitant to do this again, to fight another war, because it looked like a glorious and courageous and so successful terrific endeavour, and we got rid of a horrible leader: We got rid of a dictator, we got rid of a monster, but we didn't see what it took to do that."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 92 "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 93 \"I can't tell you how bad the civilian casualties were.

She said that a radio host on MSNBC called Michael Savage was outraged that she dared to speak with the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade about why they do what they do; why they are prepared to sacrifice themselves for what they call freedom fighting and others call terrorism. Savage, she said, labelled her a slut, a porn star and an \"accomplice to the murder of Jewish children\".l0 This is unbelievable unless you have heard some of these American mainstream 'talk show' hosts at work. Many have mouths the size of the planet and brains the size of a pea, but they are telling America what to think, or rather not to. In 1991, some called for nuclear attacks on Iraq. \"How can you discuss, how can you solve anything\", Banfield said, \"when attacks from a mere radio flak is what America hears on a regular basis, let alone at the government level?\" If this kind of attitude is prevailing, she added, forget discussion and forget diplomacy. What does that leave us with? War. Banfield highlighted the truly disgraceful Fox/Fix News of Rupert Murdoch. She talked of the \"Fox effect\" with its one-sided patriotism and lack of anything remotely resembling journalism. Cable news operators had wrapped themselves in the American flag and patriotism, she said, and targeted a certain demographic audience. It had been very lucrative and you could already see the effects on the other networks as they hired more and more right wing contributors. All of this was because of Fox, she said, and its successes in taking viewers from other networks. What she is saying is that next time they go to war the 'news' coverage will be even worse. Institutionalised racism I was in America for part of the 'war' and I saw the countless emotionally charged stories about US troops who died in Iraq. \"Terrible news\", I heard CNN say. \"Two US soldiers have been killed in a missile attack.\" There were interviews with the families of troops who would not be coming home alive and the interviewers said how awful it must be for them. I understand this, but never did I hear a thought for what the families of dead Iraqi civilians must be going through. The parents who saw their children blown apart and children who watched the same happen to their mums and dads. Dead Iraqi civilians are not \"terrible news\", it seems; they are unfortunate and unavoidable \"collateral damage\". I saw a Christian TV channel suspend its programming to urge the viewers to \"pray for our troops\". No mention of praying for Iraqis. But then they are Muslims and why would the Christian god give a shit about them? It sickens my stomach to see such blatant racism in the way this 'war', and all such 'wars', are portrayed. Do people with brown faces not have emotions every bit as traumatic and unimaginable as the relatives of US troops? The troops made the choice to go, the Iraqi and Afghan civilians had no such luxury. The United States is the leader of the 'free world'? It holds the high ground of morality? Those who believe such blatant nonsense drown in a cesspit of mass murder and self-congratulation. Let's hear it for the heroes ... Those 'heroic' troops dropped an estimated 30,000 bombs on Iraqis from the air alone at a fantastic cost in human suffering and financial outlay. This is a world that has billions living in poverty, yet every Tomahawk cruise missile costs around a million dollars and the overall military cost is closing in on 100 billion dollars. They targeted a la11d in which some 60 per cent of the 24 million people were children. I see nothing heroic in that. The most famous victim of this fascist carnage was Ali Ismail Abbas, the 12-year-old who lost both his parents and both arms in the US and British bombing of Baghdad. He also suffered appalling burns to his body. \"It was midnight when the missile fell on us\", he told Reuters at the Kindi Hospital. Thinking about his uncertain future, he asked whether he could get artificial arms. \"Can you help get my arms back? Do you think the doctors can get me another pair of hands?\" Abbas asked. \"If I don't get a pair of hands I will commit suicide\", he said with tears spilling down his cheeks. The Reuters report continued:"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 94 \"His aunt, three cousins and three other relatives staying with them were also killed in this week's missile strike$ on their house in Diala Bridge district east of Baghdad. 'We didn't want war. I was scared of this war', said Abbas. 'Our house was just a poor sh9ck, why did they want to bomb us?' said the young boy. With a childhood lost and a future clouded by disaster and disability, Abbas poured his heart out as he lay in bed with an improvised wooden cage over his chest to stop his burned flesh touching the bed covers. 'I wanted to become an army officer when I grow up, but not anymore. Now I want to become a doctor, but how can I? I don't have hands', he said. His aunt, Jamila Abbas, 53, looked after him, feeding him, washing him, comforting him with prayers and repeatedly telling him his parents had gone to heaven. Abbas' suffering offered one snapshot of the daily horrors afflicting Iraqi civilians in the devastating US led war on Iraq.\" 11 Only a public outcry about his plight in the Baghdad hospital, overwhelmed by the casualties and under supplied with drugs and doctors, led to Ali being flown to a hospital in Kuwait. An Iraqi nurse, Fatin Sharhah, wrote a letter to Bush and Blair that said: \"You have all this technology to bomb us ... but you cannot spare one aircraft for one ?ay to save a life?\" 12 Ah yes, but highlighting the story of kids like Ali would not support the US and British spin on their slaughter and so they ignore the suffering until they are forced to act because the news is out. Then those who caused the suffering are portrayed as the good guy heroes helping a little child to 'live'. As doctors and aid agencies stressed, Ali was only one of countless children who suffered similar consequences and for what? To allow Illuminati corporations to take over Iraq and its oil reserves and install themselves as the controlling force in the Middle East. \"Ali's voice is one among millions of children's voices we're not hearing\", said Kathryn Irwin, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).It is they who suffer and die, so people like the Bushes, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Perle, Blair and the rest can impose the agenda they slavishly serve for a global fascist state. While the people suffered from their unimaginable injuries, the effects of the bombing closed most hospitals in Iraq and the looting that ensued from the chaos. Those that were open had few medicines and no electricity or clean water. UNICEF spokeswoman, Kathryn Irwin said: \"Hospitals are having to deal with ill children without the drugs they need and without water - how can you treat someone without clean water?\" I am sure Bush and Blair thought of nothing else. The International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman in Baghdad, Roland Huguenin-Benjamin, said an average of 100 civilian casualties a day were being recorded at hospitals in the capital.1• Dr Huguenin Benjamin and his staff were also shocked by the numbers of dead and injured in a hospital in the town of Hillah: \"That hospital where we had a chance of travelling with our own surgeon was utterly overwhelmed by hundreds of civilian casualties brought in, in just over 48 hours\", he said, \" And there were lots and lots of dead bodies that were practically dismembered by the violence of the explosion they had been subjected to.\"15 Here is some more of the reality behind the glorious victory that CNN, Fix News and the other mainstream networks fail to mention: \"Just a few weeks ago, Ayesha, a young and fragile Iraqi girl, was looking forward to her seventh birthday this coming May. Those aspirations were quickly snuffed out by a US bomb that literally sucked away the insides of her skull, leaving behind the grotesque remains of a shattered dream. The blood that flowed from her small, frail body onto the dirt beneath made sure of that. It was those first images we witnessed that truly reflected the operation that US President George W. Bush has dubbed 'freedom'. Yes, Ayesha is free from further tyranny, and countless other innocent souls have followed her path towards freedom from Bush; but there are others today who are being subjected to no less a fate. \"From bombs dropped incessantly on a helpless population, to civilians strafed by US aircraft, to women and children shredded to pieces by gunning ground troops, this is not a war. This is the terrorism that is of the worst kind. For it is purveyed under the cloak of legitimacy, and in the name of a 'great' democracy.\" 16 And: \"The moaning of Aisha Ahmed, eight, fills the hospital's emergency ward. One of hundreds of child victims in the 15-day-old US-led war in Iraq, she lost one eye and her face and body are peppered with wounds from what must have been a storm of shrapnel. 'Mummy! I want my mummy. Where is my mummy?' Aisha kept muttering. Yet neither the nurse nor the neighbour trying to comfort her dared to answer. Her four-year-old brother Mohammad died and her mother and other brother were in critical condition undergoing surgery for head and chest injuries. Her father and two sisters were all badly injured and in another hospital. A neighbour said he saw missiles crash into Radwaniyeh, a remote area near Baghdad's airport on Wednesday morning. \"To their misfortune, the live in an area that - apart from their farm - has a presidential palace complex and military positions. A total of 12 children and six adults were struck. US war headquarters in Qatar said that a farm at Radwaniyeh doubled as a military 'command and control facility.' Washington says it seeks to minimize civilian casualties in its war to oust President Saddam Hussein. Aisha was with her cousin and neighbors playing in the garden during a lull in the fighting when a missile struck, the neighbor said he"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 95 heard the planes and then the big explosion. We saw these houses in flames, and ran to rescue them and get them out from under the rubble. We did not expect them to hit civilians during a lull,' the neighbor said.\" 17 And: \"Doctor Ahmed Abdel Amir said children were bound to make up a large number of casualties because they are such a big proportion of Iraq's 26 million population. Another child, Mohammad Kazem, seven, lay in the next bed with serum tubes strapped to him. He was hit by shrapnel in the stomach when a missile crashed near his home west of Baghdad. He is so terrified now. He trembles when he hears explosions. I keep on trying to calm him down. I keep telling him that nothing will happen to him any more. 'Whenever he hears the thud of explosions he grabs me. I stay hugging him and patting him until the bombings stop,' said his mother, Madiha Mohsen AIi, 40. 'He does not sleep or eat. The only question he keeps asking is: 'Mummy when will this banging stop?' she added. Such scenes have become part of daily life in Iraq since the US-led war started with a fierce air attack and a ground invasion on March 20.\" 18 And: \"Mohammad al-Jammal, six, was also screaming from his wounds. He too had been standing outside his house when a missile struck, killing two people and sending shrapnel into his stomach, opening it to the intestines. He lay with his father and mother reading Koranic prayers for him. They said he would be all right because 'God is looking after him'. Mothers at the hospital compare notes on their children's traumas. Many speak of their terrified children crying relentlessly, trembling when they hear the bombings. They say their children refuse to eat or sleep.\" 19 And: \"Amid the wreckage I counted 12 dead civilians, lying in the road or in nearby ditches. All had been trying to leave this southern town overnight, probably for fear of being killed by US helicopter attacks and heavy artillery. Their mistake had been to flee over a bridge that is crucial to the coalition's supply lines and to run into a group of shell shocked young American marines with orders to shoot anything that moved. One man's body was still in flames. It gave out a hissing sound. Tucked away in his breast pocket, thick wads of banknotes were turning to ashes. His savings, perhaps. \"Down the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a pretty orange 8Q.~gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body of a man who may have been her father. Half his head was missing. Nearby, in a battered old Bolga, peppered with ammunition holes, an Iraqi woman - perhaps the girl's mother - was dead, slumped in the back seat. A US Abrams tank nicknamed Ghetto Fabulous drove past the bodies. This was not the only family who had taken what they thought was the last chance for safety. A father, baby girl and boy lay in a shallow gravel On the bridge itself a dead Iraqi civilian lay next to the carcass of a donkey.\" 20 And: \"An old man cries over the coffin of his daughter. His wife and younger daughter sit in the dirt outside the mortuary in shock and abject sadness. It is only an hour and 20 minutes since Nadia Khalaf died, too early for total grief to set in. But time enough to know their lives have been shattered forever. We discovered them during a random visit to AI Kindhi Hospital in North East Baghdad at 1p.m. The doctors did not know we were coming - we had an official guide and we were free to choose which hospital. Nadia was lying on a stretcher beside the stone mortuary slab. Her heart lay on her chest, ripped from her body by a missile which smashed through the bedroom window of the family's flat nearby in Palestine Street. \"Her father Najem Khalaf stood beside her corpse. And I shall try to write what he and his family said in exactly the order they said it. I shall try because I hope it will better convey the bewilderment and horror that broke on one Iraqi household yesterday. 'A shell came down into the room as she was standing by the dressing-table,' Najem says. 'My daughter had just completed her PhD in psychology and was waiting for her first job. She was born in 1970. She was 33. She was very clever'. He holds out his dead daughter's identity card for us to see. His fingers are covered in her blood. I go to offer my condolence to his other daughter Alia, who is 35. 'I don't know what humanity Bush is calling for,' she says in English, 'Is this the humanity which lost my sister?' ... Nadia was joking about going for a shower. Alia told her she'd probably be away for three hours ... just waiting for some water. They were laughing. 'I didn't hear any sound', Alia says: '''Suddenly a shell or bomb or something came through the room. I fell to the floor. My mouth was full of dust. I was swallowing dust. Then I looked at her. The missile, something big and unexploded, had come through her chest and her heart. She was covered in blood, unconscious. I ran down to the street, daddy and mummy behind me, screaming for an ambulance. There wasn't any. A neighbour said he would drive us here to the hospital. We all knew it was too late. But we hoped, we hoped.'"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 96 \" ... And so they leave. Three people driven by a neighbour with their precious daughter strapped to the roof. Our guide says they will now wash her body, drape it in white and before dusk lay her in the ground. It has been one of the saddest episodes I have ever witnessed in my 26 years reporting for this newspaper.\" 21 And: \"Doctors who treated Iraqi victims of two previous Wars say they are taken aback by the injuries they have seen. Most suffered massive trauma and fatal wounds, including head, abdominal 9ind limb injuries from lethal weapons, they said. 'I've been a doctor for 25 years and this is the worst I've seen in terms of the number of casualties and fatal wounds,' said Duleimi, 48, who witnessed the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and the 1991 Gulf War. 'This is a disaster because they're attacking civilians. We are receiving a lot of civilian casualties', he added. 'This war is more destructive than all the previous wars. In the previous battles, the weapons seemed merely disabling; now they're much more lethal,' Dr Sadek AI-Mukhtar said. 'Before the war I did not regard America as my enemy. Now I do. There are the military and there are the civilians. War should be against the military. America is killing civilians.''' 22 And: \"Donald Rumsfeld says the American attack on Baghdad is 'as targeted an air campaign as has ever existed' but he should not try telling that to five-year- old Doha Suheil. She looked at me yesterday morning, drip feed attached to her nose, a deep frown over her small face as she tried vainly to move the left side of her body. The cruise missile that exploded close to her home in the Radwaniyeh suburb of Baghdad blasted shrapnel into her tiny legs - they were bound up with gauze - and, far more seriously, into her spine. Now she has lost all movement in her left leg.\" 23 You could fill a library of such stories and when they want to bounce the world into a repeat in Iran, Syria or wherever, perhaps it would be worth asking those supporting another carnage to read those accounts before they urge the people to \"support the troops\" in the latest 'glorious liberation'. Most did not see or hear such stories amid the triumphalism of a US president and vice president who both avoided the draft to Vietnam while supporting conscription for others. This is the president who said (no, his scriptwriters said) that when Iraqis look into the faces of American troops, \"they see strength and kindness and goodwill\".24 No, they see death, destruction and occupation of their land and they see a vicious, brainless, heartless front man in the White House who cares nothing of their plight. A president who talked about \"we\" are making progress in the war when \"we\" were spending most of the time watching sport on the White House television as the devastation continued. But when you come from a family with a truly stupendous record of supporting fascism, abusing and murdering children, and removing those who get in your way, the consequences for Iraqi civilians do not enter the equation (it's a mathematical term, George). In fact, it's a good laugh to them and I'm not kidding. If anyone has a problem with that, they should read some of my other books. To confirm the real mindset behind this war, I watched Lt General Claudia Kennedy.(ret) on CNN responding to the American tank attack on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad that was home to the international journalists. She said she hoped the military would not agonise over every such incident (no chance of that) because winning the war was all that really mattered. Once there was small arms fire from the hotel it became a \"legitimate military target\", she said, even though it was-full of men, women and children. This is the mentality that is planning more such conquests. What was that Rumsfeld told his heroic troops? \"With the liberation of Iraq, you have transformed the country. But how you did it will transform how we defend our country in the 21st century.\" What does it matter to Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld or Blair that people like 72-year-old Abid Hassan Hamoodi lost virtually his entire family when a US/UK 'coalition' (demolition) aircraft 'mistakenly' bombed his home in Basra? \"I lost 10 of my family. I once lived in that house with six other relatives, now I am alone. Just before the invasion started much of my family came to stay in my home, it being made of reinforced concrete and very strong. There was my doctor son, my daughter - a microbiologist and her three sons. My other daughter is a medical consultant and she came with her infants. We all slept in a very safe place at the back of the house; my bed was just a few metres away from the rest. Several rockets had already fallen on a club across the road from my home, five (jays before my catastrophe. Two days before, the Mukhabarat, the secret police building, was hit. We escaped without injury, though all our windows were destroyed. On 5 April at 5.30 am, a plane dropped a rocket on the main road. We all woke up. Just five minutes after we had returned to bed, the plane returned and dived very sharply, firing its rockets. They fell just at the back of the house where we were. \"The three walls of the room fell on many of my family killing them instantly. I went to the roo m and saw them all covered with the bricks and concrete that had fallen. There were 13 in that room. I somehow managed to save one of my daughters, together with her son aged five and her six-month-old infant. Her third child was killed sleeping beside his grandmother, my wife. Despite my enormous efforts, I was unable to remove the things piled up on their bodies. My daughter-in-law went into the street shouting for help, but it was early and it was completely deserted. We had to wait for the ambulances to come to remove them,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 97 but they were all dead. I gave the kiss of life to three as they were removed, but I could not restore their lives ... \" ... While I was busy removing my family and in such great shock and sorrow, people looted my house. They stole two cases, one containing all our jewellery and $25,000, the other containing new clothes I had just brought back from Manchester, where my two sons live as British citizens. The coalition has now created an excuse that they were firing on a house adjacent to mine and that Ali Hassan, known to many as Chemical Ali, was inside. They attacked us just one day before Basra fell. They could have caught this man, not tried to kill him. Was it necessary to kill 20 people in our street for the sake of one bastard? \"I have never interfered with Saddam and he has left me alone to live with my family, bring up my children and educate them. Now the coalition has killed a family of highly qualified people, irreplaceable people for Iraq.\" 25 Anyone who supported the war, or was indifferent to it, is responsible for all that happened and continues to happen. I remember being on the 702 radio station in South Africa talking about the background to the war when a guy called \"Mike\" came on. This was an idiot of unbelievable magnitude. \"What planet are you on?\" was all he could say, ignoring every opportunity to answer the question: \"What research have you done into these matters?\" He even castigated the presenter for having me on the programme to say such things. When people ask me how a few can control the world, Moron Mike often gets a mention these days. If it wasn't for people like him - and there are billions of them - none of this would be possible. Fodder in uniform (brain optional, but not encouraged) Many people of the Mike mentality are in the military or \"the cavalry on the new American frontier\", as the Project for the New American Century describes them. They are a mixture of John Wayne wannabes; psychopaths who can hide their sickness behind the cover of military legitimacy; those who genuinely think they are serving their country while serving the Illuminati; and others who are basically dumb and have to be told what to do. Take Tyler Aholt, a member of a Naval construction force called the Seabees, who said this of the people protesting against the war: \"If they are not backing up those that are in charge of us, then in the long run, they're not backing us up.\" Take a deep breath and wait for the punch-line: \"I've considered if some of the protesters even understand the whole idea of war: without war, how can you have peace?\" 26 As Einstein said: \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I am not so sure about the former.\" Then there was this guy reported in the UK Sunday Times: \"The Iraqis are sick people and we are the chemotherapy\", said Corporal Ryan Dupre. \"I am starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi. No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him.\" 27 Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old marine reserve who refused to fight in Iraq, said that many of his fellow recruits envied him when they thought he was going to be sent into battle. \"They would say things like, 'Kill a raghead for me - I'm so jealous,'\" he said.28 Another soldier recorded by the BBC said: \"We godda get this cargo up front, the sooner we get [it there], the sooner they can kill some of these people that need killin', the sooner we can go home.\" 2Y In the same programme came this gem from a boy soldier taking part in the 'liberation': \"We bomb 'em, you know it's cool to me because I like explosions and stuff like that, but, like, I don't get to see the actual explosion, and that's what I want to see, but I guess when we get closer to Baghdad we'll get to see more of that.\"}l) Hey, Cap'n, I just killed 14 of them there brown faces and my machine won't give me extended play, sir. A British soldier was arrested after staff in a photo-processing store gave photographs to the police that indicate Britis4-ttroops tortured and sexually abused Iraqi prisoners of war. One shows a man stripped to the waist while suspended from a rope attached to a forklift truck. A soldier driving the truck is apparently laughing at his plight. Others appear to show an Iraqi man forced to perform oral sex on a white soldier; two others forced to have anal sex; and two naked Iraqis cowering on the ground. Officers from the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police arrested Gary Bartlam, a private in the First Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. He was on leave from the regiment stationed in Iraq's second city Basra and the port of Umm Qasr. The British army is as brutal as any of them. Then there were the schoolboy slogans the juveniles would write on their tanks and missiles. The brilliant writer, Arundhati Roy, said in the UK Guardian: \"On the steel torsos of their missiles, adolescent American soldiers scrawl colourful messages in childish handwriting: For Saddam, from the Fat Boy Posse. A building goes down. A marketplace. A home. A girl who loves a boy. A child who only ever wanted to play with his older brother's marbles.\" 31 This is the sort of mentality, if you can call it that, which is fighting these wars of 'liberation'. Peter Arnett, the veteran war reporter sacked by NBC during the Iraqi invasion, told in the UK Daily Mirror of his experiences with such dumbos. He said that the United States was bringing enormous firepower to bear to grind down the Iraqis and he had seen it all before:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 98 \"During the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, I entered a US-held town which had been totally destroyed. The Viet Cong had taken over and were threatening the commander's building so he called down an artillery strike which killed many of his own men. The Major with us asked: 'How could this happen?' A soldier replied: 'Sir, we had to destroy the town to save it'.\" 32 There were others in Iraq, however, that did allow the reality of war to register, including this soldier quoted by the Sunday Times: \"Did you see all that?\" he asked, his eyes filled with tears. \"Did you see that little baby girl? I carried her body and buried it as best I could but I had no time. It really gets to me to see children being killed like this, but we had no choice.\" 33 An understandable reaction, but of course he did have a choice. He had a choice not to be there. Sergeant Ray Simon of the US 3rd Infantry Division put it very well when he said: \"We get up in the morning, go and kill people, stop for a lunch break, then kill some more, before going to sleep. This thing is getting ridiculous.\" 34 There are decent, caring people in the military who do believe they are helping people. But these genuine soldiers are being duped. Thousands of civilians were killed by US and British forces and hundreds of thousands injured - people like 20-year-old Akeel Kadhim, a student whose left leg was amputated. \"1 was shot by the Americans\", he said, \"1 was running to another wounded person, trying to save him ... We are innocent. We were not fighting. We were not resisting. I tried to save an innocent person. Why did they shoot me?\" 10 Can a 'smart' bomb be used by an idiot? Apparently so. Once again the public were manipulated into believing in the invincibility of the 'smart' bombs that only hit their intended targets and arrogant military spokesmen like Brigadier General Vince Brooks, Deputy Commander at Central Command, would give journalists a daily dose of this conditioning with videos of their accuracy. Meanwhile 'smart' bombs aimed for Iraqi towns and cities were landing in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. Whenever they landed their lethal cargo in civilian areas or the US military shot civilians, Mr. Brooks and company became much less talkative and they would immediately muddy the waters by saying, \"We don't know exactly what happened, we are investigating\". The idea is to hope that no one asks again. The cynicism reached new lows when a US missile landed in a Baghdad market killing more than 60 in the Baghdad district of Shu'ale and people like Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, General Richard Myers, sought to blame it on the Iraqis. It could have been Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, they said, when there was none by this time in the conflict. UK Independent journalist, Robert Fisk, found a fragment of the missile with its code number and The Guardian newspaper reported: \" ... It has emerged - as a result of detective work on the Internet by a Guardian reader - that the explosion in a Baghdad market which killed more than 60 people last Friday was indeed caused by a cruise missile and not an Iraqi anti-aircraft rocket as the US has suggested. A metal fragment found at the scene by British journalist Robert Fisk carried various markings, including 'MFR 96214 09'. This, our reader pointed out in an email, is a manufacturer's identification number known as a 'cage code'. \"Cage codes can be looked up on the internet (www.gidm.dlis.dla.mil). and keying in the number 96214 traces the fragment back to a plant in McKinney, Texas, owned by the Raytheon Company. Raytheon, whose headquarters are in Lexington, Massachusetts, aspires 'to be the most admired defense and aerospace systems supplier through world-class people and technology', according to its website (www.raytheon.com). It makes a vast array of military equipment, including the AGM129 cruise missile which is launched from B-52 bombers.\" 36 Lewis Libby, Dick Cheney's chief of staff, has shares in Raytheon Corp, which was selected with Kellogg Brown and Root to destroy 'weapons of mass destruction' in Iraq.3? Many defence analysts have agreed that what happened at the Shu'ale market was almost certainly due to a Harm, which carries a warhead designed to explode into thousands of aluminium fragments, hence the injuries inflicted. In a similar incident, 21 Iraqi civilians were killed by a US/British missile unleashed by the forces of tyranny. A Red Crescent maternity hospital was bombed and in al-Janabiy, in the southeast of Baghdad, photographer Patrick Baz, a veteran of the conflict in Beirut in the 1980s, found a farm pulverized by missiles with at least 20 dead inside, including 11 children.38 Members of the US 3rd infantry division shot dead seven women and children travelling in their car at a checkpoint set up by the occupying force. A Washington Post reporter at the scene said ten were killed, including five children who appeared to be younger than five years old.39 The report described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. The military spokesman lied as always, saying - the car did not respond to warning shots, but the Washington Post reporter said that Captain Ronny Johnson shouted at his troops: \"You just fucking killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!\" 40 \"We do all we can to protect civilians\" "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 99 The indiscriminate killings of civilians were a constant feature of the invasion and these have continued since the occupation began. When US troops exploded an arms dump close to a civilian area at Hai al-Muallimin on April 26th 2003 killing 12 people, they said it had been targeted by Iraqis. This was despite the fact that the US forces had been exploding Iraqi arms dumps all over the country and the people in the area had already asked them to move the one in question because any explosion threatened civilians. Sabi Hassoun, a 70-year-old great-grandfather lost six members of his family - a son, three grandsons and two of their wives, the BBC reported, and near him a little boy was crying inconsolably. He lost both his parents in the disaster.41 At least 13 civilians were killed and scores injured when US troops opened fire on a demonstration in the town of Falluja, 35 miles from Baghdad. The protestors were demanding that the military leave the local school to allow the children to return to their lessons. The US military, as always, said they had been fired on, but witnesses said only stones were thrown. Most of the dead and injured were young people and the next day two more were shot dead by US bullets during a protest against the first killings. In another incident, troops opened fire on a crowd opposing the appointment of a new pro-American (of course) governor in the northern city of Mosul. Ten died and around a hundred were injured. Hundreds more Iraqis have been killed by US troops since the 'major' war officially ended and the fodder troops have also continued to be killed almost by the day at the time of writing. Civilians were not only hit, they were on many occasions targeted, as they always are. A Belgian news photographer, Laurent Van der Stockt, working for the Gamma agency and under contract for the New York Times Magazine, followed the advance of US Marines (3rd battalion, 4th regiment) for three weeks, up to the taking of Baghdad on April 9th. Van der Stockt has worked in many war zones, including the first Gulf War, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Africa and the Occupied Territories. He told the Le Monde newspaper in France of his experiences with the same troops that would topple the Saddam statue in front of the world media. Van der Stockt said he saw American troops taking every opportunity to tear down portraits of Saddam Hussein. \"They were doing this right in front of the local inhabitants, whose elation quickly vanished\", he said. \"The soldiers obviously didn't imagine that it was up to the Iraqis to be doing this or that it was humiliating for them.\" 42 He told Le Monde       \"During the first few days, with colleagues from the New York Times and Newsweek, I tried to follow the convoys in a SUV by playing hide-and-seek. We were spending a lot of time then with the 1,500 Marines of the 3/4, commanded by Colonel Bryan P. McCoy ... their motto is 'Search and Kill'. The 'Kilo' unit is nicknamed 'Killer Kilo'. The words 'Carnivore' or 'Blind Killer' are painted on their tankls. McCoy could snap with a 'shame on you', a smile flashing across his face to the sniper who had just finished telling him: 'I've got eight, sjr, but only five'. Literally meaning: I've shot eight, but only five of them are dead'.\" 43 Van der Stockt said he had never seen a war with so few 'returns'. The Iraqi army was like a ghost, it barely existed, he said. Over the three weeks, he only saw the Iraqi' army' fire a few short-range rockets and a few shots. He saw deserted trenches, a dead Iraqi soldier lying next to a piece of bread and some old equipment. There was nothing that really made him feel that there was a real confrontation going on, nothing comparable to the \"massiveness of the means at the Americans' disposal\". On April 6th, he and the Marines were at the outskirts of Baghdad, facing a strategic bridge the Americans called \"the Baghdad Highway Bridge\". Residential areas were now much greater in number, but American snipers were ordered to kill anything coming in their direction. That night a teenager who was crossing the bridge was killed. Van der Stockt described to Le Monde what followed: \"On the morning of April 7, the Marines decided to cross the bridge. A shell fell onto an armored personnel carrier. Two marines were killed. The crossing took on a tragic aspect. The soldiers were stressed, febrile. They were shouting. The risk didn't appear to be that great, so I followed their advance. They were howling, shouting orders and positions to each other. It sounded like something in-between a phantasm, mythology and conditioning. The operation was transformed into crossing the bridge over the River Kwai. \"Later, there was some open terrain. The Marines were advancing and taking up position, hiding behind mounds of earth. They were still really tense. A small blue van was moving towards the convoy. Three not-very-accurate warning shots were fired. The shots were supposed to make the van stop. The van kept on driving, made a U-turn. took shelter and then returned slowly. The Marines opened fire. All hell broke loose. They were firing all over the place. You could hear 'Stop firing' being shouted. The silence that set in was overwhelming. Two men and a woman had just been riddled with bullets. So this was the enemy, the threat. \"A second vehicle drove up. The same scenario was repeated. Its passengers were killed on the spot. A grandfather was walking slowly with a cane on the sidewalk. They killed him too. As with the old man, the Marines fired on a SUV driving along the river bank that was getting too close to them. Riddled with bullets, the vehicle rolled over. Two women and a child got out, miraculously still alive. They sought refuge in the wreckage. A few seconds later, it flew into bits as a tank lobbed a terse shot into it. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 100 \"Marines are conditioned to reach their target at any cost, by staying alive and facing any type of enemy. They abusively make use of disproportionate firepower. These hardened troops, followed by tons of equipment, supported by extraordinary artillery power, protected by fighter jets and cutting-edge helicopters, were shooting on local inhabitants who understood absolutely nothing of what was going on. With my own eyes I saw about fifteen civilians killed in two days. I've gone through enough wars to know that it's always dirty, that civilians are always the first victims. But the way it was happening here, it was insane.\" 44 Van der Stockt said that at the \"roughest moment\", the most humane of the troops was a guy called Doug who gave real warning shots, aiming for tyres or the engine, and saving at least ten lives in two hours, according to the photographer. Distraught soldiers were saying: \"I ain't prepared for this; I didn't come here to shoot civilians.\" Van der Stockt continued: \"I drove away a girl who had had her humerus pierced by a bullet. Enrico was holding her in his arms. In the rear, the girl's father was protecting his young son, wounded in the torso a1d losing consciousness. The man spoke in gestures to the doctor at the back of the lines, pleading: 'I don't understand, I was walking and holding my children's hands. Why didn't you shoot in the air? Or at least shoot me?' In Baghdad, McCoy sped up the march. He stopped taking the time to search houses one-by-one. He wanted to get to Paradise Place as soon as possible [the location of the Saddam statue and the long-planned photo opportunity captured by the media]. The Marines were not firing on the thickening population. The course ended with Sad dam's statue being toppled. There were more journalists at the scene than Baghdadis. Its five million inhabitants stayed at home.\" 45 Robert Fisk described this cold-blooded murder by an American military sniper e UK Independent \"An American Marine sniper sitting atop the palace gate wounded three civilians, including a little girl, in a car that failed to halt - then shot and killed a man who had walked on to his balcony to discover the source of the firing. Within minutes, the sniper also shot dead the driver of another car and wounded two more passengers in that vehicle, including a young woman. A crew from Channel 4 Television was present when the killings took place.\" 46 But most of the time in this high-tech warfare the killers never even see their victims. MSNBC correspondent Ashleigh Banfield said the tanks and the vehicles used in the front lines are so high tech that an artillery engineer can pinpoint a target on a screen and destroy it without ever seeing a warm body. \"Some of the soldiers, according to our [embedded reporters], had never seen a dead body throughout the entire three-week campaign\", she said, \"It was like Game Boy.\" 47 Toys for the boys The psychopathic, juvenile and dumb have in their hands the most destructive firepower in known human history. The latest little gem is the Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb or Moab, the 'Mother of all Bombs'. The use of the name, Moab, would never be a coincidence to the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati. Moab is a name familiar to readers of the Old Testament as in the Plains of Moab, near Jericho (Numbers 22:1, 26:63, Joshua 13:32), where the Israelites are claimed to have made their last encampment before they entered the Promised Land after their alleged journey through the wilderness. The Bible says that the character called Moses died in Moab. The location also has associations with Freemasonry. The bomb of the same name is the most powerful non-nuclear weapon on the planet. The Moab detonates 21,000lb of explosives above the ground and is guided by the satellite linked global positioning system. It can trigger temperatures of up to 538C (I,OOOF) and has an awesome destructive power. I wonder if this just might qualify as a 'weapon of mass destruction? Imagine that dropping on a civilian area or anywhere. Wade Frazier's excellent study of the Gulf 'War' reveals the background to another weapon used against the Iraqi people: \"The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads a fine mist of fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a football field] into an explosive mix of vast proportion; then a second detonation ignites the mixture, causing an awesome explosion. The explosion is about the most powerful 'conventional' explosion we know of.’’ \"At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in its detonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around them. Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The bomb sucks oxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out through the mouths of people unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone. Our military used it on helpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].\" 48 "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 101 Figure 1.6: Would a hungry child spot the difference? The 'food' parcels and cluster bomblets were both dropped by US forces and both were the same colour yellow. How sick can you get? Figure 1.7: What cluster bombs do: this is only one of tens of thousands of victims mutilated by US cluster bombs in South East Asia. The US and UK dropped these same weapons on civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq. Still support the troops, These weapons were used in Afghanistan and the two wars on Iraq. Oft one end of this process is a 'hero' in a uniform pressing a button and on the other are men, women and children exploding into pieces. The Iraqi population were subjected to a lovely piece of hardware called a 'Big Blue', which produces a shock wave only eclipsed by nuclear weapons. Wade Frazier points out that the power of the shock wave can turn a body into a hamburger. Also deployed were the 'bouncing bombs' that are designed to 'bounce' to waist height before exploding and ensure a better chance of hitting people. There is the 'Beehive' bomb that explodes 8,800 pieces of razor-edged shrapnel in all directions, tearing people apart. The US and British heroes and liberators bombarded Iraq, as they did Afghanistan, with lethal cluster bombs that cause horrendous civilian death and suffering. Cluster bombs can be delivered by aircraft, artillery or missile. Each one releases dozens, often hundreds of smaller 'bomb lets' or 'grenades'. In turn, each of these contains hundreds of metal fragments. Just one of these fragments can rupture the spleen or cause the intestines to explode.49 These weapons are particularly indiscriminate and if you are there when they fall, that's just too bad. So many of these bomb lets fail to explode initially that their use peppers the landscape with landmines waiting to go off when any unknowing child touches them. In Afghanistan the sick minds at the Pentagon dropped \"food parcels\" that were almost identical in colour and design as the cluster bomblets (Figure 16). In Laos, where there are still an estimated 10 million (or more) unexploded American cluster bombs, people are still being killed almost every day from these weapons dropped 30 years ago (Figure 17).50 During the 1991 Gulf War more than 30 million cluster bomblets were dropped on Kuwait and Iraq. Unexploded bombs later killed 1,600 civilians and injured another 2,500. A study by the Red Cross revealed that children in Kosovo are five times more likely to be killed or injured by a NATO-dropped unexploded cluster bomb than by a Serbian landmine. Today in Afghanistan the killing also still continues, as it does in Iraq. Reports in August 2003 suggested that a thousand Iraqi children had already died this way. More than 50 international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Committee to Ban Landmines have called for a moratorium on cluster bomb use, but the US and Britain go on using them. 51 When you think that all these weapons and more were deployed against Iraq, is it any wonder that people suffered such grotesque injuries from this scale of savagery? Cluster bombing Babylon"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 102 The outstanding British journalist (yes, a real one), Robert Fisk, detailed in the UK independent the consequences for Iraqis from the cluster bombs used by the US and/ or British forces in the slaughter of 2003. Reporting from villages around the city once known as Babylon (how appropriate), he said that the wards of the Hillah teaching hospital contained the proof that \"something illegal- something quite outside the Geneva Conventions\" had occurred: the use of cluster bombs. He described the wailing children, the young women with breast and leg wounds, the ten patients upon whom doctors had to perform brain surgery to remove metal from their heads. They talked of the days and nights when the explosives fell \"like grapes\" from the sky. Were they American or British aircraft that showered these villages with one of the most lethal weapons of modern warfare? Fisk wanted to know. The 61 dead who had passed through the Hillah hospital could not say, he wrote, and nor could the survivors who, in many cases, were \"sitting in their homes when the white canisters opened high above their village, spilling thousands of bomb lets into the sky, exploding in the air, soaring through windows and doorways to burst indoors or bouncing off the roofs of the concrete huts to blow up later in the roadways ... Some died at once, mostly women and children, some of whose blackened, decomposing remains lay in the tiny charnel house mortuary at the back of the Hillah hospital.\" 52 The hospital treated 200 wounded, besides the 61 dead, and many others were believed to have died who were not brought to the hospital. Doctors said about 80 per cent of the victims were civilians. Robert Fisk wrote: \"Heartbreaking is the only word to describe 10-year-old Maryam Nasr and her five-year old sister Hoda. Maryam has a patch over her right eye, where a piece of bomblet embedded itself, and wounds to the stomach and thighs. I didn't realize that Hoda, standing by her sister's bed, was wounded until her mother carefully lifted the little girl's scarf and long hair to show a deep puncture in the right side of her head, just above her ear, congealed blood sticking to her hair but the wound still gently bleeding. \"Their mother described how she had been inside her home and heard an explosion and found her daughters in a pool of blood near the door. The little girls alternately smiled and hid when I took their pictures. In other wards, the hideously wounded would try to laugh, t o show their bravery. It was a humbling experience.\" 53 Fisk described the mortuary as \"a butcher's shop of chopped-up corpses\" and there was a graphic account of the cluster-bomb carnage in the Asian Times.54 It quoted Roland Huguenin-Benjamin, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Iraq, describing the scene in Hillah as \"a horror, dozens of severed bodies and scattered limbs\". Journalists found \"babies cut in half, amputated limbs, kids with their faces a web of deep cuts caused by American shellfire and cluster bombs\". Nobody in the West saw these images on their television screens because they were censored and milder versions distributed. The Asia Times report said that an Arab cameramen told how he saw two trucks full of bodies - mostly children, and women in flowered dresses - parked outside the Hillah hospital. If you miss the first time - get 'em later The mass bombing made enormous additions to the depleted uranium left by the conflict of 1991 that has sent the rates of leukaemia, other cancers, and deformed babies soaring. The British Ministry of Defence confirmed that troops returning from the Gulf were offered tests to assess the levels of depleted uranium in their bodies and establish if they were in danger of suffering kidney damage and lung cancer. 55 Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the Royal Society working group on depleted uranium, said: \"It is highly unsatisfactory to deploy a large amount of a material that is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to it.\" 56 He said civilians in Iraq should be protected by checking milk and water samples for depleted uranium over a prolonged period and that soldiers might suffer kidney damage and increased risk of lung cancer if they breathed in substantial amounts. But, of course, we know the effect of this poison with the consequences for the Iraqi people since 1991. Within three years of the conflict cancer in Iraq had increased 700% and thousands f troops are suffering from Gulf War Syndrome, which the authorities spent so long trying to dismiss. Despite the clear correlation between health effects and depleted uranium, the UK 'Defence' Secretary Geoff Hoon told the House of Commons in 2003 that there was \"not the slightest scientific evidence\" to suggest that depleted uranium left a poisonous residue.57 This is breathtaking, inhumane, mendacious claptrap, as Hoon must know. He, like Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Home Secretary David Blunkett, are, in my view, beyond words. They are an insult to the principles on which their Labour Party was created and has long-since discarded to serve the Illuminati agenda. Professor Doug Rokke is a former US army colonel and director of the Pentagon's depleted uranium project. He says that the military cannot just contaminate any other nation, cause harm its· people and environment and then ignore the consequences of what they have"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 103 done. He called on the US and UK to \"recognise the immoral consequences of their actions and assume responsibility for medical care and thorough environmental remediation\".58 But they won't because they don't care about the consequences for troops or civilians, only that the outcome suits their plans. The UN Environment Programme found that the depleted uranium used by the US and UK in the Balkans had reached the water table and seven years after the conflict it recommended the decontamination of buildings to protect the civilian population against cancer. But there's no evidence is there, Mr Goon? Depleted uranium is standard in a number of anti-tank weapons and is also contained in bullets, shells and bombs. The so-called bunker busters used in Baghdad contain seven tonnes of depleted uranium alone and one of these was used in the \"attempt to kill Saddam Hussein\" when a restaurant was targeted. This alone would have contaminated a large civilian area with depleted uranium and that is just one bomb. 59 Experts suggest that between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes of depleted uranium were used by the coalition in the three week conflict compared with 340 tonnes in 1991- and look at the consequences of that.60 Saul Bloom is executive director of Arc Ecology, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organisation that has helped foreign governments analyse the environmental impacts of US military bases. He says of the uranium pollution: \"Post-war environmental deaths may exceed direct civilian casualties.\" 61 Thus we can observe both the consequences for the Iraqi people of being 'liberated' and the almost unimaginable sickness of the soul it takes to plan such suffering simply to increase your own power. Yet these are the minds that control our world. For how much longer are we going to let them?? Medal if you kill, jail of you don't Events may appear to be topsy-turvy and Alice in Wonderland, but that's only if you are looking for logical explanations based on the world the people are conditioned to believe in. The common theme that finds the logical in the apparently inexplicable is a simple question: is it good for the agenda? For example, it does not appear logical or consistent to arm Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological weapons and then for the same people to use his alleged possession of such weapons to invade his country. But it suited the agenda both to arm Iraq before the Gulf War in 1991 and then to invade in 2003 using the US-supplied 'weapons of mass destruction' as the excuse. To the manipulators there is nothing contradictory in that at all. It is simply the way the game is played. If you kill people while wearing a uniform they give you a medal and if you do the same in jeans and a T-shirt they give you a life sentence. Soldiers are called \"heroes\" for killing civilians and jailed if they refuse to do so. This, again, is perfectly logical because the Illuminati want their troops to kill people. They don't want their fodder in uniform using their own minds and conscience and refusing to be involved in murder. Two British soldiers faced up to two years in prison for refusing to fight in Iraq because they would not take part in a conflict in which civilians would be killed. The two men, thought to be a private and an air technician with the 16 Air Assault Brigade, were sent back to their barracks and a third was preparing for a court martial after he would not travel to Iraq. Stephen Eagle Funk, a 20-year-old US marine reserve, also refused to be sent to Iraq to take part in a war he believed was \"immoral because of the deception involved by our leaders\".62 He said he would rather take the punishment now than live with what he would have to do in Iraq for the rest of his life: \"I would be going in knowing that it was wrong and that would be hypocritical.\" 63 He faced a possible court martial and time in a military prison for his action. But he is a true military hero. As Mark Twain said: \"It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare.\" Like increasing numbers of young soldiers, Funk only joined the military to have his college fees paid and because \"the ads make the armed forces look so cool- 'call this number and we'll send you a free pair of boxer shorts'. A lot of kids had no idea what was involved\", he said.64 He was soon to find out: \"Every day in combat training you had to yell out 'Kill! Kill!' and we would get into trouble if you didn't shout it out, so often I would just mouth it so I didn't get into trouble.\"65 He said that recruits were encouraged to hurt each other in hand-to-hand combat training. \"I couldn't do that so they would pair me up with someone who was very violent or aggressive.\"66 When the instructor told him he had an attitude problem he could not keep quiet any longer: \"I was a little pissed off and I said, 'I think killing people is wrong.' That was the crystallising moment because I had never said it out loud before. It was such a relief. It's a lot easier if you just give in and don't question authority.\" 67 He said he had spoken out to warn other young people about the manipulations of the military: \"War is about destruction and violence and death. It is young men fighting old men's wars. It is not the answer; it just ravages the land of the battleground. I know it's wrong but other people in the military have been programmed to think it is OK. All they [the military] want is numbers. What I'm doing is really trying to educate people to weigh their options - there are so many more ways to get money for school.\" 68 Albert Einstein put it so well: \"The pioneers of a warless world are the youth who refuse military service.\" "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 104 Pawns in uniform, oops, sorry, \"our troops\" The irony is that the troops who bombard these countries with their lethal weaponry causing such death and destruction are thernse1v~s considered to be expendable fodder by the Illuminati. The war criminal, Henry Kissinger, a major Illuminati front man for more than 40 years, said: \"Military men are dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy.\"69 They are portrayed as heroes when they go to war and they are hailed as even greater heroes if they die for the Illuminati, or \"the cause of freedom and liberation\". But once they are dead, or if they are maimed for life or develop war-related disease like Gulf War Syndrome, they will be ignored and cast aside, even publicly condemned. My father served with the Army Medical Corps in the Second World War and he told me from an early age about the reality of war. He told me how young kids, still in their teens, would be brought back from battle with horrendous injuries screaming for their mothers thousands of miles away. He recalled how they would add ballast inside the coffins to cover the fact that there was so little left of the person inside. He also told me how military doctors would bend the rules to get people enlisted into the military at wartime when they had medical problems that should have prevented this. Then, when they returned injured in mind or body, the same doctors would follow the rules to the letter to stop legitimate compensation. I wrote a poem about this that you will find in Appendix II. Typical of this attitude was the experience of Lianne Seymour, a mother of a young child, whose husband, Ian, died in a helicopter crash in Iraq. Soon after his death she received a letter from the British Ministry of 'Defence' saying that she would have to vacate her military home and repay nine days of his salary that had been paid since his death. When the story broke in the newspapers the Blair gang did what they always do when the truth is out. They lied and blamed it all on the man at the ministry who sent the letter. They described it as a \"mistake\" and said it was not policy to do this. It turns out that this is exactly what the policy is. I don't know why she should be made to suffer further, but Lianne Seymour was invited to meet Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, as he sought to offset the bad publicity. He said she would not have to repay the nine days pay or move out of the house. She said of the meeting: \"It's completely disappointing. I think his words were that I'm not going to live in luxury but at least I'm not going to be poor, which I just think is terrible.\" 70 The men who sent her husband to war while never seeing a bullet fired themselves, will of course, continue to live in luxury. Some 200,000 soldiers who took part in the Gulf War of 1991 complained of pain, sickness, skin problems, loss of memory and concentration - the symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome. The average payment in compensation for the loss of their long-term health is, according to campaigner Joyce Riley, about $98 a month.7! Some 60,000 have had compensation claims rejected by the Pentagon. Riley said the pathetic payment \"basically washes the DOD's hands; they can say 'look, we are compensating\"'.72 Major General Smedley Butler was twice awarded the Medal of Honor, while serving for more than 30 years in the United States Marine Corps. He encapsulated the real nature of war and the military in a speech in July 1933 in which he said that war is just a racket conducted by the very few at the expense of masses and that only a small group on the inside knows what it is really a11 about. He went on: \"Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American, republics for the benefits of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 19091912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.\" 73 Nothing changes. The Project for the New American Century document says that the US must \"fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars\" as a \"core mission\". Put another way, large numbers of US troops are going to be killed and horrifically injured to give these crackpots their global control. Donald Rumsfeld told the troops involved in the Iraq slaughter: \"With the liberation of Iraq, you have transformed the country, but how you did it will transform how we defend our country in the 21st century.\" Yep, he really said, \"defend\". What he means is the policy of \"first strike defence\" (attack) will be used to invade the neo-Nazi shopping list of target countries and a lot of troops are going to die and be maimed for life. All the troops cheered when he said that and treated Rumsfeld like some sort of god. It's the same whenever President Village Idiot reads his spinner-prepared speeches to the pawns in uniform. They cheer the 'leaders' who see the troops as nothing more than cattle to be used as necessary. It is so pathetic to watch. When Bush talked to troops about their colleagues who died in Iraq, he said: \"No one who fall s will be forgotten by this grateful nation. We honor their service to America and we pray their families will receive God's comfort and God's grace.\" "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 105 Those words were delivered by a practicing Satanist who knows that the troops are only there to be used and abused as required by the agenda he serves. It's just another script for the movie. The true scale of military casualties and the nature of their injuries are suppressed for the same reason as civilian casualties are not emphasised. It's bad for the movie version of war and the reasons behind it. An American neurosurgeon, Gene Bolles, told his local newspaper in Boulder, Colorado, how the daily \"White House press briefings and fuzzy real-time TV reports fall far short of conveying the brutality of war\".74 Bolles treated military casualties at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where he has been chief of neurosurgery for 16 years. He said: \"It really is disgustingly sanitized on television ... we have had a number of really horrific injuries now from the war. They have lost arms, legs, hands; they have been burned; they have had significant brain injuries and peripheral nerve damage. These are young kids that are going to be, in some regards, changed for life. I don't feel that people reali ze that ... these are young children; 18, 19, 20 with arms and legs blown off. That is the reality.\" 75 A message to \"our troops\" British Prime Minister Tony Blair had such contempt for the families of two dead soldiers that he said at a news conference with George Bush that they had been executed by the Iraqis. This was based, as usual with Blair, on no evidence whatsoever, but it suited the moment to indicate that this had happened. The families were devastated because the military had told them the men had been killed in action and Blair was forced to make a public apology for the grief his spinning had caused. \"Support our troops\", they tell us while they \"exploit our troops\", even after they are dead. For goodness sake, get out of the forces before you are the next victim of these insane criminals. You are not liberating anyone; you are helping to complete the global fascist state that you and your children will have to live in. Many former soldiers in the US and British armies have contacted me over the years to say they now realise how they have been used and there are multimillions in the military today who have no earthly clue why they are killing people. One teenage American soldier in Iraq called \"Private AJ\" told a CNN reporter: \"I wanna get in there and get my nose dirty, I wanna take revenge for 9/11.\" The reporter pointed out there was no evidence to link the Iraqi government with September 11th Private AJ pushed his tongue out to the end of his chin and replied: \"Yeah, well that stuff's way over my head.\"76 According to a New York Times/CBS News survey, 42 per cent of the American public also believed that Sad dam Hussein was directly responsible for the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. An ABC News poll said that 55 per cent of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein directly supports al-Qaeda.77 The graphic descriptions in this chapter don't even begin to portray the true magnitude of the horror those people suffered and, for the ones who survived, continue to suffer. If people don't understand what ~war' really means behind the flag waving and victory parades they will go on supporting the sick minds that are planning to repeat the experience in country after country across the world. This is no time for mincing words and playing softly, softly. We need to look this in the face and deal with it. Those in uniform, \"our troops\", who kill people to order- \"three Iraqi's to go, please, heavy on the ammo\" - are not \"heroes\". They are paid assassins guilty of mass murder. And it's time someone said it.

Lenin A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. Mark Twain Instead of telling the truth about the consequences of war, the Pentagon spinners produce a story straight from a Hollywood movie and it's important to know their techniques because they are due to be repeated many times ip their race for global control. The star of one of their Iraqi productions was 19-year-old Private Jessica Lynch, from Palestine, West Virginia, who joined the military to have her college fees paid because she wanted to be a kindergarten teacher. The college fee sting was highlighted in an excellent BBC documentary I saw. The military are now so . desperate to recruit more troops to \"fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars as a core mission\" that they are targeting and militarising schools, especially those of the poor and minorities, and enticing them into the military with the promise of paying their college fees. Once they sign on the line, however, these kids become liable to be deployed in war zones. So it was with Jessica Lynch. Jessica found herself in Iraq working as a supply clerk with the Army's 507th Maintenance Company. She was captured when her unit made a wrong turn near Nasiriya and was ambushed. Oh, what a frenzy of Hollywood scriptwriting exploded from the Pentagon for the media to feed upon. Mitchell Catlin, an Australian correspondent, even called her \"Private Ryan\", the Demi Moore character, in one report. The mistake was understandable because that was the way she was portrayed. \"Belying her country-girl smile and petite 5-foot-5 frame, Lynch put up a Rambo-worthy fight when her unit, the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Co., came under attack, according to a new report\", screamed one paper. Lynch opened fire on the Iraqi assailants, picking them off one by one until she ran out of ammunition, reported the Washington Post. Wow. She had continued shooting - even after she was shot and stabbed and her unit members were killed all around her. \"She was fighting to the death\", a US official told the Post. \"She did not want to be taken alive.\"~ Er, so how come that after doing this to her \"assailants\", those nasty Iraqis didn't kill her when she ran out of ammunition? And how come she had no bullet or stab wounds?? Do you think US troops would have spared her in the same circumstances? The reports said that Lynch had been shot, stabbed and tortured and the public. were told what a great American little Jessie was. All this happened at a time when the authorities were being criticised for the way the war was going. However, the Iraqi doctors who treated her told a very different story about the \"gun slinging, shot and stabbed\" heroine. They said that she suffered fractures to her arms and lower limbs and a \"small skull wound\", sustained when her vehicle overturned. Her American doctors said she had fractures in her upper right arm, upper left leg, lower left leg and right ankle and foot. Her father, Greg Lynch Sr., told reporters she had no penetration wounds. \"It was a road traffic accident\", said Haitham Gizzy, a physician at the hospital at Nasiriya who treated Lynch for her injuries. \"There was not a drop of blood ... there were no bullets or shrapnel or anything like .~at.\" Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense, said: \"I'm not going to get into the specific injuries that she sustained; that's up to her and her doctors to discuss at the appropriate time.\"3 Like never. Discussing her injuries was not a problem, however, when they were telling us she was stabbed and shot. At the hospital, Dr Haitham Gizzy said, \"She was given special care, more than the Iraqi patients.\" 4 Harith al-Houssona, another d9ctor who treated Lynch, said: \"She was very frightened when she woke up and she kept saying: 'Please don't hurt me, don't touch me.' I told her that she was safe, she was in a hospital and that I was a doctor, and I never hurt a patient.\"5 He said he went outside the hospital during the bombing to get supplies of her favourite drink, orange juice, and struggled to persuade her to eat. The doctor said that Iraqi intelligence officers told the hospital that Private Lynch would soon be transferred to Baghdad, but instead he told an ambulance driver to deliver her to one of the American outposts that had already been established on the outskirts of the city. \"But when he reached their checkpoint, the Americans fired at him\", he said.6 You mean the Pentagon told us a pack of lies? Never. But Hollywood wasn't finished yet. The day after the Iraqi ambulance drive~ had tried to deliver Private Lynch to US troops only to be fired upon, she was~\"resct1ed\" from her Iraqi hospital bed, we were told, in a daring raid by a team of Navy Seals, Marine commandos, Air Force pilots and Army Rangers working with US Special Forces. It was the first time an American Prisoner of War was freed from behind enemy lines in half a century, the media trumpeted. But once again the Iraqi doctors who were there tell a rather different tale. \"They made a big show\", said Lynch's doctor, Haitham Gizzy. \"It was just a drama, a big, dramatic show.\"? Gizzy and other doctors said that there were no Iraqi soldiers or militiamen at the hospital when the US Special Operations forces arrived in their helicopters. Most of Saddam's Fedayeen Fighters and the entire Ba'ath Party leadership had fled. There was no one at the hospital when the troops arrived, he said, only doctors. Dr Hassan and others on duty that evening said they heard a \"big thumping\" near the hospital and the sound of helicopters and tanks before the soldiers began to enter the hospital. He said the doctors agreed to stay in one room and not to intervene while the soldiers broke down several doors in the hospital before locating Lynch. US soldiers videotaped the rescue, but among the many scenes not shown to the press at US Central Command in Doha, Qatar, was one of four doctors who were handcuffed and interrogated, together with two civilian patients, one of whom was immobile and connected to a drip. \"They were doctors, with stethoscopes round their necks\", Dr Harith said, \"Even in war, a doctor should not be treated like that’s Hardly the story the Pentagon wanted to pedal. \"What the Americans say is like the story of Sinbad the Sailor - it's a myth\", said Dr Harith al-Houssona. \"They said that there was no medical care in Iraq and that there was a very strong defence of this hospital, but there was no one here apart from doctors and patients, and there was nobody to fire at them.\"9 The doctor said that the troops cut open a bed specially"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 109 designed for patients with bed sores that Private Lynch had been using. \"They took samples of sand out of it\", Dr Harith said. \"It was the only bed like it that we have, the only one in the governorate.\" He said he felt sad that he would never see Jessica again, but he felt happy that she was happy and had gone back to her life. \"If I could speak to her I would say: 'Congratulations!'\" he said. Terrible people these Iraqis aren't they? Diplomatic amnesia Unfortunately, according to the US government's broadcasting arm, Fox/Fix News and others, Jessica Lynch could not remember what happened to her either when she was captured or during her time at the hospital. 11 A US official said: \"She basically has amnesia, and has mentally blocked out the horrible things we strongly believe she went through.\"12 Mmmm. Fox News reported that military psychiatrists had been talking to her. I bet they have. It must have been a strangely delayed amnesia because there was apparently no sign of it until she was in the hands of her fellow Americans at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. According to her doctor, Isadore Rosenfeld, she began to suffer from a condition called Total Global Amnesia.13 Later they said that she was not suffering from amnesia, she just couldn't remember! It was unlikely, they said, that she ever would.14 It is such a pity especially unless her memory returns she will be unable to confirm that what actually happened to her and what the Pentagon spinners told us had happened, were so different it would be akin to comparing the mind of Einstein with that of President Village Idiot. Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense, said he knew there was some \"conflicting information out there, but in due time the full story will be told, I'm sure. But not by you, mate. The military awarded Lynch the Bronze Star for meritorious combat service, a Prisoner of War medal and the Purple Heart, which is usually awarded to those wounded in combat. What's the medal they award for keeping your mouth shut? While Jessica Lynch and her rescuers were being hailed across the front pages, what of her fellow patients in that Iraqi hospital? Among them, the doctors said, were many civilians, including children, being treated in crowded wards for severed limbs and deep lacerations caused by US tank fire and bombs during the opening week of the 'war'. The doctors estimated that some 300 civilians were killed in Nasiriya and 1,000 wounded. Not counting the losses The war propaganda was not only involved in suppressing the extent of the death and injury suffered by civilians. It also worked to keep secret the number of soldiers who died. This is always the case because the lower the perceived casualties, civilian and military, the more support there will be for the next war. Dr Waiel S.H. Awwad, a Syrian war correspondent with Al Arabiya television, a part of Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, went missing in Iraq for nine days before making contact with his family. He told Asian News International how he was an \"embedded\" reporter with a US maintenance division when they were ambushed 20 kilometres north of Basra on their way to the town of Zuber. He said that he and his film crew were taken to the local headquarters of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party before a compassionate tribal leader arranged for their escape. While was there, he said, he saw 20 British troops killed in Zuber, but the authorities only announced two: “... I saw it with my own eyes, three tanks were blown [up], three vehicles were blown [up] and six prisoners of war were caught. Now who could give such facts from the ground if we were not there.\" 16 He also described how the fierce fighting the 'coalition' forces faced in the early stages was underplayed by the western media. The lies told by the American military and people like Rumsfeld with regard to the unfolding military campaign were even highlighted by some mainstream organisations like the BBC, so blatant did they become. How many troops have been killed and injured in Iraq? We certainly can't trust the authorities to tell us, but what happened in Afghanistan might give us an idea. Mohammed Daud Miraki, the author of Perpetual Death From Ameiica,t7 claims that American losses in Afghanistan alone are far higher than admitted. In March 2003, he estimated the number of dead US soldiers in Afghanistan at 1,200 and they are still being killed, a~ ,are Afghan civilians in far greater numbers as that conflict continues out of the headlines. Miraki says the US does not reveal the military losses in Afghanistan because they want to appear invincible as a military force. The US wanted to envisage their military might, he' says, as a force that even the great guerrilla fighters from Afghanistan could not muster the skills needed to hinder their impeccable military machine. But in fact, he claims, the US military had lost many soldiers by March 2003: \"According to various intelligence agencies, the US has lost over 1,200 soldiers in Afghanistan. The Russian intelligence agency put the figure of dead in the first six months of the war at 373 dead and 585 critically injured. Meanwhile, reports from other intelligence agencies including Iranian and Indian among others put the number of dead US soldiers to be over 600 in the first year, and after 18 months, they report the figure of US losses over 1,200 and 1,500 critically wounded.\" 18 At the start of the war, he wrote, \"the corpses of US soldiers were transported to Jacobabad and Dalbudin Air Bases in Pakistan and the country's Frontier Post newspaper reported how 45 US troops were killed on just one day during a land operation near Kandahar. It further reported that 26 dead commandos have been delivered to the US-leased military base near the Pakistani town of Jacobabad.\"19 The IRNA news agency reported on December 2nd 2001 that 124 dead US soldiers were transported from Pakistan to the US: \"The bodies of 124 American troops have been flown back home in a cargo plane on November 29 [2001], claimed a local daily here on Sunday ... The Pakistan Observer reported that the troops were killed during clashes with Taliban fighters when they had landed in Helmand province to help the ex-governor of Kandahar Gul Agha's Lashkar fighters against Taliban.\" 20 Miraki said he was personally aware of the US losses in Helmand in which four Apache Helicopters were also shot down. Andrei Sukhozhilov, a reporter connected with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), wrote how he had obtained information about casualties from Khanabad Air Base in southern Uzbekistan."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 110 \"Uzbek sources at Khanabad suggest that the teal figures of US casualties are far higher than the Pentagon's official totals,\"21 he said, and he went on: \"Uzbek army personnel working at the air base said scores of US casualties have been arriving there. From November 25 to December 2 [2001], an Uzbek orderly working with American medical staff said he had witnessed the arrival of four to five US helicopters carrying between them 10-15 American casualties - each day ... \" ... An Uzbek pilot spoke of the death last week of an American soldier who he had become friendly with while he was on the base. The US serviceman, he said, had died in the attempt to end the prison riot on the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif two weeks ago. 'A lot of American troops died there - it was a real battle', the pilot said.\" 22 For sure you will find the same story in Iraq and all wars orchestrated by these re-writers of reality. Embedded to deceive Illuminati control of the mainstream media ensured that pretty much the only story the public received was the official version from the Bush cartel. A study by the Washington-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting revealed that 76 per cent of the guests on network talk shows in late January and early February 2003 were current or former government officials while those speaking against the war accounted for less than one per cent.23 This is how the game works across the world. You emphasise the 'information' that supports your view and suppress that which challenges it. When you complain that only one side of the debate is being given, the media say: \"No, no, we had a guy on speaking against the war a week last Thursday.\" Very important to the required slant are the news agencies that supply 'news' to all media outlets throughout the world. These are owned, of course, by the Illuminati. For instance the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, friend of the Bushes and owner of the Washington Times, bought the newswire UPIY The connections are endless. The British media cannot, with some exceptions, be confused with real journalism, but it is still light years ahead of the American version. The bias on networks like CNN and Murdoch's Fox News are simply sickening. Robert Fisk, the outstanding journalist on the UK Independe1lt, described American journalism as increasingly \"vapid, hopeless, gutless, unchallenging\" since 9 /1J.2-' Having spent a great deal of time in the United States since the mid1990s, the only point I would question is the bit about \"since 9/11\", although it did certainly worsen after that. It was the Pentagon's idea to have 'embedded reporters', in other w~{is journalists assigned to military units during the war. Does anyone believe that this was done because the Pentagon wanted the truth to be told? Can elephants fly? They said the policy had \"worked well\" or, more accurately, worked well in managing the news. Many times I heard reporters talking about \"we\" did this or \"we are doing this\" when what they meant was the military with whom they were 'embedded'. The British ITN correspondent, Bill Neely, wearing full military combat gear and standing in a transport aircraft, told viewers: \"We have just this second crossed the border into Iraq. We'll be landing at our target in about ten minutes time.\" Our target? The idea is that you keep the journalists where you want them, feed them the story you want them to tell, and you get them so close to the troops on whom they depend to survive that they lose objectivity, That is largely what happened. NBC News correspondent David Bloom, who died of a blood clot in his lung, told his audience: \"[The soldiers] have done anything and everything that we could ask of them, and we in turn are trying to return the favor by doing anything and everything that they can ask of llS.\"26 The British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, said the imagery the embedded journalists broadcast was at least partially responsible for the public's change of mood in supporting the war.27 Almost 100 camera crews were 'embedded' with US units and when they needed even more positive images the military shot the pictures themselves and released them to the networks. They showed them like the lap dogs they are. Robert Jensen, a journalism professor at ~he University of Texas, pointed out that 'embedding' meant following the rules dictated by the military: \"Those rules said reporters could not travel independently (which meant they could not rea lly report independently), interviews had to be on the record (which meant lower-level service members were less likely to say anything critical), and officers could censor copy and temporarily restrict electronic transmissions for 'operational security' (which, in practice, could be defined as whatever field commanders want to censor.\" 27 CentCon An excellent BBC documentary in the Correspondent series highlighted the manipulation of journalists by the political and military spinners.28 It revealed how journalists assembling with British forces in Kuwait were. ordered not to report what they saw. Tom Copetas of Bloomberg Television said: \"We were not allowed to take any pictures or describe British soldiers carrying guns. I was told that there was a decision made by Downing Street that the military minders of the journalists down there were to go to any lengths not to portray the British fighting men and women as fighters. They wanted to have them there as 'nation builders'. The media monitors would get very, very upset with you very fast and threats were levelled against you that you would be disembedded.\"29 The 700 journalists at CentCom military command in Qatar were supposed to be there to get the 'big picture' from those running-the war hundreds of miles from where the bullets were flying. Instead they were played like a violin. The Correspondent programme showed a list on the wall of the British military media office at CentCom. The list was headed \"Poo Traps\" and reminded the spokesmen of the subjects to avoid in interviews with journalists: These included \"depleted uranium\", \"bombing accuracy\" and \"market bombings\". Don't talk about anything that the public have a right to know; only say what is good for the image you are trying to give them. Paul Hunter of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said: \"At the end of the day when you try to make a news story out of whatever happens here, you still have to use their message track, the one thing they are going to answer to every single question and it has gone on every single day.\" 30 Bryan Whitman, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in a briefing paper to his war spinners that \"shaping world opinion was"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 111 priority number one\".31 Despite this blatant bias, the British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, had the audacity to say that people should be sceptical about reports that do not come from official sources.32 ' •. The American networks were given the front seats in the daily CentCom 'briefings' (of lies), then came journalists from the 'allies', with the others at the back. The spinners watched from the sidelines gesturing to the spokesmen, usually the unbelievably arrogant Genera1\"Vincent Brooks. Both the Bush White House and Blair's Downing Street sent representatives to CentCom to spin on their behalf .. Bush's guy was Jim Wilkinson. He looked straight out of high school and was definitely in the Vincent Brooks class of undiluted arrogance. Wilkinson is a civilian, but insisted on prancing around CentCom throughout the war in a military uniform even though the only action he had any chance of seeing, was on the bank of TV screens. He looked like a refugee from Masturbators Anonymous. At one 'briefing' Michael Wolf of the New York Magazine asked Brooks \"the question that every reporter was asking, not just every day, but literally every minute\" .33 It was this: \"Why should we stay, what's the value to us of what we learn at this million dollar press centre?\" The question brought applause from other journalists equally sick of being manipulated. Brooks replied: \"It's your choice; we want to provide . information that's truthful from the operational headquarters that is running this war.\" A lie, Mr. Brooks, yet another one. Michael Wolf told the Correspondent documentary what happened next: \"I was approached by a guy named Wilkinson. He was a civilian, also he was wearing a uniform, which was odd and I said 'aren't you a civilian?' He said 'I'm in the Reserves'. I said, 'but you're not here in the Reserves'. He said 'right, right'. So I said so you're a kind of paramilitary. So we immediately got off to the wrong foot. He said 'this is fucking war asshole. Don't fuck around with things you don't understand'. And then finally it was 'no more questions for you, why don't you just go home?'\" 34 This is how journalists are intimidated into line. Play by our rules or you're out of the loop. The rules included pressure not to ask follow up questions that would expose the lies of the official statements by Brooks and Franks. Wilkinson ~d the BBC: \"If people didn't like the way we handled it, I would think, one part of it, just a plain case of too bad, and the second probably a little envy on the part of those who were not embedded. The real superstars of this war were the ones who were embedded.\" And that is what war is to these idiots: a Hollywood production:- The same with many of the 'superstars' of the television networks. They are more concerned with their parting and profile thC\\Il ever they are with facts. True to their Orwellian methodology the CentCom 'briefings' - the \"platform for truth\" in the words of General Tommy Franks - were used to tell a stream of lies. As I have been saying for more than a decade, it's all a mind game and no trick is missed. The backdrop for this daily deception was built at a cost to American taxpayers of $200,000 by George Allison, one of Hollywood's leading art directors.35 He designed the set for ABC's Good Morning A11Jerica and has worked with MGM and Disney. He was also fresh from his latest Michael Douglas film, It Runs in the Family. Allison, who has designed White House backdrops for President Bush and, very appropriately, worked with the illusionist David Blaine, was flown into Qatar as part of a reputed one million dollar conversion of a-storage hangar into a high-tech hub for the international media.36 As one report said of the set: \"Gone are the easel and chart, solitary television and VCR' machine with which General Norman Schwarzkopf showed fuzzy images of smart-bomb raids during the 1991 Gulf War. On a set that will become instantly recognisable, generals will present updates from two podiums at the front of a stage adorned with five 50in plasma screens and two 70in television projection screens ready to show maps, graphics and videos of action. \"Behind them will be a soft-focus elongated map of the world, as if to suggest that the world is united behind them. The set was built in Chicago and reputedly shipped over by Federal Express at a cost of $47,000 (£29,000).\" 37 While the troops go to war on their victims, their masters go to war on the public mind. We are experiencing a world described so eloquently by George Orwell. It is a world that is about image, not substance, and one in which lies are truth, war is peace and dictatorship is liberation. The Newspeak, the false enemies, the presentation of fascism as freedom, are all in Orwell's predictions for the society we are now living in. Too dangerous to investigate A number of non-embedded journalists, known as \"independents\" or \"unilaterals\" were killed or injured while covering the war independently of the military. This suited the authorities because the fewer of those types of reporters to be deployed in future conflicts the better it is for those who want to control information. \"See, it is very dangerous, so stay with us and you'll be fine if you follow the rules.\" US spokesman Jim Wilkinson said of the independent journalists: \"They were a pain in our rear a lot of times. They would turn up on the battlefield despite our warnings/' Richard Sambrook, head of BBC News, said he would have liked more non-embedded journalists, but it was just \"too dangerous\". Funny how so many non-embedded reporters died in such a short war. Ten journalists were killed including ITN's Terry Lloyd, who was shot by American troops in a vehicle clearly marked 'TV'. Ironically, he was only at that location because the military spokesmen had lied about the \"fall\" of the port town of Umm Qasr. That had been Lloyd's original destination before the false information was fed to the media. The town actually \"fell\" some 17 days after the mendacious military claimed it was taken. A US tank attacked the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, the base of the international journalists, killing two cameramen and injuring three others. There is no way this was a mistake and nor was it, as the ludicrous US military claimed, in retaliation for shots coming from the hotel. Strange how no one in a hotel full of journalists saw or heard any such shooting. Anyway, are these prats in uniform really saying that in response to small arms fire from a hotel full of people you just blast tank shells at the building? It was planned, of course it was, and the same with the missile attacks (sorry accidents) on Arab televisi9p facilities in Baghdad in which a journalist from al-Jazeera died. The journalists were killed and injured in daylight at locations known to the Pentagon to be media sites. The manipulation of information through the media is their greatest weapon for the control of the people and they don't want any maverick independents telling the truth they 'don't want the public to hear. Two 'non-embedded' journalists told Arab News of their outrageous treatment at the hands of American troopS.38 Luis Castro and Victor Silva, both reporters working for RTP Portuguese television, were held for"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 112 four days. They said they were beaten, had their equipment, vehicle and video tapes confiscated, and were then escorted out of Iraq by the 101st Airborne Division. This was despite holding the proper Unilateral Journalist accreditation issued by the Coalition Forces Central Command. Castro said: \"I have covered 10 wars in the past six years - in Angola, Afghanistan, Zaire and East Timor. I have been arrested three times in Africa, but have never been subjected to such treatment or been physically beaten before. The Americans call themselves liberators and freedom fighters, but look what they have done to us.\" 39 The pair had been to Umm Qasr and Basra and were travelling to Najaf when they were stopped by the military police. Castro said accredited identification was checked and they were given the all clear to proceed. \"Suddenly, for no reason, the situation changed\", Castro told Arab News.40 The soldiers ordered them to lie on the ground, he said, and they stepped on their hands and backs and handcuffed them. \"The soldiers used our satellite phones to call their families at home\", Castro said, \"I begged them to allow me to use my own phone to call my family, but they refused. When I protested, they pushed me to the ground and kicked me in the ribs and legs.\" Castro said he believed they were detained because they were not embedded with the US forces: \"Embedded journalists are always escorted by military minders. What they write is controlled and, through them, the military feeds its own version of the facts \\~the world. When independent journalists such as us come around, we pose a threat because they cannot control what we write.\" 41 Castro said a lieutenant in charge of the military police had told him: \"My men are like dogs, they are trained only to attack, please try to understand.\" U What chance do the children in Iraq have, eh? One soldier, who Castro asked not be identified, wrote out a note, which was shown to Arab News. It said: \"I am so sorry that you had to endure such bad conditions, but remember that I care and pray you can forgive.\" Castro said the US troops were \"totally crazy\" and his treatment was typical of the American attitude, as confirmed to him by British forces. The attitude was \"shoot first and ask questions later.\" 43 Planting the evidence Once the liberation of Iraq had left the people without water or electricity and caused tens of thousands to be killed and injured beyond words, the inevitable followed amid the devastation and chaos. Looting erupted on a massive scale, just as the Illuminati place men knew that it would. Iraqi banks were destroyed and with them went the life savings of untold numbers of Iraqis and their families. But this suited the manipulators perfectly because the more the financial system was dismantled, the easier it would be for the United States to replace it with one in their own image: Businesses and homes of the Iraqi people were looted and destroyed and the government buildings that had not been hit by US and British bombing were looted and burned together with the files of evidence exposing the links between Saddam Hussein's regime and the very forces that had now arrived to take over. But despite all of this, somehow, miraculously, files were found by journalists in these buildings to link Saddam Hussein with Osama bin Laden and to claim that the British Labour MP George Galloway took millions in back-hand payments from Saddam. Galloway just happened to be one of the most vociferous campaigners against the war. I have never met Galloway and I did not care at all for , his public support for Sad dam Hussein, but finding the evidence against him so easily in such circumstances is extremely convenient and typical of the way these guys operate. Galloway said: “... The government enlisted the Murdoch press to launch an assault on me with the journalistic equivalent of a cluster bomb. The central thrust of their attacks, that I am a traitor not fit to sit in parliament, was scattered over the Sun., .News of the World, Times and Sunday Times ... That Tony Blair has taken New Labour into the outer limits of social democratic politics, a kind of twilight zone where, in the dimness, an axis of Bush, Blair, Berlusconi, Aznar and Sharon can just be glimpsed, is pretty much a given. But his alliance with the cheap jingo press, which is spreading racist hatred in this conflict, is a key development in the war for Labour's future. This latest attack on me, for example, was fed to a willing press by Labour sources. I know this because the national newspaper editor who was first offered the 'story' (a transcript of a translated interview I gave to Abu Dhabi TV) turned it down and alerted me. It was then given to the Sun. The transcribed words were mine; the spin was all New Labour's.\" 44 The Arab satellite television company al-Jazeera also sacked its chief executive, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, after his name appeared in a document 'found' in the same way that appeared to link him with Iraqi intelligence. Al-Jazeera broadcast· horrendous pictures of Iraqi civilian casualties during the war that western stations would not air. Convenient indeed that with so many files burned and destroyed and amid such chaos, that the 'evidence' was found to incriminate people that Blair, Bush and Co wanted to destroy. The UK Guardian newspaper reported during the invasion of Afghanistan that journalists had described how they were directed by the authorities to buildings in Kabul and other locations to 'find' apparent proof of al-Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 hijackings. This included, the paper said, new box cutters still in their packaging and a freshly tom page from an American magazine detailing Florida flying schools.45 Oh, please. This is what they think about the mentality of the media and, sure enough, these 'finds' were reported as if they were genuine. Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, a former naval officer and author of The Handbook of Personal Data Protection,46 produced an excellent analysis of such 'evidence' in the Online16.urnal of April 29th 2003.47 He said that after the United States and Britain were shown to be providing bogus and plagiarized 'intelligence' documents to the UN Security Council that supposedly 'proved' Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programme, the world's media was now being fed a steady stream of captured Iraqi 'intelligence' documents from the rubble of Iraq's Mukhabarat intelligence headquarters. The problem with these documents, Madsen wrote, was that they were being provided by the US military to a few reporters working for a \"very suspect newspaper\", the London Daily Telegraph. The Sunday edition of the Telegraph on April 27th 2003 had reported how its correspondent in Baghdad, Inigo Gilmore, had been invited into the intelligence headquarters by US troops and miraculously 'found' amid the rubble a document indicating that Iraq invited Osama bin Laden to visit Iraq in March 1998. Gilmore further reported that the CIA had been through the building several times before he found the document and that the intelligence agency must have 'missed' the document in their prior searches. This was an"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 113 astounding claim, said Wayne Madsen, since the CIA must have been intimately familiar with the building from their previous intelligence links with the Mukhabarat dating from the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Also, the CIA and other intelligence agencies, including Britain's MI-6, had refuted claims of a link between Osama bin Laden and Iraq. Madsen wrote: \"Gilmore told the SSG that he noticed that on the Mukhabarat do cuments he discovered some information that was 'erased'. The erasures were apparently made with a combination of black marker ink and correction fluid. He said he scraped away at the paper with a razor and miraculously found the name bin Laden in three places. The standard procedure for redacting a classified document is to only use a black indelible marker to mask classified information. However, the proper procedure for trying to read through such markings is not to scrape away the ink as if the document were an instant lottery ticket. Toner print often bleeds .through the indelible marker ink. If one holds up such a sheet of paper at a 45-degree angle and under a bright phosphorescent light, the lettering under the ink can be 'read' because the lettering almost appears to be 'raised'. If a razor blade were used to scrape away the markings, the indelible ink -and the toner ink would be obliterated. Gilmore's claims appear to be spurious. n 48 This Iraqi-al-Qaeda 'smoking gun' was blasted across the news with the help of the CIA-Pentagon stooge, Ahmed Chalabi, head of the CIA-funded Iraqi National Congress. He told Murdoch's Fox News that the document provided enough information that Saddam Hussein was knowledgeable about the September 11th attacks on the United States. Once again the familiar names appear. Telegraph newspapers are owned by the Hollinger Corporation of Conrad Black, who has been featured in many of my books. He is an extremely active member of the Illuminati Bilderberg Group (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret for the detailed background). Hollinger owns the Jerusalem Post, a director of which is Richard Perle, the Pentagon advisor who was heavily involved in plans for the war on Iraq. The National Interest, another pro-Bush publication, is also funded by Black.49 Perle's friend, William Kristol, the chairman of the Project for the New American Century, appeared on Fox News to support th~ significance of the documents 'found' in Iraq. He said the exposure of Galloway for accepting money from Saddam Hussein was the \"tip of the iceberg\" and suggested with no evidence at all that French President Jacques Chirac, other Western politicians and Arab journalists working for such networks as AI-Jazeera, would soon be 'outed' by further Iraqi intelligence documents.50 He was right about AI-Jazeera, so how did he know that was going to happen? Fox News also said that Galloway might have given classified satellite imagery to al-Qaeda, again with no evidence presented to support the slander. This was Wayne Madsen's summary of how he believes the propaganda works: \"Phoney documents are 'dropped' into the hands of a right-wing London newspaper owned by Conrad Black. They are amplified by Black's other holdings, including the Jerusalem Post and Chicago Sun-Times. The story is then picked up by the worldwide television outlets of News Corporation, Time Warner, Disney and General Electric and echoed on the right-wing radio talk shows of Clear Channel and Viacom. Political careers are damaged or destroyed. There is no right of rebuttal for the accused. They are guilty as charged by a whipped up public that gets its information from the Orwellian telescreens of the corporate media ... The media operating in concert with political vermin to whip up popular opinion to stamp out criticism is nothing new. It was practiced by Joseph Goebbels quite effectively in Nazi Germany.\"51 The United States has been quite active in inviting Telegraph reporters into the Iraqi intelligence headquarters, Madsen pointed out, and other documents 'found' by its reporters 'revealed' that Russian intelligence had passed intercepts of Tony Blair's phone conversations to Iraqi intelligence; that German intelligence offered to assist Iraqi intelligence in the lead-up to the war;.-and that France provided Iraq with the contents of US-French diplomatic exchanges. All of these 'finds' suited the agenda of the United States and Britain. Madsen said it was amazing that the US military would be so open about letting favoured journalists walk freely about the Mukhabarat building when the Pentagon has classified tight security on the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The reason for this was obvious, he wrote. While the Mukhabarat building could be salted with phoney intelligence documents, the Oil Ministry was likely to be rife with documents showing the links between Saddam Hussein and Dick Cheney's company, Halliburton (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). Halliburton signed more than $73 million in contracts with Saddam's government when Cheney was its chief executive officer through two subsidiaries, Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll Dresser Pump Co, and this was part of the same UN oil-for-food programme involved in the allegations against George Galloway. 52 Destroying the evidence The worst of the (coordinated) looting frenzy after the American forces arrived targeted some of the most important and priceless artefacts and manuscripts anywhere in the world at the Baghdad museums containing relics and documentation of human history going back to ancient Sumer (4000 to 2000 BC). This was also part of the information and knowledge spin. I have written extensively over the years about the Illuminati bloodline connections to Sumer and Babylon and I will later put that in context with current events. Enough to say for . now that the Illuminati do not want their origins exposed and removing the evidence from public and academic view would be extremely important to them. Iraq is in the land of ancient Mesopotamia, the 'Land Between the Rivers', on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates. The Mesopotamians were the first known people to study the stars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was, say historians, the 'Cradle of Civilisation' and the location of the Biblical Garden of Eden. The country's museums, galleries and libraries were looted of their fantastic contents from these ancient societies and torched into empty shells almost overnight while the American forces did nothing. Dr Moayad Damerji, the professor of archaeology at Baghdad University and the former director general of the Iraqi Department of Antiquities, said the objects and artefacts charting human development had vanished and their loss was immeasurable. \"The Iraqi National Museum is the only museum in the world which shows all the steps in the history of mankind\", he said. \"These witnesses to our own development have gone, they are gone.\" 53 Among the most priceless treasures missing are the Vase of Uruk and the Harp of Ur, dating back to between 3000 and 2500 BC and the rule of the Sumerian kings (who connect into the Illuminati bloodlines, see The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix). The exquisite bronze"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 114 Statue of Basitki from the Akkadian kingdom is also gone, removed despite its enormous weight. The heads of stone statues were decapitated and precious inscribed tablets from the great Sumedan libraries lost - the very accounts of human history I have highlighted in my books in connection to the Illuminati bloodlines. The tablets record Sumerian history, life and belief, and almost certainly the origin of the bloodlines that rule the world~ today. It was the same story across the country. In Mosul in the north, close to where the Sumerian Tablets were unearthed, the contents of the museum disappeared. The 2,000-year-old statue of King Saqnatroq II, one of Mesopotamia's forgotten monarchs, was taken, along with irreplaceable Assyrian antiquities. Assyria .~ - followed the Sumerian civilisation. Compounding the crime is that the Baghdad museum also lost the card catalogue and comp)1ter records, making it far more difficult to track the stolen pieces. Lost, too, are the findings of generations of archaeological study because the details of all excavations in Iraq by international teams of archaeologists had to be reported to the museum. In the words of one writer: \"It threatens to turn the clock back more than 150 years to the period before scientific archaeology in Mesopotamia.\" 54 I am sure that some artefacts were removed by museum staff before the invasion, but it was also clear that the looting that followed the bombing was allowed and encouraged to happen by US authorities who wanted to destroy the Iraqi's spirit and sense of identity, as well as stealing the artefacts that are so important to them for historical and ritual reasons. People who knew what they were looking for coldly and deliberately planned much of the looting in the museums and galleries. In the ruins of the Saddam Arts Center in Baghdad, Iraqi artist Moayad al-Haidari said the looting had been well organised. It was not just theft; the aim was much bigger than that. \"This is to undermine us, our heritage,_ our identity, our pride.\" 55 Tareq Abdulrazak, a 63-year-old scientist, stood outside the charred and smouldering shell of Iraq's national library, where every book and manuscript has been destroyed. \"Here was Iraq's culture, ancient and modem, all in writing\", he said. \"The Americans watched this happen; It is not enough to destroy our buildings, our people? Now our history too?\" 56 It was one of the key aims of the 'war' to rape the museums of their priceless contents. Moayad Damerji of the Iraqi National Museum rightly said that the raid on his building was planned in advance. \"This was a program, well organized. The Americans protected the oilfields, but did nothing to protect our museum, but they are obliged to protect . these sites\", he said.57 Dr Dony George, head of the Museum of History in Baghdad, told the media how professional experts had carried out the looting. He showed journalists a handful of diamond glasscutters found on the premises and believed to have been used by \"the professional antiquity thieves\" to cut glass and 'access delicate exhibits. The thieves had equipment to lift the heaviest objects and keys to the vaults where the most valuable items were stored. Dr George said: \"I believe they were people who knew what they wanted. They had passed by the gypsum copy of the Black Obelisk. This means that they must have been specialists. They did not touch those copies.\"58 He told Britain's Channel 4 News that among the artefacts that have been stolen were the sacred vase of Warka, a 5,OOO-year-old golden vessel found at Ur, an Akkadian statue base and an Assyrian statue. This has been described as like stealing the Mona Lisa. The online version of Business Week magazine said: \"It was almost as if the perpetrators were waiting for Baghdad to fall to make their move. Gil J. Stein, a professor of archaeology at the University of Chicago, which has been conducting digs in Iraq for 80 years, believes that dealers ordered the most important pieces well in advance. '!hey were looking for very specific artefacts,' he says. 'They knew where to look.'\" 59 Experts confirmed that the looters also knew what they were looking for at the museum in Mosul and in less than 10 minutes they had taken several million dollars worth of Parthian sculpture. Where were the American troops? Shortly before the invasion, the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), a coalition of American antiquities collectors and arts lawyers, met with officials from the US Defense and State Departments to offer their assistance in preserving Iraq's archaeological collections.60 This is another pig trough operation. Within this group are dealers who wanted to see an end to the strict Iraqi laws on the ownership and export of antiquities. The group's treasurer, William Pearlstein, described the laws as 'retentionist', (i.e. greedy dealers couldn't get their hands on them) and he has said he supported a post-war government that would make it easier to have antiquities dispersed to the US. Those who care about protecting history rather than profiting from its exploitation have had deep suspicions about this group, which was only created in 2001 after the Bush administration came to illegal power. Professor Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, a Cambridge archaeologist and director of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: \"Iraqi antiquities legislation protects Iraq. The last thing one needs is some group of dealer-connected .Americans interfering. Any change to those laws would be absolutely monstrous.\" ~2 The Archaeological Institute of America agreed, saying that any weakening of Iraq's strict antiquities laws would be \"disastrous\".63 The president, Patty Gerstenblith, said: \"The [American Council for Cultural Policy] agenda is to encourage the collecting of antiquities through weakening the laws of archaeologically-rich nations and eliminate national ownership of antiquities to allow for easier export.\" 64 News of the meeting with government officials led to fears that restrictions of exporting Iraqi artefacts would be eased after the war, but what happened was even far worse than that. The heritage that belongs to all humanity is now flooding the underground markets in Illuminati hands and the ground is being prepared to allow their legal importation into the United States. Professor John Merryman of Stanford Law School, a member of the American Council for Cultural Policy, called for a \"selective international enforcement of export controls\" in US courts that would make it quite lawful to import objects systematically looted from Baghdad if a US court chooses not to recognise Iraqi legislation.6S He argues that the fact that an art object had been stolen did not, in itself, bar it from lawful importation into the United States. Among the reasons for the orchestrated looting was to destroy as much of Islamic history as possible because they know they have to dismantle the power of Islam to bring about their world state. Washington investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, was right on when he wrote: \"Bush and his advisers, previously warned that Iraq's ancient artifacts and collation of historical documents and books were in danger of being loo ted or destroyed, instead, sat back while the Baghdad and Mosul museums and Baghdad Library were ransacked and destroyed. Cult leaders have historically attempted to destroy history in order to invent their own. The Soviets tried to obliterate Russia's Orthodox traditions, taming a number of churches into warehouses and animal barns. Cambodia's Pol Pot tried to wipe out Buddhism's famed Angkor Wat shrine in an attempt to stamp out his country's Buddhist history. In March 2001, while they were"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 115 negotiating with the Bush administration on a natural gas pipeline, Afghanistan's Taliban blew up two massive 160o-year old Buddhas in Bamiyan. The Bush administration, itself run by fanatic religious cultists, barely made a fuss about the loss· of the relics. It would not be the first time the cultists within the Bush administration ignored the pillaging of history's treasures. The ransacking of Iraq's historical treasures is explainable when one considers what the blood cult Christians really think about Islam.\" 66 However, they are not \"Christians\", they are practicing Satanists (see my other books) and blood cult sums them up. Calculated catastrophe The American government was given highly detailed information about the museums, their location and contents, and the historic archaeological sites around the country. It was supplied by experts who were deeply concerned about the consequences of the US and British invasion. This included the United Nations agency, UNESCO, who provided maps specific to these locations. Professor Elizabeth C. Stone, the head of the Department of Anthropology of the New York State University at Stony Brook, who carried out research and excavation in Iraq between ~987 and 1990, told Fox News that she had written to the Pentagon and US forces asking them to take all possible measures to safeguard the treasures. She especially emphasised the Museum of History in Baghdad, the world's only treasure of invaluable antiquities dating back to the first civilisations in ancient Mesopotamia and Babylonia. Professor Stone said that she received assurance from US forces that the museum would be protected as a matter of utmost importance. But when the museum was raped and ransacked by looters, American troops were nowhere to be seen, exactly as always planned. Professor Stone rightly compared the looting of the Baghdad Museum with the burning of the Great Library at Alexandria by the (Illuminati-controlled) Roman Empire or the rape of Aztec and Inca cultures by the (Illuminati-controlled) conquistadors from Spain. Iraq, said Stone, is a country \"who's past has been decapitated\".67 Yet, as Dr Irving Finkel of the British Museum told Britain's Channel 4 News, the looting was \"entirely predictable and could easily have been stopped\".h8 British journalist Robert Fisk ran to get US marines in an attempt to save some of the centuries-old illuminated copies of the Koran, other Islamic calligraphy, documents from the Ottoman Empire and other irreplaceable texts when the looting began at the National Library. But the Marines refused to respond. Fisk wrote in the Independent newspaper: \"I gave the map location, the precise name in Arabic and English. I said the smoke could be seen from three miles away and it would take only five minutes to drive there. Half an hour later, there wasn't an American at the scene and the flames were shooting 200 feet into the air.\" 69 Nothing was done because it wasn't meant to be done. Fisk told how an \"army of thieves\" stormed the headquarters of UNICEF, which has been working to improve the lives of Iraqi children since the 1980s, \"throwing brand new photocopiers on top of each other and sending cascades of UN files on child diseases, pregnancy death rates and nutrition across the £1oors\".70 As the occupying power, wrote Fisk, America was responsible for protecting embassies and UN offices in their area of control, but he saw US troops driving past the German embassy as looters carried desks and chairs out of the front gate: \"It is a scandal, a kind of disease, a mass form of kleptomania that American troops are blithely ignoring.\" Where are the troops? Try the oil ministry. American troops allowed the mobs to loot and destroy the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Irrigation, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Information and they refused to stop the looting of Iraq's priceless historical treasures. But hundreds of soldiers were deployed to defend two ministries and they remained undamaged - the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of the Interior with its vast library of intelligence information about the country. A whole company of Marines, along with at least a half-dozen amphibious assault vehicles was assigned to guard the Ministry of Oil, while the ones responsible for trade, information, planning, health and education (all those the US wants to reform in its own image) were left to their fate. Frank Viviano put it very well in the San Francisco Chronicle long before the Iraq invasion: \"The hidden stakes in the war against terrorism can be summed up in a single word: oil. The map of terrorist sanctuaries and targets in the Middle East and Central Asia is also, to an extraordinary degree, a map of the world's principal energy sources in the 21st century ... It is inevitable that the war against terrorism will be seen by many as a war on behalf of America's Chevron, Exxon and Arco; France's TotalFinaElf; British Petroleum; Royal Dutch Shell and other multinational giants, which have hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the region.\" 71 Even more so now. American troops \"encouraged\" looting. No, really? BBC News Online reported on May 6th 2003 how General Tommy Franks was threatened with a Belgian war crimes trial alleging that US troops failed to prevent looting in Iraq and the website said it had uncovered information suggesting that his soldiers even\" egged on\" some looters. Dr Khalid Majeed described how he tried in vain to persuade American troops to protect the Nasiriya Technical Institute of higher education from a mob of looters, but they refused every time. Dr Majeed, a community health lecturer at the college, said the crowd carried knives and Kalashnikovs and they were shouting, \"We need everything from this college\". He said he went to an American checkpoint and asked for help, but they said they could not come. Eventually, he said, a colleague roused some Americans based near the local fire station. They arrived in five vehicles, but refused to stop the looters. Instead, the soldiers fired several dozen rounds at the college's south wall, Dr Majeed said. \"It was a green light to the looters. It told them, 'We are not going to do anything to stop you.'\" Within five minutes the Americans had gone and the looters had moved in. The college was soon little more"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 116 than a shell. About 100 air conditioning units and 100 computers were stolen. Rooms were torched; the science laboratories wrecked; and the main lecture hall looked \"like a hurricane has passed through it\". But witnesses said that it was not only that the American troops refused to stop the mob, the looting was openly encouraged. Rasool Abdul-Husayn, an unemployed schoolteacher, said he saw an American soldier signalling the crowd to move in, with a repeated wave of the arm. Another eyewitness, Kareem Khattar, who works in a bread shop across the road from the college, saw the same. \"I saw with my own eyes the Americans signal the people to move in and the looters started clapping. The Americans waved bye-bye and the looters were clapping. They started looting quickly and when one man came out with an air conditioner an American said to him 'Good, very good'.\" 72 In a statement to BBC News Online, CentCom, the United States Central Command in Doha\" Qatar, refused to accept responsibility for the event. Nothing new there then. More confirmation of the encouragement the military gave to looters came from Khaled Bayomi in an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Sweden's largest newspaper based in Stockholm.? Khaled Bayomi has taught and researched about Middle Eastern conflicts for ten years at the University of Lund and had travelled to Baghdad to be a 'human shield' in support of the Iraqis during the conflict. \"I happened to be right there just as the American troops encouraged people to begin the plundering\", he told the paper. He said he went to see some friends who live near a dilapidated area on the west bank of the Tigris on April 8th and the fighting was so intense he couldn't get back. In the afternoon it became quiet and four American tanks took up places on the edge of the slum area. The soldiers shot two Sudanese guards, he said, who stood at their posts outside a local administration building. Then they blasted apart the doors to the building and from the tanks came\" eager calls in Arabic\" encouraging people to come close to them: \"The entire morning, everyone who had tried to cross the road had been shot. But in the strange silence after all the shooting, people gradually became curious. After 45 minutes, the first Baghdad citizens dared to come out. Arab interpreters in the tanks told the people to go and take what they wanted in the building. The word spread quickly and the building was ransacked. I was standing only 300 yards from there when the guards were murdered. Afterwards the tank crushed the entrance to the Justice Department, which was in a neighboring building, and the plundering continued there. I stood in a large crowd and watched this together with them. They did not partake in the plundering but dared not to interfere. Many had tears of shame In their eyes. The next morning the plundering spread to the Modern Museum, which lies a quarter mile farther north. There were also two crowds there, one that plundered and one which watched with disgust.\" He was asked if he was saying that American troops instigated the looting: \"Absolutely. The lack of jubilant scenes meant that the American troops needed pictures of Iraqis who in different ways demonstrated hatred for Saddam's regime.\" But what about the people who pulled down a large statue of Saddam? he was asked. \"Did they? It was an American tank that did that, right beside the hotel where all the journalists stay. Until lunchtime on April 9, I did not see one destroyed Saddam portrait. If people had wanted to pull down statues they could have taken down some of the. small ones without any help from American tanks. If it had been a political upheaval, the people would have pulled down statues first and then plundered.\" 74 Baghdad did not fall - it was handed over Did you notice that the invasion of Afghanistan was to \"get Bin Laden\", but they didn't? And to \"get Mullah Omar\", the \"spiritual\" leader of the Taliban, but they didn't? The whole basis of the invasion of Iraq was, in effect, to \"get Saddam Hussein\", but they didn't, or least at the time I write long after the 'war'. With so many Saddam look-alikes around, how would we know even if they claimed to? I think we can see a pattern here. In the opening days of the Iraqi war the American and British forces faced some serious opposition in the southern towns and cities, as they made their way north from Kuwait. If they could face that kind of resistance in the south, it was fairly assumed that they were in for one hell of a battle to take the capital, Baghdad. But this didn't happen. Some terrible military decisions were made that sent Iraq troops into conflict with the 'coalition' in the open desert where their firepower had not an earthly chance of competing with the state of the art technology they faced. However, the most effective use of those troops would have caused the British and Americans some serious problems. Was this simply incompetence or was there a deal at the highest levels? Most bizarre was that as the Iraqi troops retreated, not a single bridge was destroyed to thwart or slow the British and American advance. Why to goodness not??? It is basic defensive warfare that you take out bridges your enemy needs to advance once it is clear you can no longer defend them. This is especially true in Iraq, which is dominated by the two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Instead, the bridges were left for the British and American troops to cross. Why? Robert Fisk in the UK Independent quoted an Iraqi brigadier-general commanding Baghdad's missile air defences as saying that entire Republican Guard regiments were withdrawn from the desert west of Baghdad on the orders Saddam's son, Qusay. These soldiers that were vital to the city's defense took off their uniforms and went home.75 \"Our troops/were fighting in the south much better than around Baghdad\", the general said. \"They had help from the people in the villages. The Americans and the British thought these people would support them, not fight against them.\" 76 He said the defense of Baghdad was planned with two belts of army defenders, one set 100 km from the city, the other at 50km. \"Our southern troops were in real fighting in the south in the first days of the war but on around 30th or 31st March, the Republican Guard were ordered out of the deserts and back into Baghdad. We don't know why. Most had specific orders to stay at home.\" 77 When the army in the south heard this news, he said, their resistance that had prevented the capture of a single city started to collapse. On April 6th the army was ordered to abandon the south of Iraq and redeploy for the defense of Baghdad."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 117 The Tehran Times also highlighted these anomalies 8 It pointed to the pause in US and British operations amid criticism that the invasion was not turning out to be as easy as it had been sold. Following this pause, the paper said, suspicions rose when US troops, which had been stopped at the Euphrates, were immediately able to advance toward into the heart of Baghdad without any further significant resistance by Iraqi forces. \"Nobody asked why Tikrit, that was once called the ideological heart of Saddam's government and the last possible trench of the Iraqi army, was never targeted by US and British bombs and missiles\", the Times pointed out. \"Or why, when the elite Iraqi forces arrived in eastern Iraq from Tikrit, the pace of the invaders advancing toward central Baghdad immediately increased.\" 79 It was also reported in early April that a plane had been authorized to leave Iraq bound for Russia, the paper said. \"Who was aboard this plane?\" The Times continued: \"All these ambiguities, the contradictory reports about Saddam's situation, and the fact that the highest-ranking Iraqi officials were all represented by a single individual - Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed ['Comical Aii'] al-Sahhaf - and the easy fall of Baghdad shows that the center of collusion had been Tikrit, where Saddam, his aides, and lieutenants from the Ba'ath Party had been waiting for al-Sahhaf to join them so that they could receive the required guarantees to leave the country in a secret compromise with coalition forces.’’ \"This possibility was confirmed by the AI-Jazeera network, which quoted a Russian intelligence official as saying that the Iraqi forces and the invaders had made a deal. The Russian official told AI-Jazeera that the Iraqi leaders had agreed to show no serious resistance against the US-British troops in return for a guarantee that Saddam and his close relatives could leave Iraq unharmed.\" 80 The paper pointed to the common theme of Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. \"Is there any sign t~~ the US is interested in finding them and wiping them out?\" 81 One should know that these two, as US henchmen over the past decade, provided enough pretexts for the White House to dominate Afghanistan, even though they are still at large, the report went on. Washington benefited from its inability to find the Taiban and al-Qaeda leaders. The same held true with Saddam. A minor dictator like Saddam was like a puppet that has danced for a lifetime to the tune of a certain major dictator like the US and could not act on his own, the paper said. Saddam did whatever the White House wanted him to do for years, said the Times. \"Therefore, the simple answer to the question 'Where is Saddam?' is nothing but 'Wherever the US desires!'\" 82 I have heard it said by 'coalition' spokesmen that the Iraqis collapsed so quickly because they were poorly trained and operating with outdated and unmaintained equipment. But how does that square, then, with Iraq being a threat to the world, including the United States on the other side of the globe? It doesn't because that was a lie. They lie to cover one question and lie again, using the opposite stance, to cover another. Doubles crossed? The obsession with selling a fable to the public means that we have to be cautious about everything we are told - everything, no matter how apparently convincing it may at first appear to be. This includes the deaths of Saddam's sons, Day and Qusay, or any other 'targets', like Saddam himself, who are announced to be dead after publication of this book. For a start they have many doubles, as widely reported now, and Saddam and his brood have been \"killed\" a number of times before it was confirmed that they had not. The sons were supposed to have been killed, together with Saddam's 14-yepr-old grandson and a \"bodyguard\", in a shoot out with American troops at a house in Mosul. The official story goes that these four guys, one a 14-year-old, held out in a fire-fight against 200 heavily armed members of the American 101st Airborne Division - supported by attack helicopters - for up to six hours until they were strafed with bullets. Yeah, that makes sense. This residence was a palatial villa belonging to the local tribal leader. Two months earlier American tanks were parked outside because the residence was requisitioned by the military.83 As one Internet report said: \"It's like if Washington has been occupied by the Russians and Bush was hiding in the Oval Office.\" 84 The military announced at first that the sons were extensively burned, possibly beyond recognition, but then came the confident confirmations that they had 'proved' their identity. Photographs of them were then released after the bodies had undergone \"facial reconstruction\" before they were shown to journalists. \"The two bodies have undergone facial reconstruction with mortician's putty to make them resemble as closely as possible the faces of the brothers when they were alive\", a military official said.s5 What if the authorities say they have confirmed a DNA match in such circumstances? With their track record, how can you believe them? 'Freedom' to agree The Illuminati manipulation of reality is not only founded on lies. They must also suppress the exposure of the lies by attacking the freedom of expression. Nothing highlights the Alice in Wonderland illusion in which we live more, than the insane belief that we live in freedom. I am always suspicious when a government has to continually tell the people how free they are. If the society was truly free it would be patently obvious, no words necessary. Instead the mantra of the 'free world' and the 'Land of the Free' are parroted constantly and there is a good reason for this. The United States is actually a brutal dictatorship. While the slaughter of the, innocent was claimed to be the 'liberation' of Iraq and the replacement of tyranny with 'freedom', back home, in the Land of the Fee and Home of the Slave, freedom of expression was virtually dead. In truth, it has long been so, but it simply became more blatant. If you spoke out against the carnage and the dismembering of children and their parents you were attacked from all angles. Natalie Maines, a singer in the country music group, the Dixie Chicks, only said that she was embarrassed that the president came from Texas and all hell ensued. They were vilified. A mob was organised to smash their CDs and much of impetus for the boycott of their records came from radio stations owned by Clear Channel Communications of Texas, which has close ties with the Bush family. So Clear Channel stations also urged people to arrange pro-war rallies.

The suit cites a state law that declares a person cannot be fired for political opinions.

Remember this is the country that claims to be 'liberating' others from tyranny. The Hollywood Reporter told how Ed Gernon, the executive producer of a mini-series about Adolf Hitler, called Hitler: The Rise of Evil, had been fired because he compared the mood of Americans to that of the Germans who helped Hitler rise to power.88 He had worked for his production company, Alliance Atlantis, for eleven years, but the paper reported that the association ended when Gernon said in an interview that the rise of Hitler \"basically boils down to an entire nation gripped by fear, who ultimately chose to give up their civil rights and plunged the whole nation into war\". Gernon added: \"I can't think of a better time to examine this history than now.\"B9 The man was right, of course, but what does that matter to the mind-fascists? This is what the Nazi Propaganda Minister, Dr Joseph Goebbels, said about suppressing dissent: \"The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic, and/or military consequence of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State.\" This is what we see today. Actor Tim Robbins and his actress partner, Susan Sarandon, were at the forefront of the anti-war protests in Hollywood, along with people like Martin Sheen and Sean Penn. Robbins talked about a \"climate of fear\" for lesser-known actors: \"I know we're lucky. We have money in the bank. We have careers that support us continuing to work. [But] if I was a mid-range or supporting actor, in this kind of environment, it would be a lot scarier for me to risk the progression of my career [by criticising the war]. I know people like that, and they've said thank you to me for saying the things that they can't.\" 90 Actually they can. It's just that they choose not to because they fear the effect on their careers. What is more important? It was not only, or indeed primarily, the rich and famous that faced a backlash for their \"unacceptable\" views. Armed police targeted public protests against the war and other demonstrators were arrested for protesting \"without a permit\". Can anyone give me an example of anyone arrested for backing the slaughter without a permit? The UK Guardian reported how a rightwing 'talk show host' on WABC called Curtis Sliwa could hardly speak for laughing when he took a call from a listener describing what he saw while carrying an American flag and yelling support for the troopS.9! The caller said he had seen a woman carrying a sign saying, \"No blood for oil\". \"She was wearing black and she was an older lady\", the caller said, \"and then our sheriff saw her and she didn't have a permit. So they put her in the back of the truck car and hauled her away.\" Oh what a hoot. Ain't it great to live in the land of freedom? The harassment of those with a different view to that of the Village Idiot are subjected to harassment and arrest, some people even ordered to leave shopping malls because they were wearing anti-war T-shirts. But it was fine to walk around with badges saying, \"Give War a Chance\" and \"First Iraq, then France\", or pathetically rename French fries \"freedom fries\" because of the French opposition to the mass murder by American and British forces. In Oakland, California, police opened fire with rubber bullets on people demonstrating against the war and some 40 were injured, one seriously. David Solnit of Direct Action to Stop the War, a network of direct action groups, said the police gave an order to disperse, which was unusual, and then they didn't give people enough time to leave. \"They fired rubber bullets, wooden bullets and beanbags right into the crowd\", he said. What kind of world is it when those opposing the slaughter of children are abused as \"disgusting\" and \"selfish\", as they are in the United States? The Minnesota governor even proposed that arrested activists should cover their own law-enforcement costs and others were concerned, wait for this, that disruptive demonstrations might hamper emergency vehicles from reaching hospitals and compromise security by distracting police forces from terrorist threats!! 92 OK guys, now don't forget, you have to breath every few seconds, come on, in, out, in, out. Write it down, it'll help you remember. A national survey of television viewers by the media-consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates said that only 16 per cent of the 2,034 people polled online felt strongly or somewhat strongly that anti-\\\\1ar coverage should be a priority in local newscasts.9:J But then, to be fair, would you believe what a public survey told you? While the most minor pro-war events and statements were widely reported, even massive anti-war protests were all, but ignored by the American propaganda networks. This is how the Illuminati agencies in politics, military and media spin human reality. They tell us what they want us to believe and suppress the people and facts that challenge the deceit. If we wish to end this Nazi control of information we must refuse to be silenced and give all the support we can to those who are prepared to speak out. Another simple rule to remember is that when a political or military spokesman is telling you what to believe, you can be sure of one thing: they are lying to you. And when mainstream journalists report the official story, they are merely repeating the lies.

Cicero Illuminati preparation for war always includes the pre-arranged plan to impose a puppet leadership after the conflict under the guise of the 'liberated' people ,\"', governing themselves (see Hamid Karsai in Afghanistan). The US and British occupation force talked of J giving the country back to Iraqis when that, in true Orwellian style, was the last thing they had in mind. War plans also include, agreeing which of the Illuminati corporations will have the contracts to 'rebuild' the target country after the same corporations have provided the weaponry and expertise to destroy it. The technique takes the Same basic form every time. The man appointed to control Iraq immediately after the war was Lieutenant General Jay Garner, a close friend of Cheney and Rumsfeld. He is a staunch and vocal supporter of the Israeli government and of Jinsa, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. Garner accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to Israel to say how much he admired the “restraint” of the Israeli army in the Palestinian occupied territories. He's ideal to run an Arab country, then. Garner was brought out of retirement in January 2003 to become director of the 'Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance for Iraq'. This was in preparation for his role in Iraq after the war that we were told was just not inevitable. Garner is president of SY Coleman, the defense firm that specialises in Patriot missiles. It was awarded a contract worth in excess of a billiot1 dollars for logistics support to US Special Forces. It is a subsidiary of L-3 Communications, a major funder of US political parties. Bush later appointed the former State Department official Paul Bremer, a close associate of Rumsfeld, to head the American civil service in Iraq with authority even over Garner.! His job was to oversee the transition to 'democracy', the Bush mobsters said. Bremer served in the Reagan-Bush years as 'ambassador-at-large' for counter terrorism before joining the notorious 'consulting firm', Kissinger Associates, (see my other books ad . infinitum). Bremer is yet another insider, of course he is, that's why he got the job. As I was completing this book, the Washington Post reported that James Baker had been asked to take overall control of Iraqi 'reconstruction'.2 This is the same James Baker that was Secretary of State to father George Bush during the 1991 Gulf conflict; the one who was heavily involved in getting the unelected boy Bush into the White House; and the major player with father George in the Illuminati subsidiary called the Carlyle Group with its connections into the Bin Laden family. President Bush also named Reuben Jeffrey III as Washington-based coordinator for Iraq reconstruction. He is a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs who had been \"coordinating the federal aid aimed to help reconstruct lower Manhattan\".3 The Pentagon lawyer, Michael Mobbs, was appointed to control eleven government ministries in Iraq. This is the man who wants Americans jailed indefinitely without charge for 'terrorist offences' and he was the defender of freedom who created the \"legal framework\" for the unlimited detention of prisoners without charge or trial at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mobbs is a close friend of Richard Perle and worked for the law firm of under secretary at the Defense Department, the neo-con Douglas Feith. Another major player in post-Saddam Iraq is George Shultz, the Secretary of State to Reagan-Bush, and advisor to boy George's presidential campaign. He is on ~ board of Bechtel, a highly significant Illuminati company that built the facilities at Guantanamo Bay and has won major contracts for the 'reconstruction' of Iraq. Shultz is chairman of the International Council of the Illuminati banking operation, J.P. Morgan Chase (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free), in which Lewis Libby, Cheney's Chief of Staff and Project for the New American Century member, has large investments. Morgan Chase lent Saddam's regime $500 million in 1983 - the year Rumsfeld met the Iraqi leader to discuss the supply of chemical and biological weapons. During that visit Rumsfeld apparently spent much of his stay negotiating with Saddam's Ba'ath Party for Shultz's Bechtel to build an oil pipeline. Shultz was a member of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and patron of the American Enterprise Institute, home to Iraqi war architects like Richard Pearle and 14 members of the Bush cabinet. William Eagleton is another long-time Bush family insider who was wheeled out to 'rebuild Iraq'. He went to Yale University, the home of the Skull and Bones Society, with father George Bush. Eagleton was the Chief of US Interests in Iraq between 1980 and 1984 - once again the time when Rumsfeld arrived to meet with Saddam over the supply of chemical and biological weapons. Robert Reilly, the former director of the government-controlled radio station, Voice of America, was appointed to create \"Radio Free Iraq\" and basically take control of the 'Iraqi' media. He could well be working closely with the former CIA chief, James Woolsey, from the Project for the New American Century, who was rumoured to be lined up for minister of 'education' in Iraq. Reilly is part of the group planning a satellite TV station on behalf of the US government to broadcast propaganda across the Middle East. He is a close friend and business associate of Ahmed Chalabi, the US choice to run the Iraqi government on their behalf. The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (Jinsa) also supports Chalabi, which is great because clearly they have the best interests of the Iraqi people at heart and have no hidden agenda, despite their connections to so many people behind the war.4 Ahmed \"watch your pockets\" Chalabi Ahmed Chalabi is supported by Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz, a leading light in Jinsa, and he's been described as \"Cheney's protégé\". This is hardly surprising given that Chalabi is connected to the Illuminati American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi comes from an aristocratic Shiite family in Iraq that was connected to King Faisal II and the Hashemite monarchy installed by the British when they drew lines in the sand to create Iraq after the First World War. The Hashemites rule Jordan and claim descent from Hashem, a forebear of the prophet Muhammad. The Clean Break document produced in 1996 for former Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called for Sad dam Hussein to be removed and replaced with Hashemite royalty, the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 121 ruling bloodline of Jordan. One of Chalabi's relatives, Fadhil Chalabi, was involved in the oil industry for more than 30 years and was Deputy Secretary of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Under Secretary of Oil at the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum. Chalabi's family fled to Hashemite-ruled Jordan when the British-imposed Iraqi 'monarchy' was overthrown in 1958 an~ became an extremely wealthy banker there before he was found guilty in his absence by a military court in 1989 of a massive fraud. He was sentenced to 22 years, but it appears that he fled in the boot (trunk) of a car with $20 million. The fraud led to the collapse of the Jordanian bank he directed, Petra Bank, and the government had-to payout $200 million to depositors who faced the loss of their savings. The INC (CIA) Chalabi founded the Iraqi National Congress (INC) in 1992 at a meeting of exiles held in Vienna, Austria, and James Woolsey, the Director of the CIA and member of the Project for the New American Century, became Chalabi's champion. He settled in London as leader of the INC that was funded by the CIA to the tune of $325,000 a month and he apparently received some $12 million from the US after the 1991 Gulf conflict. It was from Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress that much bogus \"intelligence\" originated; this was used by Bush and Blair to \"prove\" the Saddam threat. Chalabi often visited Israel when he was with the Petra Bank and became friendly with the late Albert Wohlstetter, whom he first met while a student at the University of Chicago - also attended by Zalmay Khalilzad, the Bush 'special envoy' to Afghanistan and Iraq. Wohlstetter was an inspiration for the so-called neoconservative movement in the United States and, through him; Chalabi met ... Richard Perle. Yes, the Pentagon advisor at the forefront of promoting war in Iraq. At the time Perle was Under-Secretary of Defense for international-security policy to Reagan-Bush. Today, Perle backs Chalabi to lead Iraq even though he hasn't lived there since 1958. According to a Glasgow Sunday Herald report, Perle's Jinsa associate, Deputy Defense Secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, wants other members of the Iraqi National [CIA] Congress involved in the US puppet government. These include Chalabi's nephew Salem Chalabi, Aras Habib and Dr Ali Yassin Karim, Habib's cousin, a former medic with the CIA, who was retained by the agency despite threats of dismissal after the intervention of former CIA Director, James Woolsey, the member of Jinsa and the Project for the New American Century. Chalabi's friends, Tamara Daghestani and Goran Talebani, are two others on the Wolfowitz list of US front men in the new government of 'free' Iraq.5 Chalabi was named by the Americans on a 25strong 'council' to 'advise' the US occupiers. The Iraqis have not turned out to be as stupid as the neo-cons would like to believe, however, and the campaign to stop Chalabi and the INC taking control has been mobilised to scupper the plan. Returning \"home\"? On Tuesday, April 15th 2003, Jay Garner and Zalmay Khalilzad hosted a meeting of Iraqi groups in the shadow of the 4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur. Ziggurats are the step-pyramid temples of the ancient Sumerians. Those who have read my books like The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix will understand the deep significance of this for the symbolism-obsessed Illuminati who trace their bloodlines back to Babylon and Sumer in what is now Iraq. I will add to this significance in the next chapter. Ur is also the alleged home of Abraham, the man claimed to have founded Judaism and to be an ancestor to both Jews and Arabs. What he is not, of course, is an ancestor of the Ashkenazi/Khazars. Garner, who had just turned 65, said: \"What better birthday can a man have than to begin it not only where civilization began but where a free Iraq and a democratic Iraq will begin today?\" 6 I am not sure I would put it that way myself. Zalmay Khalilzad assured the delegates that the United States had \"no interest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq\". He added: \"We want you to establish your own democratic system based on Iraqi traditions and values.\"? If he had been like that other puppet, Pinocchio, his nose would have immediately stretched from Baghdad to Washington. Mind you, it's probably that length, and more, most of the time. This meeting was supposed to be the start of the process of establishing a new Iraqi-controlled 'democratic' government, but that is simply not going to happen. The American-British (Illuminati) agenda is to control the Middle East, not give it back to the people. A front regime will be created dominated by US place men and they will continue to control the oil and the country and establish permanent military bases from which they will launch their further expansion and control of the region in consort with Israel. Any Iraqi opposition to this US dictatorship, and it has already begun, will be dismissed as agitation manipulated by Iran or \"Saddam sympathisers\" to undermine the new \"free\" Iraq, thus offering the excuse to target Iran. The CIA and British intelligence have a long record of manipulating the internal affairs of Iran and there is no way that the student protests against the Iranian government have not been \"encouraged\" by those sources to support their plans for occupation. As for Syria, I think you are going to be having some American tourists at some point and they won't be bearing gifts. Guided missiles, maybe, but not gifts! Snorting in the pig trough The Illuminati strategy in their manipulated wars is to use their armament companies to supply the weapons to destroy a country (paid for by the taxpayers and loans from Illuminati banks) and then use their construction and other companies to rebuild it (paid for by the taxpayer and loans from Illuminati banks). This tax money from the people is funnelled through many sources, including 'aid' from national governments, the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and charities funded by support from the same taxpayers. The Illuminati work to control government aid agencies; they control- indeed create many 'charities'; and, as I have detailed in previous books, they set up the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The latter is currently headed by James Wolfensohn, a close business associate of the deeply Illuminati House of Rothschild banking empire that uses Jewish people as pawns in its horrific game. What a surprise that within days of American troops entering Baghdad we had Bush calling for the ending of sanctions (imposed through the United Nations by the United States and United Kingdom) that had cost the lives of around a million Iraqi children since 1991. We're here now, we don't want sanctions once we're in control, and we've got money to make. The US government also called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 122 the reconstruction of Iraq and for countries to write off Iraqi debts. They use taxpayer's money from every source possible to fill the pockets of their corporations. US Treasury Secretary John Snow said the international institutions would have a \"vital role to play in the reconstruction of Iraq\" 8 (\"Give us your money\") and IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler told the BBC that it was time for the world's political leaders \"to stop squabbling\" and agree a political framework for Iraq in order to get on with the task of helping its people to rebuild (\"agree to what the US wants\").9 Koehler said the IMF had experience in post-conflict situations, and could help stabilise Iraq's currency, manage its external debt, and help manage its tax system (\"give us control of their financial system\"). Knock 'em down ... The 'defence' companies that made multi-multi billions supplying the weapons to devastate Iraq and its people were all Illuminati controlled. The Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon is the major route to winning such contracts. It was headed by Richard Perle, the Jinsa member of the far-right American Enterprise Institute and Project for the New American Century, until he was forced to resign over conflicts of interest. He remains on the board. Another eight of his fellow board members have connections to companies that won contracts from the Pentagon, among them Northrop Grumman, Bechtel and the Rand Corporation (former employees, Lewis Libby and Zalmay Khalilzad). Defense Policy Board members include General Jack Sheehan (connected to Bechtel), former CIA chief, James Woolsey and former Republican Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger. Northrop Grumman won contracts worth $8.5 billion in 2002. This is connected to Jinsa and the American Enterprise Institute with its 14 members of the Bush cabinet. Another beneficiary of war and the fantastic increases in military spending by Bush, is SY Coleman, headed by ... yes, yes ... Jay Gamer, the man appointed by Bush to 'lead' Iraq after the war. James Woolsey comes up often, as you will have noted, and he has been a director of DynCorp, a 'security' organisation that operates wherever the United States chooses to 'liberate'.10 DynCorp, which won a multi-million dollar contract to run the Iraqi police force, is a major donor to Bush's Republican Party and its personnel in Bosnia bought and sold girls as young as twelve and videotaped the rape of a woman. They ran a brothel and competed to see who could own the youngest girl. The company was forced to pay more than $150,000 in compensation to Kathryn Bolkovac, a former UN International Police Force monitor under contract to DynCorp, who was fired for blowing the whistle on their sex ring. Another DynCorp employee, Ben Johnston, who also exposed the scandal, was dismissed and taken into protective custody by the United States Army Criminal Investigation Unit until they could get him safely out of the country. Johnston filed a lawsuit, which said: \"In the latter part of 1999 Johnston learned that employees and supervisors from DynCorp were engaging in perverse, illegal and inhumane behaviour [and] were purchasing illegal weapons, women, forged passports and [participating in] other immoral acts. Johnston witnessed co-workers and supervisors literally buying and selling women for their own personal enjoyment and employees would brag about the various ages and talents of the individual slaves they had purchased.\" 12 Johnson also reported that drinking on the job [while repairing military aircraft!], fraud and complete incompetence were \"de rigueur\" (the rule, not the exception) at DynCorp. This is the 0peration that has been contracted to operate the Iraqi police force. DynCorp was among a few companies \"quietly invited\" to bid for the contract. A State Department official called the process\" a limited competition\" that was born of urgency. David Isenberg, a senior analyst in the Washington office of the British American Security Information Council, said: \"Since you already have a population in Iraq that is highly suspicious of us and our motives, do you really want someone with DynCorp's baggage doing this sort of work there?\"13 Actually, it's just the kind of company a Bush administration would want, I would have thought. Since 1996, DynCorp's contract for the Balkans has been expanded to include police-training and advisory missions in East Timor and Afghanistan and this has earned some $300 million.14 A group of Ecuadorean peasants filed a class action against the company alleging that herbicides spread by DynCorp in Colombia were drifting across the border, killing crops, causing illness and killing children. When we are talking about 'defense' contractors and Illuminati companies that make billions from government contracts, we must never forget the Carlyle Group, much loved by the Bin Laden family, and headed by former CIA number two, Frank Carlucci, and people like father George Bush and his Secretary of State at the time of the Gulf War, James Baker, who has been asked by boy Bush to head 'reconstruction' in Iraq. Carlyle chairman Carlucci is on the Board of Trustees of the Illuminati Rand Corporation and co-chair of the Rand Center for Middle East Public Policy Advisory Board. Carlucci and James Baker are close friends and associates of the current US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Baker was a classmate of Rumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld's roommate at Yale.15 Secretary of State Colin Powell has also described Carlucci as his \"mentor\". Carlucci admits that in February 2001 he met with Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney to talk about military policy. This was at a time when Carlyle had several defense projects worth billions of dollars under consideration. How hilarious, therefore, are the comments of Carlucci when he said: 'I've made it clear that I don't lobby the defense industry. I will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and whom they should talk to. But I do not pick up the phone and say you should fund X, Y or Z.\" 16 Then there are the claims of David Rubenstein, one of Carlyle's founders and a former aide to the Jimmy Carter administration, that was served at the CIA by Carlucci. Rubenstein said: \"Mr [father George] Bush gives us no advice on what to do with the federal government. We've gone over backwards to make sure that we do no lobbying.\" lC So funny. But even funnier was this claim by Daniel A. D' Aniello, a Carlyle managing director: \"We are greatly assisted by Baker and Bush ... [because] ... it shows that we are associated with people of the highest ethical standards. \"That's about as wrong as any sentence has ever been in all human history. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity, hit the button when he said: \"Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can possibly be. [Father] Bush is getting money from private interests that have business before the government, while his son is president. And, in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day [some day??] benefit financially from his own"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 123 administration's decisions, through his father's investments. The average American doesn't know that and, to me, that's a jaw-dropper.\" 18 ... and build 'em up As always, having fleeced the people to fund their war on Iraq, the Illuminati fleeced the people still further for 'Iraqi reconstruction'. USAID is the government agency handing out the contracts to rebuild the country after the US bombing destroyed it and the Iraqi people had no say in this at all. Only American companies connected to Bush and his masters need have any thoughts of winning a contract. There was no bidding process even among US companies; a few were \"invited to apply\". International Resources Group of Washington DC which won a $70 million contract for 'humanitarian aid', has four vice-presidents who held top posts with USAID and half the company's technical staff worked for the agency. USAID is headed by Andrew Natsios, who was chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority during the infamous and record-breaking cost overrun for a three-mile road tunnel in Boston known as the 'Big Dig'. The project was cost out at $3.5 billion in 1985, but went on to devour $23 billion. The beneficiary of this was George Shultz's Bechtel. And hey, who got a fantastic contract to reconstruct Iraq? Well, well - Bechtel. The contract is worth the best of a billion dollars and, with an estimated $100 billion to be spent, this will be just the start. George Shultz, the former Reagan-Bush Secretary of State; Casper Weinberger, the former Reagan-Bush Defense Secretary who was charged over Iran Contra drugs or arms scandal and pardoned by father Bush; and General Jack Sheehan of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, will be delighted. All are with Bechtel, a major funder of Bush's Republican Party. Shultz was boy George's presidential campaign advisor. Riley Bechtel, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Bechtel Group, is even a member of the Bush Administration with his position on the Export Council. Bechtel's contract is for infrastructure repair work on power generation facilities, electrical grids, municipal water systems, sewage systems, airport facilities, the dredging, repair and upgrading of the Umm Qasr seaport, and includes a possible role in repair and reconstruction of hospitals, schools, selected government ministry buildings, irrigation facilities and transportation links, all of which were destroyed by the bombs of the Illuminati armament companies. Bechtel has a long history of work in Iraq, not least under the rule of Rumsfeld's old friend, Saddam Hussein. Tom Hash, the President of Bechtel National, said: \"Bechtel is honored to have been selected, through a competitive process, by US AID to help bring humanitarian assistance, economic recovery and infrastructure to help the Iraqi people,\" 19 I love The Bin Bechtels Bechtel, like the B\\1sh family, has very close connections with the Bin Ladens, as revealed by the New Yorker magazine.20 it said that Osama bin Laden's extraordinarily wealthy construction empire in Saudi Arabia is a substantial investor with a $10 million stake in a private equity firm called the Fremont Group, founded by Bechtel. Both are based in San Francisco. It was a Bechtel subsidiary until 1986 and, as the Fremont website says, it still \"enjoys a close relationship with Bechtel\". It is, in fact, rather more than that. A Fremont spokesman confirmed to the New Yorker that the majority ownership is in the hands of the Bechtel family. Five of Fremont's eight directors are also directors of Bechtel and one of them, Riley Bechtel, is the chairman and chief executive officer of the Bechtel Group. George Shultz is a director both of Fremont and the Bechtel Group, where he was once president. Rick Kopf, the general counsel of the Fremont Group, which manages some eleven billion dollars in assets, confirms that the Bin Laden family invested about ten million dollars in one' of Fremont's private funds before September 11th. He said the Bin Laden family has not enlarged its stake since then, but declined to discuss further the association of the company to the Bin Ladens, He also chose not to discuss the origin or the nature of the relationship between the Bin Laden and Bechtel families, both of which have made fortunes in huge construction projects in Arab countries. Kopf said: \"Ownership is private and is not disclosed.\" 21 What a stink would ensue if the ownership of these organisations were revealed. Companies awarded massive contracts paid for by public money should not under any circumstances be allowed to keep their ownership secret. The secrecy not only makes corruption possible, it ensures it. Root of corruption Halliburton is the biggest oil services company in the world, thanks to a considerable extent to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was CEO from 1993 to 2000 when he left to join the Bush campaign. He was given a $34 million 'retirement' package when he left to nurse maid George W. Bush and remains on the payroll. Halliburton was engaged through its major subsidiary, Kellogg Brown and Root, to extinguish the oil well fires in Iraq (no doubt ignited by US Special Forces) and repair oil facilities at a reported cost of some seven billion dollars, although the contract does not specify a time or cost limit. The company was awarded the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers under federal laws that allow negotiations to be conducted in secret and without competition because of national security. But it later emerged that the contract involved rather more than just putting out oil fires. It gave Cheney's Halliburton the power to control all phases of Iraq's oil industry.:' Henry Waxman, a Democrat representative for California, said he had received a letter from the Army on May 2nd 2003 confirming that the Halliburton contract can include 'operation' of Iraqi oil fields and 'distribution' of Iraqi oil. Officials had previously said the contract dealt only with putting out oil well fires and performing emergency repairs as needed. This was the oil, you recall, that was going to be controlled by the Iraqis in the pre-war propaganda from the White House and Downing Street. Waxman said in a letter to the Army on May 6th 2003: \"These new disclosures are significant, and ty seem at odds with the [Bush] administration's repeated assurances that the Iraqi oil belongs to the Iraqi people.\" 2' Kellogg Brown and Root is nothing to do with breakfast cereal and everything to do with drug running, arms dealing and gorging on government contracts. I have highlighted the background to this company in Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster. It is a major subsidiary of Halliburton, which has a"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 124 worldwide operation involving 130 countries and is America's biggest non-union company. While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and before and afterwards), Brown and Root has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of construction contracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti after they had been devastated by US bombing and manipulation. Halliburton has worked closely with some of the most appalling terrorist dictatorships on the planet. Cheney talks of \"constructive engagement\" in which you work with such regimes and pass on American values. No need. The values of successive American and British governments are a mirror of those employed by these very terrorist dictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with \"values\" - he doesn't have any - it is about working with anyone at any price to ensure more money and power, and the advancement of the Illuminati agenda. Halliburton had connections to Permindex, a British intelligence front organisation headed by the Canadian Louis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now well documented, was a central coordinating network behind the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963. (See also And the Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background.) Permindex organised death squads in Europe, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and the United States. This is the way the Illuminati families and agents operate. They control the government decisions through the Illuminati one-party state and operate companies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, which benefit from those government decisions and policies. This is how, once Cheney took over, Halliburton was able to expand so rapidly and become the fifth largest defense contractor in the United States, so benefiting enormously from conflicts like the 'war on terrorism'. Cheney was the Defense Secretary in the Gulf conflict supposedly aimed at Sad dam Hussein in 1991. Yet he made big profits for himself and Halliburton after 1998 through deals with ... Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The London Financial Times reported that Cheney oversaw $23.8 million worth of contracts for the sale of 'oil industry' technology and services to Iraq. He used Halliburton subsidiaries in France, Italy, Germany and Austria to hide the Cheney-Halliburton connection. Among these companies were Dresser Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump.25 These contracts together were worth more then any other US company doing business with Iraq. The International Herald Tribune reported that \"Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll Dresser Pump Co .... have done work in Iraq on contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, under the United Nations:' Oil for food Program\".26 A Halliburton spokesman admitted in the Tribune article that the Dresser subsidiaries had sold oil pumping equipment to Iraq via their European agents. So get this: these contracts for Cheney's Halliburton group were helping to rebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq destroyed by the bombs dropped by United States planes commanded from the Pentagon by the then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Now they are at it again after the Bush-Cheney administration re-bombed Iraq in 2003! While making money from Iraq for Halliburton, Cheney supported sanctions against Iraq that produced around a million dead children (so what happened to \"constructive engagement\"?) Since the second Iraqi conflict his company is winning more contracts from the same US government, of which he is Vice President. You could not make this up. Halliburton has also struck deals in Iran and Libya, even though they were on the State Department's list of terrorist states. The Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root was fined $3.8 million for violation of US sanctions against Libya. In 2002, they also agreed to pay the US government $2 million to settle claims that while Cheney was in charge it defrauded the military. This involved a lawsuit alleging the company made false claims and statements in 224 delivery orders between April 19.94 and September 1998. This pay-off to avoid the courts has happened on six other: occasions. Cheney has been the biggest shareholder in Halliburton with a stake of some'$45.5 million and the company's board includes Lawrence Eagleburger, who held State Department posts under President Father George and is an executive of the infamous Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Paul Bremer, who was appointed to head the American civil service in Iraq, is a former executive with Kissinger Associates. Paying for the privilege Halliburton and Brown and Root have long used political patronage and funding to expand business and profits. Brown and Root's ticket to the top came through its political contributions to President Lyndon Johnson from the time he ran for Senate in 1948. The Austin Chronicle once called him \"the candidate from Brown and Root\".2~ Thanks to Johnson they made billions on government contracts, including those relating to the Vietnam War after Johnson reversed the policies of the assassinated JFK and plunged America deeper into the conflict. During Vietnam, Johnson gave his personal funders contracts for airports, pipelines and military bases.28 According to biographer Ronnie Dugger, author of The Politician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,29 much of the money he was paid by Brown and Root came in cash. \"It was a totally corrupt relationship and it benefited both of them enormously\", says Dugger, \"Brown and Root got rich, and Johnson got power and riches.\" Using the same tactics, the contracts have flowed from government ever since. Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles police narcotics officer, wrote in a study of Brown and Root: \"From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya. to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to Laos, to Vietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to Libya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown & Root's traditional operations have expanded from heavy construction to include the provision of logistical support for the U.S. military. Now, instead of U.S. Army quartermaster~-tf1e world is likely to see Brown & Root warehouses storing and managing everything from uniforms to rations to vehicles.\" 30 In Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster, I expose the appalling background to Halliburton/Brown and Root. This includes the drug and arms running activities that have been highlighted from personal experience by Mike Ruppert (see his website at http://www.fromthewildemess.com). The Illuminati control the global drug running network and it was no surprise when the Pakistan Interior Minister, Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, said the poppy cultivation for the production of opium and heroin has risen to record levels in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, but US-led coalition forces were doing nothing to address the problem. He said: \"Two-thirds of that is on our western borders. We have asked the Americans, we told the commanders of allied forces - what hampers you, or what restricts you from totally neutralising this cultivated land? They say that is not within our mandate. Now, when we are told such things, it certainly is something which is hard to digest.\" 31 "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 125 Not so hard to understand, though, when you realise that the force behind the invasion of Afghanistan controls the global drugs market (see Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster and The Biggest Secret for the drug connections to the Bush family and the present US administration). Increasing the Afghanistan opium supply from the world's biggest source was all part of the invasion plan. More snort, snorts A company that works closely with Halliburton is the Parsons Corporation. It has donated $152,000 to Bush's Republican Party and has helped to 'reconstruct' Kosovo and Bosnia after American and British bombers went to work. Elaine Chao, the US Labour Secretary, was on the Parsons board before joining the Bush government. Parsons is in line for 'reconstruction' contracts in Iraq worth $900 million. Lucent Technologies, Qualcomm and others have been named in relation to the one billion dollars on offer to replace Iraq's telecommunications and that will please the Pentagon under-secretary, Douglas J. Feith (member of Jinsa who selects the members of the Defense Policy Board) and Cheney's Chief of Staff, Lewis Libby (Project for the New American Century). Feith has around half a million dollars invested in Lucent and Libby is a shareholder at Qualcomm. Libby also has shares in another company, Raytheon Corp, which has apparently been selected with Kellogg Brown and Root to destroy 'weapons of mass destruction'. Not much money in that though, eh? One of the first USAID contracts went to the union breaking Stevedore Services of America to 'manage' the Umm Qasr Port on Iraq's Gulf Coast, which was taken early in the conflict. Its president, John Hemingway, makes contributions to the Republican Party and the contract angered the British government and army. (You don't count guys, you're just there to send in the British troop fodder, so get used to it). Robin Cook, which signed from the Blair government in protest at the war, commented: \"The dispute over the management of the port of Umm Qasr is a good example. British officers sensibly took the view that the best and the most popular solution would be to find local Iraqis who knew how to do it. Instead the US has appointed an American company to take over the Iraqi asset. And guess what? Stevedore Services of America who got the contract have a chairman known for his donations to the Republican Party.\" 33 While all this was going on in Iraq, American companies were being fined (very quietly and virtually unreported in the media) under the Trading with the Enemy Act for doing business with 'terrorist regimes' named by the US government, including Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Sudan. Fifty-seven companies were involved and among them were Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco, with connections to the Bushes, Cheney and Condoleezza Rice. ChevronTexaco was charged for trading with Iraq. The biggest fine, a quarter of a million dollars, was imposed upon Zim American Israeli Shipping Co. of Norfolk, Virginia., which is half owned by the Israeli government. This company relocated from the 16th floor of the World Trade Center just a week before the September 11th attack. What liberation really means May 1st is a major day in the Illuminati Satanic ritual calendar in the period called Beltane. It was no coincidence that this was the day when George Bush declared 'victory' in Iraq. The Vietnam draft-dodger appeared on the aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, off the California coast to use returning troops as his stage prop. Tony Blair, ritually elected on May 1st 1997, also spoke of 'victory'. But what was this 'victory'? And 'victory' for whom? With the main conflict completed, this is what the people, who had been 'liberated', were left with: A brutal dictator was no longer in charge in Iraq, but a new one was, thinly disguised as a 'liberator'. Tens of thousands of civilian men, women and children were dead or maimed, along with tens of thousands of conscripts who had no wish to fight anyone. Thousands of children were now orphans. One little boy, Ali, had no parents, no arms and a horrendously burned body because of CS and British bombing and there were countless others who ha\\'e suffered similar horrors. US and British troops were killed and injured taking over a country for the Illuminati, who see them as \"dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy\". Soldiers in Iraq have died regularly ever since. Electricity and water supplies were cut off across the country, including those to hospitals deluged with casualties. Most hospitals were closed because of the bombing and the danger for staff of travelling to work, and this when untold thousands needed urgent treatment. Iraq's financial system was destroyed by the bombing and the orchestrated looting of banks, thus opening the way for a new US-imposed system. Iraqis lost their life sayings, jobs and income. Others who spent their lives building their businesses and homes have had them looted in the chaos that has followed 'liberation'. Depleted uranium and cluster bombs have been left by the US and British air forces and will cause untold suffering in explosions, leukaemia and deformed births. Museums containing some of the world's most priceless historical artefacts have been looted and burned and the most important items will end up in the United States, some to be used in the human sacrifice rituals of these sick people who trace their bloodlines back to the land of Sumer and Babylon that is now Iraq. The United States oil cartel, through Cheney's Halliburton, has control of the Iraqi oil, the second biggest reserves in the world. The US multinationals have control of Iraqi government administration, industry and commerce. The US has the foothold in the Gulf region that was planned in the Project for the New American Century document for the Bush gang before he was illegally placed in power. Israel is also delighted with the outcome. The United States are planning to choose a puppet to take Over the 'civilian government' and to maintain permanent military bases in Iraq to ensure that everything is run their way and the Illuminati that controls the American and British governments plan to use those countries for further mass murder in the Middle East and further a field. So what was this victory in Iraq? It was victory for the Illuminati agenda for a global fascist dictatorship; victory for the real perpetrators of 9/11. Baiting for God No exposure of the Illuminati techniques of mass manipulation would be complete without a mention of religion. I have written at length in other books about the way the Illuminati created the religions and have played them off against each other ever since to foster their policy of divide and rule and maintain the human"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 126 mind in a state of denial and limitation. What is happening now with the focus on Islam is but the latest example. As I write, Franklin Graham, son of Christian fundamentalist, Billy Graham, is in the wings waiting to be 'called' by 'Gaaad'. Boy Graham wants to 'save' the Iraqis from their Islamic faith, which he calls \"evil and wicked ... \"34 With Graham rubbing bibles with people like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson (see Children of the Matrix), I bow to his superior talent for bigotry on such matters. Graham is a close friend of Bush and family and delivered the invocation at the idiot president's illegal inauguration in 2001. Journalist Steven Waldman wrote: \"I am not sure any of this means that America's foreign policy objectives are served by having a Bush-loving, Islam-bashing, Muslim-converting Christian icon on the ground in Iraq tending to the bodies and souls of the grateful but deeply suspicious Muslim population. Or, to put it more simply, the idea is absolutely loopy.\" 3; Well, unless you see the agenda it is. Boy Graham was asked to deliver a Good Friday sermon at the Pentagon to the outrage of the Defense Department's Muslim employees and under Bush's 'Faith Based Initiative', Graham's 'Samaritan's Purse' organisation stands to receive US government (taxpayer) funds for its extreme form of Christian fundamentalism in Iraq. All the corruption and manipulation revealed in the last few chapters are connected to the same end: destroying Islam, a unifying force for the Arab people they wish to conquer; a~ imposing their permanent control of government, military, banking, business, media and 'education' in the target countries. This is the blueprint to be used with all the nations that the Illuminati - via the British and American governments - intend to absorb into their global empire. The Christian belief-system is at the-heart of so much manipulation of the American collective mind. After appearing on a North American radio show to expose the agenda and quoting much of the information in these last few, chapters, I received an email from a listener. She said I was suffering from \"extreme paranoia\". \"Instead of focussing on one malevolent group such as the Illuminati how about studying the Scriptures, which teach about the end times, and all that it will mean for us; and getting your heart right with God by accepting his gift of salvation?\" She said she was angry that I could suggest that9/11 was staged or allowed to occur: \"I trust the present Administration - more than any other Administration that I have seen in the US. He is a believer like I am, in Christ; and so are many others in top positions there. Because I know'!' can be trusted, I know that when they say they aren't lying to us - then we know that we can believe them. I am offended by anyone who would attack the characters of Sec. Rumsfeld. Pres. Bush, Vice Cheney. and others like them, on the White House and State Dept. Staff.\" Born again Satanists There are tens of millions like her in the United States unknowingly supporting a fascist dictatorship and believing that the child abusers, rapists, mass murderers and Satanic practitioners leading them to the cliff edge are \"Christian\". How do they know? Only because that is what they are told. The alleged \"Christianity\" of these people is merely voiced to fool the voters because they know that anyone who does not pledge allegiance to that faith will have no chance of becoming president. I mean Clinton said it for goodness sake. And Blair also claims to be a dedicated Christian believer. Tom Foley, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, said: \"We are not a nation that prays in its closet. We expect the president to be our principal preacher, to express constantly the idea that God has showered us with special blessings, and that we, therefore, have a special identity, a special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part just by being who we are, but which also requires us to encourage others to be just like us.\" 36 What chilling words they are. Here we have yet another nation believing they are the chosen people of 'God', with not only the right, but the \"mission\", to impose, sorry \"encourage\", others to be like them. The massive irony is, however, that America is not governed by Christians at all. In a powerful article headed \"Bush's 'Christian' Blood Cult\", the Washington investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, rightly points out: \", .. Bush and fellow self-anointed neo-Christians like House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, John Ashcroft, and sports arena Book of Revelations carnival hawker Franklin Graham appear to wallow in a 'Christian' blood lust cult when it comes to practicing the teachings of the founder of Christianity.\" 37 As we shall see, however, when you realise what the \"Christian\" religion is really based upon, the term \"blood lust cult\" becomes perfectly appropriate. While he was Governor of Texas, Bush sanctioned a record 152 executions, 40 of them in the year 2000 as he ran for election as president. One of the Texas execution 'team', Fred Allen, quit in disgust at the number of lethal injections he had to prepare, according to the Washington Post.38 Madsen says that he was told by a former Texas Department of Public Safety officer, a devout Roman Catholic, that Bush was more than happy to ignore DNA data and documented cases of misconduct by the prosecution, to send innocent people to the lethal injection chamber at Huntsville. The officer said the number of executed mentally retarded, African Americans, and those who committed capital crimes as minors, was proof that Bush was insensitive and a \"phoney Christian\". Of course he is; they all are. Among Bush's victims as governor was 'fellow' born-again Christian, Karla Faye Tucker, who led a prison ministry after being convicted of murder. When she asked for clemency, Bush rejected appeals from the Pope and the World Council of Churches and just mocked her. In an interview with Talk magazine, Bush imitated Tucker's appeal for him to spare her life - pursing his lips, squinting his eyes, and in a squeaky voice, saying, \"Please don't kill me\". Former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, an evangelical Christian, said: \"I think it is nothing short of unbelievable that the governor of a major state running for president thought it was acceptable to mock a woman he decided to put to death,\" 3Y Unless you really know the Bush family, that is. I will explain in the next few chapters why these people can act so callously with no regard for life or suffering. They do not feel emotion the way most of the population does and there are reasons for this. They are involved in a blood cult long exposed in my other books, but it certainly isn't \"Christian\" in the way that word is perceived. The term 'God' is just another tool used by Bush speechwriters to scam the American mind. Wayne Madsen writes: \"Bush has not once prayed for the innocent civilians who died as a result of the US attack on Iraq. He constantly 'embeds' himself with the military at Goebbels-like speech fests and makes constant references to"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 127 God when he refers to America's 'victory' in Iraq, as if God endorses his sordid killing spree. He makes no mention of the children, women, and old men killed by America's 'precision-guided' missiles and bombs and trigger-happy US troops. In fact, Bush revels in indiscriminate blood letting. Since he never experienced such killing in Southeast Asia, when he was AWOL from his Texas Air National Guard unit, Bush just does not seem to understand the horror of a parent watching one's children having their heads and limbs blown off in a sudden blast of shrapnel or children witnessing their parents burning to death with their own body fat nurturing the flames.\" 40 This is a man who targeted the Christian vote in a presidential 'debate' by saying Jesus was his favourite philosopher. Or maybe that's the only one he's ever heard of. The real George Bush, the 'Christian believer' in whom so many put their faith, was eloquently described by Madsen: \"Bush, who fancies himself a 'born-again' Christian, is actually a foul-mouthed and erratic alcoholic. For example, the 'pretzel' incident had nothing to do with a pretzel. While watching a football game at the White House, the 'leader of the free world' got so drunk he fell right on his face and blamed it on his inability to remember his mother's missive about chewing all one's food before swallowing. Such alibis and ruses are the trademarks of drunks. During the presidential campaign Bush called a New York Times reporter a 'major league asshole.' In 1986, a clearly drunk and disorderly Bush told The Wall Street Journal's AI Hunt, 'You fucking son of a bitch ... I saw what you wrote. We're not going to forget this'. The rich frat boy was irate about an article Hunt wrote about Bush's father. Time magazine is reporting that during a March 2002 briefing for three senators by Condoleezza Rice, Bush poked his head into a White House meeting room and bellowed, 'Fuck Saddam. We're taking him out!''' 41 Christianity is massively manipulated by the Illuminati. In fact, as I have indicated, Christianity is one of the greatest forces of control in the United States and that makes wars against Muslims, Asians and Chinese so much easier to sell. Gentle Jesus wants us to kill those who do not believe in him as their saviour and he wants to subsidise Jewish settlements on Palestinian land in Israel, as many fundamentalist congregations do. Typical of the hypocrisy that equates\" gentle Jesus\" with mass murder, came from Captain Jimmy Nichols, the battalion chaplain for 2-504 Parachute Infantry Regiment, who held a church service for US infantrymen in Afghanistan in which the key hymn was \"Keep on the Firing Line\". Dressed in full combat gear, he launched into a sermon about Samson who, he said, was the \"original tough guy, long before Rambo\", whose \"super-strength\" was a gift from God. He added that God had given them gifts also. \"You see, the reason that Samson is such a good story for folks like you and me in the military is that Samson is you, Samson is me.\" 42 What a prat. As someone once said, the Christian world would be so much nicer if only more Christians were like their Christ. Reich thinking Pro-Bush, pro-war, America is a deeply sick society. It is mentally and emotionally disturbed and mind-controlled to zombie proportions. How can it give freedom to anyone when it does not have freedom itself? Not even freedom of thought. A Knight Ridder poll in May 2003 claimed that a third of the American public believes US forces found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 22 per cent thinks the Iraqis used chemical or biological weapons in the war. Before the conflict, half of those polled said Iraqis were among the 19 hijackers on September 11th when, in fact, there were none in the FBI's bogus list. \"It's a striking finding\", said Steve Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of''''' Maryland, which conducted the poll. \"Given the intensive news coverage and high levels of public attention\", he said, \"this level of misinformation suggests some Americans may be avoiding having an experience of cognitive dissonance.\" 43._ That is a long-winded way of saying their beliefs conflict with the facts. They are mind controlled, reality controlled, by the indoctrination of beliefs, political and religious. I will go into this at length later because it is tire bottom line of human control. Wilson Bryan Key says in his book, The Age of Manipulation: \"Humans are uniquely dangerous because their conceptual blindness does not allow them to know they are dangerous.\" 44 Today, that applies to America more than anywhere on earth. Every day it is more obvious that the 'F' word is precisely what we are facing: fascism. After the horrors of the mid-20th century they said it could never happen again. Well it is happening again and, below the surface, it never went away. We are, as I have been predicting for more than a decade, fast heading for a global version of Nazi Germany. Barry Steinhardt, director of the American civil liberties union programme on technology and liberty, told the New York Times that the authorities are demanding records from Internet providers and libraries about what books people are taking out and the websites they're 100king.at.45 Under a planned bill called the Domestic Security Enhancement Act, the government could withhold the identity of anyone detained in connection with a 'terror investigation' and their names would be exempt from the Freedom of Information act, according to the Washington-based advocacy group, the Centre for Public Integrity}6 I have detailed in books like Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster the staggering extent to which our freedoms have already been destroyed since September 11 th 2001 and most people have no idea how far this has gone. Fascists do not have to wear a swastika on their arm. Who said this? \"An evil exists that threatens every man, woman, and child of this great nation. We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect our homeland.\" Who was it? Bush? Cheney? Rumsfeld? Powell? Blair? Blunkett? Yes, they have all expressed those sentiments since September 11th to justify the militarisation of law enforcement and destruction of freedom under the guise of 'Homeland Security'. But they did not speak those words. They came from the mouth of Adolf Hitler when he was announcing the creation of the Gestapo in Nazi Germany. American society today is being manipulated into the same mind-controlled state to which much of the German population succumbed in the 1930s and 1940s. \"I love Adolf, he's just the kind of leader Germany needs\" - \"I love George, he's just the kind of leader America needs.\" There is no difference between them in method or outcome. But, as with Bush supporters in America today, the Hitler-supporting Germans could not see through the smokescreens and the Orwellian Newspeak until it was too late to turn the tide of hatred and control. We are such a long way down the Orwellian road, but although the majority still can't see it, the fires of freedom are stirring in tile hearts of those with minds to call their own. Note that I said \"pro-Bush, pro-war\" America was a deeply sick society. I know from personal experience that vast millions of Americans are not mentally ~d emotionally"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 128 challenged like their president. They are seeing the game and they are appalled by it, as gathering billions are in Britain and around the world. America is not Bush and Britain is not Blair. Beyond tile mesmerised and tile mind-dead! !hat buy the Bush- Blair lies and delusion, many are waking up and seeking to challenge the Gestapo in Washington and London as their most basic freedoms are removed by the week in the name of a war on terrorism that is nothing more than a manufactured excuse -like 9/11 - to follow a long-planned agenda for global dictatorship. There you have just some of the background to the global conspiracy and how it has played out since September 11th. I have concentrated on the war in Iraq because of its relevance to current events and because it is a wonderful example of the Illuminati methodology used to manipulate the people every day. There is the secret agenda and there is the movie to hide that agenda from the people. The agenda is the creation of a global fascist state of centralised dictatorship and constant control and surveillance, with a world government, central bank, currency and army dictating to a microchipped population. The movie is that Christian-believers in the White House and Downing Street are fighting terrorism, protecting the people, and freeing the world from tyranny. I have been bashing out this message at every opportunity for well over a decade, often in the face of enormous ridicule and condemnation. I have been called a \"nutter\", a ';racist\", a \"hatemonger\", and been laughed at in the street all over Britain. But with people looking fascism in the face and seeing that what was predicted is now coming to pass, far fewer are finding it funny. What I have described in these last few chapters is the five-sense level of the conspiracy, that which directly effects our daily experience in this 'world'. As I walked my journey of discovery, however, I was to see that the story is much bigger than that - vastly so. Bush, Blair and all these other 'human' leaders and power brokers are themselves pawns in a much greater game. They are the pieces, not the puzzle. SOURCES 1 BBG News Online.

Er, yeah History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon. Napoleon Bonaparte By the mid-1990s I had begun to piece together the structure through which the Illuminati could manipulate the masses while maintaining the secrecy essential to their agenda's success. It was clear to me by then that (a) this conspiracy had to go back a long way and (b) there obviously had to be some unifying force that was coordinating events through the generations. Quite understandably, people ask why, if the conspiracy goes back at least thousands of years, Illuminati operatives would have given their lives throughout that period to achieving global control when they knew they would not be around to see it? There is an answer to that question and I began to appreciate what it was when an apparently bizarre new theme entered my research: reptilian shapeshifters. Yes, I know, but stay with me a while. I began to follow the conspiracy 'back' into history searching for the origin of the Illuminati and their agenda of global conquest. I got comfortably back to the time of the Crusades in the thirteenth century in the so-called 'Holy Land' and the elite secret societies established in that period like the Knights Templar, Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, which now has two main arms known as the Knights of Malta (official head the Pope) and the Knights or Order of St John of Jerusalem (official head the British monarch). These secret societies are still Illuminati operations with some of the world's most powerful people among their initiates, including Queen Elizabeth II. I continued to go back from the Crusade era and I was thousands of years BC before I found anything like a starting point to the Illuminati agenda. It was not, in fact, the origin, which lies way back with the advanced civilisations known as Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu, and even earlier. These lands were believed to be located in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and were destroyed by enormous cataclysmic events that started perhaps some 11,000 years ago (see The Biggest Secret). But there is a later point where you can pick up the story, around 4,000 to 2,000 BC in Sumer, now Iraq, in the \"Land Between the Rivers\" called Mesopotamia. Sumer or later Sumer is known as the 'cradle of civilisation' to conventional history because it was so advanced. The Sumerians were the first known people to study the stars, develop the written word and enforce a legal code. It was the artefacts, texts and records from Sumer and its successors in that land, like the Assyrians and Babylonians, that were so professionally and systematically looted or burned after the Fourth Reich's invasion of Iraq in 2003. The British writer and anthropologist, L.A. Waddell, produced a series of brilliant books about Sumer and other ancient cultures. He was an expert in Sumerian and Egyptian hieroglyphic and the Sanskrit language of the Indus Valley in India. This was a rare gift indeed and it allowed him to travel these regions, reading the ancient accounts on the temple and monuments, and see that Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley were parts of one empire based on Sumer (Figure 18). See The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix for more of this background and Waddell's work is documented in detail in his book, Egyptian Civilisation, Its Sumerian Origin And Real Chronology. Waddell also shows in his work, Makers of Civilisation/ that the Sumer-centred Empire extended not only to the Indus Valley in the east, but to the British Isles in the west and encompassed much in between. It was larger than that of Alexander the Great or the Romans. The Sumer Empire included a large part of the world and it is from this same information source that all of the major religions have emerged. From where did Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and others like Zoroasterism, etc., emerge? The Middle and "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 132 Near East and the vast region ruled at one time from Sumer; and it continued to be dominated by that knowledge base and belief system in the thousands of years that followed Sumer's demise. The story of King Sargon, the Akkadian king who conquered Sumer, is an excellent example. They said that his mother bore him in secret and floated him in a basket on the River Euphrates, where he was found and brought up by another family.3 The Israelite/Hebrews, or rather their manipulating priests, the Levites, later took this ancient story from the Mesopotamian accounts and used it in the story of Moses. The Old Testament is founded on Sumerian and Egyptian accounts, edited and rewritten as required, to create a manufactured history and religion called Judaism. The New Testament is based on symbolic stories repeated over and over in the thousands of years before it was compiled and these relate to a large extent to the Sumerian and Egyptian religion of Sun worship and Mystery school rituals. The New Testament texts, in turn, created a manufactured religion and history called Christianity. King Sargon was a major Sun worshipper and these rulers of the Sumer Empire were given the title, \"Son of the Sun\".4 To the Sumerians, the Sun was a symbol of 'God' and from this came the title Son of the Sun or Son of God. Sumerian emperors were also often known as \"The One Lord\". You find the same story in Egypt because the two cultures were so connected. Waddell discovered from the time lines and the descriptions of the leaders and their genealogy that the rulers of these three great cultures, Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley were, at least in one period, the same people under different names. It is the different names that have obscured the truth to a large extent. Historians have taken different names to mean different people, but this is not correct. The endless 'gods' in the various cultures also turn out to be different names for the same deities. Once you understand this, wading into the past becomes a lot less complicated. The advantage that Waddell had over conventional Egyptologists and 'historians' (apart from an open mind) was that he could read Sumerian and could decipher inscriptions in Egypt, which they could not understand. He could see that early Egyptian hieroglyphics were those used by their ruling culture in Sumer. It was only later that they evolved into an Egyptian system developed more locally. It is the latter that Egyptologists have been decoding. The earlier Sumerian hieroglyphics in Egypt flummoxed them, but not Waddell. Here is one example of how he proved his point. The Sumerians recorded that King \"basket on the river\" Sargon had a son called Manis, who later became emperor. At the same time, Waddell shows, the son of the kiI1gin the Indus Valley was known as Manja, and in Egypt he was called Manj (abbreviated to Man) - the guy known to the Greeks as Menes and to English Egyptologists as Mena.5 So we have the ruler's son, and later ruler, in Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley in the same period called variously, Manis, Manj and Manja. The reason becomes obvious - it was the same bloke. Even the title given to him was the same or very similar in all three places. In Egypt he was known as Manj-the-Warrior; in Sumer he was Manis-the-Warrior; and in the Indus Valley he was called Manja-the-Shooter.6 His father, Sargon the Great, is a Semitic name for the Sumerian-Mesopotamian emperor, King Gin, Gani, or Guni. The Sumer Empire was so large that in the later Babylonian texts he is called the \"King of the Four Quarters of the World\".

The raised capstone represents the unseen force that manipulates the pyramid Babylonian texts he is called the \"King of the Four Quarters of the World\". The Incas of South America also used this term \"Four Quarters\". In the ancient Indian epics, Sargon's son, Manja, was called \"The Royal Eye of Gopta and of the Four Ends of the Earth\" when he became emperor.7 In Egypt, India (at the Taj Mahal, for example) and the Christian world you also find the four pillar symbolism representing the pillars that hold up the heavens. In the Indus Valley clay seal records, Sargon and Manja or Menes also called themselves and their dynasty Gut or Got ('Goth' to the Romans) and used the titles Bar or Par which means 'pharaoh', according to Waddell.8 Gut or Got became 'God', a term used by the later Goths. All non-Latin languages in Europe are derived from the Gothic, including English, and the ancient Swedish language is still called \"Sueo-Gothic\".9 The former name for Denmark was \"Goth-land\" and a derivative was Jut-land.10 Gothic architecture so beloved of the bloodlines and the Illuminati, comes from the same source and so does the horned headgear worn by the kings and leaders of European tribes and kingdoms. But these symbols, styles and customs go back much further to the technologically advanced global civilisations known as Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu. The Illuminati Knights Templar used the 'Gothic' style of architecture when they built the great 'Christian' cathedrals of Europe, which are full of Pagan symbolism and located on ancient Pagan sacred sites. The symbolism of the 'Eye of Gopta' may relate to the widely used Illuminati symbol, the all-seeing eye or Eye of Horus, which you will find at the top of the pyramid on the US dollar bill and on the .reverse of the Great Seal of the United States (Figure 19). It certainly represents the6Ul1 God. The symbols used by the ancient Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptian dynasties are still used by the Illuminati today because they are the same bloodlines and are working with the same knowledge, which has been hidden away since ancient times within the Mystery school and secret society networks. Origins of the bloodline I knew by the time I was researching the Sumer period that the Illuminati was obsessed with genetics and obsessively interbred for some reason. The same bloodlines have been installed in the positions of political and economic power for thousands of years. First they were the royalty and nobility of the ancients and now they are the leading politicians, bankers, businessmen and media owners of modern society. So what was it with this bloodline stuff? The Sumerian accounts of their history were to offer an answer. Sumer began at the peak of its powers and then gradually declined, indicating a great input of knowledge at the start that was later lost. The Sumerians had their own explanations for the origin of this knowledge and their records were rediscovered thousands of years later. In the mid-1800s and later, tens of thousands of clay tablets were found in the former land of Sumer on the site of the Assyrian capital city of Nineveh near what is today Mosul in Iraq. An Englishman, Sir Austen Henry Layard, made this first discovery and others have followed. The astonishing accounts the tablets contain originated in Sumer and not with the later Assyrian culture. Therefore, I refer to them as the Sumerian Tablets. It is estimated that they were buried around 2000bc, but they tell a story that goes back long before to the lost civilisations of Atlantis and Lemuria or Mu and even further. In more recent times many books have been written translating the content"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 134 of the Tablets and you don't have to delve into the translations for long to see that much of the Biblical Old Testament is an edited rewrite of these Sumerian stories. Besides the floating basket story of King Sargon, the Tablets describe the Great Flood and a place called E.DIN (\"The Abode of the Righteous On~'). The Bible speaks of Eden, the garden of 'God'. The story of Genesis is a summary of the same basic story told in the Sumerian Tablet§> in far more detail. Interestingly, many of the terms translated into the English version of the Old Testament as 'God' come from words that actually mean 'gods', plural, and the Sumerians said the founders of their civilisation were a race of beings that came to this planet from elsewhere bringing great knowledge and technology. They called these beings the Anunna. Their later Semitic name was AN.UNNAK.KI (\"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came\") and DIN.GIR (\"The Righteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets\"). Anunna means \"Sons of An\" (later Anu), the 'king' of the Anunna/ Anunnaki.l1 The name for Sumer in the tablets is KI.EN.GIR, which has been translated as \"The Land of the Lord of the Blazing Rockets\" and also \"The Land of the Watchers\". The term 'Watchers' is often used to describe ancient 'gods'. The Egyptian name for their gods, the Neteru, translates literally as 'Watchers'. The Egyptians said that these Watchers came in their 'heavenly boats' and in ancient cultures across the world you have this constantly recurring theme of 'gods: arriving in some kind of flying machine to found civilisations and bring knowledge and techniques that were light years ahead of what existed before. In the Indian culture they called the flying craft Vimanas and there were several designs. Some were cigar-shaped while others were described as double-decked with a dome and porthole windows. Both types are regularly described in UFO sightings today. The ancient Indian texts describe anti-gravity technology of the type used in 'flying saucers'. So much so that when the Chinese discovered Sanskrit documents in Tibet and sent them to the University of Chandrigarh for translation, they were found to contain the knowledge to build interstellar spaceships, according to the University's Dr Ruth Reyna.12 Yet the documents are thousands of years old! Dr Reyna revealed that these ships were known as \"Astras\" and it was claimed they could fly to any planet. Some texts talk about them flying to the Moon. Details of building, flying, and operating the craft are all included. The Chinese, apparently, even used part of the contents in their space programme. 13 The Sumerian Tablets describe planets of the solar system in both number and environment in ways that were only confirmed in the twentieth century. They describe how the Anunnaki, later called' gods', created a culture of great advancement and technology that was destroyed by Earth catastrophes and flood. The story of the Biblical Great Flood is told at length in the Tablets thousands of years before the Bible appeared. The Sumerian flood hero, Utnapishtim, was replaced by the name, Noah, when the much later texts of Genesis were compiled from the Sumerian records. The most astonishing information in the Sumerian clay tablets are the detailed descriptions of how the Anunnaki interbred with humans to create a hybrid race, a fusion of the genes of humans and the 'gods'. Yet again this is a constantly repeated theme in every part of the world and can be seen in the Old Testament narrative, taken from the Sumerian, of the Sons of God (proper~ translated, the sons of the gods) who interbred with humanity and created a hybrid bloodline. Genesis recounts: \"When men began to increase in number on the Earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God [the gods] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose ... The Nefilim were on the Earth in those days - and also afterwards - when the sons of God [the gods] went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown.\" 14 The term Nefilim can be translated as \"Those Who Descended\" or \"Those Who Fell From The Heavens\". The American researcher, David Sielaff, emphasises that the Nefilim or Nephilim are not the sons of the gods (beni ha-Elohim), but the offspring of the interbreeding between the \"daughters of men\" and the non-humans the Bible calls the Elohim. The Illuminati bloodlines that rule the world today are the Nefilim, a race of human/non-human hybrids. They were also known in ancient times as the Rephaim, Emim, Zazummim and Anakim, and they were all very tall or 'giant' people in those days. IS The Biblical Goliath was a Rephaim and giant in Hebrew is repha.J6 This theme of giants is a constant on~. Cave paintings found in places like Japan, South America and the Sahara Desert, depict giant people with round heads towering over human hunters. Bones of giant people between 8 and 12 feet tall have been found in mounds in Minnesota and other locations. The Delaware Indians speak of a race of giants who once lived east of the Mississippi in enormous cities and the same descriptions of giants in ancient legends and lore can be found everywhere. J7 Scores of giant red-haired mummies were discovered in a cave near Lovelock in Nevada and some were seven feet tal1.18 The Piute Indian legends about these giants say they were cannibals. They would even dig up the Piute dead from their graves and eat them, the accounts claim.19 Stories of Atlantis include tales of red-haired giants who acted like vampires, and the giant Nefilim were associated with cannibalism and blood drinking - just like the Illuminati bloodlines are today. Most accounts say that these giants were unfriendly, even hostile, to the rest of the population. Often associated with the giants are strange craft that sound very much like the 'flying saucers' of modern UFO accounts. Genesis tells us that"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 135 the sons of the gods married the daughters of men before the flood, as well as afterwards, and Numbers calls the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, or descendants of the Anakim (Anunnaki).20 Hero worship According to scholar Zecharia Sitchin, who has written many books on the Sumerian Tablets, the term \"men of renown\" in the Genesis passage should read, from its Sumerian origin, \"men of the sky vehicles\". This puts rather a different complexion on the whole story and makes a great deal more sense of it. The reference to \"heroes of old\" is also relevant. The word hero comes from the Egyptian term, hem, which, according to researcher 1:¥.allis Budge, was\" applied to the king as a representative of the Sun God on Earth\".21 The precise meaning was \"a human being who was neither a god nor a daemon\".22 The term has the inference of a crossbreed race. The writer Homer (8th-9th century BC) wrote that \"the heroes were exalted above the race of common men\". The poet, Pindar, (518-438 BC) used the term, \"hero/hem\", to describe a race \"between gods and men\". Flavius Josephus, the first century writer and historian, said this of the Genesis reference to the interbreeding between 'gods' and human women: \" ... for many angels of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did what resembled the acts of those wtlom the Grecians call giants.\" 23 The term' angel', which means messenger, became associated with these nonhuman entities that interbred with humans. The Sumerian Tablets go much further than Genesis in explaining the interbreeding of 'gods' and humans. They describe how the Anunnaki set out to create a slave race, later called Homo sapiens, to serve their agenda and how they began this quest, amid much trial and error, using what we call today test-tube methods. This is described in the Tablets and you can read the accounts in detail in the books of Zecharia Sitchin.24 The Tablets tell of how the sperm of Anunnaki males was used to fertilise human eggs before they were transplanted to Anunnaki females to be birthed. All this appears to have first happened hundreds of thousands of years ago, but has continued ever since on various scales. I think many of the stories mentioned in the Tablets refer to events in Lemuria and Atlantis. All this makes more understandable the countless stories told today by people claiming to have been abducted by non-human entities that forced them to have sex or took their eggs. The babies that result often disappear in early pregnancy with no medical explanation. Of course, there are many 'abduction' experiences that are simply invented or have other, more earthly, explanations; but to dismiss them all, given their number and often consistency of detail around the world, would be just as ridiculous as believing every word of every one. Let's hear it for Lulu The Sumerian Tablets tell of how the original breeding programme was headed by the chief scientist of the Anunnaki, called Enki, or \"Lord of the Earth\" (Ki = Earth), and their expert in medicine, Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti (\"Lady Life\"). Mesopotamian depictions portray her holding a horseshoe-shaped tool used at that time to cut the umbilical cord. Another name later given to her was Mammi, from which came mama and mother. Mama or ma as a term for mother can be found in various languages all over the world. Ninkharsag would later be symbolised in part by the stream of mother goddess deities with names like Queen Semiramis, Isis, Barati, Artemis, Diana and the Biblical Mary. These were also used to symbolise the feminine principle as goddesses of the Moon or waters, which are considered the feminine balance to the masculine Sun. After many failures and some horrendous creations, the Tablets indicate, Enki and Ninkharsag produced a human hybrid that the Sumerians called a LV.LV (\"One Who Has Been Mixed\") - which appears to be the Biblical \"Adam'~ This was the splicing together of the DNA of the Anunnaki with that of the human form known as Homo erectus. Some of these hybrids were designed to rule as the 'middle men' or 'demi-gods' between the Anunnaki and the people. What the Bible calls \"Adam\", the 'first man', is likely to be symbolic of \"the Adam\", a genetic stream not an individual. The Biblical \"Eve\" was supposed to have been created from a rib of Adam, but the word from which \"rib\" derived was the Sumerian, TI, which means both rib and life according to the translations of Zecharia Sitchin. To be created from the \"life\" or life essence of the Adamic race makes rather more sense than a rib. In the same way, the \"dust from the ground\" from which the Bible claims that Adam was created, really translates as \"that which is life\" from the Sumerian term, TI.IT. So Adam was a bit of a TI.IT. Appropriately, the Sumerian name for humans was LV, which has the root meaning of worker or servant and also implies a domesticated animal like a sheep. Does that not describe the nature of human life today and for a long time past? My own research leads me to think that the claims that the Anunnaki created the human form as we know it all over the world are exaggerated. There have been many examples of interbreeding between humanity and the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 136 extraterrestrial 'gods' of various origins and races and not just the Anunnaki. It was more that the Anunnaki created DNA streams or bloodlines to suit their agenda and they have continued to infuse their DNA into human blood streams. They seek to rewire the DNA to close down humanity's interdimensional communication and telepathic powers. This puts us in a vibrational prison in which most can perceive only the very narrow frequency range accessed by our physical senses. Official history says that certain human forms died out to be followed by new ones and thus Neanderthal man was followed by Cro-Magnon man and then Homo sapiens or modern man. But archaeologists working in the Middle East have discovered evidence to show that all these physical forms existed during the same period. The 'missing link' that would connect them and explain the sudden and dramatic changes and appearance of their physical forms has never been found because the establishment of academia would rather stay ignorant than utter the 'E' word - extraterrestrial. The theme of royal families claiming the right to rule because their bloodline was seeded by the gods is a constant one all over the world, not least in Sumer and Egypt, and this is the origin of the Illuminati bloodlines. The 'Israelite' pharaohs Given the significance that the Illuminati gives to ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid at Giza (not least on the dollar bill), you would expect an Egyptian connection - and there is. I should stress here, however, that what we call Egypt was not the first civilisation in those lands. In the tens of thousands of years before the emergence of the Egypt we know from the official history books, this land was called Khemit (I have seen a number of spellings). Khemit connected with the advanced civilisations of Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria that existed before the vast 'Great Flood' cataclysms of around 11,500 BC (see The Biggest Secret) They were all part of a global society. The word Kh'met in Egyptian means \"The Black Land\", and this is said to refer to the dark, rich soil laid down on the banks of the Nile by the yearly floods. (Deshr'et means \"The Red Land\", from which comes the word 'desert'.) I have also heard the view that The Black Land refers to a black population. The pharaohs of Egypt claimed the right to rule because they were children of the gods and they were another expression of the bloodline seeded around the world to rule on behalf of these' gods'. This Egyptian royal line is seriously important to the Illuminati and it has survived intact to the modern era. In more recent years the official history of the Jewish people has been questioned by a number of authors and researchers who have no motive whatsoever except to establish the truth. In previous books, 1 have connected a people known as the Hyksos to the Biblical Israelites and, as I was completing this work, I came across a series of extremely interesting books by the British author, Ralph Ellis.25 He has focussed especially on the Egypt connection to the 'royal' bloodlines and the Hyksos are at the heart of his research. The Hyksos are known by history as either the \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Rulers of Foreign Lands\" depending in the translation and are said to have invaded Egypt about 1720 to 1650 BC, again depending on which account you read. They produced a number of pharaohs or \"priest kings\" who were initiated into the secrets in the Great Pyramid and the Mystery school dedicated to the Sun at Heliopolis (called On in the Bible). The Hyksos Dynasty ruled from Avaris (hence the word 'avarice' meaning greedy) in the eastern delta (see Figure 20). I recommend Ralph Ellis's books for a wealth of detail, but in summary he says that the great figures of 'Jewish' history, like Abraham, King David and King Solomon were pharaohs of the Egyptian royal line that claimed to be descended from the 'gods'. I don't share all of his conclusions and I offer my interpretation of events at the end of the chapter, but his general themes are supported very much by my own research: a bloodline and its associated secret knowledge came out of Egypt with the leaders of the Biblical Israelites. As 1 have highlighted before, you search in vain for historical evidence outside the Bible for the characters known as Abraham, David, Solomon and Moses. Equally lacking is the archaeological evidence to support the Old Testament tales like the mass exodus of the Israelite people from bondage in Egypt during the period it supposed to have happened. This is ludicrous given the scale of the alleged events and the apparent stature of these people and the feats for which they were supposed to have been responsible. Quite simply, they did not exist in their Biblical form. But Ellis presents evidence that the story does start to make sense if you relocate them to Egypt and the pharaohs of the Hyksos, the \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Rulers of Foreign Lands\". These were supposed to be a people from Western Asia, which includes the lands of modem Turkestan in the north, Afghanistan in the east, the Mediterranean Sea in the. west and the present Iran and Iraq in the south - the land of Sumer and Babylon. I think- the Hyksos bloodline carne from Sumer for reasons I will outline later. Two o(nie Burner monarchs in their king lists were called \"Shepherd Kings\" and the Sumer /Egyptian religions were virtually identical. The Egyptian Sun God called Ra was Shamash in Mesopotamia and both were depicted as a winged Sun-disk (a symbol often used by the Illuminati today). The Hebrew word for Sun is \"Shemesh\"26 and so were the sons of \"Shem\" (hence Semitic) really sons of the Sun? That is a term you find in ancient Egypt, as in sons of Ra. When we speak of Egypt we are also speaking of Sumer and Mesopotamia because the two are fundamentally connected. As Ralph Ellis writes: "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 137 \"The historical record of Sumer runs substantially parallel to that of Egypt, dating back to some 3000 BC, with king lists much the same as to be found in Egypt. Historically, it would appear that at some point in history, elements of the Sumerian culture sailed across to Egypt and that the first dynasty kings of Egypt, therefore, had much in common with the Sumerian peoples.\" 27 Figure 20: Ancient Egypt at the time of the Hyksos (courtesy of Ralph Ellis from his book. Tempest and Exodus Bull-sheep Ellis's research leads him to conclude that the Hyksos never invaded Egypt from anywhere. They were already there. He says that the Hyksos were Egyptians who began to follow the religion of the 'sheep' when the astrological age of Aries was proclaimed to have started by the priests at the Mystery school at Heliopolis - the Biblical \"On\". He says this caused massive conflict with those, including the reigning Pharaoh, who supported the continuation of the worship of the 'bull' or the era of Taurus. Ellis writes that this 'sheep' v 'bull' religious conflict is the coded meaning of the \"Shepherd Kings\" (which he believes is the true translation of their title) and the countless references to sheep, shepherds, \"good shepherds\" and cattle in the symbol-sodden Bible stories. Genesis, for example, says that the patriarch Jacob... \"did separate the lambs ... and he put all his flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle\".2' In the same way, when the age of Aries gave way to Pisces in the period related by the New Testament the codes begin to move from shepherds and sheep to fishes and \"fishers of men\". Today we are in the transition from Pisces to Aquarius. Ellis says that Abraham, the Biblical 'father' of the Jewish and· Islamic peoples, did not come from the lands of Mesopotamia as the Bible contends, but was instead the son of an Egyptian pharaoh. Abraham became the first Hyksos Pharaoh, Ellis suggests, when the Aries followers, or\" Arians\", as he calls them, seized Lower Egypt, which included the Great Pyramid at Giza and the Mystery school at Heliopolis, the City of the Sun. Upper Egypt continued to follow the old religion with its centre at Thebes, Ellis says. What is for sure is that the Old Testament stories about the Israelite heroes being poor shepherds are baloney. These were seriously connected people, as Ellis shows, and this royal line that came out of Egypt is the reason for the Old Testament obsession with genealogy and all those 'begats'. He says Abraham was a Hyksos pharaoh called Sheshi, whose throne name was Mayebre or Mayebra. Switch the M around, he says, and you have a perfect phonetic match for Abram who became Abraham of the Bible. Mam-aye-bra = Ay-bra-ham: "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 138 \"Neither shall thy name be called Abram, but your name shall be called Abraham; for a father of many nations I have made thee. And I shall make thee exceedingly fruitful, .. and kings shall come out of thee.\" 29 Abraham's son known as Isaac in the Bible was the Hyksos pharaoh called Anather, says Ellis, and Isaac's son, Jacob, was really the pharaoh whose throne name was Jacobaam. Jacob is the Biblical patriarch who was said to have had twelve sons that founded the \"twelve tribes of Israel\", Ralph Ellis contends that the Biblical exodus of the 'Israelites' was actually a story that combined two mass evacuations from Egypt by the Hyksos and their followers. The major one, he says, happened in the 16th century BC when the conflict between the Upper and Lower Egyptian religions, the bull and the sheep, led to the people of 'Abraham' leaving to settle in Palestine at the time of the Hyksos pharaoh, Yakobaam or Jacobaam (Jacob). According to the Egyptian historian, Manetho,\" they numbered 240,000 families and the first century Jewish writer, Josephus, described the t1eeing Hyksos as \"our ancestors\".'] They left for Canaan, disguised by the Biblical texts as Israelites, and sacked Jerusalem. The Hyksos royal line returned to Egypt, says Ellis, with the Biblical 'Joseph'. He writes that the Genesis \"coat of many colours\" story, when Joseph was sold by his jealous brothers and taken to Egypt, is symbolic of the return of the bloodline from exile in Canaan. While 'Joseph' was not the first born according to the story, he was the first born of his father Jacob's 'chief wife' called Rachel. Thus he was the heir. This relates to the bloodline being passed on through the female. It is the DNA of the mother, not the father, who decides the 'purity' of the genes from the 'royal' point of view. The Illuminati follow the same principle to this day and the 'chief wife' or 'first wife' symbolism continues with titles like 'First Lady' for the wife of an American president. The Biblical story goes that Joseph became 'vizier' or chief minister to the pharaoh and the Old Testament tells us that he married the daughter of a priest at the Hyksos sacred Mystery school at Heliopolis. His wife as from the Egyptian royal bloodline. Not bad for a humble shepherd who was sold into slavery by merchants. But, of course, that's just the Biblical cover story. Joseph was considered to be of the royal line of Hyksos pharaohs. His job, says Ellis, was to regain the throne for the Hyksos and by becoming chief aide to the pharaoh, who did not at first know his background, he was in the perfect position to begin the process. There are many examples in history of the line of 'chief advisors' to the royal family eventually taking over the throne. One is the Stewards in Scotland, chief aides to the kings, who became the Stuart Dynasty. The Bible claims that Joseph's brothers came back to Egypt and so, says Ellis, an underground alternative royal line lay in waiting. He says that it took 200 years before the future pharaoh, Amenhotep III, married a daughter of the 'Joseph' Hyksos line of royal 'stewards' or 'advisors'. By the way, the title of 'Amen' used in ancient Egypt, as in Amenhotep, is the origin of the \"Amen\" used in 'Christian' services because the 'Christian' religion is based on the Sun worship of Egypt, Sumer and elsewhere. Ellis writes: \"Both Amenhotep II and Amenhotep III were called 'hyk' in their royal title - meaning 'Shepherd King'. More interestingly, their origins are also listed in the record and Amenhotep II's full title is the 'Hyksos King of Heliopolis'; which makes sense as this was the sacred temple and university of the Hyksos princes. Egyptologists are strangely silent on this fact.\" 32 Out of Egypt II Ellis says that a son of Amenhotep III, the \"Shepherd King\", was highly likely to have been the Biblical character called Moses, who was from the Egyptian royal family of priest-kings and not a \"poor Israelite\". \"Moses\", writes Ellis, was probably Tuthmoses, brother of Amenhotep IV, the future pharaoh better known to history as Akhenaton. The Bible story of Moses being found by the pharaoh's daughter floating on the Nile in a basket of bulrushes (a later steal from the King Sargon story) was designed to hide this fact. His brother Akhenaton married Nefertiti from the 'vizier' line going back to 'Joseph' because he knew that they were both from the same bloodline. The ancient royal families married their daughters and sisters to keep the bloodline pure and this continues today among the Illuminati families, although it is hidden by having children 'out of wedlock' and bringing them up under other names before reuniting them later in marriage. Incest is a fundamental part of life for the Illuminati families, as it was for the ancient bloodlines from which they originate. They are obsessed with maintaining the genetic connection to the 'gods'. The Hyksos pharaoh Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaton when he sought to transform the religion of the country to a worship of \"One God\" - the Sun, or perhaps more accurately, the \"power behind the Sun\".]] Akhenaton (remarkably close to Ashkenazim) was another priest-king educated at Heliopolis where the centre of worship was the tower known as the Benben stone. This was a round tower with a conical top - the phallic symbol of the bloodline of the gods. This is the real meaning of the obelisks all over the world, like the George Washington memorial in Washington DC, the 'mysterious' round towers of Ireland and the constant use of the obelisk in memorials instigated by Freemasons. In London, Paris and New York you will find original obelisks taken from Egypt because this is still the religion of the Illuminati families that moved out of the Near and Middle East and North Africa to take control of the wider world. The Benben"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 139 stone at Heliopolis stood within the Temple of the Phoenix and the phoenix or 'Bennu' bird was in the first design of the Great Seal of United States because the bloodlines were behind the creation of the USA. Later the Phoenix was symbolised in the seal as the eagle (which also has its own esoteric meaning) and for this reason you will find the eagle used in national symbolism across the world _ including Nazi Germany. No doubt at least some of them represent the phoenix. Akhenaton, an \"Arian\" or follower of the cult of Aries, says Ralph Ellis, moved the capital of Egypt to a place called Amarna when he became pharaoh and once again there was a furious response from those among the priesthood and the people following the religion he wanted to replace. Also in the centre of this conflict, it seems, was Akhenaton's brother, Tuthmoses, who, like the Moses in the Bible, gave up his royal birthright to his brother. Moses gave it to Aaron while Tuthmoses did the same for Akhenaton because of wounds that made Moses/Tuthmoses less than the 'perfect specimen' a pharaoh had to be. Moses and Tuthmoses and Aaron and Akhenaton appear to be same characters, says Ellis. Anyway, in the religious conflict under Akhenaton he and his followers (the Biblical Israelites that had not left in the first exodus) were exiled to a remote part of Egypt and segregated from the rest of the people in an area of stone quarries. This is supported by the Biblical narrative in its story of Moses, Aaron and the 'Israelites'. Ellis says that Akhenaton's father, Amenhotep Ill, appeared to be a sort of joint-pharaoh operating \"co-regency\", but when he died Akhenaton took over everything. He banned all \"graven images\" of the old religion. The Great Pyramid was obviously a key part of Egyptian religion and Ralph Ellis believes that this appears in the Bible under the code name of \"Mount Sinai\". Moses was said to have climbed Mount Sinai to receive the Mosaic Law or Ten Commandments from 'God'. But the Bible actually says that Moses went into the mountain to meet with God. Does God live in a cave then? Much more likely that this is referring to entering a ritual chamber of the pyramid where the Egyptian priests went to converse with the gods. Incidentally, the Ten Commandments are very similar to the Egyptian Declaration of Innocence in the Judgement of the Dead.34 As unrest grew among the people, the Israelites send an army of 200,000 from Jerusalem to Avaris to support their bloodline brothers. The anti-Akhenaton priesthood had installed his brother (often reported to be his son) Tutankhamen as the eight-year-old boy-king. He had changed his name from Tutankhaton at their insistence. Eventually came the second and much smaller exodus as Akhenaton and Tuthmoses left to join their Egyptian brothers and sisters in Canaan. This is the exodus referred to in the Bible, but with the magnitude of the first one included in the tale, Ralph Ellis concludes. The Bible says that when Moses died he was buried in the land called Moab - the name of the American weapon of mass destruction or Mother of all Bombs. Ellis says that Moab (Mera or Merab) was in fact Egypt. No wonder, as I reported earlier, that Moab is associated with Freemasonry. 'House of David' Ellis goes on to present more compelling evidence that 'King David' and his son 'King Solomon' (for whom there is no mention in the historical record outside the Biblical-Jewish accounts) were, in fact, another two Egyptian pharaohs called Psusennes II (David) and Sheshonq I (Solomon). Psusennes II was the last pharaoh of the twenty-first dynasty with his court based at Tanis in the eastern Delta lands the true location of the original Temple of Solomon, Ellis suggests. Psusennes II's official title apparently means something like \"My Star that Appears in His City\". King David, of course, is associated with the 'Star of David' and 'City of David'. Ellis contends that the Hebrew name for King David was \"Duad\", which is close to the Egyptian word for star, pronounced djuat. The full title for the daughter of Psusennes II was Maatkare Mutenhat or Maatkare Mu-Tamhat while King David's daughter is named in the Bible as Maachah Tamar 11.35 No archaeological record has been found of King David in the lands attributed to Israel, ·but references to his real self, Psusennes II, have been discovered.36 The suggestion is that Psusennes II of the Hyksos bloodline arrived with an army to seize the unified monarchy of the Israelite tribes from King Saul and he passed this on to his son, Sheshonq I (King Solomon). Once again these were priest kings, the bloodline of the 'gods', and expert in esoteric 'magic' - hence the reputation of Solomon for having such powers. Ralph Ellis presents an extremely well researched case for this 'Hyksos kings' scenario and the mass of inter-connecting detail can be found in his many excellent books. This is his comparison of the stories told about the Israelites and the historical record of the Hyksos: Israelites    Hyksos Shepherds and kings   \"Shepherd Kings\" Introduced religious changes into Egypt Had a vast army Same Had a vast army    Same Adopted Egyptian names and customs  Same Skilled in astronomy and science  Same There was a famine in Egypt   Same Major war with Egyptians   Same"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 140 Great exodus of about one million from the Nile Delta Same Fleeing Israelites pursued by pharaoh  Same Went to Jerusalem   Same 37 Hiding the truth – again The 'Israelite's' Egyptian origins were written out of the Biblical accounts when a whole new history was invented by the ruling priesthood, the Levites (descendents of Aaron/ Akhenaton). This happened most comprehensively after the invasion of the Israelite/Judean lands by the Babylonian army of King Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC when most - but not all- of the former Israelite/Egyptian 'Tribe of Judah' were taken into captivity in Babylon in the former lands of Sumer. Babylon was a melting pot of peoples and bloodlines and a centre for what we would call Satanic ritual and black magic. The captivity of the Israelites in Babylon did not mean prison cells. They were not allowed to leave, but they could go about their business and they came into contact with the religious stories and myths from Sumer and the Sumer-Babylonian technique of controlling the people through interest on money. Cuneiform texts discovered in Babylon show that during the reign of King Kandalanu (648-625 BC) one banker, Jacob Egibi, was charging an interest rate of 20 per cent.38 The Illuminati, who largely came out of Babylon, have been playing the same scam ever since. Only after the 70-year captivity did the Levite priesthood produce the texts that became the Torah (the law), the first five books of the Old Testament also known as the Pentateuch that are officially attributed to \"Moses\". This was hundreds of years after the events were supposed to have taken place. These texts created new 'Is.ra~1i~e' names for former Egyptian pharaohs and made up stories to provide an official history that suited their interests. The invented name of Solomon includes in every syllable a word meaning the Sun - Sol-am-On. Solomon means Sun-Sun-Sun. Hot stuff. Whenever they wanted the people to do something they wrote that 'God' had commanded it. They used the basket on the river story of King Sargon in Mesopotamia to cover the truth about the man they dubbed \"Moses\" and introduced the character of \"St Michael\", the Sumerian Tas Mi-ki-gal, the dragon slayer and Lord of Agriculture.39 He was later called the Lord of the Air and given wings to fly. There were no 'angels' in Israelite belief until the Babylon captivity.40 The Babylonian holy days were turned into the 'Jewish' holy days, including the Passover and Feast of the Tabernacles.41 The Levites relocated the Sumerian and Egyptian stories and themes to lands that they called Israel. The high initiates through the centuries have understood the coded story, but the mass of the people who have called themselves Jewish have been sold a lie, a cover story, to imprison their minds and make them slaves to their hierarchy. Even circumcision, so fundamentally associated with the Jewish faith, came from ... Egypt. Of course it did. What really is Zionism? The sacred place of the Jewish faith is Zion, hence Zionism. It is variously claimed to be Jerusalem and apparently Mount Sinai - Mount Zion - which Ralph Ellis says in his books is code for the Great Pyramid at Giza. But Ellis writes: \" ... the nation that built ... [Jerusalem] ... was primarily influenced by three pyramids at Giza, which were now regarded as the three symbolic foundations of the Judaic people and their religion. When, according to the famous song, the Israelites sat down in Babylon and remembered Zion, they were not just reminiscing about their lost City of David; they were also remembering the long-lost days when they could physic~ visit their primary temple in Egypt - the Great Pyramid at Giza.\" 42 Ellis says that when the scribes reminisced about Giza, they symbolised Zion as a mountain or a desert monument (\"Tsion\" in Hebrew) and when they were symbolising Zion as Jerusalem it was described as a castle. But even with the latter, Egypt is centre stage once again. Ellis makes the following comparison between the Judean Zion of Jerusalem and the Egyptian city of Tchian or Zian (known today as Tanis) where the walls were stamped with the cartouche or code of the pharaoh, Psusennes II (King David): Judean Zion  Egyptian Zian Called Jebus  Called Jebet (Tchebet) Known as a castle Known as a fortress Identified with a rock Known as the\" Rock\" Called the City of King David Called the City of King Psusennes II 43 Zionism is not about fulfilling the Biblical text as read by the masses. It is dedicated to the global dictatorship of the Egyptian - Sumerian royal dynasties seeded by the 'gods'. They have recaptured Sumer and Babylon (Iraq), so does this mean \"Look out Egypt\"? Alongside the bloodlines is the religion of the Sun God. Ralph Ellis writes that the Hebrew word Eli has the root meaning of \"ascension\" or to \"climb up\" - the rising Sun.+! So we have the name, Isra-eli-tes. The name Eli is also used as E1. The chief Sun god of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 141 Egypt was Ra and the Moon goddess was Isis. Thus we have Israel ... Is-ra-e1. It is the Illuminati Trinity again that constantly recurs. I have highlighted in other books how the Judaic hero, Samson, was a symbol for the Sun and we can see it in his name. In Hebrew, Samson (Shimshown) means \"a representation of the Sun\".~' The worship of the Moon is also implied in the name of the Hebrew god, YHWH or Yahweh. Ralph Ellis writes: \"Could the ineffable, the unspeakable. name of the Israelite god be etched into the walls of the great Temple of Karnak perhaps? It may seem incredible. but I think that this is precisely the case. The first two letters of the tetragrammaton are YH and the presumed vowel in the middle is an 'a'. giving the syllable of 'yah'. Turning to the Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary of Wallis Budge, it can be seen that the name Yah can be translated as 'the Moon'. Here, at last, is confirmation that the presumptions I have made are standing on secure foundations. If the word Yahweh was derived from Egypt, it is highly likely to have had some lunar connotation.\" 46 The Rothschild \"kings\" I have also stressed the key role in the conspiracy of the Rothschild family and it is no surprise that their name Rothschild or \"Red Shield\" can be traced back to Egypt and the Hyksos kings. Ellis reports that the Hyksos/lsraelites wore protective talismans in the form of a 'star shield' that became the 'Star of David'. This is today displayed on the flag of the Rothschild-created-and controlled State of Is-ra-el (Figure 21). What's more, the Hyksos kings were closely associated with the colour red. The crown of the Hyksos pharaohs in Lower Egypt was the Red Crown, known as the djesher-t (djesher in Egyptian meant red and the first-born sons of Israel were sometimes identified by a scarlet thread on their wrist).47 The Rothschilds or Redshields are of the Hyksos royal line, as are many other Illuminati families, and this is why they don/t give a damn about the plight of the mass of Jewish people in general who are not of this 'royal' line of the gods. Do most British monarchs give a damn about the 'common people' over whom they 'reign'? Exactly. Out of Babylon came the coded cover story produced by the Levites that we know as the Old Testament and the books of the Torah or Pentateuch that are the basis of Judaism. The Levites were the priestly tribe of 'Moses' and' Aaron' or Akhenaton and I wonder if the Levites were really the bloodline going back to the priests at Heliopolis? What also emerged from Babylon was the truly appalling, unspeakable, Babylonian Talmud on which the more extreme forms of the belief system are founded. This takes precedence over the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jewish religion that has held the minds of its believers in thousands of years of servitude came from these perversions of the truth inspired in Babylon. It was this manufactured version of 'God' and history into which the Khazars were converted Figure 2j: The Star of David or Psusennes II - the Roth (Red) Shield. It is now on the flag of the Rothschild-created and controlled State of Is-Ra-EI about 740 AD, but their elite would have known the real score. There is no way in the world that the Roman royal bloodline of Byzantium would have bred with a Khazar princess to produce Emperor Leo the Khazar, for example, unless the lady was from the 'bloodline of the gods'. Indeed, especially as she was female, the route through which the crucial DNA is preserved across the generations. The EgyptianSumerian royal bloodlines expanded throughout the world and this is why evidence has been discovered, as I outlined in The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix, that Egyptians and their associated Sumerians and Phoenicians settled in Britain and Ireland thousands of years before the Christian era. It was they who built the great monoliths and stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury. These bloodlines also expanded through the Caucasus Mountains and into the lands of the later Khazars. Same origins, different spin "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 142 Islam is also based on the stories of people like Abraham - the first Hyksos pharaoh according to Ralph Ellis. He points out that the name of Allah, the Islamic God is derived from the Hebrew Eli (the spelling in Hebrew is almost identical) which means ascension and \"to rise up\" - the rising Sun. In turn, we have Heli, the Greek word for Sun, and all go back to Egypt where, for example, the Sun God Aton is almost certainly the origin of another Hebrew name for God, Adhon (plural ~ Adhonai). Christianity, too, came out of Babylon in its structural form and the world's three major religions all originated from/the fabricated allegorical stories of the \"royal bloodline\" of Egypt and its closely associated bloodlines of Sumer from where Noah is said to have resided and produced his offspring of the gods. Noah is another code for the bloodline (see Children of the Matrix). To think that these three religions, based on the same misrepresentations, have been fighting each other all these years! It is the same with the Hindus and Muslims. It is the common origins of Judaism and Christianity that has led to both Jews and the Pope wearing a skullcap. It symbolises the way the priests in the Mystery schools of Egypt and elsewhere would shave their heads in that same place. Christian monks and such like have done the same. The Pope also holds a shepherd's crook, a symbol in Egypt of the Shepherd Kings, and even the title of Pope could well originate from the Egyptian Hyksos king, Apopis IUS This can also be pronounced\" Apapi',' and the original 6th dynasty version of his name was Papi or Popi.49 This could be the root of Papa, Pop and Pope, all versions of \"father\". Christianity may appear to have moved from the 'Holy Land' to Rome, but the Roman Church that turned Christianity into the state religion was simply the Church' of Babylon transplanted when the Illuminati moved their headquarters from Babylon to Rome. That is why the Christian religion, and its churches, are awash with ancient 'Pagan' symbolism (see The Biggest Secret). The Babylonian trinity of Nimrod the fish), his 'son', Tammuz (who 'died to save the sins of humanity') and his other', Queen Semiramis (the dove), were transformed into Christianity's 'Father, and Holy Ghost'. That may seem to have ousted the female or goddess from the trinity, but Roman Catholicism venerates Mary, the virgin 'Mother of Jesus', in the same way that the Egyptians did with Isis, the virgin 'Mother of Horus', and the Babylonians did with Semiramis, the virgin 'Mother of Tammuz'. Figures 22 and 23: On the left is how the ancient Egyptians portrayed their 'Virgin Mother' Isis, and her saviour son, Horus. On the right is the classic pose of the Christian Virgin Mother, Mary, and her saviour son, Jesus, in a church at Godshill on the Isle of Wight in England. They are the same deities under different names. Horus and Jesus were also both connected to the symbol of the fish, as was Nimrod in Babylon Semiramis, Isis and Mary are all names for the same deity. The 'virgin' bit is related to the bloodlines seeded by the gods. Queen Semiramis was said to have had an 'immaculate conception' when she was impregnated by 'God' - the rays of the Sun God Baal/Nimrod, If you look at·Fjgl!res.22 and 23, you will see the glaringly obvious comparison between the EgyptlqI1,portrayal of Isis and Horus and the Christian one of Mary and Jesus, Horus and Jesus were, like Nimrod, both connected to the symbol of the fish. The Gospel stories on which Christianity is founded are a mass of Sumerian/Babylonian/ Egyptian Mystery"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 143 school symbolism relating to Sun worship, secret rituals and other esoteric concepts, as I detail in The Biggest Secret. The same basic story of 'born on December 25th, died to save humanity, etc., etc.', was widely told thousands of years before Christianity about the exploits of the Sun gods in many and various cultures, including Rome (Mithra) and Babylon (Tammuz - the 'Son of the Sun God'), Tammuz and Nimrod are symbolised in endless forms around the ancient and modern world and this includes 'Jesus', This is why 'Christian' churches always orientate to the east - the direction of the rising Sun, Nimrod was worshipped (and still is) as 'The House of the Rising Sun'. This is precisely what 'Christian' churches are and thus they are often targeted for Satanic rituals. What better place could the Satanists have? The churches are full of Babylonian symbolism venerating Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz and surrounded by dead bodies in the churchyard. The halos used in pictures of the Gospel heroes are inspired by the way the ancients portrayed their Sun gods with halos to symbolise what they represented. Jesus is called 'the Light of the World' because he is another name for the Sun God/Son, Nimrod/Tammuz, and he is symbolised as a fish because that was the symbol of Nimrod in Babylon. When Nimrod was killed it was said that his body was cut into pieces and his wife/mother, Queen Semiramis, found all the pieces except his penis. Exactly the same story was told about Osiris and Isis in Egypt. Nimrod was said to have 'ascended' to the Sun and become the Sun God 'Baal' - a major Illuminati deity to this day. As the Sun rose in the morning, the Babylonians believed it was Nimrod/Baal 'rising again'. At Sunset, they said, he went to fight off evil creatures in the ocean, only to return again every morning - victorious! Queen Semiramis said that it was Nimrod, as the rays of the Sun, who impregnated her to conceive Tammuz. It was claimed that Tammuz (or Damu and Dammuzi as he is also known) was the reincarnation of Nimrod and it was said, therefore, that the \"Father and son are one\". This is the origin of the same claim by 'Christianity' that the Father God (Nimrod) and his son, 'Jesus' (Nimrod/Tammuz), are one. The Gospel stories are actuality symbolic tales about Nimrod/Tammuz using the names 'God' and 'Jesus' with 'Mother Mary' and 'Mary Magdalene' added to represent different expressions of Queen Semiramis. Mother Mary is known as the 'Queen of Heaven' - exactly the title given to Semiramis in Babylon. Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a prostitute or whore in the Bible - Queen Semiramis is the 'Whore of Babylon'. Christianity is the Sun religion of Babylon and when Illuminati operatives like Bush, Blair and the British royal family claim to be 'Christians' and attend 'Christian' services, they are, in fact, knowingly worshipping Nimrod/Tammuz/ Semiramis, the Babylonian trinity. When others talk about the 'bloodline of Jesus' surviving to become the Merovingian kings, this is really code for the bloodline of Nimrod, Tammuz and Semiramis: the bloodline of Babylon. The 'Jesus bloodline' story promoted by people like the British author, Sir Laurence Gardner, claims th9,t Jesus married Mary Magdalene and produced children that continued the bloodline that became Merovingian! [Illuminati] royalty. I would suggest that such stories are simply code representing 'the bloodline of Nimrod (Jesus) and Queen Semiramis (Mary Magdalene). Queen Semiramis proclaimed that Nimrod/Baal would be present on Earth after his death in the form of a flame and that's the real origin of the Illuminati symbol of the flame or lighted torch. This is what the Statue of Liberty is holding! When Tammuz died, Semiramis said that he had \"ascended to his father\" and would also be worshipped as a flame. The 'Christian' festival of Easter comes from the same source. Easter comes from the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) and it celebrated her son, Tammuz, who was, wait for it, the \"only begotten son of the Moon goddess and Sun God\" - Nimrod and Semiramis. The \"Easter\" (Ishtar) eggs and the \"Easter bunny\" also come from Babylon. Queen Semiramis said she came from the Moon in a giant egg and this became known as the Ishtar egg. Tammuz was said to be very fond of rabbits and so we have the Easter bunny. Oh yes, and they also ate \"sacred cakes\" with a T on the top - the origin of our hot cross buns. The T is a major symbol of Freemasonry because of its associations with Babylon and Tammuz. The Christian wafer used in Catholic ceremonies comes from the Egyptian ta-en-aah - the sacrificial bread of the Moon.50 Christians think the bread symbolises the 'body of Jesus' when they are really involved in a ritual about the Egyptian Moon god. It doesn't take much brain power to see the true meaning behind drinking red wine as the 'blood of Jesus'. Mine's a type A, please barman. Other representations of Semiramis, by the way, include Athena (Greece), Minerva (Egypt and Greece), Astarte (Syria), Cybele (Rome), Ashtoreth (Israel) and Diana (Ephesus). Diana, the great goddess of the Merovingians, is symbolised as the Goddess of the Moon, child birth and hunting. Diana is Semiramis, the' goddess who came from the Moon', who gave birth to Tammuz and was married to Nimrod, the 'hunter'. Semiramis is everywhere under different names and Princess Diana's murder in Paris in 1997 was a symbolic ritual sacrifice to.'\\Semiramis (see The Biggest Secret). In Illuminati symbolism, Prince Charles (Sun God/Nimrod) impregnated Princess Diana (Queen Semiramis) to produce Prince William (Tammuz), the 'Son of the Sun God' who was induced to be born when? On June 21st - the summer solstice, the major day of worship to the Sun. Ralph Ellis believes that behind all this symbolism and make-believe there was a man on whom 'Jesus' was; based (although very different to the Gospel hero depicted by Christianity). He says that the claim that 'Jesus' was of the House of David was an indication that he was claiming to be of the Egyptian Hyksos bloodline (pharaohs were called the \"Son of God\" - bloodline of the gods). I have heard the 'Jesus' bloodline"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 144 story proposed many times by various authors, especially Sir Laurence Gardner, but I simply don't buy it. Jesus is code for Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz and Mary Magdalene is code for Queen Semiramis. What better way to justify global domination by the bloodline families to billions of Christians than to make out it is the sacred bloodline of their Christ? An alternative view to the 'bloodline of Jesus' story and its associated secret society, the Priory of Sion, can be found at http://www.alpheus.org/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardsonl.html. I would add this point also. I read stories about the bloodline, including the Merovingians, \"almost dying out\" and that Jesus was the last of the line who had to pass on his bloodline to keep it alive and so on. Oh please. These ancient 'royal' lines in their various forms are all over the world and, I stress again, they are passed on through the female line that history largely does not record. History follows the men. Large numbers of bloodline births are also outside marriage and the real parentage is not recorded. The bloodline depended on one man? Are you kidding? And the free masons too ... When famous Illuminati names go to church - be it Christian or 'Jewish' - they know what the symbolism and the texts really mean. They know they are taking part in an ancient pre-Christian or pre-Jewish ritual celebrating their bloodline and origins. These religious rituals are the 'outer' knowledge presented in code while the 'inner' knowledge is passed down through the highest levels of the secret society network, which is based, once again, on the same bloodline and Egypt-Sumer-Babylon origins as the major religions. Freemasonry is usually traced to the 1600s when the guilds of masons who built the cathedrals (using the sacred geometry of the ancient pyramid builders and coded architecture) began to allow outsiders to join. The Mother Lodge of Freemasonry was formed in London on June-24th 1717. But informed Freemasons know that is not their true origin. My wife Pam and I, walked into the Freemason headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, and when we found no one around we decided to keep walking until we were stopped. We saw only a builder who thought we were supposed to be there and took a number of pictures inside as we walked down the corridors and into the temples. You can see from Figure 24, a picture in one of the corridors, that they trace their origins to ancient Egypt and the Middle East. The caption underneath the picture spoke of Freemasonry passing from \"Friend to Friend, from centuries past to centuries to come\". It features George Washington, the first President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, who was so important in the country's creation, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the wartime leader, President Harry S. Truman, who ordered the nuclear strikes on Japan, General Douglas Macarthur of Korean War fame and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Figure 24: The origins of Freemasonry confirmed in a picture on the wall of the Freemason headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. This secret society goes back to the ancient world and even beyond Sumer and Egypt to Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 145 The Freemasons worship the 'Great Architect' in their rituals and in Egypt the pharaoh was called the 'Greatest of Architects' or the 'Son of God'. This is why you find the symbols of Freemasonry dominated by the tools of the builder or architect, like the compass and hammer. The hammers banged on a block by judges in their courts are also Freemasonic symbols relating to the 'Great Architect' and Egypt. The Illuminati created and control the 'justice' system, as I have long highlighted. Freemasonry or 'The Craft' is focussed on the building and re-building of King Solomon's Temple that was located, it is said, in Jerusalem on the site of the present El-Aqsa Mosque on Temple Mount. King Solomon = Egyptian King Sheshonq I, says Ralph Ellis. The Freemasonic hero is called Hiram Abif (the \"widow's son\"), who is claimed to be the chief architect of Solomon's Temple and the man the Bible refers to as Hiram. But once again Ralph Ellis makes the Egyptian connection. The chief designer for Sheshonq 1's temples in Egypt was called Harem Atif (\"Hiram is my father\"), he says.51 Harem or Hiram was a royal/priestly title in Egypt and used by some pharaohs, as with Haremheb. Temple Mount to the Arabs is Harem a-Sharif. The Egyptian and Freemasonic goddess known as Ma'at was depicted as a symbol of truth and justice and you will find her on many court buildings with her arms out stretched holding a sword and scales. The title of magistrate is derived from Ma'at, who assisted Osiris in the judgment of the dead by weighing their hearts. 52 As the Egyptian knowledge and bloodline passed through history, Ma'at became known to the Greeks as Themis and her ability to foresee the future allowed her to become one of the oracles at Delphi and the \"goddess of divine justice\".5] The Roman goddess of justice was called Justitia and she was often portrayed as balancing both scales and a sword while wearing a blindfold. One of the major secret societies that carried the knowledge from Egypt and Sumer at the time of the Roman Empire was the Comacine Masters, the Roman expression of the Mystery school known as the Dionysian Artificers. They used the same symbols that we see in 'modern' Freemasonry, including the black and white squares on the floor of their temples. Appropriately, you see this in many churches and the great cathedrals of Europe. The cathedrals were built to the sacred geometry of Egypt and Sumer by the Knights Templar a{ld their associated secret societies and groups. See The Biggest Secret for a vast amount of information about such matters and the symbolism of the Illuminati. I have stressed that the agenda is to create a global fascist state and we can find the symbol for that in Egypt and the Freemasons. The word for axe in Egypt was neter, which is very close to neter-kherti, a term that means quarryman or stonemason. 54 This is highly likely to be the real meaning of the axe in the symbol of the fasces (an axe and bundled rods) - the origin of the word fascism. The axe was also associated with the goddess, the key figure in Illuminati ritual. Ma'at was sometimes portrayed holding the fasces in one hand and a flame (the main Illuminati symbol) in the other. The 22nd degree of the Scottish Rite is called a Prince of Libanus or Knight of the Royal Axe. The following is a Freemasonic explanation of this degree and note the mention of the Hyksos: \"This degree teaches that all labor is honorable, and the 'toiling millions' should be respected and assisted [sure]. The Phoenicians [of Egypt/Sumer origin], especially those of the city of Tsidun, are remembered as those who cut cedars on Mount Libanus (Lebanon) for Noah's ark, as well as the Ark of the Covenant and the Temples of Jerusalem. The peoples of Phoenicia, Hiram of Tyre and Hiram Abif included, were tied to the Israelites by the fact that they shared the mysteries, and it is even said that the Etrurian and Roman Colleges of Artificers descended from them via the Hyksos. The Lodge, styled a College, has two apartments. The first is a plain room which represents a workshop on Mount Libanus. Here, the Senior Warden, or 'Master Carpenter,' presides. The second apartment is hung in red, lighted by 36 lights, and is called the Council-room of the Round Table. The brethren sit at a round wooden table, and the altar in the East holds the three great lights and an axe. Battery: [2-2-2]. The apron is white, bordered in purple, and contains a three-headed serpent and a table with instruments and plans on it. The jewel is an axe and handle of gold. On the top of the handle are the initials of Noah [from the land that became Sumer] and Solomon [from Egypt]. In the middle of the handle are the initials of Libanus and Tsidun. On the blade are the initials of Adoniram, Cyrus, Darius, Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, Ezra (on one side), and Shem, Kham, Yapheth, Moses, Ahaliab, Betselal (on the other).\" 55 Freemasons and their connected secret societies (operating under overall Illuminati leadership) have their agents in control of all areas of global society, including politics, business, banking, media, medicine and military. Freemasons controlled both sides in the American War of Independence when the Mother Lodge in London made sure the 'right' side won to give the illusion that the new United States was no longer controlled from England (see The Biggest Secret). Of the 55 signatories of the American Declaration of Independence, at least 50 were known to be Freemasons and only one known not to be. The Great Seal of the United States is a mass of ancient Egyptian symbolism with the Great Pyramid and All-Seeing Eye, the eagle (or phoenix), the repetition of the esoterically-sacred number 13 and the motto \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\", which is Latin for \"New Order of the Ages\". One of the Illuminati code names for their agenda is \"New World Order\" or \"New Order of the Ages\". The Pyramid and All-Seeing Eye was put on the dollar bill by President Franklin Delano 'Illuminati' Roosevelt and his later Vice-President, Henry Wallace, who believed that America was chosen by God (the gods) to lead the world in establishing the New World Order. Wallace was it prominent Freemason and he wrote in 1934:"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 146 \"It will take a more definite recognition of the Grand Architect of the Universe before the apex stone [capstone of the pyramid] is finally fitted into place and this nation in the full strength of its power is in position to assume leadership among the nations in inaugurating 'the New Order of the Ages'.\" 56 Wallace knew that the United States was always planned to be the vehicle for the final push to global dictatorship - exactly what is happening now. The British pharaohs The Coronation of the British monarch is inspired by the crowning ceremonies for the pharaohs of Egypt passed down through the Israelites. In 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey, the Archbishop of Canterbury turned to the north, south, east and west (the four points of the Pagan cross) and the congregation shouted \"God save the Queen\". This was symbolic of the story in the Old Testament described the crowning of Saul as King of Israel when people shouted \"God save the King\". This cry can be found eight times in the Old Testament when the kings of Israel are crowned. The Queen sat in the Coronation Chair, under which was the ancient \"Scone Stone\" that legend says was brought from Egypt/Israel. In her hands were the Egyptian symbols, a sceptre and a rod. On the top of the sceptre was a Maltese Cross (symbol of the Illuminati Knights of Malta) and on the rod was a dove (the symbol of Babylon's Queen Semiramis). She later held an orb with the Maltese Cross on the top, the same as those used by the Dutch (and high-Illuminati) House of Orange. Queen was anointed with oil, the ancient tradition that goes back thousands of the years to the Egypt-Sumer era and beyond. The word Christ means \"Anointed One\". The oil used in the British Coronation is the same mixture as that used in Egypt and Israel. It is carried in a gold vessel called an ampoule made in the form Man eagle (phoenix) and legends also connect this part of the ceremony to the dove (Queen Semiramis). The oil is symbolic of the \"messeh\" fat of the crocodile used in the coronation ceremonies for the pharaohs in ancient Egypt. From this we get \"messiah\" - the Jewish legend of the coming \"messiah\" - the one anointed with the fat of the crocodile: the new pharaoh. The anointing at the Coronation is supposed to elevate the monarch to the rank of High Priest and in this case, appropriately, High Priestess of the Church of England, as well as head of state. While this was happening, the Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"As king, priests and prophets were anointed: and as Solomon was anointed by Zadock the priest, Nathan the prophet, so be thou anointed, blessed and consecrated Queen over the people whom the Lord thy God has given thee to rule and govern ... \" The Coronation Crown is set With 12 jewels together with two depictions of the Maltese Cross, one of the most prominent symbols of the Nazis. In the Levite authored Exodus we hear of the Breastplate of Aaron, which is set with 12 stones. The same stones, in the same order, appear on the British crown. And who does Ralph Ellis say Aaron was? Akhenaton!! The Archbishop placed his hand between those of the Queen to pay homage to the new head of his Church and he kissed her right hand. Then he said: \"The Lord Almighty ... establish your throne in righteousness, that it may stand for evermore, like as the Sun before him, and as a faithful witness in heaven.\" This is almost a repeat of the words used in \"God's covenant\" with David in the Old Testament. The \"Lord Almighty\" was called El-Shaddai and we are talking Nimrod/Baal from Babylon. The Coronation is completed with the \"Coronation Anthem\" called Zadock the Priest, the man who is said to have performed the coronation ceremony of King Solomon (Sheshonq I). Wherever you look you find the ancient 'royal' bloodlines, their rituals and agenda, and their goal is global domination as I have been warning all these years. Rep-tales OK, so it is clear that the interbreeding \"bloodlines of the gods\" who ruled the ancient world continue to rule today. But who are these bloodlines and who are the 'gods' that seeded them? The Sumerian Tablets reveal that the Anunnaki were a reptilian race, as widely confirmed when you read other ancient accounts. A Sumerian Tablet dating to around 3500 BC leaves us in no doubt as it describes the arrival of the Anunnaki: \"The reptiles verily descend.\" 57 In Hebrew myth, the Biblical \"Nefilim\", the \"sons of the gods\", are called awwim, which means devastators or serpents. The symbol of the Hyksos kings was the snake and Egyptian royalty were very much associated with reptilian imagery. Even academics like Dr Arthur David Horn, former Professor of Biological Anthropology at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, have concluded that humanity was seeded by an extraterrestrial race and that the Anunnaki were reptilian. He,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 147 too, believes that these same Reptilians have controlled the world for thousands of years, as he explains in his book, Humanity's Extraterrestrial Origins.5R The Illuminati use reptilian and Anunnaki symbolism all the time, as you can see in The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix, and remember how Jay Gamer and Zalmay Khalilzad hosted a meeting of Iraqi groups in the shadow of the 4,OOO-year-old ziggurat at Ur, the stepped-pyramid temple of the ancient Sumerians? Ur was a major centre for the Anunnaki and the ziggurat is believed by some to be a place where communication and interbreeding took place with humans. What a coincidence that the Illuminati-controlled American government should choose such a location for their first conference after Iraq was occupied. The themes of the Sumerian Tablets are supported by Credo Mutwa, one of only two surviving 'Sanusi' left in southern Africa. A Sanusi is the peak of the African shamanistic stream. Credo is in his eighties and the other Sanusi, his aunt, is in her nineties. He is the official historian and storyteller of the Zulu nation and the very name \"Zulu\" means \"People from the Stars\" because they believe they were seeded by an extraterrestrial 'royal' race. I think many extraterrestrial groups have been involved in seeding human races for aeons and this has given us the diversity of forms. With no one for him to pass on his knowledge, and the urgent need for everyone to know the astonishing information he has received in a lifetime of initiations, I produced videos with him called The Reptilian Agenda. They run more than six hours and still that is only a fraction of the knowledge he holds. In the videos he reveals what he once pledged in his initiations never to reveal, but he says the situation for humanity is so perilous that it is far more important for them Figure 26: The necklace features a non-human figure with a ·come-and-get-me· penis that fits into the earth woman. This symbolises the interbreeding of the Chitauri/Anunnaki that created the hybrid bloodline Figure 25: The Necklace of the Mysteries in the possession of Credo Mutwa that appears in accounts going back 500 years and Credo believes is at least 1,000 years old Figure 27: Another symbol hanging from the necklace is a 'flying saucer' that the accounts say were used by the Chitauri/Anunnaki to know what is going on than for him to keep such vows of silence. This information went underground when the Europeans invaded Africa and their Illuminati leaders, in Credo's words, \"milked the minds of the shamans and then killed them\". It was suicide to talk openly of such things and secret networks of initiation were formed to keep it alive. Credo, who has become a great friend, tells the same story of the interbreeding between the extraterrestrial Anunnaki and humans to produce a hybrid race. He has artefacts like the \"Necklace of the Mysteries\","},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 148 which confirm this story (Figures 25,26 and 27). It is an extremely heavy copper 'necklace' that actually rests on the shoulders and it has been mentioned in records 500 years old. Credo says it goes back at least 1,000 years. The large symbols that hang from the necklace tell the story of humanity. In pride of place at the front are an extraterrestrial with a big copper willy and an Earth woman into whom the ET 'fits', if you follow me. This is symbolic, Credo explains, of the union between the people from the stars and the people of the planet. You find the same theme recorded in virtually every ancient culture. Significantly, he says the copper willy was once made of gold before it was stolen and replaced with copper. This mirrors the ancient Egyptian story about the golden penis of their key god, Osiris, which is symbolised by the secret societies today, especially the Freemasons, as an obelisk. The way the extraterrestrial is portrayed on the necklace, Credo says, is merely symbolic because these 'gods' were of a very distinct and unhuman form (reptilian) and they warned the people of instant death if they ever depicted them as they really looked. How often we can observe in religious texts the theme of \"God (the gods) must not be seen or revealed\". Thus the 'gods' were portrayed symbolically. Hanging from the Necklace of the Mysteries is a large hand, full of symbols. Among these is the all-seeing eye, which symbolises, Credo says, the \"Watchers\" (the same as the Illuminati image on the US dollar bill); there is also the constellation of Orion, which modem researchers have constantly connected with extraterrestrial activity on Earth; and there is a Star of David, so associated with \"King David\" (Psusennes II) and now on the flag of Is-ra-el. As some Jewish historians have stated, it is an ancient symbol found all over the world and only became closely associated with the Jewish faith when the banking and Illuminati bloodline dynasty, the Rothschilds or Redshields, began to use it in the eighteenth century. The Necklace of the Mysteries includes a very clear 'flying saucer' which, the legend says, the extraterrestrials flew from their giant 'Mothership' to land on the Earth. They say the Mothership continued to orbit and it was to there that the leaders sheltered during the upheavals of the Great Flood. This is exactly what the Sumerian Tablets say. In France, cave paintings dated to between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago include oval and disc-shaped objects standing on tripod legs with ladders coming down from them. A drawing carved in a cliff at Fergania in Central Asia had a man who appeared to be wearing an \"airtight helmet\" with some mechanical device on his back. It was dated to 7000 Be. Whatever 'the origii1 and nature of 'flying saucers' and other such craft, they have been seen aha recorded for thousands of years. Figure 28: Credo Mutwa's painting of a Chitauri reptilian from ancient and modem accounts. This represents one of the warrior class and not the 'royal\" leadership Reptilian royalty Credo has painted pictures from ancient and modem descriptions of these reptilian entities (Figure 28) and describes the various levels of the fiercely imposed genetic hierarchy. The lower levels are the 'warriors', the 'poor bloody infantry', as we say in Britain. There is another Reptilian as typically described in Figure 29 (overleaf). How appropriate that British troops were given reptile training glasses during their preparations for desert warfare in Iraq in 2003 (Figure 30, overleaf), The Reptilians are ruled by the 'royal' leaders, which have horns and tails, Credo says, and at the very top are beings with a white, albino-like skin and not the greenish or brownish colour of the others. Witnesses and abductees have reported seeing"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 149 reptilian beings with albino-like skin and these descriptions can also be found in ancient texts. In Credo's Africa these Reptilians are known as the Chitauri, which translates as \"Children of the Serpent\" or \"Children of the Python\". This is so close to the Central American term, \"people of the Serpent\". Africa, like every other continent, is awash with the legend of the serpent race. Credo Mutwa talks for hours on the videos, The Reptilian Agenda, about the background and history of the Chitauri. He describes how the Earth was once encircled by a canopy of water vapour (the \"firmament\") that was destroyed in a cataclysm. This water vapour protected the planet from the harsh effects of the Sun, and the whole planet was moist and humid and had a constant temperature. It was a place of enormous abundance and vast forests. This is a common description of the pre-cataclysmic 'Golden Age' or the Lemurian/ Muan 'Garden of Eden' in the Pacific Ocean. But, he says, when the Chitauri destroyed this canopy (symbolised by the Biblical 40 days and 40 nights of rain) the whole climate changed as the Sun's rays baked once green and abundant lands, like Egypt, and began to form the deserts. Scientists agree that Egypt, now part of the Sahara Desert, was once a green and pleasant land. This was in the days when Egypt was 'Khemit'. The story could explain the water erosion found on the Sphinx (which has a face of a woman, not a man). To divide and rule the people, Credo continues, the Chitauri scattered them across the Earth and gave them different languages so they could not communicate with each other. Figure 29: A painting by artist Hilary Reed of a Reptilian entity as described by witnesses Figure 30: A British soldier wearing the eye protectors issued to the troops as they prepared for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, How appropriate This is another story repeated all over the world and not just in the Old Testament version of the Tower of Babel. That was taken from many more ancient accounts. The Native American Hopi tribe in Arizona say that when they came to the surface of the Earth on the orders of \"Spider Woman\", a \"mocking bird\" arrived to confuse their language and make the tribes talk in different tongues. Credo, repeating the information passed on to him in a lifetime of initiations into this underground knowledge, said the Chitauri Reptilians interbred with all races to create the reptilian-mammalian hybrids through which they rule. He said that in African culture a person's genealogy is very important and that the 'royal' bloodlines of the kings of black Africa claimed descent from the same 'gods' as the white 'royalty' across the world. He said that these black royal bloodlines (like those in the countries of the 'West') had large1f moved out of the positions of inherited control, the kings and queens, where they could be identified. Instead they have taken the positions of 'appointed' or 'elected' control, like government administrators, bankers, businessmen and political '~ _ leaders. He reveals, from his knowledge of black African genealogy, that many black presidents who came to power after 'independence' from the white Europeans have been the same royal bloodlines Jas the kings and queens of black Africa. He cited Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe as an example - the same Robert Mugabe who was manipulated into power by the Illuminati's Henry Kissinger and British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, as explained in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Mugabe has brought poverty, hunger and chaos to black and White alike in a country that should be one of the richest in Africa."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 150 At the same time he has made himself a billionaire by 'winning' rigged elections and stealing the people's wealth. This is typical of the bloodline's behaviour. Recurring story In the late nineteenth century, Colonel James Churchward, an ardent researcher into the existence of Mu or Lemuria, says he was shown some ancient tablets in the secret vault of a monastery in northern India. They told the. story of how the Naacals or Naga Mayas (\"serpents\") from the continent of Lemuria-Mu had travelled to India via Burma to establish a colony there. Churchward put the texts together in years of painstaking work and revealed how they described the destruction of Mu, the Motherland, and how the Naga Mayas or Nagas had travelled to India.59 The Vedic scholar David Frawley explains how the ancient indu holy books, the Vedas, reveal that the earliest royal bloodlines of India, the priest-kings, descend from the Bhrigus who arrived from a place across the sea. The Bhrigus were an order of adepts initiated into the ancient knowledge. Frawley says in his book, Gods, Sages, And Kings: Vedic Secrets Of Ancient Civilization,60 that the monarchs of these bloodlines included the \"Serpent King\" Nahusha. They expanded into the five tribes that populated a large part of the Indian population James Churchward wrote a number of books on the civilisation of Mu and he says the Nagas also populated China, Tibet and parts of Asia. The Naga Maya people, with their mother goddess religion, were also the origin of the Maya people of Mexico. Researcher Michael Mott writes in Caverns, Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures: \"The Nagas are described as a very advanced race or species, with a highly-developed technology. They also harbor a disdain for human beings, whom they are said to abduct, torture, interbreed with, and even to eat. The interbreeding has supposedly led to a wide variety of forms, ranging from completely reptilian to nearly-human in appearance. Among their many devices are 'death rays' and 'vimana', or flying, disk-shaped aerial craft. These craft are described at length in many ancient Vedic texts, including the Bhagavad-Gita and the Ramayana. The Naga race is related to another underworld race, the Hindu demons, or Rakshasas. They also possess, as individuals, 'magical stones', or a 'third eye' in the middle of their brows, known to many students of eastern mysticism today as a focal point for one of the higher chakras, or energy channel-points, of the human(oid) nervous system - the chakra associated with 'inner visions', intuition, and other esoteric concepts.\" 62 For Nagas and Chitauri, read Anunnaki. Different names, same origins. The dragon kings and queens The theme of ruling 'royal' families and emperors who claim descent and their right to rule from the \"serpent gods\", can be found across the ancient world. These bloodlines and connections were symbolised by royal emblems in the form of a dragon, snake, sphinx, plumed serpent or the tree-cross or Ankh. In Egypt they had an order called the Djedhi (Jedi?) and the Dj meant serpent.63 Thus we have pharaohs of the serpent line called Djer, Djoser and Djederfra. The Royal Court of the Dragon was established in Egypt in 2170 BC under Ankhfnkhonsu, and more formally by Queen Sobeknefru in 1783 BC, to provide an institution for the pursuit of the work of the Dragon of al-Khem who is best known as Thoth or Hermes.64 From al-Khem we get alchemy, the 'Great Work' of the Dragon. Note that the date of 1783 BC was around the period when the Hyksos appeared in Egyptian history. The most famous books attributed to Thoth are The Emerald Tablets and The Pymander. The Emerald Tablets of Thoth talk about reptiles, specifically shapeshifters, who seek to control the world, as we shall see later. I have mentioned the way that crocodile fat, or messeh, was used in the coronation of pharaohs and this became part of Celtic mythology also. The image of Messeh evolved to become a Dragon, the emblem of kingship.65 Messeh, the holy crocodile, evolved into what we know as Sobek in Egypt, the crocodile god, who was Suchos in Greek.66 The Royal Court of the Dragon continues to this day and is promoted by Sir Laurence Gardner, the author of a number of books about the 'royal bloodline', which, he says, is the bloodline of Jesus. He calls it the \"dragon bloodline\" .. In India, the Buddhist text, the Mahauyutpatti, lists 80 kings who descended from the Nagas or \"Serpent Kings\". Hindu legend says that the Nagas could take a human or reptilian form at will, what is called shape-shifting. This is also a trait of the Chitauri according to Credo Mutwa and I shall detail shortly some of the many experiences people have had in the modern world of this phenomena. The serpent 'sea' or 'fish' gods of Sumer and Babylon were said to be able to change shape and look human whenever they chose. Shape-shifting is a common theme. Across India the rulers claimed power because they descended from the Nagas, who were described as offspring from the interbreeding of humans with the serpent gods. Accounts in the Indian epics also refer to how the reptilian Nagas intermingled with the white peoples and although their relationship was often one of conflict and distrust, the two interbred, the epics report, to produce a reptilian-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 151 mammal hybrid that became ... the Aryan kings. These serpent bloodlines became the 'Divine' royal bloodlines or 'demi-gods'. The Chinese emperors were the same. They were known as Lung or Dragons and many of the earliest emperors were depicted with reptilian features, very much like the Nagas. They were described as part human, part serpent. One of them, called Huang Ti, was said to have been born with a \"dragon-like countenance\". It was claimed that he was conceived by a ray of golden light that entered his .. mother's womb from the Big Dipper constellation.6b The Big Dipper includes the star Alpha Draconis, the star of the Egyptian god, Set. Alpha Draconis is an alleged home of the reptilian 'royalty', the elite leadership, known as the \"Draco\". One Chinese legend says that when he died Huang Ti transformed into an etheric dragon and flew to the realm of the immortals. In Media, now Turkey, the Iranians knew their kings as Mar, which means snake in Persian. They were called the \"Dragon Dynasty of Media\" or \"descendants of the dragon\". The earliest of the royal bloodlines of Central America claimed genetic descent from the serpent gods, Quetzalcoatl and Itzamna. The priest kings of the Peruvian Incas were symbolised by the snake and they wore bracelets and anklets in the image of a snake. In the Mycenaean age in Greece, the kings were, in the words of author Jane Harrison, \"regarded as being in some sense a snake\".69 Cecrops, the first Mycenaean king of Athens, was depicted as a human with a serpent tail. Another, Erectheus, who founded the Eleusinian Mystery School, was worshipped as a live snake after his death and, according to legend, King Kadmus shape-shifted ,into a live snake when he died.70 The Sumerian accounts tell of flying serpents and dragons breathing fire (symbolic of their aerial craft?) and how the kings of Sumer, going back long before the deluge to some 240,000 BC, were \"changelings\" seeded by the union of the gods and humans. Sargon the Great, that famous ruler of the Sumer / Akkadian Empire, claimed this genetic origin. The very existence of \"kingship\" is reported in the Sumerian Tablets to have been a gift of these gods. Equally clear is that they were reptilian gods with the many references by the Sumerians to their gods as fiery, winged serpents. The ancient world abounds with stories of the serpent or dragon race and royal kings, queens and emperors who claim their right to rule through their descent from the serpent gods. The kings of the succession in the reptilian bloodlines were known as \"Dragons\". When many kingdoms joined together in battle, or as a group of kingdoms, they appointed a king of kings. These were known as the Great Dragon or ... Draco. I found direct references to this theme in the Indian (formerly Indus Valley) works, like the Book of Dzyan, one of the oldest of Sanskrit accounts, and the epics, Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Book of Dzyan tells of how a reptilian race it calls the Sarpa or Great Dragons carne from the skies to bring civilisation to the world. A deluge, the Biblical Great Flood, ended the Golden Age, it says, but the serpent gods survived and returned to rule. They are described symbolically as having the face of a human, but the tail of a dragon.71 Their leader was called the Great Dragon and the Illuminati's Ku Klux Klan, created by that infamous Freemasonic 'god' in America, Albert Pike, still uses the term Grand Dragon today. The Celtic title of Pend ragon, as in Uther Pendragon, the father of \"King Arthur\" in the Grail stories, was also a version of this. Pendragon = \"Great Dragon\". In the legends, the symbolic Arthur was a descendant of the dragons and his helmet carried a dragon motif. The red dragon symbol of Wales comes from the claim by Merlin, Arthur's \"magician\", that the red dragon symbolised the people of Britain. Merlin was described as only half human because he was the child of an underground being and a human woman. The Arthurian stories include all the classic elements of the theme, including the creation of royal bloodlines through the interbreeding between humans and non-human entities, shape-shifting, the use of holographic images to hide a being's true form and battles between competing dragons. Geoffrey of Monmouth, the twelfth century historian, said that Merlin's earlier name had been \"Ambrosius\", thus possibly associating him with the Greek term for menstrual blood, Ambrosia, which the Reptilians love to drink.72 There is also the theme of the \"Lady of the Lake\" and this connects with the stories of goddess-worshipping serpent peoples like the Nagas living in underground centres located under lakes and lochs. Like the Celtic myth and folklore, the ancient Greek culture was inspired by the Sumerians and Egyptians and the earlier Atlanteans and Lemurians and was based almost entirely on their stories and myths under different names. Throughout the Sumer Empire the people worshipped serpent gods and as the Reverend John Bathhurst Deane wrote in his book, The Worship of the Serpent: \" ... One of [the] five builders of Thebes [in Egypt] was named after the serpent-god of the Phoenicians, Of hi on ... The firSt altar erected to Cyclops at Athens was to 'Ops', the serpent deity ... The symbolic worship of the serpent was so common in Greece that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of all their gods.\" 73 The Merovingian bloodline One of the key human-reptilian 'royal' bloodlines later became known as the Merovingians, who were known as sorcerers or \"priest kings\", just as the pharaohs were in Egypt. The Merovingians were the royal line of a people known as the Sicambrian Franks. Francio, who gave his name to the Franks and died in 11"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 152 BC, claimed to be a descendent of Noah (Sumer). The Franks called themselves Newmage or \"the People of the Covenant\". The Egyptians also believed they were the chosen people and had a covenant with God, a theme transposed by post-Babylonian Levite scribes to the Egyptian 'Israelites'. But for 'God' read reptilian 'gods'. The Merovingians/Franks can also trace their bloodline from ancient Troy and the Trojan Wars, up through the Caucasus Mountains into what is now France, a land to which they gave their name. Once again the Caucasus, this bloodline melting pot, was involved. At one time the Sicambrian Franks settled in an area west of the Danube and were known as the Scythians, whom the Romans called \"the genuine ones\". Figure 31: The state seal of Utah dominated by the beehive. the ancient symbol of the Merovingian bloodline that created the Mormon 'Church' Legend says that Merovee, the founder of the Merovingians, who died in 458 AD, was seeded by a reptile and this bloodline is related to every royal family in Europe and a stream of others in positions of influence and control. The founding names of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were both Merovingian bloodline and that's why the Mormon-controlled state of Utah has a beehive at the centre of its seal (Figure 31). The bee or beehive is an ancient symbol of the Merovingian bloodline, as is the fleur-de-lis, so beloved of British Merovingian royalty. The hive is the symbol of the queen bee, the Illuminati reptilian goddess at the heart of their symbolism, and it also relates to the 'hive' mentality of the Reptilians that they have been seeking to transfer to humans. The Greek deity Zeus was depicted as an eagle (phoenix?) and a serpent to whom offerings of honey were made and this is a possible connection to the Merovingian bee symbol.74 The themes of the serpent and honey can be linked to the 'Tribe of Dan', which is claimed to be one of the ten lost tribes of Israel. But are they really lost or did they never exist in the form portrayed by Levite 'history'? The Tribe of Dan also used the symbols of the serpent and the eagle and I have written about them at some length in The Biggest Secret. I do not believe they are the Israelites of the Bible. Genesis says that the Danites did not have a known genealogy and were not related to the early Israelites.75 They were a sea-faring people (the Danuna or Denyen to the Egyptians) and many settled in northern Europe. The names of Denmark (Danmark), the River Danube and Ireland's Tuatha de Danann or \"People of the Goddess Danu\", would seem to be expressions of the Danites and this is one reason why there is such a North African influence in Irish history. The Egypt-Sumer-connected Phoenicians made the same sea journeys as the Danites and they were almost certainly the same people. The Danite colours were red and white, just like the Phoenicians, and these are the colours of the Knights Templar that has its famous red cross on the white background displayed as the flag of England or the Flag of St George. This is a Phoenician deity called George of Cappadocia in what is now Turkey, the same country as Troy. Another strand of the Oanite-Phoenicians became the Merovingians and, it is suggested by some researchers, the Khazars in the Caucasus. The works of the Greek poet, Homer, who lived around the 9th or 8th century BC, are the main source of information about ancient Troy and the conflicts that led to its demise. The two epics the Iliad and the Odyssey are ascribed to him and modern archaeological discoveries have confirmed the accuracy of Homer's work. According to the Iliad, the founder of Troy was named Dardanus, who was said to be the son of the god Zeus. Not surprisingly then that the symbols of Zeus and the Danites, the serpent, eagle and bees are the same. Dardanus had a son named Erichthonius and his son was named Tros, who gave his name to the Trojans and their capital city, Troy, from whom the bee-symboled Merovingians claim descent. (Trois is the French word for \"three\" and"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 153 this is an extremely important number to the Illuminati, as in the Babylonian Trinity, and this is symbolised in the three-pointed fleur-de-lis, a symbol of the Merovingian bloodline and, therefore, the British royal family). Tros had a son called Assaracus and a prince of the royal house of Assaracus is credited with founding the Roman Empire. His name was Aeneas and we will see shortly that this guy is massively important to the Illuminati bloodline. The Merovingians are associated with Arcadia in Greece, home of the Spartans, one of the protagonists in the Trojan Wars. Some Spartans migrated to Troy (in today's Turkey) and up into France, settling in the province of Lorraine. This is a long time major centre for the Illuminati Reptilian bloodlines. In the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees, a letter from Areus, King of Sparta, tells a Jewish High Priest that the Spartans are\" ... of the race of Abraham\".76 In other words - Egyptian/Sumarian. The Spartan king's letter said that his symbol was an eagle holding a dragon in its claws/7 Here we go again. Fritz Springmeier, a long-time researcher of the Illuminati bloodlines, refers to the Merovingians as the \"13th bloodline\" because it weaves its DNA through the other 12 major families.78 It also most appropriate that the accounts of the Merovingian connected Trojan Wars involve the story of the 'Trojan Horse' and you could not have better symbolism of the way the bloodlines infiltrate their target societies. The Merovingians were supposed to have died out long ago, but in reality only the name disappeared, until recently, and not the bloodline. The genetics continued with the King of the Franks called Charles, more famously known as Charlemagne, to whom 34 of the 43 US presidents and so many other key figures are related. He vastly extended the Frankish domains and ruled as Emperor of the West in the papal empire created and controlled by the bloodlines descending from the Roman Empire. These in turn, descended from the royal lines of the Sumer Empire, Babylon and Egypt, who descended from the Atlanteans, Lemurians and the hybrid interbreeding programmes. Charlemagne was a contemporary of the Khazars. The Priory of Sion (\"Tsion\" in Hebrew means mountain or desert monument - Zion) claims to be an elite secret society created in the twelfth century to serve the Merovingian bloodline or \"Le Serpent Rouge\" (the serpent blood). It says it was very closely connected to the Knights Templar who were officially formed at the French city of Troyes, named by the Sicambrian Franks (Merovingians) after their former home in Troy. Prince Paris from the Trojan Wars stories also inspired the name of the French capital city. Another of the key figures in Illuminati genealogy is Alexander the Great, an ancestor of Charlemagne and all the major Illuminati families today. Alexander descended from the Viking peoples who settled the Mediterranean and the Aegean after the cataclysms and may well have become the white peoples of the region, including the Danites. Alexander ruled Troy at one stage and, before he died in Babylon in 323 BC at the age of 33, his army had seized control of an enormous region once ruled from Sumer. This included Egypt, Mesopotamia and into India. He founded the city of Alexandria in Egypt and, as he was known as the \"Serpent's Son\", Alexandria became the \"City of the Serpent's Son\".79 Once again we see the recurring theme. The legend goes that Alexannr's real father was the serpent god, Ammon, and this mirrors the story of Merovee, founder of the Merovingian dynasty, of whom a similar origin is given. The Merovingians have been linked with the bloodline of 'Jesus' by a number of books, not least those by Royal Court of the Dragon promoter, Sir Laurence Gardner. But the 'Jesus' connection isn't necessary to make the link between the \"dragon bloodlines\" of Egypt and Sumer and the Memvingians because they were transported to the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor /Turkey and elsewhere long before the era associated with 'Jesus'. The Illuminati are not going to have only one strand of the bloodline that is so important to them. The 'Jesus' bloodline is only code for the Babylonian/Serpent bloodline, anyway. Throughout history, the Reptilians have perpetuated their 'purest' bloodlines by marrying as closely as possible to their own genetics and through the secret breeding programmes. It is important to remember that these bloodlines do not just breed through their official partners. They have stunning numbers of children out of wedlock. These offspring are then brought up with names that are different to the major Illuminati families like Rockefeller and Rothschild. So when one of these children, called Clinton, Roosevelt or whoever, enters a position of power, the people do not relate them to the elite families because they have a different name. But, and I can't emphasise this enough, they are the same bloodline. This is how they hide the tribe, the reptilian genetic network. Insider confirmation Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, who now lives in America, claims to be an unofficial offspring of Philippe de Rothschild of the French Rothschilds, and worked within the Illuminati Satanic network for most of his life. Phillip told me that the key 'Nefilim' bloodline is connected to that figure called Aeneas, the alleged inspiration of the Roman Empire through his descendants, Romulus and Remus. The latter are code names for the bloodline and not real people and that may be the same with Aeneas. The legends of Aeneas fit with the codes and themes of the Illuminati bloodlines, including his association with Troy. Aeneas is said to have been born in Troy, the city sacred to the Merovingians and the Knights Templar. In the Hymn to Aphrodite, the goddess proclaims that Aeneas, the son she has conceived by the mortal Anchises, will come"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 154 to rule the Trojans, as will the generations upon generations that succeed him.80 In Homer's Iliad, Aeneas recounts his birth and ancestry to his opponent Achilles on the battlefield at Troy. Aeneas says that he descends from \"Divine and immortal stock\" through both his mother and his father. This connection between Divine immortality and the Anunnaki under their various names constantly recurs in ancient accounts. Aeneas says that his mother is the goddess, Aphrodite, and his father is Anchises, and he can trace his lineage back to Dardanus, the son of Zeus and legendary founder of the Trojan race. Aeneas is endowed in the Iliad with a close relationship with the gods. The legends of Aeneas are peppered with references and codes about his genealogical connection to the 'gods' and it is no surprise that he plays such an important part in the codes and symbolism of the Illuminati bloodlines today .Phillip Eugene de Rothschild told me that this' Aeneas' bloodline became what he called the \"Rothsburg dynasty\" - the union of the Bauer-Rothschilds (same family, different name) and the Battenbergs. This is the Merovingian bloodline and also the line of the Habsburgs, the leading family in the Holy Roman Empire for hundreds of years that again uses the symbol of the eagle, which follows the bloodline. The Greeks, Romans, Germans, French, Czarist Russia, the United States and many more have all displayed the symbol of the eagle/phoenix. The Habsburg's Holy Roman Empire was the medieval state that embraced most of central Europe and Italy from 962 to 1806. Phillip Eugene says that this \"Rothsburg\" bloodline is known within the Illuminati as the \"Gens\". This is a Latin word meaning \"race\", \"tribe\" or \"male line of descent\" and comes from the term gignere - \"to beget\". The late Lord Louis Mountbatten, a famous member of the British royal family, and his nephew, Prince Philip, are Battenbergs. It was Lord Mountbatten who arranged the marriage between Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II, after which the royal line of the UK became known as Windsor-Mountbatten. Both the Windsors and the Mountbattens are German bloodlines formerly known as the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Battenbergs. They anglicised their names during the First World War against Germany for public relations reasons, but both of these 'fc1milies' supported the Nazis, and Prince Philip was sent to a school in Germany run by the Nazi youth programme (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). Phillip Eugene, the Rothschild offspring, says of this' Aeneas' bloodline: \"Apparently Aeneas embodies all the various bloodlines that must trace their lineage back through Charlemagne because in him is embodied the confluence of the lineage of both David (Jewish[Egyptian]) and Alexander the Great (Aryan). It is the modern day representatives of these Roman 'Gens' or European monarchs that make up the ruling 'aristocracy' of the revived Roman Empire. These 'royal' families maintain their pedigree through endogamy (inter-familial marriages). The first prototype of the Antichrist [the purest bloodline] was Nimrod, founder of Babylon. The historical and seminal nexus of this last Roman Empire is Charlemagne and his descendants, people like [Prince] Philip Mountbatten (Rex Julius Alexander Battenberg) who is one of the ruling heads of the Julian Gens.\" 81 Dracula = Draco As I have detailed in other books, the Illuminati bloodlines are seriously into human sacrifice and blood drinking ritual and have been throughout their existence. They perform the same rituals today as they did in Babylon, their ancient headquarters after the demise of Sumer, although I think there was a much earlier version of Babylon, also. The story of Dracula originates from this theme. It was written by the Irish author Bram Stoker and published in 1897. Stoker probably knew the score after years of research into the countless vampire legends. As a History Channel documentary about Stoker confirmed, there is no part of the world and no era of history that does not have its myths and legends about vampires who feed off other people's energy and blood. Dracula contains all the familiar themes. His name is Dracula (the Draco are claimed to be the 'royal' reptilian bloodlines); he is called \"Count\" Dracula (symbolic of the way these Draco bloodlines have been carried by 'human' royalty and aristocracy); he 'shape-shifts' (like the Reptilians) and he is a vampire (symbolic of the need of the Draco Reptilians to drink human blood and feed off human energy, as I shall detail shortly). Many famous writers and artists were initiates or dogged researchers who told elements of the story through art and 'fiction'. Stoker's character was largely based on a man called Dracula or Vlad the Impaler, the fifteenth century ruler of a country called Wallachia, not far from the Black Sea in what is now Romania (Rom = Reptilian bloodlines). This region was once called Transylvania, the home of the most famous vampire legends. The Danube River valley, which runs from Germany to Romania and into the Black Sea, comes up very often in the history of the bloodlines. These were once the lands of the Khazars and so many strands of the Illuminati bloodlines have passed through here, including the Merovingians. Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, slaughtered tens of thousands of people and impaled many of them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this forest of dead bodies, dipping his bread in their blood. He usually had a Borse attached to each of the victim's legs and a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The end of the stake was oiled and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; he didn't want the victim dying"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 155 too quickly from shock. Infants were often impaled on the stake forced through their mothers' chests. The records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake. Death by impalement was slow and painful. Victims sometimes endured for hours or days. Dracula had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns and the most common was a ring of concentric circles. The height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim, an excellent indication of the ritual-obsessed Reptilian mind. The decaying corpses were often left there for months. It was once reported that an invading Turkish army turned back in fright when it encountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danube. In 1461, Mohammed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, a man not noted for his squeamishness, was sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses rotting outside of Dracula's capital of Tirgoviste. The warrior sultan turned over command of the campaign against Dracula to subordinates and returned to Constantinople. Ten thousand were impaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, where Dracula had once lived. On St Bartholomew's Day, 1459, Dracula had thirty thousand merchants and others impaled in the Transylvanian city of Brasov. One of the most famous woodcuts of the period shows Dracula feasting amongst a forest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside Brasov while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims. Impalement was Dracula's favourite technique, but by no means his only method of inflicting unimaginable horror. The list of tortures employed by this deeply sick man included nails in heads, cutting off limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, cutting off noses and ears, mutilation of sexual organs (especially in the case of women), scalping, skinning, exposure to the elements or wild animals, and boiling alive. No one was immune to Dracula's attentions. His victims included women and children, peasants and great lords, ambassadors from foreign powers and merchants. Vlad the Impaler was the son of Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into the ancient Order of the Dragon by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1431. Its emblem was a dragon, wings extended, hanging on a cross. Father Vlad wore this emblem and his coinage bore the dragon symbol. All the members of the order had a dragon on their coat of arms and he was nicknamed Dracul (the Devil or the Dragon). Son Vlad signed his name Draculea or Draculya or the \"Devil's Son\" and this later became Dracula, a name that translates as something like \"Son of Him who had the Order of the Dragon\". Most appropriate. The ancient Order of the Dragon began in Egypt and expanded through the period of the Hyksos kings whose symbol was the snake. This is the same Dragon Order that is today promoted by the British 'Holy Grail' author, Sir Laurence Gardner. By the way, Queen Mary or Mary of Teck, the mother of King George VI and therefore grandmother to the present Elizabeth II, was descended from a sister of \"Dracula\". These are the bloodlines and the mentality that seek to conquer the world today. That's why they have no compassion or empathy with the suffering, death and destruction they cause. Thinking reptilian Against this background of the reptilian connection, if you study the reptilian mind you can understand both the behaviour of the Illuminati across the centuries and the global society they are creating. They have distinct character traits and they are, seeking to make humans the same. The most ancient part of the human brain is known by scientists as the R-complex or \"reptilian brain\" (Figure 32). It is the most obvious remnant of our reptilian genetic history. Most people have no idea of the reptilian heritage of the human body and its influence on our behaviour. Scientists say that the reptilian brain represents a core of the nervous system, and look at the character traits of the reptilian brain as agreed by scientists. I quote here from an Internet article by Skip Largent: \"At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain. Without defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things; ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious, cultural, and other matters and all manner of deceptions.\" 82 Add to that the other traits of the reptilian brain such as cold blooded behaviour with no empathy with the victims of your actions; 'territoriality' - controlling the world around you; an obsession with hierarchical structures of rule and control; aggression; and the idea that might is right, winner takes all. What you have in those character traits of the reptilian brain are the very characteristics displayed by the Illuminati and their agents for thousands of years. You could not describe them better. Racism comes from the reptilian brain and the aggressive, violent sex that the Illuminati bloodlines indulge in big time - ask Father Bush, Cheney, President Gerald Ford and other Illuminati names I expose in my books. Can it really be a coincidence that the Illuminati manifest the classic traits of the reptilian brain- while, at the same time, the evidence mounts that they are reptilian bloodlines? Cosmologist Carl Sagan, who knew far more than he"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 156 was telling, wrote a book called Tile Dragons of Eden 83 to highlight the reptilian influences on humanity. He said: \"It does no good whatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature, particularly our ritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the model may help us understand what human beings are really about.\" Other areas of the human brain balance the extremes of the reptilian characteristics in most people, but they can still be seen, for instance, in those who live their lives as a daily ritual repeating the same cycles over and over week after week. The Illuminati have sought to turn society into a clockwatching, ever- repeating cycle, because that locks the people into their reptilian level of perception and further activates the reptilian brain. Those with the most dominant reptilian genetics, the Illuminati, obviously express more of the characteristics associated with the reptilian brain and this is why the Illuminati are utterly obsessed with ritual. Figure 32: The oldest part of the human brain is known as the R-complex or reptilian brain. From 'here we get the character traits of cold-blooded behaviour, a desire for top-down structures of control, and an obsession with ritual. The more reptilian we are in nature, the more these traits will dominate"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 157 Global conquest With typical synchronicity since the mound in Peru, I received a book through the mail in the last few days before this manuscript was completed. This chapter was already finished. The book was called Blue Blood, True Blood 84 and contained information about the reptilian bloodline that matched so much of my own research and my own feelings about what is going on. Once again, I don't necessarily agree with everything in the book, but in theme it matches my own view very closely. The author is Stewart Swerdlow who says he was one of the few survivors of the Illuminati mind control and genetics programmes at Montauk on Long Island, New York. As a youngster Stewart was kidnapped at night by what he thought were extraterrestrials and taken to Montauk. He later learned that his kidnappers were military officials posing as ETs - this has been a common ruse to hide the truth of who is doing the abducting. He was forced into the Montauk genetic experiment program and he found out much later that he was among only one per cent who got out alive. During his years under Illuminati control, Stewart says that he learned about the agenda for global control and the non-human entities behind it all. These entities, he writes, are reptilian. He says he saw reptilian beings at Montauk and they \"seemed to pop in and out of physical reality\".85 The following is a summary of what Stewart says he learned during the Montauk years and in his research and experiences since then. Many and various extraterrestrial groups have come to this planet and seeded the different races. Atlantis was dominated by a white or Caucasian people called the Atlans. They were from the star system known as Lyrae or Lyra while a reptilian race located on Mu or Lemuria in the Pacific. The original Lyrians were not physical as we understand that word, but they became trapped in this dimension and their vibrations became ever denser. They had blond hair and blue eyes with the occasional red hair and green eyes. Credo Mutwa told me about a tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed, extraterrestrial that Africans called the Mzungu. He said that when the white Europeans first arrived in South Africa the tribes people thought they were the returning Mzungu and called them by that name. You can see Credos painting of the Mzungu in Figure 33. The Reptilians, Swerdlow says, were created by those he calls the \"transparent people\" who \"cannot really enter into the physical dimensions because their energy vibratory rate is so high that it cannot sustain a physical body\". When they appear, he says, \"It looks like a transparent glass shell.\" 86 At first, the Reptilians were \"borderline physical\" and to function here they needed a physical form. This was achieved by mixing reptilian genes with those of the Lyrians. This is why, as we shall see, the Reptilians are so obsessed with blond and blue-eyed people - they need their genetics to operate in this reality. There you have the reason why the deeply reptilian Windsors wanted the genes of blonde-haired, blue-eyed Princess Diana and discarded her once they had them. Prince William is blond-haired and blue-eyed while Prince Harry has red hair. The Windsor line had become so Reptilian with its interbreeding that it needed a massive infusion of 'Lyrian' genes to maintain an apparently human form. The Reptilians were located in the Draco star system (hence \"Dracula\", Vlad Dracul and the word\" draconian\") and they began to expand across the galaxy by the sort of conquests we are experiencing on this planet. Stewart Swerdlow says they have been assisted in this by a race from Sirius, the brightest star seen from Earth. The Reptilians are programmed to believe they are the superior form and believe themselves more \"God-like\" because they are androgynous. They have a programmed .~mentality that wants to conquer everything. The British and Roman Empires are examples of this at work. The fusing of Reptilian genes with those of the Lyrians and others is why humans have so much reptilian DNA, Swerdlow says, and why foetuses go through reptilian-type development in the womb on their way to becoming 'human'.51 The Reptilian-Lyrian hybrids were designed to be 'tuned' to the Reptilian frequencies and could, therefore, be controlled by them. They wanted a 50-50 mix of genetics because that would produce a body that looked human while being able to shape-shift into Reptilian. \"Shape-shifting was accomplished simply by concentrating on the genetics the hybrid wished to open, or lock up, whatever the case may be\", writes Swerdlow.88 This makes sense of why Phillip Eugene de Rothschild said that the importance of Charlemagne to the Illuminati (34 of the 43 American presidents go back to him) was that he embodied the mixture of the bloodline of 'King David' (Egyptian/Hyksos/Reptilian) and Alexander the Great (\"Aryan\"). When the genetic domination is too far to the Reptilian side it becomes impossible to hold human form and in these cases they consume human hormones, flesh and blood to compensate. Human sacrifice and blood drinking rituals have followed the bloodlines everywhere and this is why. Swerdlow says that the domesticated pig was developed for this purpose and thus it is so close to human genetics. He also explains why royalty became known as the \"Bluebloods\": \"Their blood, because of the increased Reptilian DNA, contained more of a copper content. Since copper-based blood turns blue-green upon oxidizing, these Reptilian hybrids were called 'Bluebloods'.\" 89 "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 158 Figure 33: A blond-haired. blue-eyed \"Mzungu' painted by Credo Mutwa. They look very much like the 'Lyrians' that Stewart Swerdlow describes When Mu/Lemuria was destroyed, the survivors relocated to Northern India and inside the Earth where they built a massive underground civilisation. I will present evidence of this later. They also re-launched their genetic takeover and the location they chose, says Swerdlow, was ... Sumer. He says the Sumerians became known as the Sum-Aryans or simply Aryans and they expanded into North Africa, Central Asia, Northern India and the Steppes of Russia. \"The Aryan leaders, all Bluebloods, became the Sultans and Rajas of legend\", writes Swerdlow.90 He says that when the Aryans mixed with the Dravidians (formerly from Lemuria) in India, they created the Hindu religion. \"The caste system of India is a direct copy of the Reptilian division of function\".91 Once again the importance of the Caucasus is confirmed: \" .. . [the Aryans] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains and [later] became the Khazars. From here, they spread west towards Europe, seeding the national identities for the Vikings, the Franks, the Teutonic peoples and the Russians. Keep in mind that when Atlantis sank, some of those refugees went to western Europe and developed into the Celts. Some went to Greece and others to the Italian Peninsula. These peoples were here before the hybrids moved in ... These Blueblood leaders also infiltrated the Middle Eastern peoples, such as the Biblical Canaanites, Malachites and Kittites.\" 92 So what did happen in Egypt? This brings us to Egypt and what really happened with the Hyksos story. Swerdlow says, quite rightly, that the Egyptians also became known as the Phoenicians and were descendents of Atlantis. This was also the Tribe of Dan, I would suggest. As 'Lyrians', they were blonde-haired and blue-eyed with some that were green-eyed and red-haired. These were the people who located in the British Isles and the Americas as archaeological evidence and other finds have shown (see The Biggest Secret). The Sumer-Aryans infiltrated Egyptian society and implanted their Reptilian bloodline into the royal fan1'ilies of the pharaohs. So it is quite correct, at least symbolically, that\" Abraham\" is said to have come from the Sumer region that is now Iraq. At the same time it could also be correct, as Ralph Ellis says, that the Hyksos \"Shepherd Kings\" or \"Leaders of Foreign Lands\" were already in Egypt and did not invade. The Sumer infiltration began before the Hyksos period and it could well be that the time of royal and religious conflict was actually the battle for supremacy by the Reptilian Bluebloods in royal and religious affairs. The Hyksos symbol was the snake and their colour was red - highly significant in Reptilian ritual. Remember, their kings wore the Red Crown. The Egyptian ceremonial title of Moche means, \"He who is anointed with crocodile fat from the Nile River\".93 Swerdlow says the term \"Sun God\" was a Reptilian symbol and so was the lion. Both abound in ancient Egypt, as they do in the Reptilian religions and royal families to this day. The Royal Court of the Dragon (also known as The Brotherhood of the Snake) was formed in Egypt to infiltrate the royal and religious centres of power. Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian, summarises what happened in Egypt, although for \"black magicians of Atlantis\" read \"Reptilians\" who also infiltrated Atlantis: \"While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil, there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or black magic, [in Egypt] ... the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the morals of the primitive Mysteries ... they usurped the position formerly occupied by the initiates, and seized the reigns of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 159 spiritual government. \"Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual ~~d spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and unhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priest craft. The Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council - a committee of arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.\" 94 Note \"Scarlet Council\". This is what happened wherever the Blueblood Reptilians located. Babylon was a prime Reptilian centre, as I have been stressing all these years. It was the place where the Reptilian bloodlines organised the Blueblood blueprint for global conquest, not least through manufactured religions. Swerdlow writes: \"Babylon was the civilization that Sumer developed into as it expanded into Central Asia to become the Khazars. In fact, many of the Blueblood organisations that developed through the millennia called themselves Babylon Brotherhoods. [They] later combined with the secret Atlantean-Egyptian schools in Europe to become the Freemasons. Some of these immigrants went by the name of Bauer, now known as the Rothschilds. The family quickly took control of the financial and trade foundations of Europe.\" 95 Babylon's modern expression is London and this is referred to by some researchers as Babylon-don. The Babylon god and goddess, Nimrod and Semiramis, were depicted as half-human, half-reptile, and to enter that Illuminati stronghold, the financial district called the City of London, you pass flying reptiles on both sides of the street. The City's emblem is two flying reptiles holding the Phoenician/Knights Templar symbol of the red cross on the white background (Figures 34 and 35, overleaf). This is symbolic of the mixed Reptilian/Sum-Aryan genetics with the Reptilians in control. The British royal crest is a lion and a unicorn (Reptilian and Sum-Aryan) with the unicorn's horn representing the penis. It symbolises the two genetics that come together to create the royal bloodline represented by the shield. The Reptilian control is emphasised by the unicorn always being tethered (see Figure 36). The crest of the Rothschild family is virtually identical (Figure 37) and you can see a similar theme with the logo of the truly appalling Christian television network in the United States called Trinity Broadcasting, which also includes the symbol of the dove - Babylon's Queen Semiramis (Figure 38). It is the same as the beliefs of the Reptilian Nazis, who considered the Sum-Aryans to be the \"Master Race\". Where the City of London meets the area called Temple Bar, named after the Knights Templar, there is another flying reptile in the centre of the road (Figure 39). Temple Bar is the headquarters of the global legal profession and this area, together with the City of London, has more elite secret societies per square mile than almost anywhere else on Earth. Stewart Swerdlow says that the Reptilians also developed hybrid bloodlines with a race from Rigel in the Orion system that became the royal bloodlines of China and Japan and this is another reason why the Caucasus and Eastern Europe are so significant. It was into this region that the 'Golden Horde' and others carne from the Far East to interbreed with the Sumer Reptilian 'royal' bloodlines to create a very important genetics from the Reptilian point of view. Since those ancient\" times, the bloodlines and the Illuminati secret society network through which they manipulate have worked to place their operatives into the positions of power over the population. As they expanded across the world, they used the same techniques of manipulation everywhere to increase their power over the people and now they are seeking to complete their long-term goal- global control. These are the bloodlines behind the World Wars; September 11th and the 'war on terrorism'; and all the needless suffering, conflict and depravation that we see across the world. It doesn't have to be like this. It is just that the Reptilians want it to be.

As usual since the mound in Peru, this theme appeared suddenly and I began to walk into a mass of information about the same subject. This has happened so many times. In a period of about 15 days in 1998 I met 12 separate people in different,_ locations around the United States, from very contrasting backgrounds, who told me the same basic story of seeing a 'human' change or 'shape-shift' into a reptilian form before their eyes. Among them were two television interviewers who saw their guest, a supporter of the New World Order agenda, shape-shift from 'human' to reptilian. Afterwards one said he had been shocked to see the man's face turn reptilian and the other, equally shocked, said that she had seen his hands take on a reptilian appearance. A friend of one of the presenters was a policeman in Denver, Colorado, a major Illuminati and Satanic centre, where reptilian gargoyles (an Illuminati code) and Freemasonic imagery adorn the Denver Airport. The policeman had made a routine visit to an office block in Aurora, near Denver, and commented to an executive of one of the companies there about the high level of security in the building. She said that he should look at the upper floors if he wanted to see some real security. She pointed to a lift that only went to the higher floors and she told him of an astonishing experience she had some weeks earlier. The lift had opened and a strange figure emerged. He was albino-white with a face shaped like a lizard and eyes with pupils that were vertical like a reptile's. I was to hear many such descriptions in the months ahead. This white lizard figure had walked out of the restricted lift, she said, and into an official-looking car. The policeman was so intrigued by the story and the building that he made investigations into the companies in the upper floors. According to his friend, he said he found them all to be fronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Another man I met in that 15 days used to take large quantities of LSD in the 1960s and around the third day of a five-day 'trip', as he put it, the same thing always happened: some people began to look like reptiles and it was always the same people. It never changed. He also began to observe that his friends who appeared lizard-like in his 'trips' seemed to react the same way to movies, television programmes and so on. \"We used to laugh and say 'here come the lizards\"', he told me. Drugs take people into altered states of consciousness and this can cause them to 'retune' their dial to other frequencies of existence. At this point they will see other levels of the people around them, beyond the five-senses. Looking back from a perspective of greater knowledge, he believed there is what he calls a \"morphogenetic field\" transmitted to the DNA of the lizard people and this aligned the cell structure to the reptilian genetic blueprint. The Olmec people of Central America, whose whole culture was based on serpent worship, used to take hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that they called \"the flesh of the Plumed Serpent\", and this took them into other-dimensional awareness - the serpent frequency. I will discuss this further in the next chapter. In their rituals to the \"serpent son\" Dionysus (another version of 'Jesus'), the Greek initiates would drink strong wine and take mind-altering drugs and mushrooms to \"unite with their Son of God\". At the end of those 15 days in the United States, when I was speaking at a Whole Life Expo event in Minneapolis, a gifted psychic lady told me how she sees people in power, like Henry Kissinger, George Bush, and Hillary Clinton, turn into Reptilians all the time. Once again she is accessing their frequency levels beyond the five-senses and beyond the 'cover' of an apparel1Jly 'human' form. I recalled at this stage that I had read something about Reptilians in a book called Trance-Formation of America,1 which details the life of a remarkable woman called Cathy O'Brien, a recovering victim of US government mind programming. Stewart Swerdlow was programmed in one of the mind and genetic manipulation centres known as Montauk. For those new to my books, I should explain a little background to this because it will be a recurring theme. Since the early 1990s, I have been researching the mind-control technique known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), and I have written extensively about this and the experiences of its victims in The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. Basically, the mind fractures into a series of apparent 'personalities', each with different attitudes, beliefs and often 'ages'. The Illuminati have created millions of these 'multiples' through their trauma-based mind-control techniques to serve their agenda. These techniques have been known for thousands of years, but their use expanded rapidly after the Second World War when Reptilian Nazis like the\" Angel of Death, Josef Mengele, perfected the concept through mass experimentation on the inmates of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 163 the concentration camps. They use a mechanism of the mind that appears to 'forget' the memory of extreme trauma in the same way that those involved in a serious road accident do not remember the impact. Their minds have not actually forgotten the experience and in fact they have retained it in photographic detail. But the memory is held behind an amnesic barrier to prevent the horror being re-lived over and over by the conscious mind. It is a defence mechanism in its positive form. However, the Illuminati mind doctors and geneticists realised that if you could systematically traumatise someone, especially if you began before the age of five or six, you could fragment their minds into an almost endless honeycomb of amnesic barriers that they call \"altars\". Each of these altars believes it is the whole mind and the only 'personality'. The victims are given a 'front altar', the 'personality' that interacts with daily life, and this is the 'person' that others believe them to be. But behind the front altar are the multiple amnesic barriers created by the unimaginable trauma inflicted in the mind-control programmes. This includes violence, sexual abuse and Satanic ritual in which they see other children or animals sacrificed. Think of anything you would find spine-chillingly horrific - then triple it - and that is what they make these children experience. There are millions of such children and adults around the world. Once an altar has been created it can be programmed with a 'personality' that performs tasks such as assassinating Illuminati targets or being sexually abused by some of the most famous people on Earth. If you don't think that's true, read the detailed background in my other books or ask father George Bush. You're an expert, aren't you, George? Why are so many assassins described as \"lone nutters\"? They are mind-controlled slaves of the Illuminati and they are programmed to carry out the killings and hide the force that was really behind it. The front altar - the 'front personality' - of assassins and those who go crazy with guns is often programmed to appear less than the full picnic. This means that after the killings people who knew them can tell the media how they always did seem to be strange and weird. \"Ahhh, the killer was just a nutter, then, case closed.\" In the same way, children are 'switched' from the front altar to another 'personality' when they are abused by the rich and famous. Once the trauma is over they are switched back again. The front altar has no idea what the other altar has experienced and has no memory of the abuse. These people are also used to courier drugs for the Illuminati or pass messages between their personnel because of the same potential for secrecy. They are switched between altars by the use of hypnotic trigger keys in the form of words, sounds, hand signals or however they may be programmed to respond. This was the background of Cathy O'Brien. Her Satanic father, who had abused her violently and sexually from the time she was a baby in Michigan in the 1950s, handed her over to Gerald Ford -later President Ford - for use in the Illuminati's global mind-control programmes. Cathy is blonde-haired and blue-eyed, the genetics of choice for so many mind-control programmes, and I recommend her book, Trance-Formation of America, to anyone who wants to know what is happening to literally millions and millions of children around the world. I looked through the index to find the reptilian references and, although she rationalised the experience as a mind-control illusion, what she describes is the same experience that so many others had been reporting and continue to do so. She described how leading US politicians she worked for in her mind-controlled state appeared to take a reptilian form before her eyes and then return to 'human'. These included President George Bush, father of President George \"Dubya\", of the Anunnaki/Merovingian bloodline. Father George told her they were an extraterrestrial race that had taken over the planet, but no one realised it because they looked human. Cathy relates another important experience she had with Miguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico during father Bush's tenure at the White House. She writes in TranceFormation of America: \"De La Madrid had relayed the 'legend of the Iguana' to me, explaining that lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like abilities - 'a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders'. De la Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he transformed 'back into an Iguana at will'.\" 2 This is exactly the same story in Central America that you find in Africa, Asia and around the world and fits with Stewart Swerdlow's information. Researcher James Churchward told in books like The Children of MuJ that he established the Maya of Central America and the Nagas of Asia to be the same former Lemurian peoples. The Mayans say the first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexico were the Chanes or \"People of the Serpent\". They were led by the god Itzamna, a name that apparently comes from the word \"itzem\", which translates as lizard or reptile. The sacred city of Itzamna, therefore, means \"the place of the lizard\" or \"Iguana House\". I have been told by hundreds of people all over the world, from every walk of life you can imagine, about their experiences of seeing well-known and less well known people transform into a reptilialian form before their eyes and then go back again. Father George Bush is the name that recurs most often in these accounts. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 164 Shape-shifting Prime Ministers Soon after returning from the USA and the rapid escalation of my reptilian research, I went to see a woman in England to discuss her knowledge of Satanic rituals, which, she said, involved people like Ted Heath, the former Conservative Prime Minister of Britain from 1970 to 1974. He signed the UK into the Illuminati's European Community, now Union, and has persisted to campaign for our further absorption into this centralised fascist state. Government papers were released after 30 years that showed how Heath knew that entry into the European Community would eventually mean the end of British sovereignty. But at the time he denied this because the Reptilians and their clones will say whatever is necessary to achieve their ends. Heath comes up often when you speak with the victims of Satanic rituals - those who survive - and their torture as children. This lady was brought up by a Scottish family and said she was sexually and ritually abused by the highly significant Scottish Illuminati network. As a result of this background, she became the wife of the warden of an area of woodland called Burnham Beeches, a few miles from Slough, west of London. It is an ancient site mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century. Burnham Beeches is not far from both the British Prime Minister's country residence called Chequers and the former Wycombe home of the Illuminati Hellfire Club with its human sacrifice rituals involving royalty and the American 'hero', Benjamin Franklin (see The Biggest Secret). Burnham Beeches is owned by the City of London - 'the Crown'. This is the globally-important financial district of the British capital and one of the most powerful Illuminati operational centres on the planet controlled by the Crown Temple of the Knights Templar (see Appendix I). The city of London does not mean the whole of the capital. It is the area surrounding St Paul's Cathedral where the original city stood and after the Great Fire of London in 1666 it was rebuilt by initiates like Sir Christopher Wren. It is now a sovereign state within the urban sprawl we call London and has its own government. As I already highlighted, the coat of arms of the City of London, an image you find all over Burnham Beeches, is dominated by two flying reptiles holding a shield adorned by the red cross on the white background used by the Knights Templar secret society. It is from this Illuminati centre that Burnham Beeches is administered. The lady who told me about this area said that her husband, the warden in charge of the place, was a Satanist. She said he had to be to get the job. They lived in a big house in the woods and part of his work was arranging Satanic rituals there. She said that one night in the early 1970s while Ted Heath was Prime Minister, she was walking through the woods after dark when she saw some lights. Quietly, she moved forward to see what they were and to her horror she saw a Satanic ritual involving Heath and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anthony Barber. She said that as she watched, hidden among the trees and undergrowth, Heath began to transform into a reptile and she said what staggered her was that no one in the circle looked the least bit surprised. \"He eventual1y became a full-bodied reptilioid, growing in size by some two foot, she said. This is a common description by witnesses. She said he was \"slightly scaly\" arid \"spoke fairly naturally\", although it sounded like \"long distance - if you imagine the short time lapses\". I met Heath once in a television station before I knew any of this and I never forgot the coldness of his eyes or how they turned entirely black as he looked at me. There was no point where his eyes made contact with mine because they appeared to go on forever like two black holes into another dimension. I have heard many people describe a similar experience with people they claim to have seen shape-shift. The woman told me that she had seen other reptilian figures in Burnham Beeches at dusk or after dark, wearing long robes with hoods. The reptilian Windsors Shortly after this meeting, I was introduced through a third party to the healer, Christine Fitzgerald, who, as acknowledged in the tabloid media, was a close confidant of Princess Diana for some nine years. You can r'ead the full story of what she told me in The Biggest Secret. She knew nothing whatsoever of my then unpublished reptilian research, but a little way into our conversation she told me that Diana called the Windsors \"the Reptiles\" and \"the Lizards\" and used to say, \"They're not human\". Christine went on to tell me that the Windsors were a reptilian hybrid bloodline and how they had treated Diana in ways that were beyond the imagination. At the centre of this circle, she said, was the late Queen Mother, Christine told me that Princess Diana used to call the Queen Mother\" evil\". I can think of no one on this planet, maybe even in history, whose real persona is more at odds with her manufactured image than the Queen Mother. Christine said: \"The Queen Mother ... now that's a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother is a lot older than people think. To be honest, the royal family hasn't died for a long time, they have just metamorphosised. It's sort of cloning, but in a different way. They take pieces of flesh and rebuild the body from one little bit. Because it's lizard, because it's coldb looded, it's much easier to do this Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The diff erent bodies are just different electrical vibrations and they have got that secret; they've got the secret of the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 165 micro-currents; it's so micro, so specific, these radio waves that actually create the bodies. These are the energies I work with when I'm healing. \"They know the vibration of life and because they're cold-blooded, they are reptiles, they have no wish to make the Earth the perfect harmony it could be, or to heal the Earth from the damage that's been done. The Earth's been attacked for zeons by different extraterrestrials. It's been like a football for so long. This place is a bus stop for many different aliens. All these aliens, they could cope with anything, including the noxious gases. They're landing all the time and coming up from the bowels of the Earth. They looked like reptiles originally, but they look like us when they get out now through the electrical vibration, that key to life I talked about. They can manifest how they want to. All the real knowledge has been taken out and shredded and put back in another way. The Queen Mother is 'Chief Toad' of this part of Europe and they have people like her in every continent. Most people, the hangers on, don't know, you know, about the reptiles. They are just in awe of these people because they are so powerful.\" 4 I know it is hard to imagine and grasp the scale of the Queen Mother's involvement through her life because your mind tells you she was a little old lady. But, as with all of these people, what you see is just the front 'human' image, not the real being. It is an extreme version of an agent in a foreign land operating behind a cover story of why he is there and what he is doing. It's just that these people also have 'cover bodies' to hide their real nature from the five-senses of the population. We look at them with our five-senses and so that is the level of them that we see _ their 'human' form. But behind that they look very different. Christine Fitzgerald was able to see what was going on because of her work with Diana and the aristocracy and her understanding of energy, vibrations and frequencies through her healing work. I have had to study an unbelievable number of subjects and research so many different strands of information before it was possible to put a picture together. That is one big reason why it has rarely come to light like this before. There is so much to know before you can see the pieces, let alone how they fit. The Illuminati have suppressed all information that is necessary to see the picture and you have to do so much work to overcome that. You also need a mind that is free (or free-er) and willing to go anywhere the evidence leads. A few weeks after my meeting with Christine Fitzgerald in 1999, Brian Desborough, a scientist friend in California, told me there was a woman that I had to meet as soon as possible. This was Arizona Wilder, a recovering victim of the Illuminati mind-control network, who had worked for them at a very high level. She said she had conducted sacrificial rituals as a \"Mother Goddess\" for the British royal family, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at a notorious centre for Satanic ritual known as the Mothers of Darkness Castle in Belgium. This is located in the same region as the headquarters of the cult responsible for the widespread paedophilia, murder and child sacrifice that came to light amid enormous public anger in 1994. The ring involved famous pillars of Belgian society and a massive cover-up has ensued to keep it quiet. Belgium is a major Illuminati Satanic centre and that's why the European Union and NATO are based there. Stewart Swerdlow names some other major locations for the rituals as Land's End and Loch Ness in the United Kingdom; Rennes-Le-Chateau and Brittany in France; Bavaria in Germany; Phoenix, Arizona; Montauk Point, New York; the Mojave Desert and Russian River (Bohemian Grove) in California; the east coast of Florida; and the Channel Islands. He also cites the Great Pyramid (of course) and the great castles of Europe located over underground entrances to the inner-Earth. These, he says, are most commonly found in Scotland (hence the importance of this little country to the Illuminati), France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and Austria.s One of these castles over an inner-Earth entrance is tt\\~ Queen's Scottish residence at Balmoral and the home of the late Queen Mother called Glamis Castle in the north of the country. I note there is also a Blair Castle in Scotland, the seat of the Dukes of Atholl. Bilair, Bilar and Bilid are names used for the chief demon in some rituals. Arizona Wilder's original name had been Jennifer Greene. She is a blue-eyed blonde from a French aristocratic bloodline witlj significant Irish blood, too. When her mind and her memories began to return after the death of her controller, the Nazi Josef Mengele, she changed her name to Arizona Wilder, she told me. Mengele, and the other leading Nazi geneticists, mind-controllers, scientists and engineers, escaped from Germany as the Allies arrived thanks to a British and American intelligence operation called Project Paperclip. Some very famous names are mentioned with compelling consistency by people like Arizona - father George Bush, Henry Kissinger, Dick Cheney, the British royal family, the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and a long list of others detailed in my other books. Arizona is one of the many people with 'multiple' programming who are breaking down the compartments and remembering their unimaginable experiences. In The Biggest Secret and the video Revelations of a Mother Goddess, she tells her story in detail and names the famous names involved on both sides of the Atlantic. She says she was chosen by them because of her bloodline. The IlluminatiReptilians literally breed people to conduct their rituals for them. Such people tend to be very psychic and are able to connect easily with energy. They manipulate its vibrational state and draw desired frequencies into rituals. From the moment a child of these 'psychic' bloodlines is born, in fact even in the womb, they are subjected to trauma-based mind-control. The idea is to turn them into compartmentalised people who can be 'triggered' to conduct the rituals as programmed, but then 'forget' everything they did until that compartment is accessed"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 166 again for the next ritual. After the death of her controller, Josef Mengele, in the 1980s, she said that another infamous mind-controller, Guy de Rothschild, was brought in to \"take me over\", but it didn't work as before. This often happens because the victim's mind worships the one who originally programmed them, especially if it was over a long period. When I met her, Arizona had escaped from mind- control, although there were many compartments still to be accessed. The elite Satanists Support for Arizona's theme comes from Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, another recovering mind-controlled Satanist, who tells part of his story on an excellent website highlighting ritual abuse and mind-contro1.6 We also communicated directly on several occasions. Phillip, who uses another name in daily life, explains how his front altar or 'presenter' personality was that of a 'good guy' Christian. But beyond that his subconscious was programmed as a Satanist as the unofficial son of a French Rothschild. His mother was Lula Vieta Pauline Russell Campbell, who was born in 1917 in Farmersville, Texas, and died in 1977. But, he says, his real, biological, father, was not the man he had known as his father before his compartmentalised mind began to heal and remember. His genetic father, he says, was Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wine producing estates in France, who died in 1988 at the age of 86. Phillip Eugene told me: \"My father was a decadent dilettante as well as a master Satanist and hater of God, but how he loved the fields and the wines. He used to say it br01.ight out 'the primitive in him'.\" The estates are now run by Baron Philippe's daughter, Baroness Philippine, who, Phillip Eugene says, is/his half sister. He was, he writes, conceived by \"occult incest\" and was\" one of the hundreds of thousands of both legitimate and illegitimate offspring of this powerful financial and occult family\". Much of this is done artificially through Illuminati sperm banks. What Phillip says is confirmation of my own research, as outlined in The Biggest Secret, that the main Reptilian bloodlines conceive countless children to perpetuate the bloodline and only a few are given the bloodline name as 'official' children. The others are hidden behind other names and brought up by other 'parents'. Later they find themselves in significant positions, often not knowing why they got so 'lucky'. Phillip Eugene says that for most of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his Rothschild father on his estate in France. They had a physical relationship, he says, and he was \"held fast in the emotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was normal and to be admired\". He said he observed his Rothschild father's \"lust for power\" and began to desire the same. He also confirmed the way the 'occult' bloodlines are controlled by demonic entities. \"Being a Rothschild descendant\", he said, \"I was maximally demonised\". He continues: \"I was present at my father's death in 1988, receiving his power and the commission to carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family. Like the ir other children, I played a key role in my family's revolt from God. When I watch CNN, it startles me to see so many familiar faces now on the world stage in politics, art, finance, fashion, and business. I grew up with these people meeting them at ritua l worship sites and in the centers of power. Financiers, artists, royalty, and even Presidents, all these dissociated people work and conspire today to bring in a new world order ... These people. like me. are SRA/DID [Satanically ritually abused and Dissociative Identity Disorder multiples']. \"The last non-dissociative President of the United States was Dwight Eisenhower: except for him, everyone since Teddy Roosevelt has had some level of dissociative disorder and some level of involvement in the occult. President Clinton has 'full blown' multiple personality disorder and is an active sorcerer in the Satanic mystery religions. This is true of AI Gore, as well; I have known Misters Clinton and Gore from our childhood as active and effective Satanists. \"Like the hundreds of thousands of this [Rothschild] occult family's other biological children, I had my place and function within this clan's attempt to control the world. My efforts and my family's efforts strove to have a member of the European nobility of the Habsburg family assume the pre-eminent position over humanity, a position called the Antichrist by Christianity. While others were seeded into government, academia. business, or entertainment, my place was within the Body of Christ. I was to be a focus for spiritual power and controller of a cult within this Church. In this Church have lived people who I have known all my life to be the controllers and power centers of both the Rothschild family's false prophet and the antichrist. \"Many dissociated Christians in the Body of Christ hold similar corporate spiritual, occult positions as part of the Satanic New World Order. In my being I embodied the Luciferian morning star within the Church. I represented the presence of all the other Satanists who were related to me in the morning star; their spirits were present in me in the Church. Constructed through ritual but empowered by legions of spirits, I was a human and spiritual focus of corporate Satanic energy into the 'Body of Christ'.\" , The Queen and human sacrifice "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 167 Arizona Wilder told me she had conducted sacrificial rituals involving the British royal family, Tony Blair, and famous American Illuminati names like George Bush, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger and many others.s She told me that the head of the Illuminati, or the highest-ranked she knew, was a man called the Marquis de Libeaux from the key Reptilian bloodline center of Alsace-Lorraine in eastern France, which at times had been in German hands. She said that he was known as Pindar or \"Penis of the Dragon\". She didn't know if the Marquis de Libeaux was his real name. Stewart Swerdlow says that Pindar or \"Pinnacle of the Draco\" is the head of the Rothschild family who \"reports to the pure-bred Reptilian leader in the inner-Earth\".9 I guess the Marquis de Libeaux could be code for a Rothschild. Swerdlow says in Blue Blood, True Blood that the thirteen leading Illuminati-Reptilian shape-shifter families are: Rothschild (Bauer), Bruce, Cavendish (Kennedy), de Medici, Hanover, Hapsburg [Habsburg], Krupps, Plantagenet, Rockefeller, Romanov, Sinclair I St Clair, Warburg (del Banco) and Windsor (the German house of Saxe-Coburg-Gothe. Other researchers give slightly different names, but families like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Windsors are always named. Arizona told me how the Queen and Queen Mother regularly sacrificed babies and adults at many ritual centres, including Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This is where they were all staying at the time Diana was ritually murdered in Paris (see The Biggest Secret) and Tony Blair went up to join them. Arizona's accounts have been supported by other 'multiples' I have met, not least those programmed and ritually abused within the Merovingian Mormon Church. The royal family involved in human sacrifice was fantastic enough, but here again came the constantly repeated theme. Arizona described how, during the rituals, these people shape-shift into reptiles. Diane Gould, head of the US organisation, Mothers Against Ritual Abuse, also confirms this theme. In a telephone conversation about ritual abuse, Diane asked me if I could explain why many of her clients reported that participants in their rituals had turned into reptiles. As I was writing this book, another therapist I met in Texas told me of similar accounts by her clients who had suffered in Satanic rituals and she said they had mentioned the familiar famous names to her with regard to the rituals, including Tony Blair. People might want to dismiss all this, but they should know that, while they close their eyes and their minds, children are being sacrificed all over the world. this very day by the Reptilian bloodlines - many thousands of them on the main ritual dates of the Satanic calendar like May 1st and Halloween. Arizona Wilder talked about some of her experiences with the Queen and Queen Mother: \"The Queen Mother was cold, cold, cold, a nasty person. None of her cohorts even trusted her. They have named an altar [mind-control programme] after her. They call it the Black Queen. I have seen her sacrifice people. I remember her pushing a knife into someone's rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed. One was 13 and the other 18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a Reptilian, she becomes very tall and strong. Some of them are so strong they can rip out a heart and they all grow by several feet when they shapeshift.\" [This is what the lady said who saw Edward Heath and it is a common theme in witness accounts.] Of the Queen, Arizona said: \"I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood. One time she got so excited with blood-lust that she didn't cut the victim's throat from left to right in the normal ritual; she just went crazy, stabbing and ripping at the flesh after she had shape-shifted into a Reptilian. When she shape-shifts, she has a long reptile face, almost like a beak and she's an off-white colour. [This fits many depictions of the gods and 'bird gods' of ancient Egypt and elsewhere.] The Queen Mother looks basically the same, but there are differences. She [the Queen] also has like bumps on her head and her eyes are very frightening. She's very aggressive... I have seen [Prince Charles] shape-shift into a Reptilian and do all the things the Queen does. I have seen him sacrifice children. There is a lot of rivalry between them for who gets to eat what part of the body and who gets to absorb the victim's last breath and steal their soul. I have also seen Andrew participate and I have seen Prince Philip and Charles' sister [Anne] at the rituals, but they didn't participate when I was there. When Andrew shape-shifts, he looks more like one of the lizards. The royals are some of the worst, OK, as far as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and eating the flesh; they're some of the worst of all of them. They don't care if you see it. Who are you going to tell, who is going to believe you? They feel that is their birthright and they love it. They love it.\" 10 Stewart Swerdlow describes similar scenes from his own experience and how the sacrifice is terrorised before\" a final thrust of a blade disembowels the victim, resulting in rivers of blood flowing over the crowd's bodies\". He says that the frenzy is so high at this point that many begin to shape-shift into Reptilians and en attack each other mindlessly. If you have seen the 1998 film, Blade, with Wesley Snipes you'll get the picture. Swerdlow tells how the sacrifices are ripped apart and internal organs and genitalia are consumed. \" ... The God and Goddess then ant ceremonial invocation to the astral planes. I have heard this chant in Latin, Hebrew, Ancient Egyptian, Sumerian, German, English and a guttural, hissing language which I was told is the original Draco language.\" 11 These are the people controlling our world. Arizona Wilder has been viciously attacked for what she said in The Biggest Secret and on her video. A campaign of character assassination has been waged, at e time almost daily on the Internet, to discredit her evidence and"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 168 the Reptilian connection in general. Arizona is an immensely brave woman and one of the few ho will speak openly about her experiences. Most keep quiet because they think one will believe them or they want to remain publicly anonymous because they are the consequences of speaking out. For every person I name, like Arizona and Christine Fitzgerald, there are countless more who confirm the story on the understanding that their identity and location will not be revealed publicly, though I know the details. It has been claimed even by other researchers who will t leave the five-sense comfort zone that all my Reptilian information has come m only one person, Arizona Wilder. This is utter nonsense. She is only one source d there are so many more that tell the same basic tale. Before my very eyes One such case is a 57-year-old former chief of police, special agent and member of e US military. He says he has guarded two presidents, two Secretaries of Defense, d two chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the head of the US military). He contacted me to say that he knows from his experience that\" aliens exist\" and that e government is lying about the Roswell 'alien' crash in New Mexico in 1947. He o told me of a \"crystal skull\" in his possession. But his main reason for making contact was to tell me of an incident that showed to him that shape-shifting reptilians are real. When he arrived at a friend's house in Texas, he was told that two women guests were coming from New York. They travelled around the country performing hands-on-healing and they had asked if they could drop by, he was told. This former chief of police told me in personal correspondence what happened next: \"I arrived before the New York people and had already started showing my crystal skull when they arrived. They immediately went crazy [because of the skull] and started holding their hands up before their eyes and screamed 'Get her out of here' over and over. I can tell you that everyone was shocked by their actions and I was extremely upset ... I carried the crystal skull out to the car and left it there. After about an hour everyone seemed to get over the uproar they made and things settled down to discussions. Everyone introduced themselves and the two from New York volunteered to heal someone. Well everyone started telling them to do it to me because I had heart trouble and was recovering from a heart attack. I hesitated, but finally relented and said OK. \"They sprang over to me so fast that it startled me. One got behind me and one straddled my legs in front of me. They did this without touching me and they both started running their hands around my body again without touching me anywhere. This went on for about a minute then my eyes met the eyes of the lady in front of me. That was some experience, our eyes meeting. Pay attention to what I say here. I could see immediately that she knew that I knew and it broke her concentration. She lost control and changed into a Reptilipn right before my eyes. No sooner than she lost control, she regained it and shape-shifted back into a human. All this took place in the blink of an eye. They immediately jumped up and said that they had to leave and left within 30 seconds of this happening.\" He said he did not say anything about what he had seen, but when everyone began to leave, two guests stayed behind and would not move. Eventually they asked: \"Did you see what we saw?\" He asked them what they meant and they said they had seen the lady\" ... change into a reptile and then change back\". People all over the world, and from countless walks of life, have repeated this same experience to me. This is the modern version of the experience the ancients described. A lady called Odette told of a reptilian experience at a house in Quebec, Canada. She was with a friend when another woman came over and began to talk about UFOs and contactees. The woman said she was a contactee and she had a meeting with a spaceship on a certain date. She also said that they were taking her and she would never be back on Earth. Odette said she was not convinced at all and especially when the woman had said that if they could only see her real self, they would see how beautiful she is, like a princess inside. \"I was thinking, yeah right! Whatever!!!\" Odette recalled. The woman looked around 30 years old, tall and strong, light hair, cut to her shoulder, and was \"ordinary looking\". Then she asked Odette if she would let her reveal her real self because she would never have seen anyone like her. But she said she needed Odette's permission for this. Odette said yes because she thought, \"Poor thing, she's really miserable \".\" The account continues: \"We went to a quiet room. We sat facing each other, and she grabbed my hands, told me to relax and just look at her. What I saw was a reptile, tall er than she was, at least 6 feet, green/brown colour, staring at me with its head turned sideways, and I swear with something that seemed like a grin on its face. Then she/it asked me 'Didn't I tell you I was beautiful?' I said yes, and headed for the door ... If anybody has had a similar experience or knows of a book that talks about reptilians please let me know.\" Church of Latter Day Reptiles "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 169 A regular source of information about Reptilian activities and rituals are those who have been involved in 'religious' organisations, not least the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints (LOS), better known as the Mormons. Both were formed by members of the Merovingian bloodline like.J:,4e Mormons, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and Charles Taze Russell of the Watchtower Society. These 'Churches' have been controlled ever since by the Merovingian Reptilian shape-shifters. A lady called Diana Huston told me of her experiences with the Jehovah's Witness mind-control sect, officially titled the watchtower Bible and Tract Society.13 She joined them in 1969 because, after going through the Vietnam War with her husband, was attracted by the message of paradise on Earth. She was OK for a few years, but then they became more demanding and controlling. In 1987 she said that subliminal drawings began to appear in the artwork of their books and magazines depicting bizarre faces and trance messages. Some of these are detailed in the Symbolism Archives on my website (www.davidicke.com). At a small convention in September 1988, she spoke privately to one of the governing body 'elect'. At that time she thought they were e 'good guys'. The man was about five-foot-ten with dark hair and was powerfully built. She said that she looked into his eyes and was startled and terrified to see a thin membrane drop over his human eyes. She didn't know if the membrane came from the bottom of his eyelid or the top. \"I'd never heard of lizard beings, but I remember thinking how much his eyes looked like those of a lizard\", e recalled. The membrane dropped over his eyes when he looked at her and he seemed to recognise her, although at the time she couldn't imagine why. The sense f terrible danger that she felt, and the need to get away from him, was overwhelming. She went on: \"Eventually I came to understand that the leaders are not fully human, but are the offspring of something alien to this Earth. They are too cunning, lethal, and intelligent to have originated from here, and there has to be an over-race of beings guiding them from some dimension. They are here for one reason only. They look at humans as a source of enslavement for their enjoyment to torment and abuse, to misuse power and to cruelly punish and kill.\" 14 As she researched the religion's documents and books, she said she began to uncover a trail of arms and drug-running (which the Illuminati globally controls), and \"plots to destroy the world and take it for their own\". Diane took her \"mountains\" of evidence to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and met with them. They said that she was either a genius or totally insane. She said she learned that the Watchtower Society had hidden rooms under the streets of Brooklyn, New York, where they have their headquarters over the now abandoned old Brooklyn subway. There they practice Satanic ritual, including the sacrifice of human infants, she said, and here they also keep women who are used as \"breeders\" for babies to be sacrificed. This happens all over the world because the babies are never officially registered and therefore never reported missing. To the system, they have never existed. The main Illuminati bloodlines also conceive children in the rituals. Diane wrote that this Watchtower Satanic operation is totally self-sufficient and even uses blood in the ink of the magazines. She said that she and a friend tried to warn people through the media with no success (I am surprised!) and her friend had a nervous breakdown t«>m which she has never fully recovered. One of many accounts to come from former members of the Mormon \"Church\" was sent by a woman - 1 will call her \"Jane\" - who claims she suffered in a Mormon mind-control project from the time she was a young child. Cathy O'Brien says that the Mormon Church and especially the operation at Salt Lake City is a major mind-control centre and I am producing a video called Satanism and the Mormon Church with a former Mormon mind-slave, Sharon Jacobs, who has talked to me at length about the rituals and Reptilian shape-shifters within the Mormon hierarchy. The overwhelming majority of Mormons have no idea what their organisation is really about. Former military sources claim that the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, which is covered in Illuminati symbols like the all-seeing eye, stands over a large underground Reptilian \"hive\" that can be accessed from the temple. \"Jane\" said she saw her babies sacrificed in Mormon rituals and that is a common theme of such accounts. Sharon Jacobs tells a similar story. In her pursuit of the truth, Jane spoke with another victim of ritual abuse by the Mormon and Roman Catholic Church. This other lady told her that the Mormon \"Prophet\" (the official head of the Church) had taken her baby from her at a ritual and eaten it. Two other women raised as Catholics told her that they had seen the abusers shape-shift into Reptilians and eat a human sacrifice. Jane said that Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormons, was from \"the occult bloodlines\" (very true) and the whole official story was a lie. \"The leaders are mostly reptilian\", she said. \"One witness says that only one of the twelve [Mormon] apostles did not shape-shift at the ritual\". She goes on: \"I was so mad to find out that the alien abuse was connected to the ritual abuse in the church when I had believed the church was true. [Now I know that] ... our families are from occult bloodlines of England and Europe. This has gone on for hundreds and thousands of years.\" 15 Sharon Jacobs has confirmed all of this and more and she names in the video the major Mormon leaders involved. She tells of horrific sex and blood rituals under the Salt Lake Temple in which goats and babies"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 170 are sacrificed and aborted foetuses eaten by the participants. Stewart Swerdlow says that one reason sex is so important in the rituals is that human semen is considered the most potent booster of mammalian genetics to hold Reptilian form. This often involves eating the genitals of the sacrificial victim.l6 For certain, Satanic ritual goes on within the Mormon Church and, in fact, the number of accounts has forced even the Mormon hierarchy to admit it happens. What they deny, of course, is the scale on which it happens and that it goes right to the top. Indeed, it is orchestrated from there. There are a number of websites exposing this, including a site set up by former Mormons, one of whom is the same bloodline as the Mormon hero Brigham Young.? The Mormon Church is such a blatant Illuminati front. Orrin Hatch, the senator for Utah, has appeared a number of times in my books for his statements supporting the Illuminati line. He is the man attacking Internet freedom and pressing for technology that would destroy computers when people download copyrighted material. This is not the real reason, obviously. The idea eventually is to destroy the computers of those challenging the Illuminati agenda. Ironically, Hatch also claims to be an advocate of child protection. Well, if he's really serious he should start with the Mormon Church. Do you think he will? Nor me. Rothschild-Bauer-Bush The connection between the hybrid bloodlines and shape-shifting is constantly confirmed. Here is one excellent example. The Rothschilds are a predominant reptilian shape-shifting bloodline and they were called Bauer before they changed their name to Rothschild or \"Red Shield\", when their banking dynasty began in Frankfurt, Germany. The Bauers (also Bower) were an infamous 'occult' family of Middle Ages Germany. Of course they were; they are from the line of \"Sorcerer Kings\". The word \"Roth\" also developed into Roads, Rhoads, or Rhodes, the name of Cecil Rhodes, the Rothschild placeman who brought devastation and genocide to southern Africa. The country of Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was named after him. On Rhodes' immense memorial in Cape Town, South Africa, there are lines of lions - a symbol of the serpent cult/Illuminati. Another Reptilian bloodline is the Bush family in the United States, which has provided two of the last three US Presidents. I stress that I am not saying that everyone called Bauer or Bush throughout the world is like this. I am talking of these Anunnaki Reptilian bloodlines that have taken the name Bauer and Bush. I was sent a letter to my website from a source that did not wish his name to be published. It pulls together the names Bauer (Rothschild) and Bush in one story. Before you read it, you need to know that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the United States, is a major Illuminati operation, as I have explained in detail in other books. It has the power to take control of every aspect of American life, by law, whenever the President calls a State of Emergency. Anyway, here is a fascinating story connecting FEMA, the Rothschild/Bauer and Bush bloodlines, and shape-shifting: \"A few years ago I became acquainted with a lovely person with the surname of Bauer. We had many varied and wide-ranging discussions. During one of these talks, the subject of schizophrenia came up. She said it ran in her family. Asking for more detail, she told me her mother and great aunt had been afflicted by it. It was the vision hallucination type. The odd thing is that the hallucinations were incredibly similar. Their 'hal1ucinations' were of people 'of royal blood' turning into giant lizards! \"I had forgotten about this experience until I read David's book. It was just one of those odd things that didn't make sense. Now it does ... I was in quite a bit of shock when I finally made all the connections: 'So, what more can I say? I don't just believe it's real, I 'know' it is. Unless, of course, I want to deny my own experience and senses.\" 18 \"I was at FEMA training headquarters in Fredricksburg, Maryland, attending a radiological defense pilot course in 1982 for the Washington State Department of Emergency Services. During the orientation, Louis Guiffreda, one of the head honchos and a cousin of [father] George Bush, came in to observe. When he sat down I noticed a dark haze around him. I kept looking at him to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but it stayed the same. I was up in the seats alone, as I like to be in these things. Soon, I noticed he was staring at me! This unnerved me. I closed my eyes and tried to relax. When I opened my eye again, I saw him coming toward me. He sat down a few rows behind and to the left of me. I glanced back and saw him leaning forward with his eyes closed. I figured he was just tired and decided to take a rest with me. \"While sitting there trying to relax, I heard a strange hissing and swishing sound come from behind me. I opened my eyes, but was afraid to look around. I saw a woman in our group looking up in our direction with a look of astonishment and shock on her face. She kept looking up nervously in our direction. Eventually, Guiffreda left with his bodyguards (waxy-faced suits with sunglasses) and the presentation continued. After the orientation, I walked outside and found this woman sobbing and shaking in the arms of another participant. I intruded and said I wanted to know why she was looking up with that look on her face. She didn't want to say, but with repeated assurance from me she told me. She had seen Guiffreda 'turn' into a lizard! The other guy said Guiffreda had the nickname of lizard man in the circles around FEMA and he has a skin disease that makes his skin look like scales. "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 171 Sexual shape-shifting Here is another example of the way the bloodline names come up in the stories of shape-shifting. The Oppenheimer family are the controlling bloodline in South Africa on behalf of the Rothschilds and they own the diamond and gold industries, much of the media and dictate to the government. This is a story sent from a correspondent there: \"I was born in South Africa and years ago got to know an old lady in Johannesburg who had for many years been the lover of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, t he founder [with Rothschild backing] of the gold and diamond corporate cartel. She told me that Sir Ernest used to visit her in the afternoons at her flat in Parktown. On one occasion as they were about to make love, his body took on the form and proportions of a giant lizard with scales and she said the experience had been one of the sexual highlights of her life. The story which was so strange at the time has been in the back of my mind for years and came back to me when I recently read your book.\" 19 Sexual activity seems to be a time when shape-shifting can happen as the hormones, blood and energy are affected dramatically, and when the excitement can unlock the mental focus that holds open the 'human' DNA codes. This is one reason for the shapeshifting during blood and sacrifice rituals. A businesswoman in Canada told me of her Reptilian experiences. The first was with a Portuguese man who treated her terribly and she was little more than an imprisoned slave. She said he shape-shifted into a reptile. She described how he was stunningly ritualistic, even with the time and day of the month he washed his clothes. This is a basic reptilian trait. She later had a relationship with another guy who, she said, was nice on the surface, but had a dark side he was battling with. She bought The Biggest Secret when it was first published because it exposes in great detail the Ri'!ptilian phenomenon she had experienced. One time when they went into her bedroom, the book was lying on a shelf above the bed. T,he man became very wound up and took a serious aversion to it, she told me. When they began to have sex, she said he began to go crazy, becoming violent and rough. Amid this anger, he began to shapeshift into a reptile. Her hand was on the bottom of his back while he lay on top of her and she felt her hand being pushed up as the guy began to sprout a tail! She screamed, threw him off, and he began to \"morph\" back to human form. She told him to get out of the house immediately and, at the time I met her, she had never seen him since. A Los Angeles jazz singer, Pamela Stonebrooke, has written and spoken publicly about her sexual encounters with a Reptilian being. When the very tall Reptilian first appeared in her bedroom, she says she was terrified. The being forced her to have sex and seemed to get \"high\" on her fear, but she says that as these encounters continued she conquered her fear and started coming on to him! When her fear subsided, the Reptilian did not seem to be so keen anymore. Pamela considers her Reptilian experience positive overall and talks of a close connection with the being. But reports of women being raped by Reptilians are far from rare. I met Pamela briefly at a conference in Los Angeles and she is quite a character, very strong willed, and that's just what you need in these circumstances. She wrote an open letter to the 'UFO community' (most of whom are depressingly closed-minded to seeing beyond their own 'official line'): \"Reptilians are not a politically correct species in the UFO community, and to admit to having sex with one - much less enjoying it - is beyond the pale as far as the more conservative members of that community are concerned. But I know from my extensive reading and research, and from talking personally to dozens of other women (and men), that I am not unique in reporting this kind of experience. I am the first to admit that this is a vastly complex subject, a kind of hall of mirrors, where dimensional realities are constantly shifting and changing. Certainly, the Reptilians use sex to control people in various ways. \"They have the ability to shape-shift and to control the mind of the experiencer, as well as to give tremendous pleasure through their mental powers. I have wrestled with all of these implications and the various levels of meaning and possibilities represented by my encounter experiences. I will say, however, as I have said before, that I feel a deep respect for the reptilian entity with whom I interacted, and a profound connection with this being.\" 20 I would stress here that not all Reptilian entities are of ill intent. There are many - those who have developed emotionally - who a-\\~not trying to manipulate humanity and would like to help to remove the control of the others. Pamela Stonebrooke says that since she began to talk publicly of her experiences, she has been contacted by hundreds of people telling her of similar encounters with Reptilian entities. Credo Mutwa tells of the scores of African women he has met who have reported the same experience of being forced to have sex with a Reptilian or have been artificially impregnated during abduction experiences only for the resulting pregnancy to end suddenly when the foetus \"disappeared\" with no explanation. Most women stay silent because of the obvious public ridicule that would follow and whatever people may think about Pamela Stonebrooke, she has the very \"couldn't-give-a-shit\" attitude that is vital to making suppressed information known to the wider public. In fact, here we have a golden example of the way humanity polices itself and, in doing so, suppresses the very information that would give us a fix on what is really going on."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 172 When you say anything that is different to the norm, the masses either ridicule or condemn you without doing any research whatsoever to establish if what you say could be valid. They dismiss it and often direct their bile at the messenger for no other reason than it is different to what they have been programmed to believe. Most people when faced with the truth, or a more accurate version of events, just laugh in its face or condemn it as evil. Even those who have opened up to some aspects of the truth still can't expand their mind to encompass the exploding evidence of the Reptilian dimension. One writer, in an otherwise very interesting book about ancient extraterrestrials, acknowledges all the serpent symbolism, names and references surrounding the Anunnaki, but suggests that this could have been because they wore reptile clothing or kept snakes. I think there could be another reason, myself! Reptilian underground There are endless reports of seeing Reptilians and shape-shifting, but most people have no knowledge of this because 99% of the population get their 'news' and 'information' from the mainstream media. Journalists, in turn, get their 'news' and 'information' overwhelmingly from official sources, which, like the media itself, are owned by the Reptilian bloodlines. After speaking about the Reptilians on the excellent Jeff Rense radio show in America, I was sent this account of an experience at the Dulce underground facility in New Mexico. These are the words of an army private employed on the surface: \" ... I was working on a routine job when another of the young enlistees, a mechanic, came in with a small rush job he wanted at once. He had the print and proceeded to show me exactly what he wanted. We are both bending over the bench in front of the welder when I happened to look directly into his face. It seemed to suddenly become covered in a semi-transparent film or cloud. His features faded and in their place appeared a 'thing' with bulging eyes, no hair, and scales for skin.\" He later saw the same thing happen to a guard at the Dulce front gate and witnesses have spoken of seeing Reptilian shape-shifters at the Madigan Military Hospital near Fort Lewis in Washington State. There are secret underground facilities throughout the world and at the deepest levels they open out into the inner-Earth centres of the Reptilians and associated non-human entities like the so-called \"Greys\", who are subordinate to the Reptilians. Area 51 in Nevada is the best-known underground facility in UFO research circles, but there are many others. These facilities are themselves connected by a massive tunnel network that has been built with nuclear boring technology that the public never sees. It can cut tunnels at the rate of seven miles a day and these are an expansion of the global tunnel network claimed by legends and accounts to exist under the United States, Central and South America, Britain, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turkey, Asia, China, Malta, pretty much everywhere. The tunnels have state-of-the-art transport systems that move at astonishing speeds. Insiders describe them as \"magneto-leviton or mag-lev monorail trains capable of mach-2\". Leading Illuminati companies and operations are involved in the construction and administration. Companies like the Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT & T, Hughes Aircraft, Northrop Corporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford Research Institute, Walsh Construction, the Colorado School of Mines, and the most significant one of all, Bechtel, the major Illuminati corporation that has won a massive contract to 'rebuild' Iraq after it was bombed by the ‘liberators'. Workers who experienced the deeper levels of the Dulce base saw scenes so terrifying they have refused to talk about them. From other sources, however, we can imagine some of what they saw. These bases are where many of the millions, yes millions, of children who go missing every year worldwide are taken. I know it is hard to stomach, but they are used for slave labour and eaten by the Reptilians, just like humans eat chickens or cows. Workers at Dulce have reported seeing the most grotesque sights in the lower levels. Researchers Bill Hamilton and TAL Levesque (also known as Jason Bishop III) gathered the following information about Dulce, which they published in UFO Magazine: \"Level number six is privately called 'Nightmare Hall'. It holds the genetic labs. Reports from workers who have seen bizarre experimentation are as follows: 'I have seen mutilated 'humans' that look like half-human/half octopus. Also reptilian-humans and furry creatures that have hands like humans and cry like a baby. It mimics human words ... also a huge mixture of lizard-humans in cages. There are fish, seals, birds and mice that can hardly be considered those species. There are several cages (and vats) of winged humanoids, grotesque bat-like creatures ... but three and a half to seven feet tall. Gargoyle-like beings and Draco reptoids. \"Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousands of humans and human mixtures in cold storage. Here, too, are embryo storage vats of humanoids in various stages of development. [One worker said] ' ... 1 frequently encountered humans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and begged for help. We were told they were hopelessly insane, and involved in high-risk drug tests to cure insanity. We were told never to try to speak to them at all. At the beginning we believed that story. Finally, in 1978, a small group of workers discovered..41e truth' ... \" 21 "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 173 A security officer at Dulce called Thomas Castello has described to researchers what happens at the Dulce base and his words were reported in the UFO Magazine article. His information has also been circulated as the \"Dulce Papers\". Castello worked for seven years with the Rand Corporation, an Illuminati operation in Santa Monica, California, connected to the 'neo-cons' running the 'war on terrorism', and he was transferred to Dulce in 1977. He estimated there were more than 18,000 of the \"short Greys\" at Dulce and he had also seen tall Reptilian humanoids. He knew of seven levels, but there could have been more, and he said the 'aliens' were on levels five, six and seven. The lower you go, the higher the security clearance you need. The only sign in English was above the tube shuttle station which said \"to Los Alamos\", another major underground Reptilian base in New Mexico, where the H-bombs were developed that were dropped on Japan. Most signs at Dulce are in the \"alien symbol language\" and a universal symbol system understood by humans and aliens, he said. The Illuminati communicate above ground in the language of symbolism, as I have detailed in other books. The hieroglyphics of Sumer, Egypt and China, would have been a Reptilian or 'alien' language originally. Other tunnel connections from Dulce went to underground facilities at Page, Arizona; Area 51 in Nevada; Taos, Carlsbad and Datil; New Mexico; and Colorado Springs and Creede, Colorado. Castello said there was a network of tube shuttle connections under the United States, which extends into a global system of tunnels and sub-cities. He described the immense security at Dulce. Below the second level, everyone is weighed naked and given a uniform. Any change in weight is noted and people are examined and X-rayed if there is a change of three pounds. At the entrance to all 'sensitive' areas there are scales and a person's weight must match with their card and code to gain entry. Castello also revealed some of the genetic work carried out at Dulce. He said that their scientists can separate the \"bioplasmic body\" from the physical body and place an \"alien entity\" within a human body after removing the \"soul\" of the human. I have thought for years that some famous people, including prime ministers and presidents, were taken into such facilities and possessed by a Reptilian entity. To the public the famous person looks the same physically afterwards, but now a very different force is deciding the behaviour. Ancient legends also tell of people being replaced in the night by \"changelings\" or shape-shifters. The Illuminati hybrid bloodlines with their higher ratio of Reptilian DNA makes this possession easier and this is why the Illuminati keep such detailed genetic records of family bloodlines. The joint global press announcement by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in 2000 about the mapping of the human genome takes on even greater significance when you think that the US Department of Energy has laboratories at Dulce and is closely connected to the genome project, along with the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. All are Illuminati fronts. Researcher Alan Walton writes extensively on the Internet about the Reptilian connection under the pseudonym, \"Branton\". He says: \"Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA in fact, there exist subterranean counterpart 'cities' controlled by the Masonic/hybrid/alien 'elite'. Often surface/ subsurface terminals exist beneath Masonic Lodges, police stations, airports and federal buildings of major cities ... and even not so 'major' cities. The population ratio is probably close to 10% of the population (the hybrid military-industrial fraternity 'elite' living below ground as opposed to the 90% living above). This does not include the full-blood reptilian species who live in even deeper recesses of the Earth. \"Some of the major population centers were deliberately established by the Masonic/hybrid elite of the Old and New 'worlds' to afford easy access to already existing underground levels, some of which are thousands of years old. Considering that the Los Alamos Labs [in New Mexico] had a working prototype nuclear powered thermol-bore drill that could literally melt tunnels through the earth at a rate of 8 mph 40 years ago, you can imagine how extensive these underground systems have become. These sub-cities also offer close access to organised criminal syndicates, which operate on the surface. They have developed a whole science of 'borg-onomics' through which they literally nickle-and-dime us into slavery via multi-leveled taxation, inflation, sublimation, manipulation, regulation, fines, fees, licenses ... and the entire debt-credit scam which is run by the Federal Reserve and Wall Street. \"New York City, I can confirm, is one of the largest draconian nests in the world. Or rather the ancient underground 'Atlantean' systems that network beneath that area. They literally control the entire Wall Street pyramid from below ... with more than a little help from reptilian bloodlines like the Rockefellers, etc. In fact, these reptilian genetic lines operate in a parasitic manner, the underground society acting as the 'parasite' society and the surface society operating as the 'host' society ... \" 22 A woman known as \"0\" claims to have seen the underground facilities at China Lake Naval Weapons Center in the California Desert, one of the major mind-control centres of North America.23 It straddles a large area and yet little can be seen above ground. I have twice driven around the outside of the base. On one side the public road runs alongside the perimeter fence for a while. The entrance to China Lake is in the little town of Ridgecrest and this is where \"D\" once lived. Ridgecrest is home to many mind-controlled slaves programmed at China Lake and it's not far from where the mass murderer Charles Manson and his \"Family\" used to live. \"D\" said she was chosen by the military for mind-control because of her bloodline."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 174 They had told her that before the development of language, humans communicated by telepathy thanks to a hormone secreted in the brain. This hormone, she was told, was no longer operating in most people, only in particular bloodlines, including hers, and they wanted to use these abilities. The period thousands of years ago when this telepathic human brain function was genetically suppressed was symbolised by the story common to most ancient cultures of the gods giving people different languages to divide them and stop them communicating. The universal language was telepathy and this was replaced by words. The use of telepathy maintained human sensitivity to other levels of consciousness while words hold people in the five-senses because they are a five-sense activity. That was the idea. \"D\" said she was taken underground at China Lake and saw the genetics laboratory and holding centre for captured humans and genetically engineered mutants. She described seeing horrendous creatures of all types, shapes and sizes at China Lake. She said she was shown these horrors to let her see what would happen to her if she did not cooperate and she claimed her own son had been murdered. Under China Lake, she said, a Reptilian sexually assaulted her and she saw another cut open the chest of a \"Grey\". \"D\" said that from her experience the Greys are terrified of the Reptilian leadership and do whatever they tell them. On another occasion, she said, she was taken to the Reptilian base under the appropriately named Death Valley, a relatively short drive from China Lake. There she said she saw a Reptilian leader, much taller than the others, who was wearing an Egyptian headdress with a cobra snake motif. Ancient and modern The stories of Reptilians and other non-human races living within the Earth in what we would today call \"bases\", cities, or tunnel networks, can be found widely described in ancient accounts. The Nagas, or serpent people, in India and throughout Asia and the Far East, were said to live in two main underground centres called Patala and Bhogavati. From there, according to Hindu legend, they battle for power with a 'white' race known by UFO researchers as the 'Nordics' (including the 'Lyrians') and located in the underground kingdoms of Agharta and Shambala. Tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed \"extraterrestrials\" are often reported by those claiming to have been abducted by \"ETs\". Hindus believe that Patala can be entered at the Well of Sheshna in Benares, while Bhogavati is believed to be in the Himalayas. Similar stories of underground caverns and tunnel systems can be found in Tibet and China. In the Gilgamesh stories of the Sumerian Tablets, we are told of underground cities. Gilgamesh was a \"demi-god\" and \"semi-divine\" (Reptilian hybrid) who sought the immortality of the 'gods'. The stories speak of KI-GAL or \"the Great Below\", which was ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal and the god Mergal. In the KI-GAL were violent guardians called \"scorpion men\", reanimated human bodies, spirits and the \"undead\", and robotic beings known as Galatur or Gala, which were used to abduct humans from the surface. There \\\\'ere \"eagle-headed\" Reptilians, which were often said to have wings. The accounts describe a race called the Pazazu, a dog-faced 'human' with reptilian scales and tail. All this sounds remarkably like the scenes described at Dulce today. Chinese legend claims there is an underground world entered from the Eastern Mountain of Taishan and it is guarded by vicious demons called Men Shen with animal-like faces or masks. This was the Chinese 'Hell' and it is said that the Lords of Hell interacted with the Dragon Kings on the surface. The Japanese 'Hell' or underground network was similar, and among the non-human entities were the Kappa, semi-aquatic reptilian humanoids and other shape-shifters who lived in mountains, under the ground or under the sea. In Viking-Norse legend they have the giant serpent, Nidhoggr or Jormungand, that lived underground and Ws was similar to the giant serpent Apophis in Egyptian myth. The Scandinavians and Germans had their Huldre or \"Hidden Folk\" who were also known as the elves. One of the codes for the bloodline is \"elven\" and the beings of folklore like trolls, etins, fairies, elves, troglodytes, Nefilim, Brownies or Braunies and the \"lit1le people\" of Ireland are all different names for the subterranean entities described in the modern accounts of 'ET bases'. All the same stories are associated with them - interbreeding with humans, unable to go out in the sunlight (like 'Dracula'), and all the rest. They even mention the 'missing time' experience of people abducted by the 'fairies' (like modem 'UFO' abductees) and include many stories of these underground folk killing and mutilating cattle and taking the blood. Michael Mott has produced an excellent collection of these stories on underground dwellers in folklore and myth in his book.25 He writes that England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all have endless traditions of underground peoples with many similarities and common origins between them. It seems to me that Scotland, Ireland and the British Isles in general are such a major centre for the Illuminati bloodlines because of the number of entrances to the underground world there are in that region. It is the same with other parts of the world like France, Germany and our old friends, the Caucasus Mountains. What is really under the Windsors' Balmoral Castle or the Queen Mother's Glamis Castle in Scotland, that highly significant country for Illuminati bloodlines? There is a legendary \"secret room\" at Glamis. According to a guest, the writer, Sir Walter Scott and others, it is the family's law or custom that the secret is known only to three people at anyone time. They take a \"terrible oath\" not to reveal the secret. Another guest, Lord Halifax, said that in 1875 a workman at the castle came across a door leading to a long"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 175 passageway. The man investigated, but then he saw something that made him run back in terror. When the 13th Earl of Strathmore was told what the workman had seen he persuaded him to accept money to emigrate and give his word never to reveal what he saw. Lord Halifax said that after the incident the Earl was a changed man, who became silent and moody, with an \"anxious, scared face\". The Norse/Germanic fairies, goblins, trows, knockers, brownies, leprechauns, sidhe (shee), tylwyth teg (terlooeth teig) and so on were either malevolent or indifferent to humanity, Michael Mott says. They lived, virtually without exception, under the ground. Mounds, hills, ruins, hill-forts, mountains, cliffs and ancient cities were said to be the \"rooftops\" of their palaces. Beings that mirror modem reports of the Sasquatch (Big Foot) and the Yeti (Abominable Snowman) can be found in ancient stories of underground creatures that come to the surface. Like the Nagas, the serpent people of Asia, European folklore often claimed that these \"fairy\" people entered their underground homes through lakes. Michael Mott continues: \"To remove all doubt as to their relationship with Norse hidden-folk and Indian Nagas alike, they shunned the sunlight [like Dracula], and often seemed interested in crossbreeding their own bloodlines with those of human beings, or even in crossbreeding their 'livestock' or fairy cattle, horses, hounds and so forth with the surface species which were most compatible. The goblin-dwarf, Rumplestiltskin, in his lust to have the human baby and its genetic bounty, is just one example of this in folklore. The elves took a regular interest in human affairs-weddings, births and deaths, (bloodlines), the success of crops and livestock, and so forth - but only for their own selfish interests. They seemed to be overly-concerned with genetic and biological diversity, and they pilfered livestock, crops and human genes via theft or cross-species liaison whenever they saw fit to do so. The elves are generally depicted as extremely fair-haired and fair-skinned.\" 26 The accounts even include the idea of being imprisoned underground waiting for the day of judgement. Michael Mott summarises the common attributes of the inner-Earth peoples of global folklore. The accounts are incredibly consistent over thousands of years. Mott writes: \"They are mostly reptilian or reptilian humanoids or 'fair' and Nordic; they are telepathic with superior mental powers; they can shape-shift and create illusions; they want to interbreed with humans and need human blood, flesh and reproductive materials; they have advanced technology; they have the secret of immortality; they can fly, either by themselves or with their technology; they mostly have a malevolent agenda for humans; they cannot survive for long in direct sunlight; they have been banished from the surface world or are in hiding from surface people and/or the Sun; they want to keep their treasures, knowledge and true identity a secret; they covertly manipulate events on the surface world; they have surface humans working for them through the priesthoods, cults and secret societies; they have a putrid smell like 'sulphur and brimstone'.\" 27 \"The reptilian aspect of some underworlders permeates folklore. One universal theme that recurs in the folktales of many, many cultures is that of the snake-husband or snake-wife, who can transform into a 'human' or humanoid form and is invariably (of course) of royal blood among his or her own kind (talk about the ultimate pick-up line!), Often the snake or serpent-man exacts a promise of marriage, or the hand of an unborn human child in betrothal, consistent with the theme of the subterranean's interest in maintaining their own genetic diversity. \"A variant of this should be familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in the form of 'The Frog Prince'. The frog-prince is a Handsome Prince, but like the Japanese seducing dragon, he has a reptilian or amphibian form. The underworld link is complete. for frequently the frog lives in a deep well, from which he is discovered or rescued by the female protagonist. A possible connection is evident in the Scandinavian belief that some dwarves would 'turn into toads\", if caught by the Sun, much like Mimoto's lover turned from a man into a 'dragon' when the same thing happened. Slovenia has its legends of fairies and 'little people', but Siovenian fairy tales are also permeated by the presence of the 'Snake Queen', a great, white, cave-dwelling creature who is part woman and part serpent. The serpentine-yet-human Nagas are still believed by devout., Hindus and some Buddhists to dwell beneath India, Nepal and Tibet.\" 28 The ancient and modern interconnecting accounts are overwhelming when you put them together. I have summarised here only a fraction of what has come to light in my research. You will find far more about the Reptilians in The Biggest Secret. Children of the Matrix and the Credo Mutwa video s~t, The Reptilian Agenda. By the late 1990s, one thing was clear. The difference between the world we live in and the one we are told we live in, was of a magnitude that almost defied belief.

But I began to realise that the conspiracy was not only a phenomenon of the 'five-sense' level of ality. It was also inter-dimensional. As I have already outlined, there are many levels of vibrational reality sharing e same space, just as radio and television frequencies do. Broadcast frequencies only interfere or become aware of each other when they are really close on the dial d the same principle applies to the realities and dimensions of existence that are aring the same space that we are now occupying. When people say that infinity is within you or, symbolically, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, they are correct. All infinity is within us because all of infinity shares all space. The point is, however, that we cannot see all of infinity with our five-senses, as you cannot hear all the radio stations available by tuning to one of them. My research led me to the understanding that while 'five-sense' non-human entities exist on this planet, the real focus of the global manipulation was with reptilian and other non-human entities operating from frequencies a fraction outside the frequency range accessible by human sight. From there they 'possessed' the 'human' bodies of the Illuminati bloodlines and used them as a vehicle to dictate events in our reality behind the veil of an apparently human form. Our five-senses can perceive only the denser vibrational fields that reflect light. As the vibration increases, it eventually reaches a point where we can no longer see it because it has gone beyond the frequency range of the five-senses. At this stage, to our five-sense reality, it 'disappears'. It has done no such thing; it has merely left e frequency range of our five-senses. It hasn't 'disappeared' any more than Radio 'disappears' when you retune to Radio 2. The five-sense range is so limited that e cannot perceive most of what exists in this universe alone. According to the test research, some 99.5% of the mass in the universe is lost to the five-senses. We only see matter that reflects light, what science calls 'luminous matter'. This is why, when you are in complete darkness, you can't see anything. Only when you traduce light to reflect from the objects around you can they be seen. Some 99.5% of mass in this universe is called 'dark matter' because it does not reflect light and we can't see it. A friend of mine, Giuliana Conforto, an Italian who trained as a physicist, explains all this in simple terms in her superb books, Man's Cosmic Game and Giordano Bruno's Future Science.! We have people making definite judgements and proclaiming certainties about the nature of life and creation when we can't even see 99.5% of our own universe! The official scientific explanations of life are blatantly absurd and when it comes to the big questions, the contradictions and anomalies, they have nowhere to go unless they change their foundation beliefs and misconceptions. This is now being forced upon establishment science by quantum physics which is demolishing all the long held 'certainties' about reality. An edition of the BBC science series Horizon in 2002 was devoted to the gathering acceptance among scientists of the existence of parallel universes or parallel realities, as I prefer to call them. The opening narrative to the programme said: \"For almost a hundred years science has been haunted by a dark secret, that there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond our human senses. Mystics have long claimed there were such places. They were, they said, full of ghosts and spirits - but ever since the 19th century physicists have been trying to make sense of an uncomfortable discovery. When they tried to pin point the exact location of atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly impossible. They had no single location. The only explanation that anyone could come up with is that the particles don't just exist in our universe. They slip into existence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different. In effect, there's a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in another the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in one you were never born. They are even stranger than Elvis being alive.\" Different era, same manipulators Appreciating the existence of these other realities is essential to understanding the way our 'world' is manipulated. It answers the question of why people would dedicate their lives to a plan for global domination when they know they will be dead long before the goal was reached. What if the entities controlling the 'bodies', the mental and emotional responses of those in power through the centuries, have"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 178 largely been the same ones all along? What if they operate just beyond the frequency range of the five-senses and use apparently 'human' physical bodies to manipulate the five-sense world and when one body gives up on them at 'death' they move into another and continue the manipulation, the long-term agenda, for another period of what we call 'time'? Cathy O'Brien recalls in Trance-Formation of America her experience with Bill and Bob Bennett, two well-known figures in US politics. Bill Bennett controlled American 'education' during the Reagan-Bush administration and is closely connected to the 'neo-cons' behind the Project for the New American Century and the American Enterprise Institute. Cathy says the Bennetts gave her mind-altering drugs at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control laboratory. They told her they were\" alien to this dimension - two beings from another plane\". Cathy continues: \"The high-tech light display around me convinced me I was transforming dimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognising anyone, I frantically asked: 'Who are these people?' \"'They're not people and this isn't a spaceship', [Bill] Bennett said. As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens. \"'Welcome to the second level of the underground. This is a mere mirror reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from a trans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions .. .' I have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishing stronger holds on your mind than the Earth plane permits' Bill Bennett was saying. 'Being alien, I simply make my thoughts your thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thoughts are your thoughts ... '\" 2 'Heaven' between heavens Thought transfer is another way that people are controlled and manipulated. The Reptilian mind becomes the human mind and you can see this happening all the time as the Reptilian 'hive' mind becomes the human 'hive' mentality. Between dimensions, in this case between the third dimension (the five-senses) and the next one, the fourth dimension, are little 'crevices' of frequency, almost like neutral zones. The Italian physicist Giuliana Conforto calls them \"inter-space planes\" and they lie between the dimensions or, as the scientists called them in the Horizon programme, parallel universes. It is in the inter-space plane, Giuliana suggested to me, that the Reptilians and other entities reside. This is the realm of the \"demons\" of folklore that have been frightening and manipulating humans for as long as ancient accounts record. I rang Credo Mutwa, the Zulu Sanusi (shaman) and official historian of the Zulu nation, to ask him if these 'inter-space planes' were part of his understanding. \"Oh yes\", he said. \"We call them the heaven between heavens and that's where the reptiles are.\" In frequency terms, the inter-space plane is very close to the range of the five-senses, but a fraction outside, just beyond the range that we can see. However, if someone with psychic sight can extend their vibrational range a little they can connect with that frequency range and see some of these entities and they do. People who have taken mind-altering drugs that break through the vibrational walls of the five-senses and allow their consciousness to see beyond it have had the same experience. Also, if these entities lower their vibration only slightly to enter the five-sense range they become visible to us here. As the Horizon science programme about parallel universes said: \"The only explanation that anyone could come up with is that the particles don't just exist in our universe. They slip into existence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different.\" It is possible for particles to move between 'universes' or 'realities' and 'dimensions' and so it is possible for entities to do the same. This is a major reason why the Illuminati bloodlines have taken part in their rituals from ancient times to the present day. The rituals allow them to connect with their masters in the inter-space planes, not least because human blood and the vibrational fields created by the rituals produce the frequency environment in which the Reptilians and other entities can manifest in the five-sense frequency range. Credo Mutwa has described to me how he witnessed rituals decades ago at which people in the room shifted from a human to a reptilian form, but there have been countless other people from very different cultures and backgrounds who have described the same experience of what happens once the blood begins to flow. \"Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved into darkness, using dark magic, calling up beings from the great deep below us. Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existing unseen by the children of earth-men. Only through blood could they form being, only through man could they live in the world. “ "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 179 The emerald tablets Ancient tablets, alleged to come from beneath a Mayan temple in Mexico, describe the Reptilians, their ability to shape-shift, and how they possess the bodies of people in power. The accounts correlate remarkably with modern experience and reports. They are known as the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, who was a deity of the Egyptians. It is claimed that they date back 36,000 years and were written by Thoth, an \"Atlantean Priest-King\" who, it is said, founded a colony in Egypt. His tablets, the story goes, were taken to South America by Egyptian \"pyramid priests\" and eventually placed under a Mayan temple to the Sun God in the Yucatan, Mexico. The translator of these tablets, Maurice Doreal, claims to have recovered them and completed the translations in 1925. But only much later was he given \"permission\" for part of them to be published, he says. You can read the whole tale and the content of the tablets on this website: http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html. There is also a book.3 However, you don't have to accept all the details of that story to appreciate the synchronicity between what these tablets say and what is now being uncovered. The tablets tell of the \"children of the shadows\" manipulating this reality: \"Speak I of ancient Atlantis, speak of the days of the Kingdom of Shadows, speak of the coming of the children of shadows. Out of the great deep were they called by the wisdom of earth-man, called for the purpose of gaining great power. \"In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the place whence they came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and planes unknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times they appeared among men. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwell among men. \"In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted. but appearing to man as men among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men. Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling o'er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and rule in his place. \"But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from the face of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to man and taught him the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among men. \"Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to the world. Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been said; again as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men. \"Called, may they be, by the master who knows the white or the black, but only the white master may control and bind them while in the flesh. \"Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear. \"Know ye, 0 my brother, that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all in the brightness, the shadow will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the voice of LIGHT is clear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear.\" Within that passage, whatever its origin may be, you have the story of life on Earth and the source of those who control the world today. The leading politicians, banking and business leaders, media owners and heads of the military are the \"serpent-headed beings\" hidden behind human form (or their puppets and stooges). They are the ones the Sumerian Tablets called the Anunnaki and the \"sons of the gods\" that the Bible calls the Nefilim. The background presented in the Emerald Tablets is confirmed by modern experience and information from the inside of the Illuminati. Here are some examples of what I mean: \"Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existing unseen by the children of earth-men.\" This is describing how the Reptilians and other non-human entities exist in the same space as we do, but in another \"cycle\" or frequency that we cannot normally perceive. To operate and manipulate our reality they needed a five-sense human form. They had to create a 'genetic space suit' that they could occupy and hide within. Cathy O'Brien says in her book, Trance-Formation of America, that President de la Madrid of Mexico told her this was achieved by creating bloodlines that fused their reptilian DNA with that of humans. These bloodlines have a genetic, therefore vibrational, compatibility between the Reptilians and their five-sense 'human' forms. This makes the possession or take-over of these bodies far easier and more effective than with other human genetic streams that do not have that particular DNA combination. It is to retain this genetic structure that the Illuminati bloodlines have always interbred with each other and"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 180 continue to do so. It means that if they can manipulate these bloodlines into the positions of power, they are putting themselves into those positions through their control of these bodies from their own frequency. This is the reason that the genealogy of those in the major seats of global power today can be traced back to the royal lines - the reptilian hybrids - that ruled Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and so on. The ancient Book of Enoch says that those born of Nefilim blood are, because of their \"ancestral spirit\" (Reptilian possession), destined to \"afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle and work destruction on the Earth\". The Nefilim are associated with human sacrifice and blood drinking - just like the Illuminati today. The Book of Enoch describes the behaviour of the Nefilim offspring produced with human women: \"And they became pregnant, and bore great giants ... who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh and drink blood. The Earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.\" That continues to be the mentality of those who manipulate events. Sharon Jacobs, who took part in many blood and sacrifice rituals under the mind-control of the Mormon Church, told me how Reptilians and other entities would possess the men impregnating women in the rituals. In doing so they would implant a frequency code in the DNA of the offspring that would connect them vibrationally to these inter-space plane entities. The vampires The Emerald Tablets also say: \"Only through blood could they form being, only through man could they live in the world.\" Insiders have told me that Reptilians need to drink human (mammalian) blood to maintain human form and stop their reptilian vibrational codes from manifesting their true reptilian state. Accounts of the Nefilim also include references to their blood-drinking activities, as we have seen. All this explains why these bloodlines have always taken part in human sacrifice and blood drinking rituals from the ancient world to the present day.

I have been writing for years about the ancient Satanic rituals performed by the elite of the United States at a place called Bohemian Grove. This is 2,700 acres of secluded and guarded redwood forest in Northern California. Cathy O'Brien tells in her book, Trance-Formation of America, of how she and her fellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusers at Bohemian Grove. These include Satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture and blood drinking. Cathy says: \"Slaves of advancing age or with failed programming were ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Grove and I felt it was only a matter of time before it would be me\".4 She says that the Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, including a Dark Room, a Leather Room, a Necrophilia Room and one known as the Underground Lounge, spelt as U.N.derground on the sign. In Figure 40, there is a photograph of robed and hooded men at the Grove standing alongside a large fire while worshipping a 40-foot stone owl- an ancient Illuminati symbol going back to Babylon and beyond (Figure 41). These world famous Illuminati initiates at Bohemian Grove bum and sacrifice a human 'effigy' under the owl at the start of their 'summer camp' every year. This happens during a Babylonian-type ritual called the Cremation of Care and in the year 2000 Alex Jones, an American radio talk show host, took a hidden camera into the Grove and filmed the ritual. He was too far aW3Y to see if the sacrifice. was an 'effigy' or real, but the human sacrifice rituals go on among the elite of the elite in much more secret and secluded locations during the 'camp', according to insiders. The Jones footage clearly shows the bizarre opening\" ritual and the sound quality is particularly good. At one point an 'effigy' is floated on a boat across the lake at Bohemian Grove where it is placed under the giant 'owl and set on fire. At this point you hear very clearly a blood-curdling scream and one of two things are happening. They are either sacrificing a human being in the guise of an \"effigy\" or they broadcast the sound of the scream of agony as part of the ceremony. Whichever, this is the mentality behind the Fourth Reich, just as it was with the Third. President George W. Bush, like his father and grandfather, is a Bohemian Grove attendee and arrived there shortly after the video was shot. The Jones footage appeared in a television documentary on the UK's Channel 4 in 2001, a programme that skimmed the surface of what really goes on at the Grove and missed a wonderful opportunity. Alex Jones's own video of the Grove footage is far better than the UK Channel 4 version and is available through www.Infowars.com. Among the participants at Bohemian Grove past and present are George Bush; George W. Bush; Al Gore; Ronald Reagan; Richard Nixon; Jimmy Carter; Gerald Ford; Dwight D. Eisenhower; Lyndon Johnson; Herbert Hoover; Teddy Roosevelt; Dan Quayle; Robert Kennedy (JFK's brother); Joseph Kennedy (JFK's father); Earl Warren (head of the Warren Commission, which 'investigated' JFK's murder); David Rockefeller; Laurance Rockefeller; Nelson Rockefeller; Henry Kissinger; Mikhail Gorbachev (the Soviet Union and the 'West' were always controlled by the same force); William F. Buckley, an American"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 182 publisher and major Illuminati operative; George Shultz, the former Secretary of State to Reagan-Bush, advisor to the 'election' campaign of boy Bush and leading light in Bechtul, the company with the massive contracts to 'rebuild' Iraq; Walter Cronkite, America's most famous news reader; William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper tycoon; Andrew Knight, a British media executive closely connected to the Rupert Murdoch Empire; Edward Teller ('Father of the H bomb'); Glenn Seaborg, who developed plutonium; Burt Bacharach, the composer; singer Bing Crosby; Bob Hope, a British MI6 operative and handler of mind-controlled 'multiples'; Ray Kroc, the man behind the McDonald's fast-food empire; author Mark Twain; and John Muir, founder of the Illuminati environmental front, the Sierra Club.' That's just a few of them. The Kennedys are a major bloodline family in the States, but everyone is expendable if the Illuminati agenda requires action to be taken. Many recovering mind-controlled slaves have told me how they were brutally sexually abused by Senator Edward Kennedy and one former mind-controlled operative with the Illuminati, a mind controller herself, told me: \"Senator [Edward] Kennedy and the whole Kennedy family was part of this. I know that they are political icons in our country, but they are in it up to their eyeballs\". Phillip Eugene de Rothschild says he is one of hundreds of thousands of unofficial Rothschild offspring. He stresses that often the most significant operatives in the Illuminati hide behind apparently 'ordinary' lives while dictating the agenda and attending human sacrifice rituals. This is my own information, too, after talking to Illuminati insiders. But he says that there are many public figures that are very high in the Illuminati-Satanic pyramid and he highlights Prince Philip as a major player in the rituals he has attended: \"I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not real brokers of occult power. Except for Alan Greenspan [head of the US Federal Reserve Bank], most of these fellows were camp followers in the occult, primarily for the economic power and prestige. Greenspan, 1 recall, was a person of tremendous spiritual, occult power and could make the Bushes and the younger Rockefellers cower with just a glance. Ex-CIA Director Casey (as were most of the CIA leadership for the past forty years), Kissinger, and Warren Christopher [former US Secretary of State] were in attendance at non-ritual gatherings and some occult rituals as well, but well back in the gallery. \"At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe]. Prince Philip at the pinnacle. He stands. like most of the contemporary European monarchy. in the Charlemagne. Merovingian. Aenean bloodline. But he is its current head. I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current ··antichrist'· Nephilim. Prince Philip ... is the leading biological descendent of the 'Reptilians', as you call them. Immediately below him are the males of my family line [Rothschilds] like a court of ministers in charge of logistics and operations. The current monarchs of The Netherlands. Spain, and some of the old Austrian nobility [Habsburgs] are next in occult power and in the conspiracy.\" 6 There is a lot of detailed background to Prince Philip and the Windsors in The Biggest Secret. Other information has come from the victims of the Illuminati mind control programmes, like Stewart Swerdlow, who was held at Montauk Point on Long Island, New York, which has been the subject of a number of publications. Stewart tells how he witnessed human sacrifice ceremonies at Montauk involving William F. Buckley, the well-known American publisher and Bohemian Grove member, who, I was told by Arizona Wilder, heads the elite Janus mind-control operation based at NATO headquarters in Belgium. Arizona says she has had similar experiences with Buckley. Swerdlow writes in his book, Blue Blood, True Blood that during his time in captivity at Montauk he often saw other apparently famous people at the rituals: \" ... Many well-known personalities came to participate. Some of these were political figures. while others were in the media or literary world. I remember seeing personages that looked like Sir Laurence Gardner. William F. Buckley. Sean Connery, Spiro Agnew, Henry Kissinger. John F. Kennedy, Jr .. the Shah of Iran. and numerous other actors. military personnel, and Middle Eastern figures. whose names I did not know. All, but Kennedy and Connery shape-shifted into Reptilian form during the ceremonies. \"On most occasions they gorge on fetuses harvested from abortion clinics. They also had live babies that they held up by the back of the neck. Then, they slashed its throat from left to right. ear to ear. biting down on the gaping opening to drink the blood. This was an amazing delicacy to them.\"- Telling tails Swerdlow says that the knowledge he learned at Montauk showed him how the Reptilians shape-shift. He said there are locked sequences and open sequences of DNA. Open codes manifest as a physical characteristic while closed codes do not. The Reptilian hybrids, he says, have the ability to lock off certain genetic codings while they open others. When this happens, he says, there is a literal transformation of the cellular structure, which changes from a mammalian to a reptilian form. \"So it's not like the human form goes anywhere\", he told me, \"It just shifts, it changes into a reptilian form because those sequences are opened. They also have the ability to shift it back\". However much your mind may be struggling to cope"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 183 with that, for sure what he says about DNA codes in general is correct. Some babies are still being born with tails because codes from our reptilian past have opened in those people when they should have remained closed and dormant. These tails are known today as caudal appendages and doctors usually remove them immediately. But in those areas of the world where that treatment is not available, people live their whole life with a tail. You only have to feel the bottom of your spine to see where our tails used to be and they do not manifest today, except rarely, purely because the DNA genetic blueprint is closed. Swerdlow is merely claiming that when you know what you are doing and understand DNA to a much greater level than human scientists currently do, you can make this code-opening and closing happen real fast. As the human foetus forms into a baby it goes through many stages that connect with major evolutionary points in the development of the present physical form. These include those that connect with non-primate mammals, reptiles and fish. At one stage, the embryo has gills and is very much like those of birds, sheep and pigs until the eighth week when it goes on its own evolutionary path. In the next few chapters we will see that the nature of what we think is 'real' is such an illusion that shapeshifting is small deal compared with what is possible. In fact, anything, literally anything, is possible. It could be no other way when you are dealing with an illusion on the scale I will describe in the third section of the book. As I outlined earlier, Stewart Swerdlow says the Reptilians need mammalian hormonal levels to hold the mammal codes open and maintain human form because their 'base-line' state is reptilian and the mammalian codes would close if they did not consume frequent supplies of human blood. They also want an adrenaline that enters the bloodstream in large quantities at times of extreme terror. Hence they have victims who know they are going to be sacrificed and they use the ritual to build their terror to the point of death. This allows them to drink blood full of that adrenaline. Arizona Wilder supplies the same information from her own horrific experience. She says that the blood type the Reptilians most desire is that of blond-haired, blue-eyed people, as I explained earlier, because it is the most effective for the purpose of holding human form. She, like almost every 'elite' mind controlled slave I have encountered, is blonde-haired and blue-eyed. They are also the ones most often chosen to be sacrificed by the Illuminati. Red-haired people also seem very important to them for the same reason and, most of all, they want the blood of pre-pubescent children and young women who have not had sex. This is to do with the purity of the blood and energy of children, and the changes that take place within the energy field once a person has experienced sex or puberty. Thus the Illuminati sacrifice children and young women more than anyone and this is the origin of the stories throughout history of sacrificing 'young virgins' to the gods. Feeding off fear Human blood is not the only target of these vampires. The Reptilians also feed off human emotional energy. Physicist Giuliana Conforto says that inter-space planes do not have a natural energy source like a dimension. They are like neutral zones. Any entities operating there would need to create an energy source for themselves and they have. It is human fear in all its forms. When we feel fear we generate a vibration, an energy field. Every time we think and feel, no matter what our state of being may be, we are sending out 'broadcast' waves that vibrate to the frequency of the particular thought or emotion. We feel these frequencies coming from people in what we call 'vibes'. The low vibration of fear and its associated emotions like anger, aggression, stress and guilt produce frequencies that pour into the inter-space plane and this has become the energy source of these Reptilian and other entities. The more humanity feels fear in all its forms the more energy - power - the Reptilians and other inter-space entities have to sustain them and use back against us. The entire Illuminati system has been designed to generate the energy of fear and turn the human population into an energy source. In the first of the Matrix movies, the character called Morpheus holds up a battery and says: \"The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change the human being into this.\" That is symbolically correct. The major children's movie called Monsters Inc, released by the Illuminati Disney organisation, had the same theme. The 'monster' world did not have an energy source and so they walked through 'doors' (symbolic of the interdimensional gateways) into children's bedrooms in the human world. There they would frighten children and when the kids screamed with fear the monsters would capture that energy in a tube and take it back through the door to power their world. This is one major aspect of September 11 th and its aftermath that is not acknowledged because it is so far from conditioned reality. But imagine the fear generated as a result of 9/11 and the two world wars, the 'war on terrorism', and a political, financial, business, military and media system that is specifically designed to maintain humanity in a constant state of fear, worry, stress and anger. Take another look at the microchipping programme from this perspective. Once people are microchipped they can be externally triggered through the chip to produce fear on demand. In the light of all this, look at this coded speech made by George W. Bush after 9/11. The Illuminati use reverse language to speak to each other, so black means white; \"we will\" means \"we won't\"; \"we do\" means \"we don't\"; and \"them\" and \"their\" means \"us\" and \"ours\":"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 184 \"The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a cult of evil that seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering. Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears.\" His speech writer could not have summed it up better: a cruelty that is \"fed, not weakened, by tears\". The more emotion we can be manipulated to project through fear and all its manifestations the more energy they can absorb and recycle against us. Researcher Alan Walton has uncovered the same themes: \"These vampirial types [of Reptilian] ... actually seek to feed off human emotional energies and life force/essence in order to acquire the energy that they apparently need not only to infiltrate our world but also our dimension. Having genetically engineered themselves along more 'warrior instinct' lines. what little connection they might have had to a 'spiritual' side has been all but eliminated, and they are motivated only by the predatory instinct of their collective which apparently knows only one agenda: conquer, assimilate, consume! All this has been confirmed by many abductees. especially in more recent years.\" 8 The whole Illuminati agenda is actually based on the terror of not survuvung and the Reptilian mind equates control and having far more than necessary with a better chance of survival. Most fundamentally to them their survival in the inter-space plane is dependent on humans continuing to be their energy source and their worst nightmare is for humans to discover the scam. They have also created a society in which most people are focussed on physical or financial survival and that locks them into the reptilian brain and the 'hive mind' they wish to impose on the population. Silent invasion All of these themes can also be found in the Emerald Tablets, as translated by Maurice Doreal: \"In the form of man moved they amongst us. but only to sight, were they as are men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as men among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men. Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling o'er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and rule in his place.\" This is a superb encapsulation of what has happened and is still happening. The Illuminati Reptilians manipulate their bloodlines into positions of power - \"the councils\" - and take over those bodies for themselves. It is what we call possession. The rituals conducted by the Illuminati-controlled secret societies like the Freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar, etc., are one way this is done. The major and ancient Illuminati families know who they are and their hybrid nature, but there are many other offshoots within societies all over the world who have no idea that they carry what has been described to me by insiders as the hybrid DNA \"corruption\". Nor are they trying to manipulate anyone. From what I have learned over the years, the DNA corruption lies dormant unless it is activated and until that point it has no effect on the person. Such people go through life oblivious of their bloodline. However, if they come into contact with the vibrational codes that activate the corruption then that is a very different story. They become seriously open to possession by the inter-space entities. This vibrational code or key is generated at the secret society rituals of the Illuminati network and this is another reason why they have performed the same basic rituals since ancient times. They are designed to produce the vibrational code that activates the DNA corruption and opens the vibrational door to the Reptilian entities. The children of Illuminati families are put through the rituals by their parents in the full knowledge that they are being opened to possession to allow the baton to be passed on to the next generation. Talk to anyone who has been involved in Satanism and they will tell you that its hierarchy is decided by the power of the demonic entities that you allow to possess your body during the rituals designed for this end. The theme of 'selling your soul to the Devil' is a valid one in the sense that Satanists allow their bodies to be possessed in return for power in the five-sense world. The same applies to the Illuminati and, in fact, Satanism is one of the major strands in their web. One way I have found to identify possessed people is that no matter what their facial expression may be, including laughter, the eyes never change. They maintain a cold, fixed, emotionless stare. I have seen few more glaring examples of cold Reptilian eyes than those of Hillary Clinton. Next time you see her, watch her eyes, the same with Bush and Blair. The Illuminati keep detailed records of who has the dormant DNA corruption. They have used genealogical libraries like the one at thg.Il1uminati-controlled Mormon Church in Salt Lake City, Utah, to do this, but the preferred method today is a global DNA database that they are now manipulating into being under the guise of stopping crime and terrorism. What happens to these unknowing 'corruption carriers' is that they are targeted by the Illuminati in the knowledge of who they are. They might be making a career in politics, the law, the military, the media and so on, and they will find that their careers suddenly take off and some"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 185 powerful people begin to support them. At this stage they are under the impression that this sponsorship by influential people is because of their ability or, in the case of politics, because the supporters believe in 'what the target stands for. But in truth it is because of their DNA. At some point the target is invited to join the secret society network as a good career move and they are put through the rituals that activate the DNA corruption. Still they will have no idea of what is going on, as only a tiny few Freemasons know what their bizarre initiation rituals really mean and are structured to achieve. Once the target's DNA possession code is triggered by the rituals the process of possession by the inter-space entities begins to unfold. The person's thoughts, emotions and attitudes start to change until they are a fully possessed being. How many times do we hear former friends and colleagues of those in power say that they are not the same people they once knew? We are led to believe that these changes of personality are due to the influences of power - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Of course, there is some validity in this, but the main reason for the personality change is quite simply that they are no longer the same being, let alone the same character. \"Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling o'er man.\" These are the people who become the presidents, prime ministers, banking and business tycoons, media owners and others who run or administer the Anunnaki agenda, although the most powerfully Reptilian are those who dictate from behind the scenes: \"Sought they from the Kingdom of Shadows [inter-space plane], to destroy man, and rule in his place.\" Meeting their masters Another reason for the Illuminati obsession with rituals is to allow other dimensional Reptilians and other entities to manifest before them. Some researchers suggest that the Reptilian faction behind the Illuminati was banished from the surface of the Earth and this five-sense reality by closing the interdimensional 'portals', which allowed them to move into this reality or density very easily. These portals are vortex points on the Earth where dimensions connect and these are often the places held most sacred by the ancients. I have been told a number of times over the years that the Caucasus Mountains are the location of a major portal. The portals are similar in theme, if not detail, to the one featured in the film Stargate, the story of an ancient Egyptian people controlled by high-tech, extraterrestrial 'gods'. In their rituals, the Satanists summon the manipulating entities into their presence by creating the vibrational 'doorways' that allow them to manifest. Words, colours and symbols all vibrate energy and the secret rituals use the combinations that have the required vibrational effect. Researcher Alan Walton writes: \"Some claim that the Crowleyan [Satanic] rituals and Montauk [technology] projects have been very useful to them in ... tearing holes in the fabric of space-time that separates our dimension from theirs.\"! As the Emerald Tablets say: \"Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to the world\" and \"Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been said.\" (Illuminati rituals to open the 'stargates'); \"Again as time passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men\" (which they have). This theme of sealing the portals might be described in the Bible's Book of Revelation, which clearly describes the 'Devil' or 'Satan' in reptilian terms. It tells of St Michael, an ancient Sumerian/Phoenician deity, defeating the dragon: \"And the great dragon was cast down. the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to Earth and his angels were cast down with him. \" ... And he laid hold on the dragon. the old serpent. which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss. and shut it. and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more.\" 10 This could also relate to being condemned to live in the inner-Earth. The vibrational veil \"Only by magic could they be discovered. only by sound cou ld their faces be seen ... But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from the face of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to man and taught him the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then they lifted the veil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among men.\" I have learned from a number of sources that the key to lifting this \"veil from the face of the serpent\" is a sound frequency that disrobes the illusion of human form to reveal their reptilian nature. It resonates a vibration that prevents them from holding their 'human' cover. This same theme can be found in the movie, They Live (Alive Films 1988). This was the creation of director John Carpenter and it offers a visual portrayal of a non-human race controlling the planet while hiding within human form. Carpenter's entities control in exactly the same way as the Illuminati, through secret societies, mind conditioning and ownership of the media. In the end, the heroes of the movie reveal the conspiracy when they break the vibrational sound frequency that is maintaining the illusion that those in power are human. Immediately that vibration"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 186 is destroyed, the president and others in power and influence shift into their true form and the people can see who is really ruling them. \"Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only the master of brightness shall conquer the shadow of fear ... Know ye, 0 my brother, that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all in the brightness, the-shadow will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the voice of light is clear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear.\" Those who dabble without knowledge in what has become known as the 'occult' open themselves to manipulation by these entities, Reptilians and otherwise. The inter-space plane is home to many misguided, malevolent entities, and this is the origin of the legends and tales of demons and 'evil' spirits. In fact, the word 'occult' has been given an unfairly bad name. It merely means 'hidden' and the same knowledge can be used for good or ill. If you use the 'occult' knowledge with love in your heart and positive intent, you maintain a high vibration and connect with that level of consciousness. If you use it without understanding (like those who play with ouija boards) or with ill intent, you can connect yourself with the malevolent vibrational range that this represents. The emphasis in the Emerald Tablets on living without fear is also a vital point. This is how we are controlled and it is the inter-space energy source - the fear of what others think of us; fear of death; fear of being alone; fear of poverty, fear for our families and children; fear of war. The list is endless. The emotion of fear resonates to the frequency range of the inter-space entities and when we are consumed by fear we are much easier for them to influence and control. The hidden 'team' With the knowledge that we are manipulated by 'human' bodies possessed by nonhuman, other-dimensional entities, the apparently complex, mysterious and contradictory begins to come into clearer focus. People think that Americans would not slaughter Americans, for example, and government agencies could not have been involved in the planning of 9/11. But the leaders are not American; they are Reptilians and other non-human entities possessing a 'human body' that was 'born' in America. It is the same with the leaders in Britain, Spain, Pakistan, China, Germany and all the rest. These possessed 'leaders' have no allegiance to the people of these nations, their only allegiance is to themselves as Reptilians that have been manipulating this world for aeons to create a global centralised fascist state through which they can control a microchipped, constantly monitored population. Their allegiance is to a long-planned conspiracy to create a structure in which every child born into this five-sense world is immediately microchipped and turned into an externally manipulated and controlled battery to provide an energy source for the inter-space entities that are running the show by occupying physical bodies. I have symbolised the structure of this Reptilian control in Figure 42. The Illuminati manipulate their bloodlines (in other words the inter-space entities) into the positions of power across the world through their secret-society network in each country. Most of these leaders in the various countries are working to the same goal and they often only appear to be in conflict for the purposes of deluding the people into a false reality. There is also great rivalry on one level between different elements of the Illuminati because as one researcher told me years ago: \"They are like a gang of bank robbers. They all agree on the job, but then argue about how the spoils are shared out.\" Those who are consumed by the desire for power and control are not going to switch that off when it comes to having power over those on the same side. But they all depend on the agenda for their collective power over humanity and that is the cement that holds the warring factions together. The Reptilian leaders of the various countries play out a pre-arranged plan that appears "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 187 Figure 42: The leaders in different countries may appear to be from different 'races' with an allegiance to their 'nation'; but they are mostly from the hybrid bloodlines, possessed by Reptilian entities working to the same goal of global domination. There is disagreement and conflict between them over power and detail, but they are united by the same overall agenda to the public to be the random result of random events. But in fact, as the Illuminati puppet Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: \"Whatever happens in politics you can bet it was meant to happen.\" The leaders of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Russia, China etc ... are not American, Arab, Pakistani, Russian and Chinese, except in their outer five-sense form. They are Reptilian-possessed beings working to the same agenda and what appears on the 'news' is a movie designed to obscure the truth. They answer to a strictly hierarchical structure and anyone is expendable when the agenda demands it. The Li bloodline in China, for example, is one of the major Illuminati bloodlines on the planet and this has been bred into other races over hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years to the point where it does not manifest as a 'Chinese' body, but still maintains the corrupted DNA. This happened, for example, when the 'Golden Horde' flooded into the Caucasus and Eastern Europe to interbreed with the bloodlines that came from Sumer and Egypt. A fellow researcher contacted me to say that he had an excellent Chinese source that claimed to have seen the Illuminati Li family 'tree' and saw that it· connected to Bill Clinton and the Bush family. Funnily enough, I have always thought that Colin Powell looked far more Asian than African-American. The Reptilian bloodlines do not relate to an Earth race, they have infiltrated all races and cultures. The Reptilian entities in the positions of power manipulate the peoples of the world to fight each other in the five-sense prison and in doing so advance their structure of global centralisation while producing vast quar1,tities of fear to feed their own 'world'. The human race has been duped all this time and never more so than now. The conditioned reality they are programmed to accept prevents them from seeing the malevolent game that is being played out all around them. The idea of Reptilians controlling their lives by hiding within human form is beyond most people's comprehension because it is so far from their conditioned sense of possibility. They have never been told the vibrational truths nor had access to the ancient and modem evidence and information that would tell them a very different version of reality. There is still much to know before we can fully understand how these apparently bizarre concepts and experiences fit together. But after all these years of travelling and research, I \"can see that one level of this amazing story is that otherdimensional entities with a definite reptilian emphasis are possessing certain hybrid bloodlines that are manipulated in to the major positions of power. We see only the 'human' level of them with our five-senses, but beyond that frequency veil our world is being controlled by entities that look nothing like we do. What you have read so far will appear fantastic beyond words compared with the 'world' sold to us through 'education' and the media. Shape-shifting Reptilians controlling global society? Are you kidding?? But, as my journey continued, I realised that not even this was the end of the story. Far from it.

Jean Toomer I had long understood that our 'real' world was only an illusion generated from our minds, but in January 2003 and the months that •. followed I was to 'see' this for myself in a way that taught me so much more about the 'Matrix' through which the human family is held in 'disconnected' servitude. I was invited to speak at a gathering of people at a location in the Amazon rainforest about an hour's drive or so from Manaus in northern Brazil. The event, over ten days, would offer the participants the opportunity to experience the 'psychoactive' effects of a plant called ayahuasca, which has been used by South American shamans for hundreds of years (at least) to take people into other states of consciousness beyond the five-sense realm. Ayahuasca is known as the 'teacher plant' because it allows people to experience these unseen realms where so much can be learned about self, life and reality. It is also dubbed the 'plant of the gods', no doubt because it can allow you to see those dimensions where the 'gods' of myth reside. In fact, it was the number of times that participants at these events had seen reptilian entities and imagery in their altered states of awareness that led the organisers to invite me. Ayahuasca is much used in religious ceremonies and rituals in parts of Brazil and it is quite legal in such circumstances. Around the 'Western World' it is largely illegal to own or take the brew, as it is with potions in general that can transport our conscious awareness beyond the five-senses. I wonder why?? I jumped at the chance to accept the Amazon offer, although I had some reservations at one point when I learned of the possible physical effects of vomiting and shitting with a vengeance. Once I was assured that the participants would be made well aware of this before they proceeded, I agreed to be there. I knew this was the dimensional door I was looking for to take the next step in my journey. I had reached the age of 50 without consuming a single drug or potion that was labelled 'psychoactive'; no magic mushrooms, no nothing. But I could go no further in my understanding without taking my conscious awareness to places beyond the veil. I also learned that even those who were regular experiencers of mushrooms and other such reality changers were aware that ayahuasca was immensely powerful. \"You have never taken anything and you are starting with that?\" I was asked. Ayahuasca contains many powerful hallucinogenic properties including Dimethyltryptamine or DMT, a naturally occurring component of the metabolism of mammals and plants. DMT is known by some as the 'spirit molecule'. In January 2003 I arrived in the Amazon with my wife, Pamela. In the two weeks before, as we had travelled the Native American lands of northern Arizona, I had been hearing a clear 'voice' (thought transference or telepathy) in quiet moments communicating information that proved to be remarkably accurate. Some of the detailed messages I was given seemed blatantly at odds with the way events were looking, but the circumstances changed and the 'voice' was confirmed to be correct. When I first arrived at the Amazon location I had some unease and I decided, as always, to let synchronicity and intuition guide my decisions about whether and when to take the ayahuasca. I was not going to do anything just because others did so or because it was written in the schedule. The night before the first ayahuasca session the 'voice' said that I would not be taking it with the rest of the group the following evening, but instead I would be taking it on my own. This seemed strange and made no sense because the sessions were arranged for every other day and all the people were due to experience the effects together in a large round house specially built for the purpose. The next day I went back to Manaus to work on the Internet to keep up with events and provide postings for my website, www.davidicke.com. There was plenty of time to get there, do the work, and get back for the ayahuasca session. But two people who came with me had problems with arrangements they had to make and although my work was finished I had to wait for them because we were sharing the same vehicle. When at last we arrived in the darkness at the Manaus ferry for the river crossing on the return journey I saw it was just leaving and we had to wait ages for it to come back. Even when we were within sight of the location our flashing headlights did not for some time attract the attention of those who needed to bring a boat to transport us across a river inlet. Add all these delays together and the ayahuasca session had already started by the time I returned. I was tired and frustrated and not in the space I wanted to be in. So I missed the session and later asked to take the potion or 'tea' the next night by myself. This is what happened and the voice had been correct. Around 9 o'clock in the evening I took the ayahuasca in the form of a drink in a small glass. I thought it tasted a bit like liquorice. I was in the big wooden 'round house' building, alone in the darkness, except for Zoe, {me of the organisers, who has experimented with all kinds of such drugs and their combinations."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 191 There can't be much left of the rainforest that he has not drunk or smoked! I liked Zoe. We didn't always agree to say the least, but he's a nice man with a big heart. I have heard it said that the plant takes you here or takes you there. I don't agree with that. I think that ayahuasca opens the channels (or rather deludes you into thinking it does) and allows you to take yourself in conscious awareness to where you already are. Some will see dark places that reflect subconscious states and others will go to paradise. Where people are at in their deeper levels may not be where they appear to be in their conscious lives. A happy-go-lucky five-sense personality, for example, can be a front to hide subconscious emotional trauma that can manifest as a 'dark' ayahuasca experience. By the way, I will state the obvious because sometimes that can be missed. The subconscious is only subconscious to the conscious mind. At its own level of awareness, it, too, is conscious and has a different reality to the five-sense 'conscious mind' that directly experiences this 'world'. Also, what is the subconscious? It is all that is not conscious to the five-sense realm. In other words, it is infinite. Like the conscious mind, the subconscious can be caught in the illusion or be aware of its infinity. Which level of the infinite subconscious that is communicating with the conscious mind will obviously make a fundamental difference to the way people see themselves and their sense of reality. It is the difference between knowing you are an expression of the Infinite One or believing you are an 'ordinary' and 'powerless' nonentity .. I began to feel the effects of the ayahuasca pretty quickly and I felt nauseous and agitated. I then began to scream out years of pent up frustration and I mean scream. The frustration going back to the days of the mass ridicule, the suppressed emotion I didn't know was there, was unleashed into the darkness. Good riddance. Some people, as I was to learn, can vomit to Olympian proportions after taking ayahuasca, while others have no such effect. The idea is to hold it back until at least an hour after you have taken the plant because by'1:hen it has 'metabolised' and can do its work. Zoe's announcement during the sessions of \"One hour - you may vomit now if you wish became one of my abiding memories of the event. Anyway, vomit I did not and after my screaming session I went back to the mattress on the floor feeling incredibly calm and at peace. When the ayahuasca effects kick in you go into altered states when you close your eyes and you see bright, swirling colours and images. But as soon as you open your eyes you are back in five-sense reality, albeit in a slightly altered form. I liked that because comparing the two was interesting. The more powerful the experience becomes the less you want to open ' your eyes and when you do they don't want to stay open for long. Anyhow, that is what happened to me, especially on the second night. The 'One' I was soon to understand why I was doing this first session by myself because I started to speak out loud and that would not have been possible with everyone else in the room having their own experiences. I remember most of the words and all of the themes quite clearly. As I lay on my back looking up at the pitch darkness, my arms stretched out, much as they did in a standing position on the mound in Peru. Out of my mouth, in a very different voice to 'David Icke', came the words, slowly and powerfully, \"I am love\". I then began to repeat: \"I am everything and everything is me, I am infinite possibility.\" With that I felt a fantastic energy pour from my heart chakra and fill the room. A strip light on the ceiling began to flicker on and off. After a few minutes, three of the lights came on full power. I looked across and thought, \"Why has Zoe turned the lights on?\" But he hadn't. The lights were all switched off and they had come on by themselves without electricity. Then the equipment playing music switched off and came back on again after ten seconds or so. Weird stuff on the face of it, but I could understand why an energy of the power I was experiencing could effect the electrical circuitry. I clearly felt an energy coming out of my heart chakra and arching from there to my head. The words I was speaking came through this source. I even called Zoe over to ask if this was what usually happened. He said everyone was different. I began to speak fluently in my altered state. It wasn't that I had thoughts and then articulated them in speech. The words just came from my mouth and that is the first I knew of them. I will summarise what they said and what came to me even more powerfully in another form the following night. In the following two chapters I will detail some of the gathering wealth of evidence among open-minded scientists to support what I was told. Some of the information can't be yet verified 'scientifically' and you will have to use your intuition to decide what you make of it. But much of it can. I was told in my altered states that all that exists is one infinite consciousness, which was referred to as 'The Infinite', 'Oneness' and the 'One'. In our manipulated, illusory, reality we had become detached from the One..(J.n our minds, though not in fact) and therefore we viewed everything in terms of division and duality instead of seeing that all is connected, all is the same Infinite Oneness. This illusory sense of disconnection is the mind prison I call the Matrix. The time loop My words in the first ayahuasca session said that the five-sense 'world' that we daily experience is a 'time loop' that goes around and around basically repeating the same sequence in theme if not detail. What we call"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 192 the 'future' eventually becomes the 'past' and spins around to repeat the 'present' over and over. That old Jimmy Ruffin song I've Passed This Way Before should be the anthem of the planet, it would seem. The lyrics say: Life lends a crushing blow And once again a heart is broken And as history repeats itself These few words are sadly spoken I've passed this way before And I've felt this pain before A hurt that took so long to end Has found my poor heart again This is basically what happens in the Time Loop. The same experiences keep repeating. The cover picture of this book was produced by an artist friend, Neil Hague, from a design and information I gave to him that symbolised what I learned in the ayahuasca sessions (Figure 43, overleaf). I would emphasise that the picture is only symbolic because I was told that the Matrix is a vortex, like a whirlpool in a river, with the Time Loop - our five-sense reality - in the densest part of the spiral. Think of the Matrix as a whirlpool and the Infinite Oneness as the river. The Matrix. is still the 'river', the Infinite One, but, like a whirlpool or eddy, it is operating in its own little world to its own agenda. What has happened, I was told in my altered states, is that the Matrix has forgotten it is the Infinite - the whirlpool has forgotten it is the river. Vortices can be remarkably stable if the circumstances don't change too drastically. Observe a whirlpool in a river and so long as the flow of water continues in a certain direction and speed the vortex will hold indefinitely. In the same way, the Matrix/Time Loop is going around and around in a perpetuating spiral or cycle that has become a prison for the consciousness trapped by its seductions and illusions. The imprisoned consciousness, too, has forgotten it is Infinite Oneness. Conversations with the 'One' On the first night I spoke the words out loud and on the second I heard a powerful female voice as clear as can be that added much more detail. This is what I was told over those two nights in altered states lasting a total of some six to seven hours. I will refer to the communicator as 'the voice'. The Time Loop is encased within a Matrix of 'non-physical levels' that have also lost contact with Infinite Oneness. These 'non-physical' dimensions of the Matrix are symbolised in the cover illustration by the ball of netting that encompasses the Time Loop. The 'nonphysical' levels are the dimensions to which most 'human' consciousness returns after a 'life' in the five-sense realm at the moment we call 'death'. It is free of the physical body, but it is still caught in the Matrix. I will come back to this later. The very fact that we believe in time is confirmation of the illusion that we take to be 'real'. Time does not exist, except in our minds. What we call 'time' is the illusion of passing through something. But if we are already everything, how can we pass or travel through ourselves? So how can there be 'time'? If we symbolise the human body as the Infinite, how can your body travel through your body? It is already the whole body to start with and how can it travel through itself? When everything is One, there can be no 'time', only all things existing and expressing in the infinite NOW. 'Past' and 'future' are illusions designed to entrap us in disconnection. They are different realities happening at the same moment, in the same infinite NOW. The apparent sequence of one era following another in passing 'time' is an illusion of the Time Loop. Subconscious mind had become imprisoned by fear, the voice said, and this had caused the illusion of disconnection from the Infinite or Infinite Love, the only 'is' that we all are. This had reached such proportions that these lower levels of subconscious mind had developed a deep and deepening fear of the unknown that lay beyond its 'disconnected' awareness. It had forgotten that it is Infinite Love and that what lay outside of its apparent boundaries was also Infinite Love. To ease its fear of the unknown, subconscious mind had created a collective thought projection - a sort of three-D 'movie' - that I refer to as the Matrix. How this is done, collectively and individually, I will discuss when I get to the scientific research into the nature of reality and how we create it. The Matrix is a self contained system that has lost contact with the Infinite that exists beyond its illusory reality. In fact, it is the Infinite; everything is and can only be. But it has simply forgotten. The voice said that the key level of the Matrix is the repeating time loop that we know as the five-sense world. This is the 'power station' that feeds the whole system. The loop was created to provide familiarity that eased the fear of the unknown and was a very much more pleasant experience at first than it is in our reality. When people are in fear, the voice went on, they find comfort in the familiar and predictable and this had happened on a collective level of subconscious mind. It was a way for consciousness to whistle in the dark, giving itself comfort in the familiar. What is humanity's biggest fear in our daily experience? Fear of the unknown. Subconscious mind created a dream world that was to become a nightmare. Seven months after this experience in Brazil, I came across an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness had begun as a ripple that decided to leave the ocean of consciousness - the \"timeless, space-less and eternal\" "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 193 Figure 43: The Time Loop symbolised by artist, Neil Hague. The five-sense 'world' is an illusory 'loop' of manufactured 'time' in which the 'future' becomes the 'past'. It is the human equivalent of a mouse running around on a wheel in a cage When it awakened to itself in this 'disconnected' state, the myth said, it forgot that it was part of the infinite ocean and felt isolated and separated. This is basically what the voice told me had happened. Wilson Bryan Key described the human attitude to the unknown very well in The Age of Manipulation: \"Humans detest uncertainty. Uncertainties produce anxieties. To reduce anxiety, if no factual structure is readily available, humans will simply invent one or accept a ready to wear media reality structure ... these perceptions, of course, are fictional constructs.\" 2"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 194 The voice said that this emotional state had led collectively to the creation of the illusion - the Matrix - that humans believe to be real. The Frankenstein Matrix At this point the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop were still only a collective mind projection of the type now being identified by the more enlightened expressions of science. This projection was dependent for its survival on subconscious mind continuing to hold that reality, much like a movie projector beaming on a screen. Once the projector is turned off (in this case the sense of reality changes) the movie disappears too, and another is created to reflect the new sense of what is real. How this is 'done can be explained very simply and I will do that in the next chapter. However, the thought projection itself took on a 'life' of its own when it gained access to an energy source independent of that which was projecting it. This energy source, the voice went on, was fear. The Matrix - the projected reality of subconscious mind - absorbed the energy of fear generated particularly within the 'five-sense' Time Loop and took on a life and agenda of its own. That agenda was to generate as much fear as possible to empower itself even further. The Matrix became a Frankenstein. The created or projected thought field had accessed an energy source to become a creator and projector of its own illusory reality. As these words were being spoken, I was shown scenes from the Disney cartoon movie, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which the sorcerer had created an entity to do all the jobs he didn't want to do, but then the entity had taken over events and become the sorcerer's controller. Subconscious mind created the Matrix/Time Loop as a predictable, familiar 'world', but it had lost control. Both subconscious and conscious 'five-sense' mind were subject to the manipulation of this now self-aware 'entity' that the Matrix had become. \"Humanity is controlled by deception?\" the voice said. \"No, humanity is controlled by self-deception.\" The subconscious had created the prison from its disconnected state of self-deception and now it and the conscious mind were sitting in a cell of their own making, with the 'cell' dictating events. The reason why the Matrix projection needs the energy of fear to empower itself is because it is fear, self-aware fear, the voice said. It had been created originally by the fear of subconscious mind and, as projected fear, this is the only energy source the Matrix entity could access and absorb. The more fear its manipulations generate through wars, conflict, stress, guilt and aggression etc., the greater its power to increase this cycle of fear production. Reptilian programs The ultimate manipulator of the Matrix and its five-sense Time Loop, the voice said, was the very fabric of the Matrix itself and its power source was the consciousness trapped within its vibrational walls. The Matrix was a self-ware entity that was knowingly manipulating to ensure its own survival by generating the events'- - \" necessary to produce the fear that empowered it. Humans were indeed 'batteries' or power stations for the Matrix and we were providing the power to maintain our own prison. The Reptilians did 'exist', said the voice, but they were holographic thought projections of the Matrix very much like the agents or 'sentient programs' that manipulate in the Matrix movies. They could either operate as a reptilian projection or hide behind an apparently 'human' form, just as the sentient programs morph in and out of different human forms in the movies. Either way, the Reptilians and other projected agents of the Matrix were not 'real' in consciousness terms; they were projections, thought fields or highly sophisticated software programs. The existence of such thought-projected holographic phenomena is now supported by scientific research and experiment, as we shall see. Holograms are projections of energy or 'light' that appear to the observer to be a three-dimensional form, but in fact they are a series of codes and wave patters that only take on the illusion of 3-D when a laser is shone upon them. Or in the case of the holographic projections in the Matrix, when they are observed into illusory reality by the human mind. In the next chapter I will explain how this works. It is so simple. As I was told with great clarity in my second ayahuasca experience, the whole of five-sense reality is a holographic illusion that only exists in a 'solid' form because the human mind/brain makes it appear that way. The '3-D' world of landscape, seas, buildings and human bodies, only exists in that form when we look at it! Otherwise it is a mass of vibrational fields and codes. In the movies, the Matrix is depicted from the outside as a series of green numbers and codes, while inside it is experienced as the sort of world we think we live in - mountains, streets, cars, people and so on. That is a good analogy, I know this all sounds fantastic at first hearing, but these themes are now being confirmed at the cutting edge of scientific research. The voice said that when the Reptilians absorbed human fear they were absorbing it for the Matrix itself because they are projections of the Matrix. But they were not aware of this. Indeed, the Reptilians, other"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 195 'demonic entities', and the Illuminati hierarchy were not aware of who their ultimate master really was - the Matrix itself. The manipulators were also being manipulated. The Reptilian 'sentient programs' did not have human emotion, the voice said, because they were just that, 'sentient programs', and are not conscious in the way humans are conscious. \"If you programmed a computer to kill children, would that computer have any emotional problems with that?\" the voice asked. No, it would just follow the programming because computers do not have emotion. They do what they are programmed to do. It was the same with the Illuminati and the 'Reptilians' - they were, in effect, like highly sophisticated computer software. They were like digital people implanted in the movies alongside human actors. They appear to be the same, but they are not. Unemotional computers can process information faster and more efficiently than human conscious minds in a disconnected state and, in the same way, the sentient program projections of the Matrix have been able to out-fox and out-think humans. But this can only continue until humanity remembers who it really is and where it really comes from, and reconnect with its true and infinite self. Then the projected holographic manipulators will have intelligence akin to counting beads compared with human potential and, as I was told, that moment is fast approaching. This is what happened symbolically to the Neo character in the first Matrix movie when he awakened to the illusion of life and death and the dream world he had been living in. Once he reached that point of reconnected awareness, the agents, the sentient programs, all-powerful until then, were suddenly no problem to overcome. \"Love does not abandon\" The voice said that the Matrix, and particularly the five-sense Time Loop, had become so vibrationally dense, and the imprisoned consciousness so lost in the illusion, that the Infinite One was intervening in the 'game'. Control of the Matrix and the Time Loop were in the process of being dismantled so that entrapped consciousness could return 'home\"' to conscious reconnection with the Infinite. I heard many times in my a1tered~ but \"self-aware state: \"Love does not abandon.\" There were no chosen ones whom 'God' had selected. There was no 'God' as humans perceived it, only the infinity or 'Oneness' of existence. \"All would be gathered in\", the voice said, \"and no sheep would be left in the field alone.\" The Infinite was the balance of all things, while the Matrix was calculated and manipulated imbalance, in which Oneness had been divided into polarities and dualities of 'light' and 'dark', 'good' and 'bad', male and female and all the rest. These polarised states of duality not only offered the massive potential for fear and conflict, they also ensured that such imbalance and division would disconnect mind from a sense of balance and Oneness - the Infinite. Without such division and polarised reality there could be no Matrix. The process of removing the Matrix control was well advanced, the voice said. Expressions of the Infinite had entered the Matrix and especially its densest level, the Time Loop, to anchor the energy that would break up the fear vibration that held it together. These expressions of the Infinite taking human form had not been aware of their role for most of their 'physical' lives and many were still not. This was because they had to experience the emotional and mental states that held humanity in disconnected servitude and in doing so attune themselves to the low vibrational frequencies of these states of being. When this was done the Infinite could feed its energy of Oneness and balance through such 'people' and transform those mental and emotional frequencies on which the Matrix and the Time Loop depend. This is represented in the cover of the book by the hole in the Time Loop /Matrix. After the first session of ayahuasca in which these matters were addressed, I recalled a communication I had been given through a psychic in 1990 that said: '\" feel you are sensing now the energies coming in, the energies surrounding your planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many of you to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to go, what you want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these upheavals are very confusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people in partnerships are finding they can no longer continue in those partnerships because their partners cannot tune into what they are tuning into. It is causing a great deal of disturbance ... \" ... As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you light workers who are working to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a catalyst to be able to feed in more and more energies.\" This was a more basic version of what I learned in these ayahuasca experiences. Valerie Hunt, professor of kinesiology at the University of California in Los Angeles, has developed the use of technology to measure the human energy field and this has confirmed that a person's state of mind affects their vibrational speed or frequency. Those focussed only on five-sense reality are the lowest and the more people are using their higher senses the higher the frequency of their energy field.3 This is the reason for the phrase ... \"As the consciousness level of your planet raises itself, those of you light workers who are working to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more and more refined vibrations.\" Or, as the voice told me, the more the Infinite expressed itself in the Matrix through its incarnate aspects, the more people would begin"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 196 to feel its manifestation and be transformed by its harmony and balance to awaken and remember who and what they really are. The veil of ignorance would lift from their vibrational 'eyes' and they would remember they were all that exists - the One. This is the transformation - the 'Truth Vibrations' - that I was told about when my mind was first blown in 1990. As I have travelled the world since then, I have seen how this phenomenon has become so apparent and continues to gather pace by the day. I was told that the transformation of entrapped consciousness, from the illusion of disconnected limitation to reconnected infinity, is now happening. The voice emphasised that this was not a 'maybe' and that we were seeing the last desperate death throes of Matrix control. \"00 you think the Infinite is going to have a problem with George Bush?\" it said, laughing. This did not mean that we just had to sit around and wait for all this to happen. We were the Infinite and we all had roles to play in the transformation of this reality. The Infinite was expressing itself at all levels of the Matrix as those in conscious awareness exposed its illusions. I was told that the most important level of the Matrix that had to be transformed was the 'five-sense' Tune Loop. This was the densest level and it acted as an 'anchor', or like a light that captivates the moths, and it provided most of the 'fear energy' that sustained the Matrix entity. The transformation was being brought about by infusing Infinite Oneness into the vibrational concrete and fear - the 'freeze vibration' I was told about in 1990. This was why people were changing and this would continue and increase apace until we were experiencing a very different reality to the one we currently 'see'. Words were only necessary to keep the five-sense 'mind' occupied while the energy infusions did their work, the voice told me. I was shown a scene of myself standing on a stage in a theatre. I was saying nothing the audience were looking at each other in bewilderment. The voice said, laughing: \"You only speak words because if you did not, the audience would be sitting there asking 'when is he going to start?' - not knowing that you already had!\" Unseen energy was the real transformer, not human language. That was only to keep the five-sense mind happy. More and more people are waking up and this is why: a vibrational change is unfolding ever more quickly. The voice said the reason there was such an effort underway to imprison humanity even further in the fast emerging global fascist state or New World Order was a desperate attempt to hold the game together and stop the awakening people - especially through the microchips that are designed to artificially suppress the quickening vibrations of awakening humanity. What the manipulators did not realise, I was told, is what they are dealing with. They are ignorant of the true background to the 'game' in which they, too, are pawns. The voice said: \"This transformation is not a maybe, it is not something that might happen or we hope will happen if things go according to ·plan'. It is happening now and the power and speed of the change will become ever more profound aJ:1d obvious. What you are seeing is the last desperate attempt of the 'Matrix' to stop the inevitable, that's all. The transformation from prison to paradise is a done deal.\" Remember who you are These words were thought fields decoded by my mind and so the language is something like I would use in my own speech. An Italian or an Egyptian would decode them in their language, as I explained earlier. On the second night I took an increased dose of ayahuasca and at first the feeling of screaming and nausea returned. This time I was with the rest of the group, and as I began to enter an altered state, I asked Zoe if he would come with me back to my room to avoid disrupting the others. There I was, screaming out more frustration and heaving without being sick. I stood out on the balcony looking out at the trees, heaving into the darkness. From out of nowhere I said to my nauseous body \"1 love you\" and with that the nausea left me and the need to scream in frustration lifted from me also. It sounds cheesy, but that is what happened. I felt calm and at peace again and went back to the round house to rejoin the others. The most profound night of my life was about to begin. As I lay down with my eyes closed, I began to see the swirling colours and images again and for a time they had a very Chinese feel about them. Then I began to hear a voice as clear as can be. Not some distant 'what did it say?' type of voice, but a loud and powerful one, more so than anything I had experienced. It was female and spoke with great dignity, assurance and clarity. \"David\", it said\" \"We are going to take you to where you come from, so you can remember who you are.\" With that I was taken to a realm of indescribable bliss. There was no 'time' and there was no 'place~. Everything just was. I had no body, I was only consciousness, and I was everything. There were no divisions, no polarities, no black and-white, no us and them. I was infinite, but I was also completely self-aware, as an 'individual' with my own point of observation within the whole. This is what we all are and if only people could experience the bliss of Oneness the world of the five-senses would be transformed in an instant. The energy was not vibrating as it does in the Matrix. I experienced it as either stillness or as the waves of an ocean moving in slow motion and in perfect harmony. \"This is the Infinite, David\", the voice said, \"This is where you come from and this is where you shall return.\" The following words then began to repeat over and over in my mind: "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 197 \"Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion; Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion; Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion.\" At one point I began to form a question in my mind I was going to say: \"You really mean everything?\" But before the thought could form, the voice interrupted:\"Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion; no buts, no exceptions, that's it.\" This word 'love' has connotations in which it is often perceived as weak or naive. I hear people say, \"You need more than love, mate.\" But let me define what is meant by love in the context of Infinite Love. It is the balance of all. Infinite Oneness is the only truth, everything else is illusion would be another way of saying it. Therefore, Infinite 'Love' is also Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Everything. I was told how humanity had been manipulated to identify itself with illusory 'personalities' and not as the Infinite that we are. This had trapped people in the illusions of a disconnected state. The voice would return to this theme, as it communicated with me constantly through the hours that night. “Why do you think you needed to scream and try to throw Up?” 11 I was asked. “Do you feel any frustration or anger in this place?” No, I did not. “Do you have any worries or fear or guilt where you are now?” No, I didn't, there was only harmony, peace, love and bliss. “Frustration, anger, fear, guilt and pain are only illusions, figments of disconnected mind \", the voice said. “They don't exist except in your imagination. II It went on: “Do you think the Infinite you are now experiencing needs to throw Up?” No. “Do you think the Infinite ever gets il1?” No of course not, these states are only illusions of the conditioned mind. II Later in the night I began to feel a little nauseous again and immediately the voice said: \"Where is your nausea coming from? Do you think the Infinite is feeling nauseous now? So you must be identifying with your body. It's an illusion, David, your body is an illusion, and so must be the nausea you think you are feeling in your body. If your body does not exist how can nausea or pain? These are illusions and they only exist in the minds of those caught in the Matrix.\" 'Time' to confuse With that, the nausea left me, never to return. The voice told me more about the Matrix and the Time Loop. It said that the illusion of 'time' was necessary to maintain imprisoned consciousness in a disconnected state. While people related to the movement.9f 'time', they could not relate to the Infinite One that was 'no time'. The Matrix entity, 'self-aware fear'; had created an illusion of time to trap its prey, its prisoners, in a state of disconnection in which they would forget who they were. I was told that while the five-sense Time Loop created the illusion of 'time' moving 'forward' most powerfully within the Matrix, the other 'nonphysical' levels also had versions of this. The voice said that human psychics and mediums may make contact with entities that say their realms do not have 'time', as we know it, and those who have had so-called 'out-of-body' and 'near death experiences', may say that in their out-of-body state there was no 'time'. But the very vibrational nature of the Matrix was different to the truly 'no time' state of the Infinite and in a sense manipulated 'time' was prevalent throughout the Matrix. I got the impression that the \"detail of what was meant here was beyond the ability of human language t0express. The out-of-body experiencers often spoke of being in a place of 'no time' because what they were feeling was such a different version of 'time' to that of the Time Loop. It appeared that they were experiencing 'no time' when it was a different version of 'time'. The Time Loop produced the most fear to sustain the Matrix because the five-sense reality most fundamentally identified with time and the movement from 'past' to 'future'. Those experiencing the Time Loop were the most thoroughly disconnected from their no-time self, the Infinite. Everything in the Time Loop was geared to indoctrinating the 'time' illusion. “Do you think the Infinite gets old?” asked the voice. “Human minds are programmed to believe that their bodies age and so they do and this strengthens the illusion more than anything of passing from past to future.\" Nothing aged in truth because there was no time, no past and no future. Only illusion draws a pension, it said. DNA also carried the programming of aging that the mind accepts as its reality, but DNA was also an illusion. \"Do you think the Infinite has DNA or worries about its cancer gene? Illusion !\" At one stage during the night I saw the Moon appearing above the clouds and the voice said: \"Ah the Moon, the Moon, how the poets wax lyrical about the Moon, the Moon. illusion! The Moon is a holographic projection to give the illusion of the movement from past to future, the passage of 'time'. That is what it is there for, to capture the mind in the time illusion. Do you think the Infinite needs the Sun to survive? Do you see a Sun in this place you are now? You are the Infinite so why do you need the Sun to sustain you? You are the Infinite and all is the Infinite. Why do you feel heat from the rays of the Sun? Because that is what the Matrix mind and body is' programmed and conditioned to feel and so it does. It is all illusion. The Sun and Moon are projected holograms to provide the illusion of night and day - the movement of 'time'.\" "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 198 I was told that what we call the universe is a holographic illusion akin to looking up at the 'sky' projected on the ceiling of a planetarium. The only difference was that in the 'universe' the projections appeared to be in 3-D because they were '- - ~ holograms. The 'universe' was a figment of our conditioned imagination, the voice said, and it was only part of our reality because we believed it was. The universe was also far smaller than people perceived. \"Look at the sky in a planetarium and it seems so vast, yet it only goes as high as the ceiling.\" Then the voice said: \"Do you think that's the Earth you're lying on now? Mmmm. Iluuulsiom!\" As with everything in the Time Loop and throughout the Matrix, the Earth was a holographic projection and so was its illusory' 'surface'. \"You are lying on the Earth now only because you think you are\", the voice said. If you are new to all this and think how unbelievable and fantastic it is, you are going to be amazed how much scientific evidence is now coming to light to confirm that this is correct. \"Remember always\", said the voice, \"Infinite Love is the only truth, everything else is illusion everything.\" It went on: \"If it vibrates, it is illusion. The Infinite does not vibrate; it is the harmony and Oneness of all. Only illusion vibrates - that which is created by the imagination and delusion of mind.\" Laws of illusion I was told that the 'laws' of physics were also illusions. \"There are no laws of physics\", said the voice. \"The scientists create illusory 'laws' to measure an illusory universe.\" There were no 'laws' of any kind because everything just is. \"Do you . think the Infinite needs 'laws' through which to express itself?\" The laws of physics and mathematics and all the others that 'govern' the physical and non-physical worlds were the creations of misguided mind. If the scientists believe in such 'laws' that will be their experience. Not because the laws exist, but because the scientists, and through them the people in general, believe them to exist. and so they appear to. But this continues only until someone comes along and changes the belief, the collective reality, and then such 'laws' cease to apply. It has been shown again and again that the beliefs of the scientists performing an experiment will affect the outcome of the experiment. The nearest thing there is to a 'law' is this: what you believe is what you will see and experience. The voice explained how what we perceive to be a 'solid' world only exists because we believe it does. This 'world' is not 'out there', it is 'in here' - in our minds. Scientific experiments have shown that we do not see up to 50%, and more, of what comes 'through' our eyes because it is filtered out by the temporal lobes of the brain on the basis of our conditioned belief before it gets to .the visual cortex, the point at which we actually 'see'. It is our brain that sees, not our eyes. The eyes only provide information and it is the mind that decides what to make of it. So whatever our mind/brain is conditioned to see or not see, it will. When we think we are in a 'conscious' state going about our lives, we are, in fact, experiencing a dream every bit as much as those we experience in sleep. It's just a different dream. Other levels of me might well be saying to each other right now that they have just had this strange dream in which they were sitting at a computer writing something about drinking a plant and living in a Time Loop! What we think we 'see' is just a dream infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion. The Illuminati (i.e. ultimately the Matrix entity) use this understanding of the mind to manipulate our sense of reality and maintain the population in ongoing control. They tell people what they should see and so they do. This is the fundamental role· of the 'norms' (official 'truths') I have spoken and written about so widely. It is also why the authorities are desperate to remove or discredit those who challenge the norms because, in doing so, they offer another vision of possibility that allows people to 'see' a different reality. I ain’t got nobody Our bodies are holographic illusions that did not really exist in the way that we think we see and experience them, the voice said. We only have to eat and drink because we and our bodies are programmed (through conditioning and the DNA) to believe that we do. We only have to breathe for the same reason. Yes, if we stopped breathing we would 'die', but this was not because we have to die. It only happened because our conditioned minds and bodies believe that will be the outcome and so that is what they create. “Do you think the Infinite sits down to dinner?\" the voice said, “Do you think the Infinite has to breathe or it will die?\" So why, the voice asked, do those in the Time Loop? Answer: because they identify who they are and their sense of possibility with being a physical 'personality' subordinate to illusory 'laws' and not with being what they really are - the Infinite 'One'. The voice offered an example of the chasm between perceived reality and infinite self: \"Why do you need to fly around in aircraft? You are point A and you are point B and you are everything in between. Why then do you need to use an aircraft to fly through yourself?\" 'Law of the Wild' - iIIuuuusion!"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 199 The 'laws' of nature were also illusions, said the voice. \"Why do people have such a problem understanding why a 'loving God' would create 'laws' of nature, laws of the wild, in which everything was based on killing and survival?\" There appeared to be such a contradiction between 'Divine love' and the carnage and fear written into the very fabric of 'nature'. But there was no contradiction, the voice said, because the 'laws of nature' were the creation of the Matrix, not the Infinite. \"Do you think the Infinite, where you are now, would wish to see anything suffer and live in fear, never mind create a structure in which this happened as a matter of course?\" Nature was another holographic projection that was only 'real' because we were conditioned to believe it was. The 'laws' of the natural world reflected the state of being of its creator, the Matrix entity; a state of fear and desperation to survive. There were, the voice said, some apparently beautiful expressions of nature on 'Planet Earth' and so long as we realised they were illusions they could b.: enjoyed. But we should be careful not to become mesmerised by what we see-on Earth or we would become like a moth hypnotised by a light, trapped by illusions that held us in a disconnected state. The message was enjoy what you see, but remember that what you 'see' is merely what you think you see. An illusion can only control you when you think it is real. The new age Matrix If you are interested in 'New Age' thought or some of the Eastern religions and philosophies the next bit might be a bit of a surprise. The voice explained to me that the vast majority of 'incarnate( consciousness that left the 'physical' body at what \" we call 'death' did not consciously reconnect with the Infinite. Instead it moved to other 'non-physical' dimensions of the Matrix. Consciousness may have withdrawn from the Time Loop, but it was still in the fly trap; albeit a less dense expression of it. Reincarnation was the cycle of consciousness moving in and out of the Time Loop from other levels of the Matrix. The concept of reincarnation is another creation of the Matrix entity to hold consciousness in a cycle of se~ih1de while believing it is 'evolving' through experience in line with the New Age belief. \"Do you think the Infinite has to reincarnate?\" the voice said. \"Consciousness in the Matrix is also the Infinite, so why does that have to reincarnate?\" It doesn't, it just believes that it does. As with the saying \"death is no cure for ignorance\", so it was the case that consciousness in other levels of the Matrix was also trapped by illusions. When consciousness withdrew from the 'physical' body it did not become immediately re-enlightened. That depended on its reality. In the five-sense realm what we think we should see is what we appear to see and experience. This, the voice explained, is what also happened in other frequencies of the Matrix. If consciousness left the body believing totally that it was going to the heaven of Jesus and the Christian version of God, this would be its experience; that is what it would 'see' because that is what it believed it would see. It was the same with the other religious beliefs and the Matrix maintained a Christian 'heaven', Islamic 'heaven', Hindu 'heaven' and Jewish 'heaven', etc. But these were nothing more than figments of expectation. Only that which was free of conditioned belief was able to transcend the vibratory illusions of the Matrix and become consciously one with the Infinite. Belief was the prison and other levels of the Matrix were different levels of illusion. This meant that the overwhelming majority of information 'channelled' through psychics in the Time Loop was from consciousness still caught in the Matrix. This might know more than those in the Time Loop density, but it was still in the web of illusion. I was shown a picture of people symbolically dropping from the sky onto a footpath across a field. The voice said that because consciousness in the Matrix was caught in a cycle of moving in and out of the Time Loop through 'reincarnation', they were not only conditioned by the beliefs of one 'physical' lifetime. They were conditioned by endless experiences in the Time Loop and between these 'physical' excursions they were in another form of illusory state. So they were already conditioned even as they returned to the Time Loop reality for still more conditioning. This was why humanity dropped into the conditioned, servile state so easily. They had been there many times before. As these words were being spoken, I saw the footpath being worn away by the trampling feet going over the same ground until the path looked like a sort of record groove. It went ever deeper and the figures walking the path went down and down into the dark 'groove' until they disappeared. \"Is it any wonder that humans look up for their God?\" the voice said. \"It is the only place where they can see any light!\" The voice told me how 'New Age' thought and some philosophies of the East and native peoples were more enlightened than those of the purely Time Loop religions and sciences of mainstream society. The 'New Age' reality understood that the 'physical' realm was only one dimension of existence and there were many more beyond the vibrational walls of human senses. That was good, but what was not understood is that these other vibrating dimensions were still levels of the Matrix. They provided the constant 'supply' of consciousness to inhabit the Time Loop and generate the fear necessary to keep the Matrix 'alive'. New Age beliefs in a 'Great White Brotherhood or an 'Ashtar Command' communicating with their chosen people were manipulation~ of the Time Loop from other levels of the Matrix. In fact, some were even communications from within the Time Loop planted in the minds of the 'psychic' by mind-control and"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 200 forms of technological 'telepathy'. When psychics, like those in stage shows and television, were communicating with the deceased relatives of the audience, they were contacting levels of the Matrix very close to the Time Loop reality. Their other-frequency communicators may realise that there are other 'worlds' beyond the 'physical', but they were still in the realms of Matrix delusion. They communicated about going to 'Halls of Learning' in their non-physical world and how the Earth was a spiritual 'university' where people came to learn some tough lessons and work out their 'karma'. This was illusion, the voice said, total illuuuuusioll! \"DO you think the Infinite has to go to school to learn anything when it knows everything there is to know?\" the voice said. As for 'karma', the idea that you experience what you have made others experience, the voice asked: \"Why should the Infinite have to experience what it has made itself experience?\" The idea of karma was a Matrix manipulation to indoctrinate beliefs in the passage of 'time' - it's my karma from a past life or I am building karma for the future - and to maintain people in a state of guilt and self loathing. \"Infinite Love does not judge itself or loathe itself - these are illusions of disconnection.\" What sign are you? Er, all of them The voice then turned to astrology. Yes, it said, astrology appeared to 'work' in the sense that certain types of 'personality' and traits could be predicted by the illusory 'time' and 'place' of a person's birth in the 'year' (a classic illusion of the Time Loop). But why was this? Astrology 'read' the vibrational fields of the Time Loop and while it could do this effectively in skilled hands, it was still a Matrix illusion that was based on division not Oneness. Astrology, said the voice, was a creation of the Matrix to manipulate people to identify still more powerfully with their illusory 'personality' - I am a Taurus, a Leo, a Capricorn or whatever. It emphasised the idea of division, of parts, not the whole. \"00 you think the Infinite has its astrology read?\" asked the voice. \"00 you think it consults a psychic about its 'future' or visits a tarot card reader?\" These were all identifications with the 'physical' personality and such 'forward' predictions were peering down the Time Loop, that's all. Psychics were extremely useful in showing people that 'death' is an illusion and the best of them - those connecting with the Infinite beyond the Matrix - could bring profound and mind-freeing information into the Time Loop, it said. But if people believed what the psychic or tarot reader said would happen they could make it happen. What people believed was what they 'saw' and experienced. In fact, we all have the power to create whatever reality we choose. As I was hearing these words, I was shown a symbolic scene of the Infinite sitting at a table when someone brought the morning paper. The Infinite turned to the list of birth signs on the astrology page and said: \"Oh my goodness, this will take me all morning because I am all of them.\" Since that time) have refused to identify with my 'astrology' and instead have identified only with being all that is. If I don't identify with being a 'Taurus' or 'Aries' or 'David Icke' I begin to release myself from such influences and limitations. The New Age and mainstream religions have a belief in the existence of 'light' and 'dark'. But there was no 'light' or 'dark', the voice said. These were illusions. The belief that light was needed to balance the darkness was utterly misguided and a belief in the existence of 'light' was as divisive as a belief in the existence of 'dark'. To believe in the 'light' means you must also believe in the 'dark' and so belief in the 'light' also creates the illusion of its perceived polarity, dark. Once more these were figments of disconnected mind. Light and dark were illusions of the Matrix designed to cause division, conflict and fear. The Infinite was not light any more than it was dark. It was the balance of all things. It is not 'good' nor 'bad', 'light' nor 'dark', black nor white, male nor female, it just is, the Oneness of all. Neither were there any 'demons', the voice said. These were projections from the mind of the Matrix and the creation of human minds that accepted their existence. \"Demons only manifest in minds that believe in them.\" If Infinite Love was the only truth and everything else was illusion, how could demons be anything, but illusions? They were holograms projected from the imagination of frightened and manipulated minds. The idea that the 'light' must 'fight' the 'dark' and the demons only reinforced the belief in their perceived existence. There was no need to 'fight' anything and those who did so were only giving what they fight more power by confirming it was 'real'. If people didn't like their life experience they should perceive another reality and the manifestations of the present one would disappear. You don't like your dream? Then dream something else. Why ask when you know? The voice emphasised that to free ourselves from the illusions of the Matrix we had to identify with being the Infinite and not a fragment of mind stuffed inside a body. There was no David Icke, only Infinite consciousness. If we relate to being the Infinite and not some hologram dreamed into imaginary 'existence', the Matrix will no longer control us. Stop asking questions, the voice said, and start knowing the answers. It didn't mean rhetorical questions to illustrate a point, but those that come from the belief that we don't know something. \"You are the Infinite so you know everything; do you think the Infinite asks questions when it knows all there is to know?\" Whenever we identified with limitation, ignorance and our illusory personality"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 201 we were disconnecting from the Infinite that knows all and is all. When we ask questions we are accepting that we don't know the answer. Would the Infinite do that? Stop asking the question and you will know the answer, the voice said, and, modifying a line from the first Matrix movie, it added: \"It's not the question that drives you mad, it is asking it.\" The psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, once said: \"If I do not know I know, I think I do not know.\" People so lack confidence in themselves that they t09!< to others to tell them what to think, but if they could free their minds of such doubt and limitation, they would simply 'know'. Don't think it, know it. Don't ask it, know it\" Dreaming our lives away Since Brazil, I have understood more about the nature of our dream-world reality. I walked along a beach on one occasion in an altered state on a beautiful sunny day thanks to 'magic mushrooms'. It is the only other time I have taken anything to access an altered reality. The voice said to me: \"Look around you, does it not seem like a dream? Does it not feel like a dream that you have in sleep?\" It certainly did and later the 'memory' of the experience was extremely dream-like. Did it happen? Was it really all a dream? It was like walking through a painting, a reality 'bubble', and laughter came far easier than it does in the purely five-sense state. What I found interesting was the way that 'this world' phenomena could bring me out of the altered state in an instant. I was walking along enjoying my expanded reality when I saw a police car and began to think of the authoritarian system .. Immediately I was out of my altered state and back 'here'. Later I began to think about something relating to fear and the same happened. Whenever I checked the 'time' on my watch I was kicked out of the altered state as I related to the reality of the Time Loop. This allowed me to understand more of how the Time Loop/Matrix holds us in a manipulated reality and why the system is structured as it is. Interest in psychoactive substances exploded in the sixties with the use of drugs like LSD, but they largely became an escape from this reality rather than a bridge to a new one. I don't want to escape this reality, I want to change it, and experiencing altered states can help us to understand the game we are dealing with. Those who have studied the effects of drugs like LSD from this perspective have certainly learned a great deal more about reality than they would otherwise have done. One is Stanislav Grof, the author of The Holotropic Mind,4 and a former professor at John Hopkins University School of Medicine. He was a founder of the International Transpersonal Association and has developed a means of taking people into Hered states called Holotropic Breathwork. Grof was a convinced materialist and atheist until he began studying the effects of LSD in the 1950s as he sought to establish if there were any medical benefits. He was to continue his research for decades to come. In his first experience on LSD, he had what he called \"an extraordinary encounter with my subconscious\". He realised immediately that the unyielding 'truth' of the scientific establishment, taught as fact in the schools and universities, was a fantasy: \"Traditional science holds the belief that organic matter and life grew from the chemical ooze of the primeval ocean solely through the random interactions of atoms and molecules. Similarly, it is argued that matter was organized into living cells, and cells into complex multicellular organisms with central nervous systems, solely by accident and 'natural selection'. And somehow, along with these explanations, the assumptions that consciousness is a by-product of material processes occurring in the brain has become one of the most important metaphysical tenets of the Western worldview . \"As modern science discovers the profound interactions. between creative intelligence and all levels of reality, this simplistic image of the universe becomes increasingly untenable. The probability that human consciousness and our infinitely complex universe could have come into existence through random interactions of inert matter has aptly been compared to that of a tornado blowing through a junkyard and accidentally assembling a 747 jumbo jet.\" Itzhak Bentov calls this mind set the 'giraffe syndrome' in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum. The term is inspired by the story of a man who sees a giraffe for the first time with its enormous height, neck and legs. It is such a challenge to his reality that he dismisses it as impossible and rejects the idea that such an animal could exist. Stanislav Grof conducted some 4,000 LSD sessions and 20,000 with his Holotropic Breathwork, which involves a combination of breathing techniques, sound, bodywork and artistic expression. This has, Grof says, an \"extraordinary potential for opening the way for exploring the entire spectrum of the inner world.\" What fascinated him were the remarkable states of consciousness his subjects and clients have been able to access. They have experienced what it is like to be animals and plants, and they have described intricate details of their genetics and behaviour that later proved to be 100% correct. They have even experienced being an atom or a blood cell, seeing inside the Sun, and what it was like for them in the womb and the birth canal. Others have said they became the consciousness of the whole cosmos and I know exactly what that is like myself. How was this possible? 'Because we are the cosmos, we are every cell and atom, and there is no 'past' or 'future'. The five-sense prison - the Time Loop - disconnects us from the understanding that we are all One. Indeed this perception of division is the prison."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 202 In these altered states beyond the five-senses we can regain our conscious connection to the Infinite and experience any expression of the Infinite - anything in all existence. Look at the ocean. We give it different names like the Pacific or the Indian, as we give ourselves names like Bill Jones or David Icke. But these 'different' oceans are the same water, as we are the same consciousness. So where is the ocean? Is it crashing on the coast of India? Is it lapping on a. beach in Jamaica? Is it the Roaring Forties or the South China Sea? It is all of them and so it can experience all of them. We are the infinite consciousness that is everything. Where are we? Are we the tree in the garden? Are we the forest down the road? Are we the Sun or the sky? Are we the reflection we see in the mirror or the raindrops on our face? We are all of them because we are an expression of the seamless One and we can experience any aspect of the seamless One that we are. We have been manipulated to believe we are isolated 'individual' droplets when we are the ocean. We are not even part of the ocean, we are the ocean. When you place a droplet back in the water, where does the droplet end and the ocean start? There is no division, the droplet becomes the ocean. This knowledge has been communicated by the enlightened throughout human existence, but official science has denied its validity. The ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, said that human beings were like people sitting in a cave always facing a wall. The universe was the shadows projected onto the wall, illusions that the people mistake for reality. The only.reqlity.9r truth was the light - consciousness - that made the shadows possible the ancient Vedic works of India make the same point. The eighth century Hindu mystic Shankara, said: \"This entire universe of which we speak and think is nothing but Brahman [infinite consciousness]. Brahman dwells beyond the range of Maya [illusion]. There is nothing else.\" 6 I had known this since my transformation began in Peru, but in the Amazon I experienced it like never before. People often say that the more they know, t .~ more they realise there is to know. But once you reach the threshold of understanding, the opposite is the case. The more you know, the less you need to know, because' t is all so simple: Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion.

In the long run it is far more dangerous to adhere to illusion than to face what the actual fact is. Physicist David Bohm It's funny how the public and media are quite willing to accept lies pedalled by the politicians without any demand for 'proof' and yet they insist on proof from anyone challenging the official version of reality. The official 'truth' of September 11th is one such case. A schoolboy could take the story apart. But when faced with other explanations for these events, and for life itself, the same people who accept this crap without question scream: \"Where's the proof?\" \"That's all very well, mate, but how can you convince me if you don't have the evidence to prove it? I can't believe what hasn't been proved, can I?\" Oh, but people do; and they go on doing so all their lives. Some points to make here. First, why can't we 'feel' and 'know' our reality instead of insisting that the conditioned and manipulated mind must be the only arbiter of 'truth' through the production of evidence that it believes to be 'proof'? What is 'proof', anyway? Proof is only that which the conditioned mind accepts to be so. Billions are convinced that the official version of 9/11 is true because of the 'proof' revealed by the United States government. After all, didn't they find a passport from one of the hijackers that had miraculously survived the fireball to be found in the street? Well, actually, no they didn't because that was a ·lie. But the FBI named the 19 hijackers didn't they? No, they gave us 19 names, at least seven of which were found to be still alive. But they proved Bin Laden did it, surely? I heard them say that. Yes, exactly, we heard them say it and nothing more. They produced no 'proof' of anything, only the repetition of their fairy tale that billions accepted as 'proof'. It was those usiI1g their 'hearts', their intuition, who knew something was very wrong with the official version even before any further investigation had begun. Does what I reported in the last chapter 'feel' right intuitively even without 'scientific' support? Only you know if it feels right to you or not; you don't need some guy with a fancy title and letters after his name to tell you what to think. What does your heart say? That's all that matters. Second, the last thing I am trying to do is convince anyone of anything, that's not my intention or desire at all. So why bother doing what I do? I want to understand what is going on and I believe it is right that everyone should have access to all information available and not just the version that suits those in power. What people make of it is their business, not mine. Third, even for those who still demand 'proof' for everything, there is an increasingly enormous amount of scientific support for the themes of the last chapter, fantastic as they may have appeared to be at first hearing. Seeing is believing? \"I can't believe my eyes\", people say. Nor should they because the eyes don't actually see. They are lenses that pass information to the visual cortex in the brain and only there do we 'see'. We 'see' with the brain, not with the eyes. \"I can't believe my brain\" or \"I saw it with my own brain\", would be a better way of putting it. On the way from the eyes to the visual cortex, the temporal lobes edit and reconstruct up to 50% and more of this information and we only 'see' what the brain, with all its conditioned realities, decides it is seeing. In his outstanding book, The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot writes about the work of neurophysiologist Karl Pribram and others: \"Pribram discovered that the visual information a monkey receives via its optic nerves does not travel directly into its visual cortex, but is first filtered through other areas of its brain. Numerous studies have shown that the same is true of human vision. Visual information entering our brains is edited and modified by our temporal lobes before it is passed on to our visual cortices. Some studies suggest that less than 50 per cent of what we 'see' is actually based on information entering our eyes. The remaining 50 per cent plus is pieced together out of our expectations of what the world should look like (and perhaps other sources such as reality fields). The eyes may be the visual organs, but it is the brain that sees.\" 1 "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 204 This is the journey of information or. 'light', as some call it, when it passes from eye to brain: Light enters the eye by passing through the outer, transparent layer called the cornea; it goes on through the pupil, which gets bigger or smaller to allow in more or less light depending on the circumstances. This process is controlled by the coloured part of the eye, the iris; from the pupil/iris it goes to the lens to be focussed; next stop is the vitreous humor, a jelly like substance behind the lens; now the light/information strikes the retina that captures th~ 'image' like the film in a camera. But this image recorded on the retina is upside-down and two-dimensional; it goes on to the optic nerve that sends the image through. the brain to the occipital lobe. Only now does the brain re-assemble the upside-down, two-dimensional image delivered by the eyes into the form we think we are seeing. Scientists say the flip from 2-D to 3-D is possible because the brain takes light/information from both eyes and combines them into one 3-D image, much like one of those 3-D picture viewers you can buy.2 I think it is more sophisticated than that, however. What a journey for everything we 'see'. Given these facts it is clear that our 'physical' reality is not constructed 'out there', but 'in here'. It is like looking out of a window and telling someone a version of what you see that suits your beliefs rather than what is really happening. As studies have shown, for example, men and women have a real problem communicating accurately with each other because what one says the other does not hear. A process of editing goes on in which they each 'hear' whatever supports their conditioned belief and prejudice about the other. I have seen television programmes in which they filmed a conversation, asked each participant what the other had said, and then played back the recording. They have been stunned by how inaccurately they heard what was said to them or the tone in which they spoke to the other. You will find the same in any argument between people with rigidly held beliefs. Remember the polls of the American public that revealed how many of them believed breathtaking nonsense about 9/11, / the Iraq war and the finding and use of chemical and biological weapons? Steve Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, said the level of misinformation suggested that some Americans may be avoiding having an experience of \"cognitive dissonance\". In short, their beliefs were in conflict with the facts and so it is their beliefs, not the facts, which dictate their reactions and responses. Implanting belief is everything to the Illuminati because it is through belief that we manifest our reality. What we don't 'see', we make up The eyes have a blind spot where the optic nerve connects to the eye in the middle of the retina. Whatever we may be looking at we cannot see anything from that part of the eye, but the brain weaves the picture together from the information available and fills in the 'hole~~ Reality is only what we are programmed to believe it is. What we believe we are 'seeing' is what we see and it is the same with all five-senses. The phenomena of phantom limb syndrome when people have limbs removed but can still feel them is another example of the five-senses reacting to the brain's sense of reality. In the first Matrix movie, the woman known as the 'Oracle' tells the Neo character not to worry about the vase. What vase, he asks? As he speaks, a vase falls to the floor next to him. He is very apologetic, but the Oracle says: \"What's really going to cook your noodle is would it have happened if I hadn't said anything?\" We are being constantly programmed to accept realities that suit the agenda because once we do those realities can manifest. I wonder how many times people have warned children about something to such an obsessive extent that the child's mind has absorbed that reality and created it. \"I was always telling him he would have an accident if he wasn't careful and now he has.\" The same process is used on the collective mind of humanity by the Illuminati to manifest the reality they want us to have. When I asked Credo Mutwa why even more people did not see the Reptilian entities, he said it was because they are so at odds with human reality that the mind removes them from what it 'sees'. The mystic, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, also said that most humans possess a \"mental screen\" that keeps us from seeing behind lithe veil of matter\". Daughter or no daughter In The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot recalls an experience he had that confirms what I am suggesting here. He says that in the mid 1970s his father hired a professional hypnotist to entertain a group of friends. One of those chosen to be hypnotised was a man called Tom and this was the first time he had met the hypnotist. What stage hypnotists do is to programme a person to believe they are seeing something or doing something that is pure invention. We have all seen them make people believe they are seeing the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 205 audience naked or they are a dog or a mouse or whatever. Michael Talbot recounts how this hypnotist made Tom believe there was a giraffe in the room and eat a raw potato believing it to be an apple. All this is confirmation that the brain sees and experiences what it is programmed to believe it sees and experiences. But the most profound part of the story came when Tom was brought back to 'waking' consciousness. Just before the hypnotist ended the formal trance state, he told Tom that when he awoke he would not be able to see his daughter, Laura. The hypnotist asked Laura to stand right in front of her father so that when he opened his eyes he would be looking at her stomach. Tom was asked if he could see his daughter. \"No\", he replied. Laura was even giggling, but it made no difference. The hypnotist hid behind Laura and held something against the small of her back. To see it, Tom would have had to see through his daughter. The hypnotist asked Tom what he was holding irtl1is hand and, leaning forward looking at the stomach of his daughter, he said: II A watch. II He was asked if he could read the inscription and, squinting to read the small writing, he did so. The hypnotist revealed that he was indeed holding a_ watch with that inscription.3 Tom's mind had been programmed to believe he could not see his daughter and so he didn't. More than that he could see what was behind her. How is this possible? We construct our reality 'in here' not 'out there'. With this knowledge we are at the cutting edge of understanding how the Illuminati, and through them, the Matrix, controls billions of people from (illusory) cradle to grave. They programme us to believe a version of ourselves, life, possibility and the world, and this belief constructs our reality in line with that indoctrinated blueprint. We only 'see' what we are conditioned to see and edit out anything that contradicts it. For instance, to advocates of war the statement \"I want peace\" is saying \"l want to let 'terrorists' and 'dictators' do what they like.\" Or to supporters of unfettered industrialism the statement, “We must protect the planet\", is saying “We should go back to living in tents and caves and working the land with horses and ploughs.\" Each side does not hear what’s being-said because their minds edit the message to fit their beliefs. I have witnessed many exchanges like this and everything becomes polarised - just as the Illuminati want. Polarisation = division and conflict; and division and conflict = divide and rule. They want conflicting, rigidly held beliefs, for this reason. The Illuminati need the 'Left' as much as they need the 'Right' and 'Centre'; they need the 'poor' as they need the 'rich'; they need the 'black' as they need the 'white' and they need the 'fors' as they need the 'againsts'. I have been writing all these years that the Illuminati don't much care what you fiercely believe so long as you fiercely believe something because they can then play you off against others who fiercely belief the (apparent) opposite. Holographic illusion The official 'truth' of mainstream 'science' is in disarray. Its ludicrously narrow vision of possibility - this 'world' is all there is - has been faced with so many basic questions it cannot begin to answer that its credibility is in tatters among anyone with a mind still reporting for duty. The reason it is silent in the face of such questions (like why they can't locate the mind in the brain) is because its foundation assumptions about consciousness and reality are nonsense. It is obsessed with the five-senses and cannot see beyond them. Given that we are dealing with infinity, five-sense 'science' must always be no-sense 'science'. It is, as Stanislav Grof puts it, \"a conceptual straigh~acket\".4 The so-called 'paranormal' has always been dismissed as a fantasy simply because such phenomena is unexplainable within its arrogant and juvenile view of possibility. Adding to its plight has been the brilliant work of those scientists researching the realms of quantum physics beyond the frequency range of the five-senses. From this research has come the confirmation that what psychics, mystics, native peoples and freethinkers have been saying for thousands of years is correct. There are infinite reals of existence and they are all part of one indivisible whole. The five-sense reality is only one of them. Most intriguing, given what I was told in those ayahuasca sessions, is the fast emerging evidence that what we think we see as buildings, people, forests and lakes are actually three-dimensional holographic illusions conjured into that reality by our own minds. Albert Einstein said: \"We must remember that we do not observe nature as it actually exists, but nature exposed to our methods of perception. The theories determine what we can or cannot observe.\" 5 "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 206 Or, as he also said: \"Reality is an illusion, albeit a persistent one.\" Among those at the forefront of this research are people like David Bohm, the world-renowned' quantum physicist at the University of London, who worked with Einstein, and Karl Pribram, a neurophysiologist at Stanford University. Many others have picked up their themes and published their own findings. Bohm and Pribram came to basically the same conclusions even though they arrived from different directions and did not correspond until their original ideas were formed. This research states that our 'physical' reality is ~made up of holograms that give the illusion of three-dimensional objects when they are, in fact, nothing more than frequency patterns. The voice in the ayahuasca session said that our minds create these holographic illusions in a slightly different way to the holograms made by human technology, but the principle was the same. Holograms are made by directing a laser onto a photographic plate (Figure 44). Lasers are used because they produce a stable, focussed beam known as 'coherent light' and project a single frequency. Coherent light is that which holds a narrow, even beam over long distances and does not expand like the light from a torch, for example. The laser is directed at the film through a semi-transparent mirror. Figure 44: Holograms are made by using two parts of the same laser light, One half (reference beam) goes almost directly to the photographic plate and the other (working beam) is diverted onto the subject, When this working beam is diverted again onto the print it forms an \"interference pattern\" with the reference beam. If a laser is shone upon this pattern it creates a 3-D holographic picture of the subject Figure 45: The wave or 'Interference' pattern on a holographic print, It seems random and meaningless until a laser light is shone on the pattern and a hologram IS formed, Some of the light is deflected away in another direction and onto the object you want to film, Now you have the laser light pointing at the plate (known as the reference beam) and the part deflected away onto the object (known as the working beam). This working beam, carrying the vibrational image of the object in question, is then also directed onto the photographic plate. When it hits the plate it 'collides' with the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 207 reference beam - its 'other half' and this creates what is known as an interference pattern between the two. You can liken the principle to throwing two stones in a pond and seeing how the two wave formations collide and interfere with each other. They form a wave pattern that is a wave representation of the two stones, where they fell and at what speed. The interference pattern imprinted on the photographic plate looks much like the waves in the pond, It is a series of lines that appear to be random and incomprehensible (Figure 45), But when you shine the same type of laser light upon this pattern suddenly an apparently three- dimensional image of the photographed object comes into view (Figures 46 and 47). Immediately when you turn off the light the holographic image disappears because it is only an illusion. A point to stress here is that the same type of laser light that creates the interference or wave pattern is also required to manifest the patterns as a three-dimensional holographic illusion. This is what we do with different parts of the mind interacting with each other. Like the laser, two parts of the mind interact to form the wave (thought) patterns and the same mind observes them into holographic illusion (Figure 48). You might call this form of communication 'visual telepathy'. Remember, too, how the brain (a 'physical' computer for the mind) takes light/information from the eyes and turns a 2-D image on the retina into 3-D image that we 'see'. It is turning 2-D wave patterns into 3-D holographic illusions that we think is the world 'around' us. In truth, it is all happening within us as we turn wave patterns into holograms, as symbolised in (Figure 49). Figure 46: A holographic 3-D picture created by shining a laser onto the wave pattern Figure 47: Holograms can look as 'solid' as we do, but you can put your hand right through them because they are illusions - just like we are! The 'television' brain"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 208 What the voice in Brazil told me was that our beliefs and sense of reality are projected as 'thought fields' that are akin to the interference patterns on a holographic film. Our thought waves create frequency patterns in the unseen, 'non-physical' subconscious realms and by observing these patterns with our conscious minds We’ve turn them into apparently three-dimensional holographic forms. We both create the frequency patterns and, by observing those patterns, manifest the hologram - just as the laser does. Observed and observer are one, created and creator are one. As with the light shining on the holographic film, the '3-D' image only appears to exist when we are observing it ('shining' on it, you might say). When we are not observing these vibrating thought fields, they are frequency patterns and not the apparently three dimensional images we think we are seeing. It is the same principle as a television set that turns electromagnetic frequencies broadcast from a transmitter into pictures we can recognise. Whenever you think you are seeing something 'real' you are actually watching holographic television and your brain/lower mind is the TV set. I delude myself, therefore I am. When you see a holographic picture it seems to be 3-D and occupying 'space', but it is not. It is a virtual reality: an illusion. The image is not occupying 'space'; it is an interference pattern on a film. What we think we are seeing with our 'eyes' as 3-D images occupying 'space' all around us, are just a virtual reality. There are no 3-D images 'out there', only the frequency patterns that our mind and brain decode into holographic illusions 'in here'. I remember the really boring hymn they sang at my school called \"God be in my Head\". Well, symbolically everything is in your 'head' or, rather, mind. It is like looking out of the window, seeing a frequency pattern, and saying: \"Hey, there's Mrs Smith running for the bus.\" Quantum physics has long discovered that atoms, the so-called building blocks of the 'physical' world, are themselves made up of smaller and smaller 'particles' like electrons. Figure 48: Subconscious mind creates the wave or thought patterns and the conscious mind 'observes' them into the holographic illusions that we take to be the 'real' world. It is only an illusion, a figment of our implanted belief and imagination "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 209 Figure 49: If we could see the 'world' _ •• , before it enters our eyes it would be a mass of wave patterns - thought fields. Through the collective mind we transform these fields into an agreed 'reality' - the landscape we think we see all around us.- In fact, it is within us, within our own minds Scientists have established that electrons and other sub-atomic particles can either express themselves as a 'wave' form (non-physical) or as a particle (appa~rent1y 'physical'). And, get this: they only manifest as particles - 'physical' when we are looking at them!! Otherwise they are always in wave-form. Michael Talbot writes in The Holographic Universe: \"For [Karl] Pribram, this synthesis made him realize that the objective world does not exist, at least not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What is 'out there' is a vast ocean of waves and frequencies and reality looks concrete to us only because our brains are able to take this holographic blur and convert it into sticks and stones and other familiar objects that make up our world ... \" ... In other words, the smoothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom limb syndrome. \"According to Pribram this does not mean there aren't china cups and grains of beach sand out there. It simply means that a china cup has two very different aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we'd experience it as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion? 'Both are real to me,' says Pribram, 'or, if you want to say, neither of them is real'.\" 6 Appropriately, it was the discoveries by the Frenchman Jean B. J. Fourier in the 18th century that led to television, the discovery of holograms and the research that revealed how the brain is actually a frequency decoder Fourier developed a process called Fourier transforms. This is a mathematical method of converting patterns into simple wave forms and back again, so providing the potential for a television camera to convert pictures into electromagnetic frequencies and the television to convert them back again. Picking up this theme, Dennis Gabor won the Nobel Peace Prize for his development of holographic technology, starting in the late 1940s. He turned a three-dimensional object into a wave/frequency pattern on photographic film and then converted it back to a 3-D holographic image in the way I have described. At the end of the 1970s, research by Russell and Karen DeValois, two neurophysiologists at Berkley University, revealed compelling evidence, since supported by countless other scientists across the world, that the brain is decoding frequency patterns and turning them into holographic images that we 'see'. The same Fourier system is involved. in the way the brain does this. It was already known that the brain cells in the visual cortex, from where we 'see', react to different frequency patterns arid activate according to the type of frequencies they received. For a century it had been known that the ear was a frequency decoder and experiments by Georg von Bekesy, another Nobel Prize winner, had long confirmed how the skin responded to frequencies. Other research strongly suggests, as the voice in Brazil told me, that all the five-senses are the same. They are decoding frequencies into sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. As the Morpheus character said in the first Matrix movie: "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 210 \"What is real? How do you define real? If you are talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see then real is merely electrical signals interpreted by your brain.\" It goes even further than that. It depends on the point from which you want to observe the illusion. At one level, the brain is a hologram acting like a computer. interpreting reality. But at a higher point of observation, there is no brain!! That's just another illusion. The wall is 'solid'? Sorry, impossible There is no such thing as 'empty space' (unless you believe there is!). Physicists calculate that every cubic centimetre of 'empty space' (i.e. that which our 'physical' senses cannot' see') contains more energy than is contained in all the matter of the known ('seen') universe! Some empty ~\"\" space, eh? The astrophysicist and author, Giuliana Conforto, notes that we cannot 'see' 99.5% of the mass in the known universe. Space only appears 'empty' because the energy is beyond the frequency range of the five-senses and it is in these unseen realms that the thought fields are constructed that we turn into holographic illusions of three dimensional 'solidity'. The realm of the five-senses is like the crest of a wave, while the unseen realms are the infinite ocean from which this reality is made manifest through thought. I have quoted in almost every book the words of the brilliant, and much missed, American comedian, Bill Hicks. He was a man who experienced many times the kind of 'trip' I experienced in Brazil. Bill said: \"Matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration; we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively; there's no such thing as death, life is just a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.\" Superb. But while the five-sense reality is dense compared with the rest of the ocean, it is not solid or anything like. It just appears to be. The physical realm is constructed, scientists say, with atoms. These are named from the work of an ancient Greek called Democritus, who made the first known claim that matter was made up of tiny particles that he called atoms. This was some 2,500 years ago in our measurement of 'time' when the materialist view of the world was founded. The science establishment did, however, dismiss this idea of atoms for many centuries and it was not revived until 1808. Today we know that atoms contain even smaller particles consisting of a nucleus (made of protons and neutrons) orbited by electrons. The inside of the atom with the electrons orbiting the nucleus while spinning themselves is similar to the principle of planets orbiting the Sun, though not the same. The point I am making is this: the atoms that comprise 'solid', 'physical' matter are not solid or physical at all. They are overwhelmingly 'empty' from a 'physical' sense perspective (Figure 50). As one writer put it if the atom was the size of a cathedral, the nucleus etc would be about the size of a ten cent piece, The rest is 'empty' to the perception of the five-sense world and is not in the least 'solid'. So how can something that is not in any way solid be the building block of a solid reality? Of course, it can't. The illusion of solidity is just that illusion. Amit Goswami writes in The Self Aware Universe “You can't be sure if all things are made of atoms - it's an assumption, suppose all things, including atoms are made of consciousness instead~'\" Itzhak Bentov makes this point very well in his book, Stalking the wild Pendulum. He explains what would be seen with a microscope capable of observing single atoms and the subatomic realm: \"Let us now magnify a piece of bone ... we see the atoms weaving back and forth like a field of ripe wheat blown by the wind. They move in unison and in beautiful rhythm. Acoustical energy is flowing through the crystal. \"Next we focus on the atoms. At first they appear as little shadowy balls vibrating about fixed points in the molecule. As we magnify. we see less and less. The electron shell has somehow dissolved. and we are looking at a vacuum. As we further magnify we see something tiny moving about. We focus on what we suspect is the nucleus of the atom, located in this vast space within the atom. If we take the diameter of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom to be 1 mm. then the diameter of the electron orbit will about 10 meters. a ratio of 1 to 10.000. and the intervening space is vacuum. \"As we zero in and further magnify the vibrating nucleus. it seems to be dissolving. We are looking at some shadowy pulsation; some more magnification and the nucleus is almost gone. We are sensing the pulsation of some energy: it seems to be a rapidly pulsating field. But where did the bone go? We thought that we were looking at a solid piece of matter! "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 211 \"Well. it seems that the real reality - the microreality, that which underlies all our solid, good. common-sense reality - is made up, as we have just witnessed, of a vast empty space filled with oscillating fields! Many different kinds of fields. all interacting with each other. The tiniest disturbance in one field carries over into the others. It's an interlocked web of fields, each pulsating at their own rate but in harmony with the others, their pulsations spreading out farther and farther throughout the cosmos.\" 9 Figure 50: The atoms that make up our 'solid' world are virtually 'empty' to five-sense reality. You could hardly find anything less. 'solid' than an atom. So how can.these be the building blocks of the 'solid' physical world? They can't; it's all illusion Nothing adds to the belief in the 'physical body' more than the apparent solidity of bone, but bone is not solid at all. Bentov goes on to say that a powerful enough disturbance by one vibrating field can knock others from their harmonious rhythm and the irregularity spreads to disturb the neighbouring fields. This is how the disharmonious vibrations caused by stress and trauma can cause 'physical' disease dis-ease - by disrupting the vibrational harmony of the body hologram. When we are emotionally charged, upset or stressed we stop thinking straight for the same reason. The emotional field disrupts the mental. This also explains why those who work with electromagnetic technology, live near or under power lines, or use mobile phones can suffer more than others from certain cancers etc. These technology fields disrupt the harmony of the hologram and the thought fields from which they manifest. Pollution, nuclear waste and radiation have the same effect of vibrationally imbalancing the body hologram. But, as always, only if we think they do! The Trinity? Itzhak Bentov points out in Stalking the Wild Penduilim that the interaction of two frequencies produces a third frequency that is much slower than the other two. Is this the process by which higher frequencies of thought interact to produce this lower frequency, the five-sense world? Is this the real origin of the obsession with the symbol of the trinity through the ages, like Christianity's Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Are these really codes for two vibrations interacting to create a third, denser one - the 'son' of the other two? Maybe and how appropriate that one of the main characters in the Matrix movies is called Trinity. The Swedish mystic, Emanuel Swedenborg, said that our universe is created, and held together as a 'physical' reality, by two wave-like flows, one from what he called 'heaven' and the other from our own 'soul', as he put this. Dr George F. Dole, a professor of theology at the Swedenborg School of Religion in Massachusetts, wrote: \"If we put those images together, the resemblance to the hologram is striking. We-are constituted by the intersection of two flows - one direct, from the divine. and one indirect, from the divine via our environment."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 212 We can view ourselves as interference patterns because the inflow is a wave phenomenon, and we are where the waves meet.\" 11 Reality is created from endless sources of 'wave' or thought, but the principle is correct. Two forces interact to create a third. This is the trinity. Put another way, father and mother create a denser 'son'. But enough about George Bush. Life is but a dream Charles Tart, a professor of psychology at the Davis Campus of the University of California, asked two skilled hypnotists called Anne and Bill to hypnotise each other. He was trying to synchronise their two hypnotic realities and that is what happened. The two, both graduate students, found themselves experiencing the same 'place', a beautiful beach and ocean. They swam together, studied the same crystalline rocks, and 'talked' to each other even though they were not speaking in this reality, from where Tart was observing them. They later recalled that this hypnotic dream was every bit as 'real' as their experience in their 'awakened state' and included five-sense-type sensations although their hypnotic world was more pliable and less dense than this one. During their experience they often forgot to manifest bodies for themselves and floated around only as faces and heads. On one occasion when Bill asked Anne to take his hand she had to 'think' her own 'hand' into 'existence' That may sound amazing, but what they experienced was no different, except in density, from the 'world' we think is 'real'. I experienced something very similar to this when I walked on a beach in an altered state of consciousness. Interestingly, the nearest psychological state to the hypnotic state is the waking state! We are living in a dream just as much as we are when we sleep and what we call our memory is our ability to remember our dreams. The difference is whether we know it is a dream or believe it to be real. If you drive a car over a cliff in this five-sense dream world you are dead because that is the accepted reality of this realm. Do the same in a dream you know is a dream and you will wake up unharmed. The interchange between the Neo character and the enlightened little boy in the first Matrix movie encapsulates the nature of our reality: \"Do not try to bend the spoon; that is impossible, only try to realise the truth.\" \"What truth?\" \"There is no spoon ... it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\" This is like the story of the two monks debating about the movement of a flag in the wind. \"The flag is moving\", said one. \"No, the wind is moving\", said the other. A third, passing by and hearing the conversation, said: \"The flag is not moving. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving.\" The nature of our 'physical' dream is dictated by our beliefs, which project thought fields that we observe into holographic illusion, We project the frequency pattern with the thoughts of our nonphysical minds and our conscious minds decode them into the three-dimensional holographic illusions we take to be real. That's how we create our 'seeing' reality and that's how the illusion works. The Robin Williams movie, What Dreams May Come (PolyGram, 1998), offers an excellent visual portrayal of what I am talking about here. It shows how, after 'death', we create our own reality with our thoughts and beliefs. What needs to be emphasised, however, is that we are also doing that in this five-sense realm. What is free will? Something to emphasise here. The conscious mind is not the one ultimately in control of events, except in the way it decodes thought patterns into holographic 3-D in accordance with its sense of reality. The subconscious is the main source of human response and behaviour, not the conscious that thinks it is making the decisions. Experiments have revealed that the signals in the brain necessary to move a limb, open the mouth or take any 'physical' action, begin some one and a half seconds before the conscious mind makes the 'decision' to do it. Benjamin Libet and Bertram Feinstein, neurophysiologists at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco, confirmed this theme in their experiments. They asked people to press a button when they were touched. The outcome was that the brain reacted to the touch in 0.0001 of a second and the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 213 button was pressed in 0.1 of a second. The amazing part, however, is that the person was not aware of feeling the touch or pressing the button for a full half a second. Other tests have revealed that the reaction to stimuli registers in the human energy field (the location of mind) even before it does in the brain. The subconscious makes the decisions and, while the conscious level can have an input here and there, it is basically the observer and experiencer. Psychiatrist Carl Jung coined the word \"synchronicity\" to describe the amazing coincidences that happen to us, which are thousands or millions of times beyond statistical chance. It is as if some 'force' was guiding such events. Well it is. In my view, synchronicity is the conscious mind observing what the subconscious has decided will happen. \"Going with the flow\" is going with the will of the subconscious; fighting the flow is fighting the will of the subconscious. Do we really have free-will? Yes, but not necessarily at the conscious level of the five-senses, except, that is, for what we choose to observe into holographic illusion from the thought fields placed before us. The conscious and subconscious were the two 'different' levels of me, of which I was so aware on that Wogan Show interview in 1991. My conscious level observer / experiencer was in turmoil while my subconscious was perfectly calm because it knew where it was all leading. I went on the show in the first place, despite the consequences my conscious mind knew would ensue, because my subconscious was making the decisions. Physicist David Bohm says: \"Every action starts from an intention in the implicate [non-'physical'] order. The imagination is already the creation of the form; it already has the intention and the germs of all the movements needed to carry it out. And it effects the body and so on, so that as creation takes place in that way from the subtler levels of the implicate order, it goes through them until it manifests in the explicate\" [five-senses],13 This fits the information given to me by the voice in Brazil. It said the Matrix had been created by the collective subconscious, and the conscious mind had been imprisoned by the illusions thus created. The Matrix took on a life of its own when it accessed an 'energy source' of its own - 'fear' generated by the conscious and subconscious mind that was caught in an illusion believing it to be 'real', This 'self-aware fear', the Matrix, then also trapped the collective subconscious in illusion, As I have detailed at length in other books, the Illuminati's secret language is that of symbolism and metaphor. Global society and the media are awash with such hidden messages that are called 'subliminal' or 'below threshold', They are the language of the subconscious and the Illuminati know that if they programme the subconscious with a reality they want, the five-sense level will act it out. It is the subconscious that the Illuminati target most of all. Mass hypnosis We are further conditioned to see what we are told to see by the very 'norms' of society I have been emphasising in book after book. Hypnosis comes in endless forms. It does not have to stand on a stage or hold a swinging pocket watch. Hypnosis of the type I am talking about is the programming of the conscious and subconscious mind to believe a falsehood to such an extent that this is what it 'sees'. The hypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind. Those ten words encapsulate the real motive behind the 'education' system, official 'science', the media, government pronouncements, and all the other sources of official 'information' with which the human brain and mind is deluged every day - \"the hypnotist is implanting a false reality into your mind\". I have exposed this process in detail in other books and this is what these institutions are: hypnotists. This is especially true of 'education' and the media, and, most particularly, television. These constant influences programme our sense of 'reason' to such an extent that we believe the illusion to be real. In one of the books of Carlos Castaneda, he quotes his shaman source, Don Juan, as saying: \"We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity. We are boundless ... We. or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime.\" 14 From the moment we become conscious as a child, the programming of our reality begins. In fact it begins in the womb through the mother. We already start with a 'body' that carries its inherited reality programming through the DNA and this usually includes genetic subservience to authority and a sense of \"I am small and insignificant\". I see the body as like a bucking horse that our consciousness has to subdue and"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 214 harmonise by expressing its reality over that inherited genetically by the body or 'horse'. I reckon the minds of vast numbers of people are prisoners of their body's genetic programming and responses. The 'horse' is in control of their actions and reactions, not the 'rider', the mind. In such people an inherited genetic trait like alcoholism will be repeated in their own experience. Those with consciousness more powerful than the genetic programming will be able to override it and avoid the repetition. When I was walking in an altered state on the 'magic mushrooms', I came across a horsebox parked in the street and alongside was a horse and rider. The voice said to me that the analogy of the horse and rider, body and consciousness, was valid. It said that the hologram, the 3-D illusion, has a fantastic capacity for storing information, a fact that science has confirmed. The voice said that 'space', like 'time', was an illusion. Something as 'small' as the DNA had the capacity to store astonishing amounts of information in the form of vibrational codes because there is no 'space' in terms of 'big' and 'small'. There is only everywhere. A pin-head and the infinite are actually the same. The voice said that the programming of a body hologram - its \"library of experience\" - is passed on through the DNA to its successors in the line. The body holograms contain all the information accumulated by all the expressions of that DNA since the line 'began'. These genetic 'lines' do not exist as 'past' to 'future', but in different realities of the infinite NOW. Imagine, the voice said, that the incoming consciousness has to cope with all those inherited programmes, beliefs and assumptions of reality. The voice said: \"Do you wonder any longer why people are so easy to manipulate when they inherit that genetic programming to start with?\" It said that most people expended so much energy coping with the inherited responses, reactions, desires and demands of their body hologram that they had little left to look up and see beyond the illusion. With great synchronicity as I later walked back along the same street, the horse was being led into the horsebox. \"You are looking at a profound symbol of the human condition\", said the voice. \"Human consciousness is trapped in the 'horse' and the 'horse' is trapped in the 'box' human consciousness is trapped in the 'body' and the 'body' is trapped in the Time Loop and the Matrix.\" How we can break free will be discussed later. This inherited programming through the body hologram and the effect of mind on 'body', explains why many people who have been regressed to 'past lives' have realised that the experiences of a previous 'incarnation' are symbolised by traits in their body. Someone who had his throat cut might have an unexplainable scar-like line on the throat or a person who had his hand smashed by torture might have a deformed hand in this 'life'. These are mind and body memories manifesting in the hologram. It is important to remember this body programming when you are in altered states of consciousness because your mind and body might not be on the same page of perceived reality. Your mind may jump out of the window shouting \"1 can fly\", but half way down your body says: \"Not with me you bloody can't.\" Aaaaahhhhhhhh! Inter-generational hypnosis In childhood we are subjected to the programming of our parents who instil their own conditioned reality upon us. From the age of {our or five this is compounded massively by school and 'education', which is little more than legalised child abuse. The abuse, that is, of the child's mind and sense of reality. What does the 'education' system actually do? It indoctrinates a false reality day after day throughout the most critical period of a child's development by (a) pounding out the official version of science, history, possibility and impossibility, and all the rest; and (b) by insisting that only by repeating back this bollocks in exams will you progress within the Illuminati system that controls 'education'. For many this indoctrination at school is followed by college or university 'education' in which the same process is repeated at a higher level. Education is not involved in developing self-awareness, it merely prepares young people to do the jobs that will serve the system. Real 'education' is actually unlearning the indoctrination of official 'education'. Constantly underpinning these false realities throughout our lives is the conditioning of the same 'norms' and 'truths' by the media, most powerfully via the resident hypnotist in the corner of the room. \"Mom, where do I learn about the meaning of life?\" - \"Oh shut up and watch TV.\" - \"OK, mom, Zzzzzzzzzzzz.\" Add to all this the fact that almost everyone around you will have been through the same programming and accept the same realities, plus there is the peer pressure throughout your life to conform to the norms even if you don't want to. This produces a network of inter-connected imposition of reality that causes all but a few to submit to this collective mind-control. When they accept this hypnotic state, and most do from a very early age, their brains and minds are programmed to 'see' the reality it has been programmed to believe in. It 'sees' what it is indoctrinated to see, and edits away anything that doesn't fit. This confirms to people most"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 215 powerfully of all that what they believe is true! What a web. This mind manipulation is well summed up by this observation: \"If a baby from birth is told by loving parents that 2 + 2 = 3; and later at Sunday school, kindergarten, preparatory school, public school. and university this young mind is again told by apparently clever and often highly respected teachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if this same teaching comes through the mass media, backed by the weight of law, is it any wonder that many people. often in very responsible positions, seriously believe that 2 + 2 = 3?\" 15 The bigger the lie and the more it is repeated, the more will believe it. This process of indoctrinated reality has convinced six billion people that 'seeing is believing' and that the 'world' around them is 'real'. It must be, they can see, hear, touch, smell and taste it. That means it has to be real. Oh yeah? Who says? Consensus reality The vibrational fields we 'decode' into 'physical' holographic reality are not only our own. They also include the thought projections of the Matrix, including its Illuminati 'agents' and 'Reptilians', and the thoughts of those who influence our beliefs. The voice in the Amazon told me that the basic landscape of our five-sense universe like the planets and star systems, are the creations of the Matrix entity. These are thought fields - vibrational fields - that our minds decode into holographic '3-D' illusions of physicality. There are many planets and stars 'out there' that we do not currently see because we are not tuned into their frequency range and as our 'radio dials' becomes more open and sensitive we will 'see' more of them. \"We have discovered a new planet\", the headlines will say, but we have tuned into a new planet would be more accurate. Within this basic Matrix landscape is the collective human mind, what I call consensus reality. This adds its reality to the Matrix landscape and so life on this planet will be different to life on another, although both will exist within the rules of the Matrix. The holographic 'human' body adds its programming to this mix and our 'individual' subconscious and conscious minds also tinker with the collective song. We might be singing from the same basic song sheet manifested through the collective mind, but we can change the lyrics around and interpret them differently. Put another way, we may agree on the background to the painting, but we differ on the detail we wish to include. This is where the 'individual' mind can put its own spin on consensus reality. We may both agree we are looking at a movie or a car, but we will interpret what we see differently - \"nice car\", \"awful movie\". In this and more profound ways we are changing the detail of the collective reality to reflect our uniqueness of view. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung called the collective mind the Collective Unconscious, the 'species mind' if you like. I will call this 'consensus reality' (what we are all agreed exists). You might symbolise the 'individual' mind as a personal computer and the collective mind as the Internet or World-Wide Web through which all computers can connect and communicate. The so-called 'hundredth monkey syndrome' is an expression of the collective unconscious, or the consensus reality, at work. This is the discovery that when a few members of a species are taught something new suddenly all or many of the species begin to do the same instinctively without being shown. It is supposed to be a mystery, but it isn't. The monkeys or whatever species implant the new knowledge in the collective mind by the very act of learning and realisation. It is like finding new information and posting it on the Web. It becomes available to anyone connected to the Web. When enough monkeys have added the new knowledge to the collective mind (and it doesn't take many) it is powerful enough to be accessed by the other 'computers' and they can suddenly do instinctively what the pioneers had to learn. Unlike humans, animals don't undergo a lifetime of conditioning. This makes them more sensitive to their multi-levels of being and they can access the collective mind with greater clarity. But humans do it, too. Every time you think, you are putting that thought, belief, knowledge or opinion, into the collective mind. If the Illuminati can programme a sense of reality into billions of people they know that this will also consequently dominate the reality of the collective mind. It becomes a cycle of 'individual' minds placing their beliefs into the collective mind and, in turn, being influenced or confirmed in their beliefs by the reality of the collective mind. Once again we need to break the circle. The collective mind manifests the collective consensus reality, the dominant belief in what is 'real'. The collective mind is dominated by the belief that the walls around you are 'solid' because that is what it has been programmed to believe. Even though you may be aware that it's not possible for the walls to be solid, as explained earlier, the collective reality to which you are connected will go on"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 216 manifesting the illusion that it is. \"I know this wall can't be solid, but I still hurt my hand when I smack it.\" When mystics meditate before performing a 'miracle' they are disconnecting themselves from consensus reality, the collective mind, which says the 'miracle' is impossible. The basic landscape of the five-sense world, and all that we agree is 'real', is generated by the Matrix entity and the thought fields of the collective human mind that our conscious minds decodes into a holographic 'world'. To be truly free to create our own reality and end our belief in limitation, we need to disconnect our sense of reality from the Matrix and the collective consensus or, at least, give ourselves the option of when, and when not, to tap in. It suits me at this moment to accept the illusion that I am sitting on a solid chair, but there are endless other collective realities I do not wish to accept and I want to access the power to make that choice. It is within the collective unconscious that much of the Matrix control will be removed and that is now happening, as I will come to later. I have been writing and talking for years about the way we create our own reality and live in our own personal 'universe' and this is how it is done. We are what we think we are, and what we allow others to tell us what to think we are. The two are in fact the same. Physicist David Bohm is one of those who is convinced that reality only exists because of our thoughts, and look at the implications of this in the ability of the Illuminati/Matrix to feed us false realities that suit the agenda. We are also unknowingly observing thought fields created to mislead us and we are turning them into holographic images we believe to be 'physically' real. \"It must be true, mate, I saw it with my own eyes.\" The higher levels of the hierarchy understand this process and use it mercilessly to maintain, through hypnotising human minds, the reality that suits them. The Matrix = consensus reality The Illuminati/Matrix seek to construct a 'consensus reality' in which the collective human mind, Jung's collective unconscious, accepts the prevailing 'truth' it is programmed to believe. The more this happens, the more powerful are the thought patterns holding the manipulated reality together and the denser the holograms will appear. This is the 'freeze vibration' the psychic communications talked about in the early 1990s. It is a form of collective hypnosis, a 'solidified' dream (or nightmare). Remember how the graduate students, Bill and Anne, shared precisely the same hypnotic reality because they hypnotised each other? Their consciousness connected to the point where they manifested the same illusion. This is what the consensus reality is. We are mutually hypnotising each other through the acceptance and imposition of 'norms' to share the same basic illusion. Look around the world and observe how diversity is being stamped out by the day and how we concede our uniqueness to the global consensus reality we call materialism. You find the same fast food chains, banks, architecture, economic and political systems, and lifestyles wherever you look. The assault on diversity is designed to crystallize and solidify still further the consensus reality and make it even more difficult for people to see beyond it or to recognise that it's only a manipulated illusion designed to imprison them. The agenda is to 'solidify' the consensus illusion still further by removing all challenges and alternatives to it. The Matrix reality is constructed from largely imbalanced, deluded thought (fear) that produce low vibrational frequency patterns. Those caught in the Matrix illusion resonate to these patterns and the more caught you are, the slower your vibration, as the work of Valerie Hunt with the human energy field has shown. People are both caught in the vibrational web projected by consensus reality and add to the 'stickiness' of the web by contributing their like-vibration to this construct of fear and disharmony. It is the ultimate vicious circle with prison and prisoners both contributing to the survival of the Matrix. Until these frequency patterns are challenged by those of Oneness and harmony, the Matrix will prevail because fear and disharmony are the Matrix. That transformation is now underway. Itzhak Bentov discusses the background to such phenomena in Stalking the Wild Pendulum. He points out that when you put two violins together and pluck a string on one of them, the same string on the other violin begins to vibrate in what is called sympathetic resonance. Bentov also presents this example: \"Suppose we get several old-fashioned pendulum-type grandfather clocks. Let us hang them on a wall and arrange the pendulums so that they will start beating each other at a different angle, that is out of phase with each other. If we disturb one of the clocks it "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 217 will get locked [back] into rhythm quite fast. The larger the number of oscillators within such a system, the more stable the system, and the more difficult to disturb. It will force a wayward oscillator back into line very quickly.\"6 See what is happening in the Matrix and how it remains so stable? As the mystic Sri Aurobindo Chose said, physical reality is just a mass of stable light. The more stable it is, the denser it appears as its vibrational state slows. This world, it seems, is in a state of extremely stable instability! Humans and everything else within the Matrix are oscillators, symbolic tuning forks or violin strings beating out a frequency that represents their state of being, their reality. When we accept the Matrix/Time Loop version of reality we resonate to its frequency and become one of its vibrational representatives like one of those grandfather clock pendulums in Bentov's example. As he said, the more pendulums or whatever which vibrate oscillate - to the same pattern the more stable and difficult to change that pattern becomes. That is why the Matrix is a stable vibrational construct held together by the minds that resonate with it by believing its illusions to be real. When we have a thought we are sending out waves of sound at frequencies the five-senses cannot hear (infrasound it is called) and this sound resonates a frequency pattern. In my video The Freedom Road (Bridge of Love), I show how particles of sand and other material on metal plates react to sound frequencies. As the note is played, the particles immediately arrange themselves into distinct patterns as they vibrate to the sound and make a visual image of it. They will stay there in this 'standing wave', as it is called, for as long as the sound continues. When the sound changes - i.e. the frequency pattern - the particles rearrange themselves in an instant into a new pattern that reflects the new frequency. The entire five-sense world is, like the body hologram, a mass of vibrating reality fields held together by sound. Change the sound - the thought, the reality - and the world must change. It would appear that these thought fields take the form of a vortex, a spiral of energy like a whirlpool in a river. As I've said, vortices can be incredibly stable and they can continue indefinitely until the circumstances change sufficiently to stop or redirect the flow through the spiral. The Matrix is a vortex spinning round and round, getting slower and slower, and causing the energy to become denser and denser as the illusion of physicality has taken an ever more powerful grip on human reality. Vibrated into line This is a view supported by the American psychiatrist David Shainberg of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry in New York. He believes that thoughts are vortices that can become fixed and rigid. He suggests that these express themselves as fixed opinions, unchanging views and a rigid sense of reality that is resistant to change.l7 I am sure he is right. The Matrix itself is a vortex and the Time Loop is the densest level of its spiral. The Time Loop is like an anchor pulling the rest of the Matrix into greater density and disconnection. On this planet alone the best part of six billion people resonate to the illusions of the Matrix and that is why the Matrix can continue. Now, what happens when anyone challenges the system and offers another reality? They are ridiculed, condemned, fired, marginalised, attacked financially, jailed or even killed. We can observe the 'physical' level of this, the holographic projection of it, as we see the consequences that such people face. But what is really happening on a vibrational level? It is the five-sense expression of the Matrix energy pattern \"forcing a wayward oscillator back into line\". We may see the consequences in such rebels being attacked in various ways, but to the Matrix they represent a different frequency beat that needs to be kicked back into vibrational line by the prevailing - Matrix - frequency pattern. We also see politicians who start out challenging the system and later become advocates of it. Blair cabinet ministers like David Blunkett and Peter Hain, and former Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, come immediately to mind. They were 'system busters' who joined the system. We cannot bring the Matrix prison to a conclusion by reacting 'out there' with guns, bombs, anger and hatred because that will make the Matrix frequency even stronger by adding to its patterns of disharmony. The answer lies 'in here' as we change our own frequency patterns and connect with Oneness, harmony and love. If we change ourselves, we change our 'world', our reality. Only then will the Matrix pattern be overwhelmed by a mass vibrational change that will undermine the stability of the frequency fields that hold its imprisoned minds in such servitude to the 'material' illusion. The Matrix is a vibrational construct and that's why it can be broken down into mathematics, numerology and other frequency measurement. To remove the control of the Matrix reality we have to break the vibrational power it has over us. In fact, most of that 'power' is simply our ignorance that such control exists."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 218 Underpinning the belief in materialist 'solid' reality has been the pre-eminence of official (Illuminati) science and its demand that everything be 'proved' through experiments that can be repeated. Scientists who suggest conflicting explanations are ostracised or undermined to defend the prevailing (Illuminati-imposed) 'wisdom'. Fundamental to losing sight of our infinite unity is the official policy of mainstream science to depict the world as unconnected parts and this is reflected in the very structure of science with its compartmentalised 'specialities' that rarely, if ever, talk to each other. But when the beliefs of scientists are affecting the outcome of their experiments, as quantum physics have shown, what the hell use is such dogma? A subatomic particle called an anomalon has been revealed to have different properties in different laboratories, which, as author Michael Talbot points out, is like having a car that changes its colour and features depending on who is driving. The 'laws' of 'science' only apply because the scientists believe they do and, thanks to the god-like status of 'science', what it decides is 'real' becomes the consensus reality. But it's all illusion. Take a basic 'law' of science known as cause and effect, the foundation of the so-called Law of Karma. For every action there has to be a re-action. That's true - but only if you believe it is. If you believe it's not true then it isn't! People have 'karma' only because they believe they do at the level of their 'individual' and collective mind. The Danish physicist Niels Bohrone of the great pioneers of quantum physics, made the point that if subatomic particles only exist when they are observed how was it possible to say what their characteristics are before they are observed? But that is what mainstream 'science' continues to do - investigate and label an illusion. If everything we 'see' is a hologram manifested by our conscious minds from a thought field, how can 'science' be any more 'real' than anything else? William Tiller, a physicist at Stanford University said: \" ... When we get to the frontiers of our understanding, we can in fact shift the laws so that we're creating the physics as we go along.\" 1'1 would say that is how it has always been. As the voice told me in Brazil, there are no 'laws', only infinite possibility. What is reality? What do you think it is? Then that is what it is. These areas of knowledge are far more 'subversive' to the system than simply exposing the secret society network or the global agenda because they offer the means through which we can think the agenda and its fascist values out of our existence and think a new reality into being. This is the transition from the prison to the paradise I have long articulated. Like all reality, the transition has to happen first in the mind - or more accurately the heart - and only then can we experience it in the 'physical' world as manifested holograms. Rejecting the consensus reality and creating our own is the transformation. It's like the story of the emperor's new clothes. The consensus reality was that he was wearing lovely new clothes because the crowd did not want to admit that he was naked. It took a small child to break the spell and say the obvious: \"He's got no clothes on.\" 'Miracles' are a different sense of reality The 'laws' of the five-sense world may only be what we think they are, but while we accept them as real we are subject to their limitations. In the same way, if we can free our minds of these realities, we are no longer subject to their 'laws' and limitations. This is what we call 'miracles'. Almost everyone will have read of 'unexplainable' feats like walking through fire without getting burned, having swords pushed through the body without injury or scar, levitation and all the rest. None of these phenomena are possible to conventional materialist science, but that is simply because conventional science is the knowledge equivalent of a Mickey Mouse movie. A woman I knew allowed a room in her house to be used by serious meditators, those who wanted to meditate for a long time undisturbed. One guy went in and did not appear for many days and she became concerned that he was OK. She took him a cup of tea and slowly opened the door. The next moment the cup had crashed on the ground because when she looked at him the bottom half of his body was 'invisible'. Not possible? Oh yes it is and perfectly explainable, too, as we'll come to shortly. In 1905, the psychic, Indridi Indridason, was part of a project by leading scientists in Iceland into the 'paranormal'. When he went into deep trance the scientists saw different parts of his body disappear and reappear. i9 Anything is possible, literally anything, because we are infinite possibility. A woman I met in Texas told me how she woke up next to her husband one morning to find him floating six feet above the bed still asleep. Apparently, he was a bit of a fly-by-night. Dr William Tufts Brigham, the curator of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, was a keen investigator of the 'paranormal' and his studies included the 'miracles' performed by the Hawaiian shaman, or kahuna. He witnessed one of them heal a man who had broken his leg so badly that pieces of bone were protruding through the skin. The female kahuna 'prayed' (concentrated thought) and meditated beside the man and straightened his leg, pushing on the broken bones. After a few minutes she said the healing was complete"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 219 and the man stood up and walked around with no sign of the severe injuries of only minutes earlier.~' This is possible because as we have seen, there is no 'bone' - it's an illusion. Brigham also watched a group of kahuna walk barefoot across volcanic rock so hot it had hardly cooled enough to take their weight. They went through a ritual of 'prayers' and walked across the rocks with no discomfort, let alone severe bums. Brigham was taken through the process and tried himself, although he refused to remove his boots! When he reached the other side, his boots and socks were on fire, but his feet were fine. \"1 had a sensation of intense heat on my face and body, but almost no sensation in my feet\", he said.cl Some 'miracle men' have allowed themselves to be studied by sceptic scientists and one was the Dutch author, Jack Schwarz, in the 1970s. Watched by doctors and researchers from the University of California's Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute and other institutions, he would push six-inch needles into his body with no pain or bleeding; hold hot coals; and press lighted cigarettes against his skin with no ill effects. In the 1940s, another Dutchman, Mirin Dajo, performed a stage show in which he pushed a- fencing foil into his body and out the other side. Again, there was no bleeding, no pain, and only a faint red line where the sword entered and exited. He agreed to do this before a host of doctors and journalists at a Zurich hospital and was X-rayed with the sword inside to prove that it was no trick. Later he allowed scientists and doctors in Basel to impale him. The outcome was the same.'= When King Louis XIV of France sought to purge the Huguenots in the 1600s, his death squads found a group known as the Camisards in the Cevennes Valley who simply would not die under any circumstances. Michael Talbot writes: \"In an official report sent to Rome, one of the persecutors, a prior named Abbe du Chayla, complained that no matter what he did, he could not succeed in harming the Camisards. When he ordered them shot, the musket balls would be found flattened between their clothing and their skin. When he closed their hands upon burning coals, they were not harmed, and when he wrapped them head to toe in cotton soaked with oil and set them on fire, they did not burn.\" 23 Illusions cannot 'die' unless we believe they are 'real' What goes on here? How is all this possible as it demonstrably is? Quite simply such people disconnect their minds from the consensus reality and cease to be subject to the illusory 'rules' of that reality. They manifest a different illusion, a different dream. How many times do we have dreams in which we experience events that should kill us or harm us, but don't? It is the same principle. If it is your reality that fire cannot burn your feet then it cannot. Why? Because your feet don't exist any more than the fire does!! Hmm ' can an illusion bum an illusion unless we believe it can and manifest that reality - the illusion of burning and pain? When We feel pain it is in the brain and not in the big toe we have just bashed on the table. The brain manifests the pain from messages it receives and the conditioned brain feels pain only because it thinks it should. That is what its computer programme says and that is what it delivers. When you change the programme you get a different reality - no burning and no pain. 'Miracles' are only the withdrawing from consensus reality to where its illusory 'rules' no longer apply. How can your body bum when you know it is only a holographic illusion of your mind? How can a holographic illusion be harmed by a sword that is also a holographic illusion? Answer: only when you believe it can! The guy who 'lost' half his body meditating in the room went into such another state of consciousness - reality - that his holographic body began to follow. In doing so, it began to disappear, or withdraw, from this one. As for levitation and other such 'paranormal' phenomena (paranormal to the consensus reality), the principle is the same. The voice in Brazil told me: \"When you levitate, it is not 'you' that goes 'up', it is your 'world' that goes 'down'.\" Put another way, our minds don't lift us off the 'ground' they rearrange our reality by changing the 'world' we believe is around us. There is no bed, as there is no spoon, so how can you levitate above a bed that is not really there with a body that is not really there? \"It is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\" But an observer can lock into the rearranged reality - the tl10ught pattern - of the 'levitator' and sl1are the same illusion that he is six feet above the bed. Oh, I hear, but isn't the situation the art of overcoming gravity? Only if you think it is because gravity is another illusion. If we did not believe in it we would not be subject to its rules. There are no rules unless we believe there are. Infinite love is the only truth, everything else is illusion. Most of us will have heard accounts of people who produce 'super-human' feats at moments of great challenge and emotional stress. Some have lifted cars to free their child. Their mind in that concentrated, highly emotional state, switches realities and they are no longer subject to the 'rules' of this one. A lady told me how she spent a long time in a room fighting a fire amid smoke so dense"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 220 and toxic that no one else could stay there for more than a few seconds. Even then they were treated for the effects of smoke on their lungs, but my friend was found to be perfectly OK. She didn't even remember any smoke in the room. Once again she had changed realities in her stress and focus of mind and could not be effected by the laws of the reality that was effecting everyone else. How many times do we hear it said that someone surviving an ordeal that should have killed them has had a 'miraculous escape'? They changed realities at the crucial moment, that's all, no miracles necessary. There is a point I'd like to stress here that I feel people get confused about. They equate performing these apparent 'miracles' with spiritual enlightenment and advancement and this can be a real trap. You are not some 'living god on Earth' because you can do the party tricks that come from knowing how we create reality. You can be a con man, quite easily, and the Illuminati are using these techniques all the while. These abilities can, and are, used by those who wish to expose the illusion and help people to awaken from it. But they don't have to be. It's only knowledge and you can use it any way you want. Here, there and everywhere My wife, Pam, pointed out that within the word everywhere is also the word here, as in everywhere. How appropriate because everything is here and everywhere. In the same way, nowhere is also nowhere. As that old Jeff Beck song goes: \"You're everywhere and nowhere, baby, that's where you're at.\" 24 A wave pattern that can be in many places at once suddenly manifests in a single location when it is observed. This is known as the wave collapse. The waves and the particles are the same and they are both here and everywhere. Subatomic particles can talk to each other over any distance without any communication being measured. What makes this possible is that the particles are both each other and all the 'space' in between. They actually don't have to communicate because they are the same. Is there any need for the following conversation between two 'particles' that are both the same David Icke? \"Hello, David Icke here, is that David lcke?\" \"Yeah, this is David Icke, nice to talk to you, David lcke.\" \"I have a message for you, David, can we manifest as a tea cup, please, someone just looked at me?\" \"I'm already on it David, bone china, right?\" \"Thanks David.\" \"That's OK, David.\" . Such a conversation is unnecessary and so is communication between subatomic particles. The hologram is a perfect example of this theme. One of the amazing traits of the hologram is that every part contains the whole (see Figure 51, look good, don't I?). If you cut a holographic film into four pieces and shine the laser on to each of them, they will not reveal four parts of the picture. Each will show a smaller "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 221 Figure 51: Fine figure of a hologram. Every part of a hologram contains a picture of the whole and this is why every cell in the body contains the information to grow another whole. The body is a holographic illusion Figures 52 and 53: Reflexology and acupuncture can find a representation of the whole body in the foot. the ear and elsewhere because the body is a hologram and every part contains a smaller version of the whole body version of the whole picture. Cut the print into as many pieces as you want and they will always project the same whole image when the laser is shone on them. It is because the human body is a hologram that every cell contains all the information necessary to 'grow' a whole body; hence they can clone people and animals from a single cell. Conventional 'medicine' sitting in its establishment bunker dismisses alternatives like reflexology and cranial therapy as ridiculous quackery with no basis in 'science'. If they were not so mesmerised by their Mickey Mouse medicine that serves the Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel so wonderfully well, they would realise that the body is a hologram and the basis of such alternatives could not be simpler. Reflexology is an ancient form of healing that is based on the understanding that different parts of the body, like the feet, hands and ears are mirrors of the whole body (see the foot and ear chart~ in"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 222 Figures 52 and 53). The art goes back at least to the ancient Indian, Egyptian and Chinese people, but yet again our beloved medical establishment decide they know best, why? they actually know next to nothing. Reflexology identifies points on the fee( hands, ear, etc., that relate to organs of the body and through these points any imbalances in the organs can be treated. This is not only perfectly logical when you realise that the body is a hologram, it is how it must be because every part of a hologram contains the image of the whole. Every cell contains the whole, for goodness sake, as even the medical establishment has had to recognise. The ancient art of acupuncture is based on the holographic sub-systems of the body, as is palm reading because the hand contains the whole body. More than that, every part of every hand, foot and ear also contains the whole and so does every part of every finger and every part of every part of the finger. The body hologram is an expression of the hologram that is the universe and the cosmos, and so is every part of the body down to every cell, atom and electron. Holographic memory So to the brain, the computer-like interface between the mind and the holographic 'body' of the five-senses. The brain is not the mind, it is a computer used by the mind and thus scientists have never located where in the brain lies the mind. They never will because it's not there. We don't think from the brain, but through the brain at the five-sense level of reality. Mainstream science has also been unable to locate the area of the brain that contains the memory because the memory (the computer hard drive) exists throughout the brain. Of course it does, the brain is a hologram and every part contains the ·whole. Horrible experiments on animals have removed massive parts of their brains and still found they could remember the tasks they were set when the whole brain was intact. People who have large parts of their brains removed because of tumours do not lose specific memories. They might not remember in general quite so well because they have moved to a smaller level of the holographic memory where there is less clarity than in the whole. But they don't lose one memory completely and retain another in crystal clarity c1S they would if memory was located in one area. The hologram has a staggering capacity to store information. You can store many pictures on the same piece of holographic film, for instance, and by changing the angle at which you direct the laser you can choose which one you want to see. Accessing our memory works in basically the same way. We move our 'laser' to find the information we are looking for in the hologram and those who can do this highly efficiently are said to have a 'photographic memory'. Yes, a holographic photographic memory. People can 'read' objects like watches or jewellery and glean from them detailed information about their history and owners because the objects are holograms and they have recorded that information. Our body holograms store memory from all of the senses. When, for instance, we smell something it can trigger a memory just as powerfully as when we see or hear something that recalls an experience. Our memory extends beyond even the brain hologram and is located throughout the body hologram, too. In turn, the body hologram contains the memory of the cosmic hologram and so on. Everything is connected to everything else. Everything iv everything else. The Matrix cannot literally divide the whole into parts because Oneness is always Oneness, but it can give the illusion of division and polarity, and this is what it does by manipulating our sense of reality. Division and polarity are il1usions because all is One. Holographic senses All our five-senses are holographic and are located throughout the hologram-body. Yes, even our sight. It is clear that we don't need eyes to see when you sift through the endless accounts of those who have experienced the out-of-body or near-death phenomena. They leave their bodies and their 'eyes', but they can still see. This is possible because the mind does not 'see', it decodes frequency patterns into holographic illusions it thinks it sees. It is a virtual reality and you don't need eyes to see what your mind is thinking because it is all happening 'in here', not 'out there'. If something can decode frequencies into holograms it can 'see'. As all consciousness can do this, everything can 'see' and every part of the body hologram has 'eyes'. Excuse me while 1 look through my big toe at the inside of my sock. Anyone got a needle? No really, we can see throughout the body and that must be the case if the body is a hologram. More horrible experiments (I don't want to know that badly, thanks) have shown that rats can continue to see perfectly well with 90 per cent of their visual cortex in the brain removed, while cats continue to see after 98 per cent of their optic nerves have ceased to function. There have been many experiments to show how some people"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 223 can see and read through their hands while their eyes were covered with a blindfold. The hands and all other parts of the body can send visual messages to the visual cortex in the brain from where we 'see'. But in fact, we don't even need the brain to 'see' - that's just another level of the multi-levelled illusion. Does the infinite need eyes or a brain to see?? Paul Bach-y-Rita, a neuroscientist and physician at Wisconsin-Madison University, says: \"You don't see with the eyes. You see with the brain.\" (Beyond that we see with the mind). When an image reaches the eye's retina, he says, it \"becomes nerve pulses no different from those from the big toe\". Information enters the eyes as a frequency pattern and the brain turns it into a 3-D image. Now, because every part of a hologram contains the whole, every part of the body - the hand, toe, knee - has the ability to pass frequency patterns to the brain, which it transforms into holograms that we can 'see'. This means that people really do have eyes in their backsides. I have heard some people speak of being able to see 360 degrees when they have entered altered states of consciousness that make them more attuned to these senses by withdrawing their focus from the five-sense consensus reality. All this is perfectly explainable from the holographic perspective. Life magazine featured a Russian woman called Rosa Kuleshova who could read with her fingertips and others have been able to do the same with other parts of their bodies like the nose and ear.2\" David Eisenberg MD, a clinical research fellow at the Harvard Medical School, highlighted two young Chinese sisters who could read with their armpits! 20 There was also the 'miraculous' discovery by Paul Bach-y-Rita and other researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that we can see through our tongues. They have developed a device to stimulate the tongue's ability to 'see' and this has allowed blind people to regain vision. One report said: \"The tongue, an organ of taste and touch, may seem like an unlikely substitute for the eyes. After all, it's usually hidden inside the mouth, insensitive to light, and not connected to optic nerves. However, a growing body of research indicates that the tongue may in fact be the second-best place on the body for receiving visual information from the world and transmitting it to the brain. \"Earlier research had used the skin as a route for images to reach the nervous system. That people can decode nerve pulses as visual information when they come from sources other than the eyes shows how adaptable, or plastic, the brain is. says Wisconsin one of the device's inventors.\" 27 Research is underway to see if other lost senses can be restored by routing them through other parts of the body. They will find that they can for the reasons I have described. Most people cannot access these inherent abilities because they don't know they have them and they don't believe they have them. Until they do, they won't. We are what we think we are and we can do what we believe we can do. Every part of the hologram has the senses of the whole and is conscious. Michael Talbot tells a story in The Holographic Universe that gave him an insight into this. He had been having trouble with his spleen and had been using visualisation to treat the problem, using his mind to rebalance the hologram that is the spleen. One night he became frustrated with the process and, in the privacy of his own thoughts, gave his spleen a right rollicking for not responding quickly enough. A few days later he went to see a psychic about his health. She identified the spleen problem and then paused, looking confused, before saying: \"Your spleen's very upset about something ... have you been yelling at your spleen?\" She said the spleen became ill because it thought that is what Talbot wanted. He had been giving the wrong messages, she said, and now the spleen was confused at being scalded. \"Never, never get angry with your body or your internal organs\", she said, \"Only send them positive messages.\" 2~ Big bang baloney A little observation in the light of all this. Science says that the universe was created by the 'Big Bang'. It says that matter was concentrated in a fireball of enormous density and this was all that existed. Then the fireball, or cosmic egg, exploded and the matter and space it contained expanded out from the centre and is still expanding. The official theory says this is why the galaxies etc. are still moving away from each other. Out of this cooling explosion of matter came the universe as we see it, we are told. But hold on. If there is no matter because matter is an illusion of the mind, how could there be a \"Big Bang\" of original matter, except as an illusion? The universe, like everything in the Matrix, is a mass of vibrational thought fields that our minds decode into a 3-D holographic illusion. As a result of this big bang explosion and the process that followed, the official story goes, subatomic particles emerged. But if waveforms only become particles when they are observed, how could they be created by a process of 'matter' that followed the explosion?"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 224 They could only be 'formed' out of thought fields by being observed into holograms. Maybe someone was looking, eh? The universe is the thought equivalent of a computer program and just as a software program does not need to explode to be seen in Windows 2000, neither does the universe need to explode to be formed as thought fields observed into holographic illusion. Imagine if there was an explosion of 'matter' every time a thought field was created. It would be bloody noisy, wouldn't it? BOOM! \"Hey Ethel, stop thinking will you, I can't hear the telly.\" \"Sorry dear, I was just thinking we need some more cheese.\" BOOM! \"And some tomatoes.\" BOOM! \"Etheeeee1!\" There was no need for an explosion to create the universe. Once the thought fields are projected it's a done deal. If the galaxies are still moving away from each other, that is because the 'program' was written that way, not because something had to go 'bang'. The infinite 'One' In my altered states in Brazil I entered a 'place' in which I was consciously 'me', but also everything else. This is a state of being that has been described throughout known 'history' by mystics, meditators, people under the influence of psychoactive drugs, and those who have had 'near death' and 'out-of-body' experiences - those who have expanded their conscious awareness to beyond the Time Loop's five-sense-reality where all appears to be divided into independent parts. David Bohm and Karl Pribram, two of the world's leading researchers into holographic reality, agree these out-of-body experiences sound like what they call the 'implicate order' - the world the five-senses cannot perceive.2Q Mainstream science, the science of the Illuminati agenda, rejects Oneness and promotes a belief in unconnected parts. This serves the Matrix magnificently. It conditions this belief in the human mind and we then see what we have been programmed to see - a world of parts and not the seamless 'One'. Such a sense of isolation and disconnection brings a perception of being small, powerless and insignificant. This is what the Matrix needs to hold us in its spell. It also means that we seek 'individual' solutions to problems when you can never find a 'solution' without realising that everything is connected. A simple example is the way 'Western' governments give 'aid' to poor countries while the translational corporations from the 'West' exploit those countries and bleed them dry of far more wealth than they ever receive in aid. If you don't view the world economy as a whole and change the way it functions as a whole, you will never solve the 'individual' problems and injustices that such an imbalanced whole is bound to cause. Viewing everything as unconnected parts and not as a seamless Oneness is vital to the Matrix/Illuminati agenda. It is no accident, therefore, that, as I have detailed in other books, the Royal Society in London, the home of establishment science, was created by high degree Freemasons on behalf of the Illuminati. The so-called 'classic physics' of the materialists became the official line from the 17th century with Isaac Newton and the French mathematician, Rene Descartes, who viewed the world as a machine. This dogma denied the existence of the spirit because they believed they could explain life without a need for one. But like most of the 'facts' pedalled by mainstream science these were not proofs, but mere assumptions. According to the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail,3° Isaac Newton is reported to have been a grand master of an elite secret society in the Illuminati web called the Priory of Sion (see my other books). It claims to go back at least to the 12th century and to have been originally closely connected to the Illuminati Knights Templar. Others dispute this, however. The Priory of Sion says it seeks to advance the goals and influence of the Merovingian bloodline that today manifests as the royal families of Europe, a long list of US presidents and others in positions of global banking, business and media power. With the advanced esoteric knowledge available in the upper levels of secret societies, there is no chance that Isaac Newton was not aware that his version of materialism, a world only of matter, was a nonsense. But how this has served the Illuminati agenda as it denied the existence of the spirit (when you're dead, your dead) and viewed the world as a series of parts and not as one unified, infinite whole. The basis of mainstream science is baloney and those in control know it. Stanislav Grof, writing in The Holotropic Mind, says: \"A true scientist does not confuse theory with reality and does not try to dictate what nature should be like. It is not up to us to decide what the human psyche can do and what it cannot do to fit our neatly organized preconceived ideas. If we are ever to discover how we can best cooperate with the psyche. we have to allow it to reveal its true nature to us.\" 31 The Illuminati are desperate to prevent this, of course. Others are now challenging this deception, however, and people like the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and London University physicist David Bohm say that"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 225 every 'part' is an expression of one indivisible whole. A gathering army of real scientists are saying the same. They are accepting what mystics and their like ha\\'e been saying all along. Those with open hearts and minds are beginning to speak the same language of Oneness even though they come to this conclusion from different directions. There is no 'empty space' and there are no 'vacuums'. Everywhere is consciousness that connects everything to everything else. David Bohm and others have established that not only do two particles act as if they know what the other is doing, trillions of them do. In fact, all of them do because all is all. Everything is everything. Behind the apparent diversity is one consciousness. I have heard this explained as a vibration that is travelling so fast that it appears to be everything, in the same way that if you orbited the Earth at fantastic speed you w0uld never know where you were at any point and you would seem to be everywhere on the planet at the same time. I don't buy that. The Infinite doesn't have to travel at such speeds to be everywhere. It doesn't have to travel at all. It is already everywhere. It just is. Why would you have to move to appear to be everything and everywhere when you are always everything and everywhere? Bohm believes that we need to look at the world as a ballet dance and not as a crowd of unorganised people. The dance is the prime reality, not the 'individual' dancers. But as the poet William Butler Yeats wrote: \"You cannot tell the dancer from the dance.\" Our five-senses can only perceive an almost immeasurable fraction of the Infinite and yet humanity has been kidded into believing that what it thinks it sees is all there is. On a basic level we talk of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, but they are the same body of water. Every subatomic particle, atom, cell, organ, limb, body and mind is a mirror of the cosmos. They are the cosmos and the cosmos is them. It is the same with every droplet of water, every tree, every tulip and blade of grass. In the words of William Blake: To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And. Eternity in an hour. The imprisoned minds of the Matrix may have forgotten they are the Infinite, but they are and always shall be. The only difference between the Infinite and the Matrix is that the Infinite knows it is the Infinite and the Matrix has forgotten. You are not Joe Bloggs or Bill Smith; that is only a programmed illusion. You are all that is: everything. Yes, little old 'insignificant', 'powerless', you. We don't live life; we are life.

What mysteries? Man is what he believes Anton Chekhov (1860 - 1904) I was once interviewed by a Christian radio host and I made the point that Christianity and official 'science' refused to investigate the mysteries of life unless the outcome conformed to their belief system. \"Welt maybe there are mysteries that God doesn't want us to know\", he said. This is typical of the little me, BIG GOD, concept of mainstream religion that maintains its followers in life-long slavery to a fairy tale. Investigating mysteries with an open mind is fatal for both religion and establishment 'science' because dogma can only survive if it remains unchallenged. So, dear child of the Lord, have faith and shut-the-fuck-up. You too, professor. It is not 'God' that doesn't want us to know; it is the Illuminati and the Matrix that invented the whole concept 'Of 'God' to serve their ends. They don't care what your rigid belief may be, so long as you have one, and it has ensured you have plenty to choose from. Rigid dogma = closed mind = the Matrix has you. As we have seen, once we begin to understand reality and how it is made manifest, the mysteries of life, unanswerable by religion and mainstream 'science', become rather less mysterious. Different minds, different faces Since the early 1990s, I have been researching the mind-control technique known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). As I outlined earlier, this is when the mind is fractured through trauma and programming into a series of apparent 'personalities' or 'altars', each with different attitudes, beliefs and often 'ages'. I have sat in a therapist's office and seen a 30year-old woman, who had been horrendously abused since childhood, manifest at least seven distinct 'personalities' in half an hour, including one of a baby. In line with all 'multiples', each 'personality' had its own name, background and characteristics, and each was brought forward in turn by the therapist using the correct trigger words and codes. The woman was very nice in 'front altar' mode, but one of her programmed back altars was pure venom when it was activated. What's more, as one 'personality' was switched to another the woman's face changed. This is one of the many 'mystery' characteristics of multiples; their facial features, including eye colour, can change when they switch personalities and so can their brainwave patterns. One 'personality' may be drunk or high on drugs, but when they are switched to another altar they cease to be effected in any way by the drink or drugs. I have met such people. Features on the skin, like moles and scars, can disappear when one altar replaces another as the conscious mind. The same body under one 'personality' maybe allergic to something, but not when other altars are activated; a doctor can prescribe a drug that will have an effect on the body under one altar, but have no effect with another. It even extends to the fact that they can overdose if a drug is given to an adult altar and they are then switched into one of their child personalities. They can be ill in one mode and perfectly healthy in another and they can be spark out under anaesthesia in one personality, yet wake up on the operating table fully conscious if another altar kicks in. Women with MPD can have different menstrual cycles with each personality. Another trait is that often multiples don't age anything like as quickly as the rest of us and they can look older or younger, depending on the altar in the driving seat at the time. I remember Cathy O'Brien, one of the be6t-known victims of US government mind-control, telling me that she was not allowed to know the 'time' in her mental captivity and in this period she did not perceptibly age. Mind is body and body is mind These apparently astonishing traits of multiple personality disorder are baffling to mainstream science. But from the perspective outlined here it is all quite straightforward. The body is a hologram manifested by mind and the mind's sense of reality is governed by its belief. When these various 'personalities' take control"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 228 of the body hologram it changes to match the new state of mind - belief. This can happen because the body hologram is an illusion of the mind and the mind can change it in any way it wants. What are known as altars or 'personalities' are simply different realities and when you change the sense of reality you change its holographic illusion. In fact, the different 'altars' are probably different holograms created by the different versions of reality. These different 'personalities' are different holographic 'brains', you might say, and the principle is similar to having many holographic pictures on the same photographic film. When you shine the laser at different angles on the wave patterns, you pick out a different picture. This is what the 'trigger' codes are doing that activate the different programmed personalities of the 'multiple’ They are accessing different programmed holograms. That is what the' altars' are. So let us look again at the 'mysteries' I outlined above. How can someone be drunk or high on drugs in one mode, but sober when switched to another? The reality that drinks the alcohol or takes the drugs, accepts that it will become intoxicated or high because that is it's conditioned and, through the DNA, inherited belief. It doesn't have to react in this way because the booze and drugs are an illusion, as is the body, and how can the effect of an illusion on an illusion be real? Do you think the Infinite gets pissed? When an altar - holographic reality - is switched, the new altar /hologram does not have the reality of being drunk or high. How could it? It was not the reality that popped the pills or swigged the liquor. Why should it be affected by them? Skin features like moles and scars appear and disappear depending on the reality of the mind hologram in control. Maybe an altar reality was formed before the illusion of the scar or mole \\\",'as there. If so, it is not going to manifest something it does not believe in. It is the same with an allergy. If the altar-reality does not believe it has an allergy, it won't have one. Without the cooperation of the mind-brain (consciousness and computer) it can't. The effect of a drug depends on whether the prevailing reality believes in it. If it does, the drug will 'work', if it doesn't, it will not. Remember, much of this is taking place on a non-conscious, as well as a conscious level. The drug given to an 'adult' altar that overdoses the 'child' altar is, once again, an example of different realities experiencing what they believe on conscious and unconscious levels, and through the inherited DNA programming. How can it be any other way? The difference is not the 'physical body'; it is the reality of the mind. Illness and disease are illusions. One reality may believe it is ill while another may not. When the switch happens the illness will disappear in a flash because it, was an illusion to start with and the new altar hologram does not believe in it. A multiple can feel pain in one altar and it will disappear in another, just as some altars may need spectacles, but others will see 20/20. If you give an aesthetic to one brain-hologram, and it accepts the effect, it will be off to the land of nod. But if \"'. another one takes over, how can it be effected by the aesthetic when it does not have the reality of having the shot? It can't. It wakes up with no idea what is going on \"what are you doing with that bloody knife, mate?\" It's all illusion, as are the menstrual cycles of women. Does the Infinite have a period? Oh, but the woman must menstruate to release the build up of blood, right? Oh really? Then why could the bodies of some multiples have a continuous period if the altars were activated in the correct sequence? Where does all that blood come from? Or, if you structured the sequence in another way, they could never have a period. Where does all that blood go? It goes nowhere and it comes from nowhere: it is ILLUSION! Why is it that multiples that are disconnected from the five-sense version of 'time' don't age. or at least age as fast as everyone else? By now this answers itself. There is no time, so how can time age us? When you use a laser to project a holographic picture of ,) human body it doesn't age no matter how long you leave it there. You could leave it for a thousand years and it would not age a second. Our bodies are holograms and we could do the same. We only appear to age because we believe in 'time' and the illusory passage from 'past' to 'future'. We age because we believe we do. Does the Infinite need Botox? The facial features of multiples change as they switch because our illusory faces merely reflect our sense of reality. Our bodily features are holographic illusions; change the illusion in your mind and you change the features you appear to 'see'. You switch holographic realities. All this is not confined to those with multiple personality disorder; it applies to everyone. Now, what is another term for this instant transformation of facial and body features? Go on you sceptics who have laughed all these years I know it's hard, but do try ... shhhh ... yes, almost there ... shhh-ape ... go on yes, yes ... shape-shifting! Exactly. When you see just how illusory our reality is, shape-shifting Reptilians are a small deal indeed. Shape-shifting? That Icke's a nutter."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" 229 Since I began writing and speaking about shape-shifting, I have, naturally, been the subject of still more ridicule. I understand why people have dismissed the idea because they are so caught in the illusion of the 'physical' and cannot perceive of anything that does not conform to its 'laws'. But there is no 'physical', it's illusion; and an illusion can take any form its creator wants and shift from one to another at will. Visualise a human being now in your mind and watch him or her shape-shift into a Reptilian entity. See, an illusion is anything you choose it to be. Accounts of shape-shifting beings, not least those who shift between 'human' and reptilian form, abound throughout the ancient world, as we have seen. They feature in the accounts of the same people who said that all was One and this world was 'maya' illusion; the same 'primitive people' who are now being proved right by the cutting edge of scientific research. Let us get down to some scientific basics here. The scientists say this 'physical' world is made up of atoms and subatomic particles such as electrons. This is how Michael Talbot describes their properties in The Holographic Universe: \"The electron, like some shape-shifter out of folklore, can manifest as either a particle or a wave .. , This chameleon-like ability is common to all subatomic particles. It is also common to all things once thought to manifest exclusively as waves. Light, gamma rays, radio waves, X-rays - all can change from waves and back again. Today physicists believe that subatomic phenomena should not be classified solely as either waves or particles, but as a single category of some things that are always somehow both. These some things are called quanta, and physicists believe they are the basic stuff from which the entire universe is made.\" 1 People dismiss the ancient and modern claims about shape-shifters when the whole cosmos down to the tiniest particle is in a constant state of shape-shifting! For goodness sake an electron can appear in one place and then another without passing through the 'space' in between, the so-called 'quantum jump', But shape-shifting is not possible? Talbot adds: \"The capacity to shape-shift from one kind of particle to another is just another of a quantum's abilities.\" A particle in the blood called the somatid is \"an astonishing shape-shifter in culture\" and \"in rapid progression (less than 90 hours) it can be spore, double spore, bacteria, microbial globular form, yeast, ascii, mycelial form, fibrous thallus, etc.\"2 But how can a person shape-shift from one 'body' to another when they would have to do an instant 'swap' of their heart, lungs, liver and so on? Surely they would die? No, no. I realise it is a massive leap, but I repeat: the body is an illusion, a figment of the programmed mind. It is really a frequency field, a thought form, and this is how people can appear and disappear just like the guy meditating in the woman's house. You don't need your organs to survive unless you believe you do and create that reality. You don't need to eat and you don't need to breathe if you can override the programming that you do. A woman called Therese Neumann did not eat or drink for 35 years. She began to drink only liquids in 1923 and four years later even stopped that. In one two week period in July 1927, a medical doctor and four Franciscan nurses kept a watch on her 24 hours a day. They confirmed that she consumed nothing and had no ill effects, loss of weight or dehydration.3 This continued for the rest of her life. Taking her to dinner would have been a cheap date, eh? \"What would you like to eat, darling?\" \"Er, nothin'.\" The body is a holographic illusion and if your mind is deprogrammed enough you can turn it into a bus if you want. \"Hey, Ethel, I have decided to be the number 28 to Oxford Street\" - \"OK dear, mind the traffic.\" Michael Talbot says of extraterrestrial entities: \" ... if we are being visited by beings who are as insubstantial and plastic in form as the bodies [out-of-body experiencers] find themselves in after they have exteriorised, it is not at all surprising that they might appear in a chameleon-like multitude of shapes.\" 4 I emphasised in Children of the Matrix that what we call 'extraterrestrials' are really 'inter-dimensionals'. Our 'bodies' take a form that reflects our state of being and it could well be that the manipulators (sentient programs) projected by the Matrix often take a reptilian form because their emotionless state and survival mentality is an expression of the same basic thought field blueprint or programme that we can observe in the emotionless, survivalist, Reptilian species in the Illuminati on Earth. What people see now as extraterrestrials are the modern expression of the 'fairies', 'elves' and 'little people' that the ancients claimed to have seen. What we can say with certainty is that extraterrestrials and the 'fairies' do not exist as solid 'real' 3-D entities. Why so sure? Because nothing exists in that form, except as illusions. 'Extraterrestrial' holograms "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" 230 The ETs and fairies will be, as with everything in the Matrix, frequency patterns that can take any form they, or their creator, chooses. This is the basis of shape-shifting once again. It is the frequency pattern that 'shifts' and it appears to the five-sense level that the physical body has shifted. It has, but only because its base form, a vibrational pattern, has changed and we have changed the way we decode the pattern into a hologram. These frequency 'entities' can take any form they wish when they understand the process. Also, our sense of reality decodes these patterns into holographic form and it could well be that we 'see' these entities in the form that suits our prevailing reality: i.e. the ancients would 'see' them as fairies, elves and goblins, while we would decode them as high-tech 'ETs'. Many people have reported seeing 'angels' or had visions of Jesus or Mother Mary. Sometimes enormous shrines have been built as a result and the 'visionary' given sainthood. These are illusions, creations of belief and manipulated thought projections designed to confirm such belief. The visions 'see' the classic portrayals of 'Jesus' and 'Mary' when those portrayals are only the result of painters who presented their own idea of how they looked. One of the most famous Christian 'visions' was at Knock, Ireland, in 1879 when fourteen people saw the glowing figures of Jesus, Mary and St John the Evangelist near a church. In line with what I have just said, the vision of St John looked very much like a statue of him in a local village. The figures were so real that the witnesses could read the letters on the book that 'John' was holding. But when one of them, a woman, tried to touch 'Mary', there was nothing to embrace but air. The woman said: \"The figures appeared so full and lifelike I could not understand why my hands could not feel what was so plain and distinct to my sight.\" , The figures were holograms and were no more real than the 3-D image of a holographic photograph of an apple or pear. The only difference between 'Mary' and the bodies we think we have is the illusion of density. Is it now still so incredible that those in control of our collective reality, the Illuminati, are holographic projections or 'sentient programs' and not 'human' or even consciousness as we perceive it? What are the 'spaceships' that so many people 'see'? They are frequency fields and 3-D illusions and they can defy the 'laws' of this reality, just as the firewalker does not burn his feet. Michael Talbot tells in The Holographic Universe how he saw a holographic image of a werewolf form around his body when he was writing a novel about them: \" ... the holographic-like image that enveloped my body was real enough that when I lifted my arm I could actually see individual hairs in the fur and the way the canine nails protruded from the wolfish hand that encased my own hand.\" 6 A psychic, Carol Dryer, walked into the room and also saw the-'werewolf', but when he stopped thinking about the novel the image faded. Psychics often report seeing holographic objects around people and these are thought patterns in the person's ayra or energy field that the psychic observes into a 3-D reality. Carol Dryer apparently saw potatoes swirling around a woman's head on one occasion and it turned out she worked for a potato organisation in Idaho. Living to die? Or dying to live? If our bodies don't exist, except as thought fields and holographic illusions, how can they die? Only if we, and they, through their DNA programming, believe they can. Believe in death and you will appear to 'die'. Don't believe in it and you can't. By that I don't mean that you will be condemned to live in the body for all infinity; you can drop the illusion whenever you choose. I mean the difference between 'dying' as perceived in the present sense and consciously deciding to leave the illusion in the full awareness that this is what you are doing. Death has been described as walking in your mind and that is all it is, a change of perception and point of observation. Even if you believe in death you still won't die in the sense of ceasing to exist because you can't. You are infinite consciousness. You can 'believe' your body into the grave, yes, and billions do. But once that has been unloaded you are still conscious in another reality. This is the transformation process behind the 'mystery' of near-death (NDE) and out-of body (OBE) experiences. They are only a mystery because establishment science cannot explain them. Incalculable numbers of people have experienced leaving their bodies on operating tables or after heart attacks and road accidents only to learn that they had 'died' when it was happening (NDE). Others have experienced a spontaneous disconnection between body and mind without 'physically dying' (OBE). The NDE and OBE have also been described in accounts throughout known 'history'. Both groups tell basically the same story. The common theme of these experiences is floating above the body with mind and sight intact. They can give themselves new 'bodies' in this state simply by thinking of one and sometimes they still look like the body they have recently left. This is what was called in the first Matrix movie 'residual self-image'. This is the way your mind is used to"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 231 perceiving its form and so it continues to do so. People who have returned from these disembodied states have said that they had no form until they 'thought' and then whatever they thought became their reality. This is what is happening in the five-sense world, if we only realised, and it is this process the Illuminati work so hard to exploit. Robert Monroe, a highly experienced 'OBEer', who founded the Monroe Institute in America, described his form in the out-of-body state as a \"vibrational pattern\" made up of \"many interacting and resonating frequencies\".7 Yes, that is what we are in our Matrix state, but not when we are truly and consciously at One with the Infinite because the Infinite in awareness of itself does not vibrate. Only illusion vibrates. Mind thinks all (vibration). Heart is all (stillness). Those who have left their bodies also speak of the feeling of Oneness, of being everything. But I wonder how many are actually experiencing Oneness in its Infinite sense and how many are experiencing a state that is simply far more like Oneness than they experience in the Time Loop, the greatest level of illusory disconnection. Most people judge their level of happiness by their le\\'el of unhappiness. They are not actually happy, but they are less unhappy than at other times and so they take this to be happiness. Another constant report from NDEers and OBEers is that they can go anywhere in an instant. As many have said: \"1 on Iv had to think it and I was there.\" That may be the perception, but 1 would describe it another way: you only have to think it and you become conscious of a 'there' where you already are! How? Because 'there' is you. Everywhere is you. 'You' are everything and everything is everywhere. Why would you have to move when you are everywhere already? Where does the holographic body exist when every part of the hologram contains the whole and is the whole? 'Heaven' and 'Hell' Many of those who have had a near-death experience have described in detail the activity and conversations in the room or operating theatre-while they were 'dead' and floating above their body. The wealth of supporting evidence is now so enormous that even mainstream science has had to take it seriously, at least on the surface. I read of experiments in which certain symbols were placed on the top of light shades in operating theatres that only someone floating above them could see. \"Hey, doc, you've got some funny symbols on your light shades.\" Eureka!! Those who have experienced life without the body invariably tell of a beautiful world of love and bliss from which they do not want to return. They talk of going through a 'tunnel', meeting dead relatives and beings of light, who tell them it is not their 'time' to die and they must return. For me, these stories mostly describe other dimensions of the Matrix. They are experiencing less dense realms of the Matrix vortex, but the Matrix still has them. These are the realities to which most consciousness gravitates between 're-incarnations' back into the Time Loop illusion. Interestingly, in line with what I outlined earlier, those with a Christian belief tend to see Christian deities and scenes in these near-death states, while a Hindu and believers in other religions tend to see their version of where they expect to go after 'death'. They are free of their Earth body, but not free of the illusion. Death is no cure for ignorance and the Matrix is full of these traps because it needs to stop its energy supply from leaving the illusion, the vortex, and consciously connecting with Infinite Oneness. These Hindu, Christian, Jewish and Muslim 'heavens' are as much an illusion as the reality we experience. They are frequency patterns that the still-' disconnected' mind observes into its holographic version of reality after death'. Someone who commits suicide in a dark and desolate state is likely to experience an illusion of that - a 'Hell' of their own making. Those overwhelmed by guilt, who believe that their behaviour will condemn them to alil eternity stoking the fires for the guy with the horns, will likely create that illusory experience. Heaven is an illusion and Hell is an illusion. They are manipulated polarities created by the Matrix and in many ways the ultimate ones. The holographic illusion extends throughout the Matrix and only the vibrational density differs in these different realities. The idea of 'old souls' and 'new souls' is a myth, I would suggest. These terms only describe levels of illusory disconnection. Another illusion, I would say, is the 'life review', much recounted by near death experiencers, in which we are supposed to see all that we have experienced in a five-sense lifetime to help us understand what we still have to 'work on' and learn. Does the Infinite have to go to school when it knows everything? Does the Infinite need to have endless lives on Earth to become enlightened? Does the Infinite need a 'life review' to decide its future curriculum? Does the Infinite have an 'old soul' or a 'new soul'? Does the Infinite have to be turned back at the border by 'beings of light' and told that it still has things to learn? Does the Infinite need a religion? Can the Infinite die? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right, agreed. Then neither do WE!! It's all illusion. I am not saying that"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 232 these things are not experienced by discarnate entities in other levels of the Matrix. I have no doubt that in their reality they are. I am saying that these are illusions and not necessary. When disabled people have out-of-body experiences their disability disappears and the 'old' can be 'young' if only they choose to think it. All the 'rules' of limitation they believed to exist are seen to be illusions of the mind/brain. Does the Infinite need a wheelchair? Then neither do we - unless we and our holograms think we do. Mental handicap is also an illusion of the body hologram which identifies who it is and what it can do with the 'physical laws' its inherited programming believes to be real. Can the Infinite be mentally handicapped? No, then neither can we - unless we and our body programming believe in the possibility. When someone dubbed mentally handicapped leaves the five-sense realm they are no longer 'handicapped'. It is a programmed illusion of mind and body. There is a New Age belief that 'souls' sometimes choose to experience disabled bodies in their journey of evolutionary experience. I would not dispute that this can happen, just as I do not dispute the fact that astrology, tarot card readings, and many of the other New Age and Eastern techniques can be extremely accurate in gifted hands. I am not saying that these are not valid in the realms of vibration, quite the opposite. I am, however, suggesting that they are phenomena of the Matrix and, as such, illusions that can help to trap us if we are not aware of this. I am not a friggin' Taurus, I am the Infinite All. But if I believe I am a Taurus, I will be, and I will identify with being a part and not the whole. There is no David Icke illusion - so how can he be a Taurus? The souls that re-incarnate into different 'bodies' in the Time Loop, as I'm sure they do, are similarly caught in the Matrix illusion of learning through experience when they already know everything. Why 'good' and 'evil' need each other How ironic that the greatest human fear is dying (fear of the unknown) when we don't and cannot die. It is this fear that drives the engine of the 'health' industry in all its forms and has turned the doctor into a demi-god. Oh, doctor, please save me, I don't want to die!! I understand that in humanity's conditioned state. But the very fact that you believe you can die means, that you will experience the illusion of it and if you believe that the doctor can make things go right it also means that Y01,t accept that things can go wrong. One polarity creates the other. If people believe in the doctor when he says he will 'cure' them, they will also believe in the doctor when he tells them he can't. They 'die' because they believe that is what must happen. They think themselves to death. After all, the doctor I believe has cured me in the 'past' now says nothing can be done. See the polarity? The belief in the doctor's ability to heal creates a belief in the doctor when he says he cannot heal. For this reason, as endless research has shown, when a doctor tells someone they have six months to live that is pretty much how long most of them last. They think themselves to death because of their belief in the doctor. I would suggest that the key realisation here is not that the doctor can cure or not cure, but that there is nothing to cure and there is no doctor! It is manipulated illusion. A belief in 'good' must, by definition, create the illusion of 'evil'. How can there be a belief in good if there is not also a belief in evil? Left needs Right in politics for the same reason and the 'pros' need the 'antis'. Vibration is the realm of illusion and to vibrate you need to create a rhythm, a beat that oscillates between two points, as a pendulum needs to swing between two points or it must be still. How can a pendulum swing if it only has one point? For every 'to' there has to be a 'fro' and vice versa. Without the two points there can only be stillness (the Infinite). The Matrix is illusory duality and the division of the One. Look at the laser beam that has to be divided into two for the holographic pattern to be produced. Thought, too, is illusion. Thinking is not being, just as believing is not knowing. Our loss of awareness of the One means that we have to recognise everything by differences. We know what is hot because we know what is cold; we know what is loud because we know what is quiet. Without the dualities to compare, everything would just be. The realm of vibrational illusion depends for its very existence on polarity, duality, and the whole agenda of the Matrix is to maintain the illusion of polarity in all things. People have said to me that I am a 'good man'. But I am not 'good', I just am. A 'good man' is a polarity. Others ha\\'e said I am a 'bad man'. But I am not 'bad', I just am. A bad man is a polarity that provides the oscillation point to vibrate with the good man. Polarities are Matrix illusions. Keep taking the tablets (it's good for business) "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" 233 The pharmaceutical cartel is one of the major arms of the Illuminati and it makes multi-billions a year from the illusion that drugs actually heal people. But how can they do that, except by planting a belief that they do? The body is a holographic illusion of the mind. How can it possibly be healed by a pill or potion that is only another illusion? 'Pills' are frequency fields that can affect the frequency field of the budy hologram - but even then only if we think they can. Hey, but what about the ayahuasca and other psychoactives that have taken me into altered states? They, too, only work because I believe they will. The trick is going into these other realms without external stimulus because we can do that if it is our reality. In the second session of the ayahuasca in Brazil the voice said to me: \"Do you think you are experiencing this because of a plant? Illusion. Ayahuasca is an illusion because plants are illusions. Your mind altered itself because it believed in the plant. \" This would explain how I was able on the first night to snap out of the deeply altered state the moment the voice spoke the words \"it is over for tonight\". The effect should have lasted for far longer, but my mind intervened in the illusion and changed it. I felt ill when I took the ayahuasca simply because that is the effect I believed it would have. In other altered states I have been able to return to five-sense reality in a flash. How could this be possible if it was the substance that was really controlling the experience? Someone with multiple personality disorder can be drugged in one mode and unaffected in another, as we have seen. Funnily enough, a few minutes after I wrote the above I was skimming through a book when I saw a reference to people in LSD trials that were given a fake dose or 'placebo' and yet still 'tripped' for hours just like those who had taken the real LSD. Richard Alpert, a psychologist at Harvard, who later became known as the mystic, Ram Dass, told another relevant story on this same theme. He was travelling near the Himalayas researching the affects of LSD. A 'holy man' in his sixties asked him for a large dose of LSD and increased it still further until it was massive, some four times greater than experienced 'trippers'. But he was playing with Alpert. The LSD had no effect on him because he knew it was an illusion and if that was his reality that had to be his experience.' The placebo is a wonderful example of the power of the mind to make its illusions 'real'. Fake pills are used to placate people who demand drugs not deemed to be necessary and they are also used in trials to test the effect of drugs in what are called 'double-blinds' like that LSD experiment. Half the people are given the 'real' drug and half the placebo. The power of the placebo to heal people is extraordinary and some have even become addicted to them! The reason is familiar by now belief. Another form of placebo is to cut people open in the operating theatre and sew them up again without doing anything to them. One such trial in the 1950s on patients with angina pectoris showed that the 'open and shut' placebo patients had as much relief as those who were given the normal surgery. Doctors have 'cured' a stream of complaints with a placebo, including warts that have disappeared when a purple dye was applied to them. The patients thought the dye was a treatment, but it wasn't, it was a placebo. Remember how people with multiple personalities can have warts in some altars and not in others? The accounts abound of the placebo effect like the man who was given a drug for asthma and improved immediately only for the doctor to be told later that he had been sent placebos by mistake and not the real drug. Even the enthusiasm of the doctor about a placebo's effect can make a significant difference to the outcome because it gives the patient more assurance that it is going to work. People given a placebo in double-blind tests-for chemotherapy drugs have lost their hair just like those taking the real thing. One of the most famous placebo stories was recounted by a psychologist, Bruno Klopfer, about a guy called Wright, who was suffering from an extremely advanced lymphatic cancer that was all over his body. He was in a terrible state. [n desperation, Wright asked his doctor to give him a new drug called Krebiozen that was undergoing trials. His doctor saw no point, but he eventually relented. He gave Wright the drug on a Friday and fully expected to find that he had died \\'I/hen he returned after the weekend. Instead, Wright was out of bed with the turn ours half their size and within ten days of taking the drug he was declared cancer free. It was a miracle, it seemed. All was fine for two months until Wright read articles that Krebiozen was not proving successful in the treatment of cancer. What happened? His cancer came back. His doctor now understood what was happening and assured him that the failed trials were from a faulty batch and that he had the real deal that worked. This time he gave him an injection of water (injections tend to work better as placebos because they are perceived to be more powerful than tablets). Wright's cancer disappeared once"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 234 more for another two months until the American Medical Association issued a statement saying that Krebiozen had no effect on cancer. There was now no escape for Wright's mind and he died two days later. 'Genetic disease' = inherited reality The latest 'in' topic in medicine is genetic disease. Some women are even having their perfectly healthy breasts removed because they have been told they have a 'cancer gene' that dramatically increases their likelihood of breast cancer. How insane can you get? But look at the daily bombardment through the media of scare stories about new threats of disease or dangers to our health. How many people develop these health problems because the possibility is planted in their minds in this way? Fantastic numbers worldwide, I have no doubt. We must allow human cloning because it can help to 'fight' genetic disease, we are told. But there is no need. Genetic disease, like all the others, is illusion! It is the inherited programming of the body hologram and we are more powerful than that if we choose to access and use that power. There are published examples of people being cured of genetic disease through hypnosis and of course that is possible because it is rewiring the reality of the mind and the inherited reality of the DNA. That is what 'DNA disease' really is - an inherited reality! How many more people suffer and die from a genetic disease only because some ignorant doctor says they have the 'gene' that makes them more likely to develop the problem? I dread to think. How often do we hear that a disease or complaint \"runs in the family\"? Yes, it runs in the family because the family thinks it runs in them. The inherited programming/ disease that is passed on through the family becomes their body / mind reality and so they can manifest that. They are not passing on a genetic flaw to the next generation, they are passing on their DNA's belief in the genetic flaw. Again, all this is happening at subconscious as well as conscious levels. Look how doctors describe to their patients the prognosis of an 'incurable' disease and the ever-worsening stages through which it will go. What happens? It does - if the patient accepts that belief. Alzheimer sufferers are one example of this and the same with Parkinson's disease. If the mind of the patient believes what the doctor says then that is what will happen. \"See, the doctor was right.\" No! The doctor has often programmed the patient's mind to believe that scenario and therefore it happens. It is sobering to ponder on the effect of this process in places like America where the doctor is held in such unquestioning awe. I have met some of these guys and what havoc they wreak. A little knowledge may be a dangerous thing, but no knowledge is lethal. This is the reverse of the placebo - believing ourselves ill. More mind over 'matter' The 'mystery' of stigmata, when people bleed through their hands and feet like 'Jesus' on the cross, is another potent expression of the power of the mind over the illusory body. Christianity has presented stigmata as \"it's a sign, a sign\". A sign of what, though? Of 'Jesus'? No, a sign of the person's belief. In the classic stigmata experience the blood flows from holes in the hands because that is the way that 'Jesus' has been portrayed on the cross in the paintings and statues, etc. But the hands cannot support the body -in this way and the Romans banged the nails into the wrists of those they crucified. That is not, however, the reality of the stigmata experiencer and it is their reality that their minds make 'real'. Many times the blood flows down the feet to the toes even when they point their toes to the sky because their programmed reality recreates the way they believe the blood flowed when 'Jesus' was on the cross. How can the blood overcome the laws of gravity? As I said earlier, gravity is an illusion because there are no laws unless we believe there are. When you have advanced cancers disappearing because someone believes a useless treatment will work and skin blemishes disappear because the patient believes in the power of a useless purple dye, what is the big deal any more about people with a profound religious belief manifesting the central symbols of their religion? It is not mind over matter because there is no matter. It is mind over illusion. Once again the power of the belief and the manifestation as stigmata comes from the subconscious level. Experiments with soldiers and others have shown that people do not get tired because of how far they have walked so much as how far they think they have walked or how far they think they still have to go. The mind tells the body it is tired. The body is an illusion and can never get tired until we tell it to be. Neither do we need sleep. We just believe we do and so we go Zzzzzzz. There are people who don't sleep at all and they are perfectly OK. Does the Infinite get knackered or go off to the land of nod? My daughter Kerry was a brilliant runner when she was younger, but I remember one night when she was really struggling in a"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" 235 middle distance race. She looked tired and was off the pace back in something like seventh position with the leaders way ahead. Suddenly, on the last bend with the finishing tape in sight, she produced the most amazing finish I have seen. She overtook runner after runner and missed winning the race by literally an inch or two. Her. mind had been telling her body it should be tired because that was her perception early in the race with several laps to go and the pace hot, right from the gun. But once she saw the finish line, even though she had run so far already, her mind knew it was almost over and she was able to produce a tremendous sprint finish from-200 metres out when the body illusion responded to her change of mind, change of reality. Sportsmen and women produce what appear to be incredible performances, but they are primitive compared with what they could be doing if they truly understood their power to create whatever reality they believe in. Look at how many sporting barriers, like the four-minute mile, take so long to overcome, but once it has happened many others do the same and it becomes commonplace. The barriers are mental, not physical, because there is no physical. Once someone has shown that a feat is possible, the mental barrier dissolves in others and they can also do it. Healthy eating? Speaking of sports and such, we need exercise to maintain a healthy body and we need to eat a balanced diet, right? Well, yes, but only if we think we do. If the body is a holographic illusion, how can it benefit or otherwise from-exercise or this or that type of food? But if you eat lots of fatty food you will get heart disease, I've read it many times. First of all that research is not necessarily the 'proven fact' it claims to be and, second, the heart is an illusion and so are the bacon, egg, sausage and fries swimming in the fat. An illusion cannot affect an illusion unless we think it can. Of course it can't. But the body must need nutrition, surely? No, only if you believe it does. What about diets? Do people lose weight or not because of the diet or because they believe or disbelieve in its effectiveness? The latter, it has to be. Whether your body is a thin illusion or a fat illusion is down to your own mind and its ability overcome its own conditioning and that of its inherited hologram that carries programming through the DNA. \"But I drink lots of beer, eat lots of chips and scoff bars of chocolate, so I am bound to get fat.\" Why? That is what you are told; that is what you believe; and that is what you make 'real'. I am not saying we should eat certain fatty foods for the sake of it or spend our days with the feet up on the sofa watching the soaps and sport all day, and until people can disconnect from consensus reality and their body programming it is far better to eat well rather than consume the crap the system bombards us with. I am just saying that food doesn't affect your health unless your body /mind believes it does and when we can free our minds of that programming it doesn't matter what, or even if, we eat. What about Therese Neumann who didn't eat for 35 years and maintained her health and weight? She should have died in weeks. She didn't die and she didn't become emaciated because it was not her reality. Physician heal thy self There is no need for a medical system when we understand the full magnitude of who we are and the way we create reality. Why do we need surgery when what is 'inside' of us is a holographic illusion that we can cl,1ange anytime we want? The man called Wright might have been treated for his cancer by removing large amounts of his cancerous tissue. Yet when he believed a useless drug would be effective, the areas of his body that might have been surgically removed healed themselves. The man with the seriously broken leg healed by the kahuna would have normally had surgery and been in a plaster cast for months. Instead he was healed in minutes. ,The Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel is making multi-billions by selling us drugs that don't work unless we believe they do and killing us by planting the belief that they have not yet come up with a cure for something we think we have and \"nothing can be done\". Their drugs are also having unpleasant, often terrible, side effects when we believe that they do. How many people get the side effects after they have read about them on the side of the bottle or from their doctor? How many people get addicted to heroin or cocaine because they are told these are seriously addictive drugs? They can't be. They are illusions, just like the bodies that become addicted. How many smokers die of lung cancer because they are told that is what smoking does to you? We will take control of our own 'health' only when we realise that we are in control of it. Doctors and their masters in the drug cartel need to be erased from our reality on all levels. Most of our belief and sense of reality about doctors and health - and all reality - .comes from subconscious programming that we are not even aware of. This is where we lock in most powerfully to the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 236 collective consensus reality that effects us so fundamentally. I know that the wall I am looking at now and the chair I am sitting on are illusions. I know it is all illusion. But I am still connected enough to the consensus reality to see the world around me as 3-D 'solid' like everyone else and I can stop my bum falling through this illusory seat. To withdraw completely from consensus reality, I have to let my understanding of the illusion pervade all my levels of consciousness and reach a state that I can only describe as 'knowing' or 'being'. Shit, my bum has just smacked on the floor. Oh, but there is no floor ... aaaahhhhhh! Hold on, there is no me, either, so how can I fall through the chair and the floor? I can't.

(Dave, get on with it before you disappear up your own backside.) But I don't have a backside, it's an illusion, so how can I disappear up it? See where YUU can go with this??? Alternative illusions (but more enlightened ones!) The gathering distrust of the scalpel and drug medical system has led to an explosion in those seeking help from what is called 'alternative' or 'complementary' medicine. This includes an almost endless list of techniques and therapies. including aromatherapy, reflexology, acupuncture, cranial therapy, Reiki, oxygen therapy, colour therapy, sound healing, homoeopathy, crystal therapy. on and on it goes. These methods can by-pass the system in that they aim to rebalance the vibrational fields of the patient that have been imbalanced by their mental and emotional state and/ or other vibrational influences. This can be extremely effective in healing dis-ease, but unless the patient's mind, emotions and / or environment changes, the imbalances will return. I have been saying for years that alternate healing therapies, as with an understanding of astrology, psychic phenomena. etc. are stepping-stones to the realisation that they are illusions, too. But they are a vitally important bridge that can lead us out of the physical illusion, the densest and most imprisoning of all, and help people to begin the reality shift. This' \" 'alternative' area can, however, also be a trap if people believe they have found it and such is the case with thousands of people' I have met around that' world, is with astrology and much of the New Age, these alternative forms of healing work with the realm of vibration. Almost all of them are based on balancing vibrations and energy by using other vibrations and energy. Acupuncture balances energy with its needles; aromatherapy with the vibration of smell; colour therapy with the vibration of colour; sound healing with the vibration of sound; Reiki with energy through the hands; crystal therapy with the vibration of the crystal; and homoeopathy with the vibration of plants. This is why the homoeopaths dilute the substance of the plant or flower, It is the vibration they are working with not its 'physical' form. The alternatives understand that everything is a vibrational field and that the physical body is vibrating energy. But if it vibrates it is still illusion, stil1 trapped 111 the Matrix. While alternative therapies are a big advance on the primitive beliefs of the medical establishment, they are only a stepping-stone to the realisation that all is created by thought and so all can be healed by thought. The more people turn to these alternatives and believe themselves to health, the more strongly others will believe from this evidence that they can be healed and more will. Belief is self perpetuating because it creates an alternative consensus reality. In an altered state, I was looking at the vibrant colours around me. \"Do you think those colours are real\", said the voice. \"They are vibrations and so they are illusions,\" Colour. it said. is only what we think we see. \"How can the illusion of colour affect the illusion of the body?\" Only if we, at some level, think it can. When I got home I recounted this story and a few seconds after I finished I walked into another room to be faced with the front cover of a magazine headlined \"Colour Therapy - rainbow remedies\". And what are rainbows? Illusions. These alternatives are doing an important job in teasing people out of the densest illusion, but we need to keep moving to avoid this alternative trap. The mastery of our own reality is the revelation that will open the prison door. New Age thinking and alternative therapies can lead people towards the door, but they can't take them through. Only we can do that. Haunted by ourselves "},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 237 There is the apparent mystery of ghosts, apparitions and poltergeists, but are they really so mysterious? On the Isle of Wight where I live in England there are ghost stories galore of people who claim to have seen figures who come and go wearing the clothes of other centuries. There can be many reasons for this. It could be a formerly incarnate mind that is so attached to that experience - that illusion - that it continues to 'live it' even after it's body hologram has 'died'. It manifests another illusory body through residual self-image, just as those who have had near-death. Switching off the trees There is nothing that cannot be explained once we realise that Infinite Love (Oneness) is the only truth and everything else is illusion; and that we are creating the illusion or having the illusion programmed into to us by believing it to be real. Lyall Watson, the biologist and author of Sllpematllre, tells of watching an Indonesian woman called Tia, a shaman in training, talking to a small girl in a grove of trees. He looked from a little distance away and she did not know he was there. She seemed to be explaining something to the girl and a sort of ritual of dance and gesture began. To Watson's amazement, the grove of kenari trees disappeared and a few seconds later came back again. \"One moment Tia danced in a grove of shady kenari; the next she was standing alone in the hard, bright light of the Sun\", he said.1lJ She proceeded to 'switch' the grove on and of several times as Watson looked on incredulously. This is impossible surely? No it's not. The grove is a holographic illusion and those with an understanding of how the process works can disconnect from that reality, the consensus dream that agrees the grove exists. With Lyall Watson observing this scene intently it was easy for him to become part of Tia's reality field and also see the grove appear and disappear. Someone else might have watched this from the illusion of consensus reality and the grove would not have disappeared to them. This is how some people can walk through walls - they believe they can and that becomes their experience. They disconnect their mind and body from the laws of consensus reality that insists this is impossible. When I say 'believe', it is a level of belief that is beyond any words that just say 'I believe'. It is not belief, it is a knowing, a being. There is that age old saying that says we can 'move mountains'. They can't mean literally? Why not? If a tree grove can disappear, why not a mountain? The mountain is a holographic illusion and our minds control the illusion. Why can't we move mountains? We can, but we don't, because we don't know we can. Copsensus, programmed, reality says the very idea is ridiculous and if we buy that reality, it is and out-of-body experiences report doing. These substitute 'bodies' are much less dense than the five-sense hologram and appear, disappear, and move around in a way that seems impossible to a five-sense observer. But the observer is seeing another level of reality and possibility. Other ghosts and the sights and sounds of ancient battles that people say they have seen and heard can also be the memory of the battle, the recording if you like, imprinted as a thought form in the energy field. By unknowingly observing this, their minds bring it into holographic reality like a laser light shining on the holographic print. They 'see' soldiers fighting in the uniforms of history and hear the sounds of the carnage. Such a place is said to be 'haunted', but it is better described as the ultimate holographic drive-in movie. Battles and wars are especially effective in imprinting these vibrational memory fields because emotion is a major factor in the creation of reality and the power of the illusion. You find many ghost stories and accounts of hauntings are connected to murders, violence and suffering of some kind, and other events of high emotion. These memory imprints - 'hauntings' - are often observed at particular times in the year and this seems to be connected to other energy and vibrational cycles that..·, activate them and allow them to be to be seen and heard more powerfully. W. Y. Evans-Wentz spent two years early in the 20th century travelling through 'Celtic' Britain, Ireland and Brittany in France interviewing people who had experienced the 'supernatural'. In his book, The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries he includes'-' dozens of accounts from people who had seen ghostly conflicts and battles with soldiers in armour or uniforms from the 'past'. Some scenes were silent, some had the noise of battle and others were only heard. Evans-Wentz concluded: \"Nature herself has a memory. There is some indefinable psychic element in the Earth's atmosphere upon which all human and physical actions or phenomena are photographed or impressed. Under certain inexplicable conditions, normal persons who are not seers may observe Nature's mental records like pictures cast upon a screen often like moving pictures.\" 12 This phenomenon is no longer inexplicable, however. They are memories recorded in the energy field that are observed into holographic reality. Poltergeist activity has been widely reported as families being terrified by some force that moves objects, turns on taps, switches electrical equipment on and off, and"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 238 sometimes hurls things around the room. But is this really, or always, an 'evil spirit' at work? Many common themes have been identified in poltergeist activity that have led researchers to believe the 'culprit' is the mind or minds of those being 'haunted', Often the activity is connected to teenagers, especially girls, going through a period of emotional stress. The external phenomenon is a holographic mirror of what is going on with the person emotionally. Everything is connected to everything else because everything is everything. This applies to apparently 'dead' objects like cups, lamps and ash trays. They are really vibrational fields and at that level they can be moved by other vibrational influences - the minds of people. In turn, these vibrational fields are turned into 3-D holographic 'reality' by being observed. The minds of people, say a teenage girl, unknowingly interact with the 'inanimate' objects on the level of the frequency fields as they express their emotional state at that subconscious level of reality. But they consciously 'see' the result of this at their conscious level of reality - the five-senses - with the objects moving and flying about the room. Understandably they scream in terror, but they are doing it to themselves!!! When they calm themselves emotionally, their five-sense reality calms down and the 'poltergeist' moves on! There is an important point to stress here. I have just described how the subconscious level of the girl imprints a vibrational field with her thoughts and emotions (reality) and her conscious five-sense level observes that field into holographic illusion. This is the process by which we all constantly create our own reality. Just as the teenage girl doesn't realise in her conscious awareness that she is creating the poltergeist activity with her subconscious mind, people in general don't realise that their observed reality - their 'lives' - are only a mirror of their subconscious reality. Me and my car are overheating The interaction of mind and machine is another mystery easily explained when we realise that both are One. The mind and its holographic illusion are the same because observed and observer is the same. This being so, mind and machine must effect each other when they are each other. When we are stressed and anxious to get somewhere fast and urgently, how many times does the car break down? When we are desperate and stressed to finish something on the computer how often does the computer go wrong? The more stressed and emotional we get the more powerfully we are interacting with the vibrational field blueprint of the 'physical' object and the more likely it is that we will pass our imbalance - our sense of reality on to the 'object'. In the years after I bought my first car I was going through a time of enormous emotional stress. I was in emotional overload. I had a series of cars of different makes and states of mechanical competence over these years and yet everyone developed the same problem - overheating! It got to the point where every time I went-on a journey of any distance I would worry about the car overheating. Of cour~, this added to the power of the reality and ... the car overheated. Once 1 passed through this emotional phase my cars stopped overheating. I had a call from a friend once who said she wanted to come up the motorway to see me and others because she was so emotionally stressed. Half an hour later she called again. She was delayed because her car had overheated on the way over. If we are emotionally and mentally stressed and imbalanced, so must be the 3-D illusion that our minds and emotions in that state are creating. That mental and emotional state will symbolise itself in the holographic illusion we manifest and the people and experiences involved. A calm and peaceful consciousness will create a calm and peaceful illusion. This is why I say that you do not fight for peace, you peace for peace. Got the time, mate? Past, present and future are happening together? That's ridiculous, surely. But it's not. Unless, of course, you think it is, in which case it will not happen in your reality. We don't go back to the past or forward to the future. We don't go anywhere because we' are already everywhere. There is no time and there is no space. A subatomic particle too 'small' to be seen can hold all the information contained in the cosmos because it is not 'small'; it only appears to be. Size is an illusion - just as I tell my wife. The particle is the cosmos, as a cell is the body and contains all the information to 'clone' a replica. Every cell is also everything. How can the Infinite One be travelling from 'past' to 'future' when it is already all that is and can ever be? Past, present and future are just different realities. You have a reality of the world right now and someone else will have another. They are different realities, but we have no problem accepting that they are happening simultaneously. All I am saying is that it is the same with the past, present and future. They are different realities happening together. But don't we travel from past to future every day? No, you 'travel' from reality to reality. I hear·, many of those that recognise the 'past' can be accessed describing this process as attuning with the vibrational/holographic memory of the 'past' from our point in the 'present'. I don't agree with that, a massive stretch of our perception as this may be. We don't go back to the 'past' because there is only"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 239 NOW. Past, present and future 'are different realities happening together in the same NOW. I would go further, fantastic as I know it will sound. There are not even sequences in which one action follows another. That, too, is illusion. I did not write the last chapter before this one. I am writing both in the same NOW and you are reading it as I am writing it. It is my awareness of one and not the other that gives me the impression that one follows the other. My reality changes with my changing focus. When I thought I was writing the last chapter I was actually in the same now that I am in as I write this one. Only my awareness of the two realities has changed. There is no after and there is no before. There is only NOW. Wow, I know the feeling: \"Hello backside here I come.\" This is something you have to just know. If you think about it, you disappear up the orifice. The concept of 'memory' is another illusion that accepts the existence of past time. How could past time not exist if we have a memory of it? But memorv is not recall from the 'past', it is accessing information stored in another reality experience in the eternal NOW. And what is this 'past' and 'future'? How many different realities of the 'present' exist on Earth 'today'? As many as there are minds. Yes, there is the consensus reality, but there are endless variations on this. It is the same with the 'past' and 'future' realities. So what is real? Whatever you think it is. 'Reincarnation', then, is not a process of coming in and out of this 'world' over 'time'. It is moving in and out of different realities all happening at once. It is the same with the 'recording' of the ghostly battles I was talking about. Because there is no 'time', the 'recording' or 'memory' is actually the battle happening in another reality in the same NOW as the people observing it 'centuries' later. One of the greatest mysteries is how it is possible to predict the 'future', which endless studies have 'shown to be the case. One example is the' chair test' devised by the Dutch psychic, Gerard Croiset. Investigators would identify public events in halls across the world that did not have pre-assigned seating. People sat wherever they chose when they arrived. The investigator would give Croiset a particular seat to focus on weeks in advance and he would have to describe the person who would sit there at the event. For some 25 years Croiset described the occupants of the seats with incredible accuracy. Dr Jule Eisenbud, clinical professor at the University of Colorado, conducted one of these tests in 1969. More than two weeks before an event in Denver, Colorado, Eisenbud contacted Croiset in Holland and gave him a seat to 'read'. Croiset said the man who would sit in that chair was about five-feetnine and worked in industry and science. In his job, said Croiset, he wore a laboratory coat that was stained by a greenish chemical. He said the man had black hair, brushed back, a scar on his big toe and a gold tooth in his lower jaw. Seventeen days later this very man sat in the seat and Croiset was correct in every detail, including his height of five feet nine and three quarters.]) How is this possible? The man in the chair and the man 'before' he even knew he was going to that theatre, were not happening weeks apart. They were happening together. They were different realities of mind in the Infinite NOW. Slaves to the clock To hold us in the illusion, the Illuminati/Matrix condition us to believe in time. When we fall for this, we disconnect from 'no time' - our Infinite state. The movement of the primets, Sun and Moon, night and day and' aging bodies' are all designed to sell the illusion of moving from past to future. Look at the way the clock governs our lives and the whole of society. Up at this time, out at that time, leave at this time, arrive at that time. Have you got the time? Do you know the time? What time does it start? What time does it finish? Thanks for your time. I could be some time. I might be a long time. There's not enough 'time'. I have too much time. We are slaves to time. But what is this 'time'. It is the creation and measurement of an illusion constructed to fool and control us. The meridian system of 'time' based on the imaginary line through London known as 'Greenwich Mean Time' was introduced by the Illuminati in 1884 and it was from the Illuminati controlled Vatican that Pope Gregory XIII commissioned the Gregorian calendar in 1582 (see my other books). This was introduced by more and more countries who accepted the new measurement, of 'time' until it became the 'norm'. To make it fit, the British Calendar Act of 1751'declared that 12 days of the following year would not exist and that the day after Wednesday, September 2nd 1752 would be Thursday, September 14th. See how silly the idea of 'time' really is? However you seek to measure 'time' it will always be an illusion because the concept of time is an illusion. Everyone has linked their sense of reality to the movement of the Sun and Moon, night and day, and almost everyone to 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day. This is a reality prison that"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" 240 holds us in disconnected illusion. It is so ridiculous that you can go to two events and attend the second before the first by crossing the imaginary international dateline and going 'backwards' in 'time'. The movement of the Matrix-created planets and other spheres and objects have a powerful influence on our belief in time and also the frequency of our vibrational fields. It is well known that people are effected by the full Moon, but these effects go much deeper, as an experiment by Frank Brown of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois confirmed. He shipped live oysters from Long Island Sound, California, a thousand miles to his laboratory in Illinois to study the effects on their biorhythm. The oysters were excellent subjects because they open and close with the tides. At first they maintained the rhythm of the Long Island tides, but in around two weeks they began to change and they opened and closed in sync with the passage of the Moon over Evanston, Illinois.\" We are being influenced in the same way by the Sun, Moon and the planets, and this, of course, is the foundation of astrology. These vibrational fields serve the Matrix magnificently in imposing their frequencies on us and confirming that 'time' exists when it does not. The no-time zone I had an experience as a footballer that made me question the nature of time. I was playing in a game one night in London when a guy smashed a shot from quite close range. I can recall the experience clearly. I saw him strike the ball in normal speed and it was moving so fast I was sure it was going to beat me. But as I moved--· towards the ball everything went into slow motion and all sound disappeared. I dived to my left and pushed my hand towards the ball, still in slow-mo. Then, as the ball struck my hand and deflected over the bar, everything surged back into 'real' time and the noise crashed back also as I returned to five-sense reality. I lay on the ground as my team mates congratulated me, but I was in a daze. What the hell just happened? I now know that I entered another reality that was not subject to the 'laws' of this one. Sports people often talk about entering the 'zone' when there seems to be no time and no noise. In this state, they say, they can perform at their peak. They access a subconscious state that is untroubled by the doubt and fear of failure that is such a trait of the five-sense self. We only have to observe our own experience to see how 'time' is relative and not measurable. Sit in a dentist's waiting room and see how slow 'time' seems to pass. But do something you really enjoy and it seems to pass so quickly, as it does if you are chasing a deadline. When I worked at a radio station reading the news live on the hour, I would often still be in the newsroom two minutes before the start writing a story or waiting for one. I realised that if I got stressful and anxious those two minutes would pass very quickly, but if I stayed calm they passed much slower. In truth, they didn't 'pass' at all and the speed that they appeared to pass was only an illusion of my reality. Albert Einstein put it like this: \"When you spend two hours with a nice girl, you think it's only a minute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think its two hours.\" How often have you had a 'long dream' in which a great deal happened, only to find that you have only been asleep for a few minutes? People who have experienced the near-death phenomenon recall how they had a 'life review' in which they saw everything that happened in their life in an instant. How come? There is no time; it is one of the major illusions that ensnares our reality. Those who have left their bodies speak of being in a place of 'no time', but others have described other realms with different time-tracks. The voice' in Brazil told me that the other levels of the Matrix have versions of time that are different to ours and can appear to be no-time when they are not. When I went into the 'zone' in that football match, time slowed dramatically, but there was still the feeling of 'time'. Oh yes, I see it now ... From the perspective I am outlining in this book, 'mysteries' of every kind become perfectly logical even for the conditioned mind. Here are a few more examples: Telepathy is one 'mind' attuning with another 'mind', which allows both to link, so think, together. Both minds are actually one and there is no space between them, only the Infinite that seamlessly connects everything to everything because it is everything. Remote viewing, where people go in their minds to observe other locations, is possible because the viewer is both here and everywhere. Remote viewers don't 'go' anywhere, like A to B, with their minds. They attune their minds to the reality they wish to observe and that connects with them. Much of what we call mental illness is when people operate in a different reality to the 'norm' and appear strange in their behaviour and unable to relate to the 'world' the rest of the population think they live in. Schizophrenia is when people switch"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 241 between holographic realities, the same as those with multiple personality disorder do. Aura reading is communication with the human energy field, the conscious and subconscious mind. It is the subconscious that instigates a course of action before the conscious mind 'decides' what to do. If you attune with the subconscious you can read its reality and predict what is likely to happen when this becomes five-sense reality. But once again, hard as it is for most people to grasp, it is all happening in the same NOW. Tarot card reading is another form of this. Each of the cards represents a certain vibrational state and when we choose the cards apparently at random our vibrational state is attracted to its representation on the cards. This makes us choose one card rather than another. It's a sort of magnetism. 'Mind readers' are those who attune into the consciousness of people and astound their subjects by telling them facts about themselves they could not possibly know. But, of course, they can know if they can read the vibrational fields that hold that information. I appeared heavily disguised on a television programme once in which an aura reader and a tarot card reader had to guess who I was and give the audience background information about me. They did excellently and both said I was about to go on a long journey to the Far East. The aura reader actually mentioned Japan. I was extremely impressed because I was due to go to Japan. This knowledge was in my mind, my energy field, and available to be 'read'. However, circumstances changed and I did not actually go. Had they accessed deeper levels of my subconscious mind they would have known that. The information] have detailed in this section of the book holds the key to . human freedom in that it exposes the illusion we think is 'real' and reveals how we can change it. More than that, this knowledge is the very foundation on which the control and manipulation of humanity (and all in the Matrix) is based. The bottom line of the Illuminati agenda is the manipulation of humanity's imagination of itself - its sense of reality. Control that and, for reasons here explained, you control the 'physical' outcome. SOURCES 1 The Holographic Universe, pp 33 and 34 2 Ralph W.

If you do not alarm anyone morally, you yourself remain morally asleep. If you do not embody controversy, what you say will be an acceptance of the drift of the coming human hell. C. Wright Mills Control of this reality is control of the mind-game through which reality is created. We can either give our minds away to the constant conditioning of our sense of self and the world or we can cease to feed those delusions and manifest our own reality. That is the difference between existing in slavery and living in freedom. Understanding how we are programmed to believe in the consensus 'Matrix' reality is vital to cutting the chains that bind us to the prevailing illusion. In this chapter I will explore the techniques used to manipulate that sense of reality. It is testament to the power of consciousness that anyone at all has awoken from their manipulated dream, especially in the 'developed' world of mass media and indoctrination. But they have and the numbers are exploding across the globe because the influence of l1luminati programming is no match for the power of consciousness in awareness of that power. Trance-forming It is essential to the oppose the l1luminati desire that they maintain the population in ignorance of our true nature while planting messages into the conscious, and especially subconscious, to programme the reality that suits the agenda. It is nothing less than hypnotism. All except a few of the six billion people on this planet are held in an hypnotic state, a trance, a spell, as they move zombie-like from· conditioned thought to conditioned response and the conditioning is so total that they believe they are making free decisions and choices. Wilson Bryan Key rightly says in his book, The Age of Manipulation: \"Once the group or collective unconscious is programmed into what has been called culture, virtually any bill of goods can be sold at conscious levels.\"! The Matrix consciousness and its l1luminati manifestation know the process of creating reality. Society, therefore, has been structured to maintain the illusion. The subconscious is where the thought patterns. are generated that the conscious mind observes into holographic 'reality'; and the subconscious, with its language of symbolism and metaphor, is the Illuminati's prime target to be conditioned in many subtle and less subtle ways. One example is the massive increase in the number of speed cameras in Britain. Millions of motorists are being caught because their mind wanders for a moment and they are snapped a few miles an hour over the limit. This brings in enormous amounts of money in fines that the government says is being spent on introducing more cameras. Talk about paying for your own prison. The subconscious message of this system is \"don't relax for a second because Big Brother's eyes are everywhere\". When the police letter arrives with a picture of your car and threats for not doing exactly as demanded, the subconscious implant of \"do as we say, we are in control of your life\" is still further re-enforced. The whole process happens without the driver seeing a single human being. They send you a leaflet with a list of questions they think you might ask. The answer to everyone is basically \"there's nothing you can do\". One of them asks if it makes any difference that you have a perfect driving record with no previous convictions for car offences of any kind. Is this taken into account? The answer is: \"Speed cameras do not discriminate, everyone is treated the same.\" That is the idea. The Illuminati want to remove as much human involvement as possible so there is no weighing of the circumstances, no taking every case on its merits. This is how it is, end of story. Doing five· miles an hour over the speed limit in dense traffic is treated the same as doing the same speed on the same stretch of road at three in the morning when there is no other vehicle in sight. The letters you receive are worded to imprint fear to illicit the desired response. It suggests you could be fined thousands of pounds if the case goes to court, but they offer you the chance of paying a fixed penalty of £60! All the time the subconscious is getting the message \"you are under our control\" and the idea is to programme that reality so deeply that the person ceases to rebel and accepts what"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 244 he or she believes is the inevitable. The obsession with 'political correctness' is also a method of subconscious thought control, as I will discuss later. Political correctness is saying to the subconscious \"we are watching every word you say\". Looking without seeing The targeting of the subconscious is behind the bombardment of subliminal messages coming at us from all angles as they aim to manipulate behaviour through human 'drives' like survival (hunger, thirst, danger of all kinds); sex, greed, social acceptance, security and territoriality (a big drive ottl1e reptilian brain). Subliminal means 'below threshold' because the messages are communicated at a level that the conscious mind doesn't register, but the subconscious certainly does. The subconscious sees all while the conscious notes only a fraction of what passes through the eyes and even changes much of that. Subliminal advertising was exposed in the 1950s when some television and movie theatre ads were found to be transmitting split-second images that the conscious mind couldn't see to stimulate a desire for a product. This included a subliminal \"I'm thirsty\" during drinks commercials. But the knowledge of subliminal programming goes back to ancient times with scholars like Plato and Aristotle mentioning the phenomenon and more than 500 scientific papers have been published confirming the effectiveness of subliminals.2 Producers of movies like The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre publicly admitted that .trey contained violent and frightening subliminals.3 The use of subliminals is supposed to be illegal in some countries and the Illuminati controlled Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in the United States says that subliminals are inherently ~deceptive because the consumer does not perceive them at a normal level of awareness and is given no choice whether to accept or reject the message. Funny then, that nothing is done about the subliminals that abound in advertising, let alone in political manipulation. The US Federal Communications Commission, currently headed by Colin Powell's son, Michael, a Bush appointment, has no regulation barring subliminal advertising, but generally considers it deceptive, it says. Again, why no action? The picture in Figure 54 carries a very clear subliminal message, or at least it's clear when it's pointed out. Can you see it? Apparently, about five per cent seethe subliminal at first sight and the rest are amazed when it is made clear to them. If you haven't seen it, look at the white areas and not the plants. Your eyes go to the, plants, but it is most often in the background that subliminals are posted. We consciously see the apparent focus of the ad while the background passes us by. Look at the lower level of the two plants on the left and you will see that they combine to make the letter S in the white background. Move your eyes right and you'll see an E and an X. Oh yes, of course, I can see it now. Why couldn't I see it before, it's so obvious? Until the subliminal was explained, the conscious mind was not in the game, only the subconscious. Once it is highlighted, the conscious mind registers the word because it is no longer subliminal or below its threshold. Every time you look at that picture from now on you will see that once-subliminal word immediately. It is crucial to communicate the manipulation techniques and methods of the Illuminati because once people understand how they work they are no longer subliminal and can be clearly identified. Hey, and guess what they call these subliminal additions to advertisements? Embeds! Yes, the choice of the term 'embeds' or 'embedded' for the journalists assigned to military units is no accident. This is what those journalists really are embedded distorters. They are subliminal embeds planted to give the appearance of journalism while merely reporting the official line. I have often said that the Illuminati manipulate the people by manipulating the image they have of something, rather than with the detail. They know that people don't retain detail from the television or even newspapers. They go away with an image, a feeling, about a person or event. Tell the people something over and over and at the level of the image, the feeling, they will overwhelmingly accept the image to be a true picture of events even though there is no detail to back it up. They keep 'repeating the same mantra over and over like 'weapons of mass destruction', \"al-Qaeda was responsible\", and “it was Bin Laden\". This is simple hypnosis."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 245   Figure 54: Can you see the subliminal message in this image. Apparently about 5% of people see it immediately I see no sex Sexual themes are used in subliminal advertising on a monumental scale. The subliminal word 'sex' is incredibly common in advertisements, as is 'fuck'. Contrary to what many assume, we are not a sexually open society, but a seriously sexually suppressed one. We are largely in denial of our sexuality and our desires, but much as people may wish to deny them they don't go away. Denying something gives it more power over you and can become an obsession. People hide their sexual feelings because they are at odds with what the mass hypocrisy dictates is 'moral' and 'decent'. Stuff that. I have a simple philosophy: do what you like so long as everyone involved has made a free choice to be involved and there is no compulsion or manipulation to do so. Once those criteria are met, who cares what other people do? It's no one's business, but theirs. For goodness sake, it's all an illusion anyway. Is it immoral for an illusion to have sex with an illusion, even with more than one? What? \"Ooh, I think it's disgusting what those people next door get up to.\" Well don't do what they do then, darlin'. Most of the time, beyond the denial, they'd actually love to go next door and join in. But no, \"that's disgusting my mother said\". You get those campaigners against pornography who condemn some video as disgusting and depraved while watching one after the other. It's all in the name of research, see. The tabloid media is full of sexual themes and pictures designed to attract readers through the genitals while condemning people in the public eye for their sexual antics. It is the old carrot and stick technique; pull them in and then push them away. \"Here is something you'd like ... no, no, you can't have it, it's immoral\" Lionel Rubinoff wrote in The Pornography of Power: \"Hypocrisy which takes the form of a denial of hypocrisy is hypocrisy squared.\" 4 What happens as a result of all this' is that the subconscious is drawn to sexual themes while the conscious is in denial of them and this is one major reason why advertising subliminals are overwhelmingly sexual. Look at the picture in Figure 55. The image itself is quite overtly sexual in this case, but I wonder if you can see how much more blatant it is on a subliminal level? Take your eyes to the waistline of the jeans, just left of centre and follow the carefully designed shading upwards from there. See it? You could hardly miss "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 246 it once it is highlighted! Again, whenever you look at that picture from now on you will spot the subliminal immediately because it has registered with the conscious mind. You see ads with men naked from the waist up or women naked from the back and such like because the mind 'fills in' the rest consciously or unconsciously. Such subliminal images are not ran at all. It is staggering how commonly they are used in advertising of all kinds. The Ponald's ad in Figure 56 is supposed to be for chicken. Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but I've never seen any part of a chicken that looks like that. I have seen dicks that look like that, but not chicken. Maybe it's a rooster. Next time you see a can of Diet Coke (for your sake don't drink it!) look at the glass on the lower left. Hold the can at arms length away from you and you'll see women's breasts. The subconscious is attracted to the sexual theme while the conscious mind is suppressing its sexuality and, in effect, denies the sexual implants and doesn't see them. To confirm the point, people accessing the subconscious during hypnosis and those in more sexually open societies see subliminals far more easily. The findings of Viennese neurosurgeon, Otto Poetzle, in 1917 suggested that information implanted subliminally appears in dreams and involves the same denial to hide taboo images. The penis might appear in the Figure 55: A sexual picture, but the subliminal makes this far more blatant. Can you see it? dream in the form of a banana, for instance, or, if you're not so lucky, an asparagus. At the website of Jim Hagart's Semi Subliminal World, you can find subliminals highlighted in other Coca Cola products like Dr Pepper, Lilt and Fanta.s They include distorted faces, 'gremlins' and the usual sexual themes. By the way, the target market of Diet Coke is overwhelmingly women and the subliminal use of women's breasts is an example of the technique of planting subliminals of women's sexual parts in ads aimed at women and men's in those targeting men. Being attracted to people of the same sex is even more taboo and the denial of the conscious mind hides the subliminal from view even more effectively, while attracting the subconscious to the ad. That is why they do it. Wilson Bryan Key is one of the world experts on subliminals and has produced a number of highly recommended books on the subject. He writes: \"In a visual perception, as little as 1/1000 of the total perception registered in the brain actually surfaces in consciousness. The remainder lies dormant within memory. Embeds enhance perceptual experience of the picture, intensifying responses such as EKG, EEG, GSR - heart rate, brain rhythms, and galvanic skin"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 247 response. Emotionalized, repressed information remains in the memory system for long periods, perhaps for a lifetime. In embedded pictures, nothing is actually hidden - certainly not by the artist. Once viewers learn perceptual flexibility, 'the embeds'- are readily available to consciousness. The only thing hidden in embedded media is what viewers or listeners hide from themselves. Repression appears to be a compulsive process, probably initiated to protect oneself from unsettling information that would provoke anxiety.\" 6 For this very reason, many are in complete denial of the existence of the global conspiracy and its other-dimensional expression. It is just too much for them to take emotionally because of the perceived implications for their own lives. Thus people like me are dismissed as crazy or dangerous by many without any reference to the endless detail and evidence available. It is the 'shoot the messenger' syndrome when you don't like the message. You can give these people as much supporting detail and evidence as you like and they will still be in denial. I had a guy call in to a South African radio show I was on who went into long-winded Figure 56: McDonald's Chicken Mc Dickets. Ever seen one of these on a chicken? explanations for why each element of the conspiracy was explainable without a conspiracy. It was not worth debating with him because no matter what scale of evidence you presented he would have to find a way to deny the conspiracy. People support despots like Bush and Hitler because they try to persuade themselves that their leaders have the people's best interests at heart. To face the fact that they are vicious dictators with a Nazi agenda is too much to bear. They deny the obvious over and over until they cannot deny it anymore. By then it's too late. This happened in Nazi Germany and is happening in the United States and Britain today. Frontwards, backwards, upside down The subconscious mind not only absorbs everything, it perceives what it sees from all angles. There is a whole area of research these days into what is called 'reverse speech'. What someone is saying when their words are played backwards also communicates with the subconscious. It is claimed that when you play sentences backwards you can hear what the person is really saying even though in forward speech they appear to be saying the opposite. I have heard some political speeches played backwards to me and there certainly appears to be truth in this. It is the same with reversed pictures like the one highlighted in Figures 57 and 58. When the picture is the right way up it appears to be a simple; even boring, advertisement for a flooring company. Look at the picture reversed and there again you have the obvious sexual connotations. This ad was pulled from a phone book once the reverse image was noticed. Often it is the most apparently"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 248 innocuous and uninspired ads that contain the most powerful subliminals. The more disinterested you are in the ad the more open you become to subliminals because the conscious mind is not getting in the way of the direct communication between subliminal and· subconscious. The idea is not to get you to remember the ad, but to plant a 'subliminal message like a hypnotist's command that can be retrieved days or weeks and months later when you are walking around the supermarket. The subconscious programming is triggered when people see the product on the shelf and they follow the command to buy it. Most print advertising is designed to be looked at for less than one second and the ads are there for subconscious implantation, not conscious awareness. Wilson Bryan Keys says: \"Ads that were recalled consciously were a loser. An advertisement’s to motivate a decision to purchase days, weeks, or even months after it has been perceived for even an instant. The job of an ad is to sell - not to be recalled.\" 8 Key says minds that operate in linear reasoning (deeply entranced by the five-sense reality) appear more susceptible to subliminals. This is still another motivation of the Illuminati to maintain the population in the five-sense illusion. You can buy paper today implanted with subliminal messages of your desired theme. When you send a letter or circular the person thinks they are only reading the words they can see. In truth, their subconscious is also absorbing the message they can't see hidden in the paper. A class of eighth graders took a self-esteem test in 1983 on paper implanted with the subliminal message, \"You are loved\". They scored 15% higher for self-esteem than those who took the test with non-subliminal paper. When the same test was given to under achievers they scored 34.7% higher with the subliminal embeds.9 Figure 57 and 58: This appears to be a simple. even boring advertisement, until you turn it upside down. The subconscious views reality from all angles and so registers the upside down image as much as the right way up "},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 249 The same techniques are naturally exploited to programme negative or controlling messages. All of our senses are targeted by the subliminal mc1nlpulators. Messages are played to us just outside the frequency range that our hearing can consciously access. These subliminal words bypass our conscious awareness and enter our minds at a subconscious level. I came across an advertisement on the Internet for subliminal tapes designed to manipulate people to have sex with you. “Imagine ... Only 5-10 minutes use required to program another person's mind and your advances can never be rejected!\", said the ad. \"Imagine ... She/He thinks it's New Age music but it's really an Erotic Subliminal Sexual bombardment to their subconscious mind with 1,OOOs of hidden messages to arouse their passion and focus it on only on you!\" 10 (Do you mind finishing this chapter before rushing to order? Thanks.) The recording industry includes subliminal audio programming in its products to manipulate the consciousness and reality of the buyer. Dr Hal C. Becker patented a black box in the 1960s to pipe audio subliminal messages on top of another audio source. It was used in stores to plant the message \"don't steal\" and theft dropped by 37%. Think how sophisticated and undetectable such technology must be now. If it can tell you subliminally not to steal, it can also tell you to buy, buy, buy; who to vote for; and what to think. Such subliminal instructions are pouring from our televisions, CDs and the media in all its forms. Even most people involved with the media have no idea this is going on. \"Dooo whatever weee saaaay\" In the John Carpenter film, They Live, the main character finds special glasses that allow him to see the subliminals. Without the glasses he sees normal advertisements for Coke or holiday destinations and articles in magazines, With the glasses he sees the subliminal instructions \"obey\", \"don't question authority\" and 'I do as you are told\", This is happening around us all the time. With the glasses he also saw similar messages in 'news' magazines and Bryan Wilson Key has indeed identified subliminals in magazines like Time. In one example when the US government was targeting Libya's Colonel Gaddafi his cover picture was embedded with the subliminal words \"sex\" (attraction to the magazine and \"kill\" (to plant negative feelings about him) The anti-Gaddafi propaganda campaign was conducted by CIA Director William Casey and operations officer Vincent M. Cannistraro answering to Secretary of State, George Shultz, the advisor to George W's 'election' campaign and a major player in Bechtul, which has benefited so handsomely from the invasion of Iraq. Time also put the word \"sex\" on the forehead of the Ayatollah Khomeini on the front cover on November 26th 1979, according to KeyY These are the people telling you what is happening in the world, including who was responsible for 9/11! Another piece of subliminal kit is the tachistoscope projector that flashes words and images onto the screen for milliseconds, far too quick for the conscious mind to acknowledge. These are used in film and video production and advertising. People connected to instruments while watching tachistoscope subliminals did not report a conscious awareness of any stimuli, but the alpha and theta waves in their brains were effected and so was their heart rate. The manipulation of lighting and background sound is also used in conjunction with the visuals. Other subliminal techniques include the double meaning or double entendre when a sexual or other meaning could be taken from a phrase or situation that can have another more mundane explanation; and 'dissonance', when something is incongruous or· out of proportion to the picture. Lying to ourselves It is not only our sexual suppression and taboos that subliminals target. They manipulate all human emotion, denial and defence mechanisms. Fear, as always~ is the main one: fear of death, fear of aging, fear of anything they think will be effective. Wilson Bryan Key writes: \"To avoid anxiety, overload, we construct perceptual defense mechanisms to either limit or distort our perception of reality.\"13 Repression of our fears and feelings provides the major distortion because we delude ourselves into believing our own self-deception. Psychiatrist R. D. Laing defines repression as when \"we forget something, then we forget we have forgotten\".14 We believe our own lies because we have forgotten we have lied in the first place. Research has revealed how emotional security, confirmation of self worth, gratifying the ego, a sense of power, sense of roots, fear of financial hardship and fear of death or desire for immortality can all be influenced subliminally. This need for security and self worth is manipulated mercilessly by advertisers and government spinners. The 'war on terrorism' targets almost 100% the fear of death and the desire for perceived safety and security for self and family. But before you can control people through such fears you"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 250 have to make them fear m the first place. The 9/11 attacks make them fear and you exploit that fear consciously and subconsciously to justify the 'war on terrorism'. All the \"terror alerts\" and warnings that spew from the White House, the Pentagon and Downing Street are designd to continually underpin the sense of fear that can then be exploited to advance the agenda. The more fearful and insecure you are, the more the Matrix has you. Dr William Sargant, a psychiatrist with the Illuminati Tavistock Institute in Britain, wrote in his 1957 book, The Battle for the Mind: \"Various types of belief can be implanted in people after brain function has been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear, anger, or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances the most common one is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility. Its various group manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of 'herd instinct', and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe epidemics, and all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety and so individual and mass suggestibility. \" ... We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective psyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authorities to 'protect people' from that fear.:' Some psychologists lead and direct discussions, at meetings of alcoholics to encourage them to reveal their fears and desires. An alcoholic might say something about having nightmares after trying to stop chinking and the researcher would then ask exactly what the nightmare was about and use this information as subliminal images in drink advertisements. As a result you see skulls and screaming contorted faces embedded in the ads to subliminally remind people what happens if you stop drinking. One Internet expose of subliminals claims to have found a dozen or more screaming faces, skulls and animal faces in an ad for Seagram's Extra Dry Gin.1\" The owners of Sea grams have been the Illuminati Bronfman family in Canada who have featured in previous books. Many images, phrases and slogans have hidden or double meanings behind them. Symbolism can also go into this category. ' Figure 59 and 60: The Statue of Liberty presented to New York by French Freemasons in Paris ... where on an island in the River Seine you will find the statue's mirror image. They are holding the torch of the 'Illuminated ones'- the flame of Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz Symbolic subliminals "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 251 Symbolism is the language of the Illuminati because it is the language of the subconscious and this is another major subliminal technique, as with the use of phallic symbols of many kinds. The bloodlines and their Illuminati network are obsessed with symbolism and their symbols and codes going back thousands of years can clearly be found throughout American society and the rest of the world, especially the countries of the British Empire. The ancient Illuminati symbol of the pyramid with the capstone missing or the pyramid and all-seeing eye was placed on the dollar bill in'19~3 by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the highly significant front men for the Illuminati in the United States during the 20th century. The most obvious Illuminati symbol is the eternal flame or the lighted torch and this represents the 'Illuminated ones', the' initiates illuminated into knowledge that the rest of the population is denied. The Illuminati lighted torch is most famously held by the Statue of Liberty. This was given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew what she and the torch really symbolised. There is a virtual mirror image of the Statue of Liberty on an island in the River Seine in Paris (Figures 59 and 60). As the bloodlines came up into Europe and across the world they naturally brought their symbols with them. The Statue of Liberty is the symbolic image of the goddess worshipped by the Illuminati bloodlines since they were based in Babylon (and before). She goes under many names, including Queen Semiramis, the \"branch bearer\", who was symbolised as a dove. If you look at Figure 61, you can see the image of Queen Semiramis on an ancient coin and compare that with her representation as the Statue of Liberty. When the Illuminati bloodlines moved their headquarters to Rome, the goddess was worshipped as Venus Columba or \"Venus the Dove\". The French word for dove is still colombe. This is why a man who signed his name \"Colon\" is known to official history as \"Columbus\". He was bearing the branch of the dove into the Americas in 1492 and was given this symbolic name relating\" the Illuminati goddess. We have the' centre of US government located in Washington DC - the District of Columbia, or the dove, Semiramis. We have British Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS), Columbia University, and '~Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and the lighted torch - the symbol of Nimrod/Baal/Tammuz in Babylon. The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They place their symbols all around us, but present them with the reverse of their true meaning. The dove symbolises peace to most people, while to the Illuminati bloodlines it represents their goddess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch means freedom and liberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol of their agenda and control. The Nazis reversed the ancient symbol of the swastika to symbolise the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram or five-pointed star to point downwards for the same reason. Everything is symbolism and ritual to the Illuminati, and always has been'. After they killed President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry placed an obelisk In Dealey Plaza with a lighted torch at the top. When they buried Kennedy Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC they placed a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternal flame, on his grave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murdered Princess Diana in Paris is a massive representation of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty. It is located on top of the Pont de L' Alma Tunnel where the Illuminati arranged for her to die in 1997 (see The Biggest Secret for the background to Diana's murder and the 'Goddess Diana' symbolism involved). The name Capitol Hill is also Illuminati symbolism and named after Capitoline Hill, a sacred place for the Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. The more that I understand about the manipulation of the subconscious, the more the Illuminati obsession with symbolism takes on an even greater significance. These Illuminati symbols speak to the subconscious and implant messages relating to control and \"we're watching you\" while the conscious mind is oblivious of what is going on beyond its perception. The Illuminati use of code words and phrases are designed to have the same effect. Figure 6~: Both \"Libertys\" are symbolic representations of Queen Semiramis, the Babylonian Illuminati goddess "},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 252 Santa pause They also use satanic ritual subliminals and you find them in the most unexpected places. Stewart Swerdlow confirms what I have been saying in my books for years \"the Illuminati love symbolism, dates, name derivatives and double meanings that cryptically tell the truth while hiding it from the general population\".17 He says that the 'Santa Claus' story is an example of this. The myth of Father Christmas or St Nicholas is an old Pagan tale and he was depicted wearing green. It was Coca Cola who gave him a red suit in a massive advertising campaign and he became known as Santa - an anagram of Satan. Swerdlow writes: \"Satanism and Satanic rituals have grown exponentially since the media blitz of the Red Santa. This subliminal method instils in the mind-pattern that a mystical, non human can enter people's homes. He will be good to them only if they behave in a certain way during the year. The red costume speaks for itself - red is the color code for entry into the astral planes. Red is the color code used by the goddess during Reptilian ritual to invoke astral entities. \"Of course, Santa 1ives at the North Pole, which is an entry point into the inner- Earth, and the underground Reptilian society. He has short little elves that do his work, symbolic of the small greys with a group mind pattern. The flying reindeer and sled symbolise the inter-dimensional flying craft used to enter there. Children are advised to leave Santa a snack for his arrival, representing a sacrificial offering to a powerful god. In addition, the commercialism surrounding this artificial Christmas holiday is designed to extract any religious intentions as well as enrich an already wealthy global elite.\" 18 All the major symbols of 'Christmas', including the tree, holly and mistletoe, come from Pagan festivals. Swerdlow also highlights the enormous number of television programmes for children that present reptilians as their friends and he says that the baby in the ~centre of the Sun, as depicted in the Tellytubbies series for small children, is a reptilian religious symbol. \"The baby at the centre of the Sun indicates that this baby is a sacrifice to the Sun God.\" 19 Selling the president All the subliminal techniques used by advertisers to sell products are used by the government spinners who are, after all, just selling a president, prime minister or policy in the same way that Coca Cola sells canned drinks. One of the more crass and incompetent attempts at subliminal manipulation came in the Bush presidential campaign in 2000 when a political ad placed by the Republican National Committee flashed the word 'RATS' over a Gore prescription drug proposal (Figure 62). It was left up too long in the same way that a subliminal flash of President Francois Mitterrand was spotted in the opening titles of a French news programme when he was seeking election. The Bush 'RATS' tape only had to be slowed down slightly to be clearly visible. Let no one kid themselves that subliminal messages (or \"subliminable\" as George Bush"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 253 called them) are not pouring from political advertisements. Note how the background behind Bush is always full of pictures of his family when he is announcing the certain death of families in countries his masters want to conquer. It is all aimed at the subconscious. Operation Iraqi Freedom, the title the Pentagon spinners gave to their human slaughter in Iraq, was devised for\" the same reason. The names for these military invasions are designed solely to depict what the spinners want the public to believe the war is all about. Any news organisation worth associating with the name journalism, would acknowledge th~ _ ~ title Operation Iraqi Freedom once when it was first announced and then never mention it again. To do so is to knowingly allow you and your viewers to be manipulated. Instead, when I was in America during the war, I saw news networks like CNN and Murdoch's Fox News, displaying \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" on the bottom of the screen for much of the time. That was speaking constantly to the subconscious while the conscious mind was watching the pictures on the rest of the screen. It was a disgrace, but then most of those that control such organisations are intellectual prostitutes anyway, so what do they care? And I'm not sure about the intellectual bit. Figure 62: Gotcha! The Subliminal implant of ‘RATS’ in a Bush commercial attacking Al Gore in the 2000 election campaign. It was not subliminal enough and could be seen by slightly slowing down the tape Speaking with forked tongue The manipulation and suppression of language is crucial to the mind programming of the people and the conditioning of reality. Words are the method of communication in the five-sense realm and they are targeted big time by the spinners. The connection between the manipulation of words and the manipulation of thought and perception is fundamental. This can be seen\" in the technique called Neuro Linguistic Programming or NLP in which political leaders and speechwriters, lawyers, salespeople, etc., are trained. I have seen NLP described as \"software for your brain\" because it allows you to \"automatically tap into the kind of experiences you want to have\".2o Maybe, but like all knowledge, it can be used another way to tap into the kind of experiences you want others to think they are having. Does anyone believe that politicians, lawyers and salespeople learn the techniques of NLP primarily for personal growth or because they wish to manipulate the population, judges and juries or potential customers? NLP was developed in the 1970s from the techniques of people like Dr Milton Erickson of the Milton Erickson Foundation in Phoenix, Arizona, and the founder of \"Ericksonian Hypnosis\". This involves communicating \"with the whole person by utilizing conscious and unconscious levels\" and teaches \"how to utilize and bypass client resistance by embedding therapeutic interventions in seemingly casual conversation\".21 Bypass client resistance? Cut the Orwellian language and it means mind manipulation, tapping into the unconscious mind without the person's conscious knowledge to plant the thoughts you wish them to follow. NLP claims to train students to read others by noting their eye position and choice of language and so on With the manipulative use of NLP the idea is to put your target into a trance state without them realising it, just as a skilled hypnotist can do. Dick Sutphen, an expert in subliminal programming, said that if a suggestion or command is given in this state, \" ... the suggestions are not challenged by your conscious mind, they are accepted by your subconscious, which begins to create the circumstance necessary to change your life so it will match your new beliefs\".23 Or creates the circumstance necessary to change the beliefs of someone else. This trance state is vital to mind programming because the conscious mind stands aside to allow the subconscious to be accessed, for thoughts to be planted. The trance state is, appropriately, connected to the most ancient part of the human brain, the R Complex or reptilian brain. "},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 254 Newspeak The use of language for mind-control was highlighted most famously by George Orwell in his classic, 1984, which was written in 1948 and published the following year. Orwell (real name, Eric Blair) was heavily involved in British political life and it was not purely from imagination that he could foretell so accurately the Big Brother society we are experiencing. He could see it coming. Orwell used the term, 'Newspeak', for the language of manipulation and suppression. In Orwell's novel, the state controlled media use Newspeak and other linguistic trickery to spread its propaganda and brainwash the public. Orwell explains in his essay Politics and the English Language, how \"Political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\".24 Or, as he puts in 1984: \"War’s peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\" 25 In the society predicted by Orwell, the names for government ministries were chosen to present the opposite meaning to their true function. The Ministry of Truth was there to falsify records; the Ministry of Peace was the one that orchestrated the wars; the Ministry of Love was \"the really frightening one\" that questioned and tortured suspects; and the Ministry of Plenty produced fake figures to convince the people the economy was doing well when there were major shortages because of the endless wars being fought. The forced labour camp was named the Joycamp. This is what we have today. Ministries of information are there to spread disinformation; ministries of defence launch wars of conquest; departments of homeland security are there to secure control; \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" was designed to hide the truth that it was really Operation Iraqi Slaughter and Conquest; the term 'democracy' is used as a cover for dictatorship. Orwell's manipulators, like those manipulating our minds today, repeated the same statements over and over in the knowledge that in doing so it would indoctrinate the people to believe them through sheer repetition. The mantra about 'weapons of mass destruction' was a most obvious example as the public were prepared to accept the invasion of Iraq. Puppets like Bush, Blair and Powell knew precisely what they were doing as they bashed out the same phrase hour after hour. Watch for the repeated messages and you'll see what you are being prepared to accept next. Orwell's Ministry of Truth changed news items and documents that cast the authorities in a bad light. Once the original document was replaced it was destroyed. Orwell writes: \"This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets ... Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record.\" 26 This is what happens when the present Fourth Reich finds 'documents' that support their claims and others that \"expose\" those who challenge them. Hiding reality A major aim of Newspeak is to use words to underplay the horrors and injustices inflicted by the manipulators and to emphasise their 'victories'. Orwell gives an example of how the policy of bombing defenceless villages from the air and forcing people from their homes is called \"pacification\" and millions of peasants robbed of their farms with no more than they can carry is called \"transfer of population or rectification of frontiers\".27 In modern wars, like the invasion of Iraq, we hear the constant repetition of the term \"mopping up operations\". This disguises the reality behind \"mopping up\" - killing anyone still resisting the tyranny after the main battle is over. There is also the obscene term \"collateral damage\", which is Newspeak for slaughtering civilians in the name of freeing them. \"Pre-emptive strikes\" is Newspeak for mass murder and conquest by attacking first. The US Justice (Injustice) Department produced a law within the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 to allow the government to strip American citizenship from anyone giving \"material support\" to any group designated as terrorists. The [In]Justice Department naturally decides who are considered terrorists. But how can they take away someone's US citizenship when this is specifically forbidden by the Constitution? By Newspeak. \"Material support\" for terrorists is a Newspeak phrase that means \"any support we decide is support\" and section 501 of the act says that Americans can voluntarily give up their rights to citizenship purely by their behaviour. To quote the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 255 Newspeak: \" ... an intent to relinquish nationality need not be manifested in words, but can be . inferred from conduct\". If you, in the opinion of the [In]Justice Department, give \"material support\" to terrorists (the designation of which they decide) you are voluntarily giving up your rights to citizenship. Once that is done your constitutional rights are ended. First they pass 'anti-terrorist' laws to do what they' like with foreigners they dub terrorists or supporters of terrorism, as with those held without charge, trial, or lawyers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and then they use this all-embracing Newspeak clause to take away the citizenship of those Americans they are targeting so they can hold them indefinitely without charge, trial or access to a lawyer. Another common Newspeak phrase to justify grotesque inequality of wealth distribution is: \"We don't believe in punishing people because they are successful.\" You hear Tony Blair say this a lot. This moves the emphasise of the \"victim\" of injustice from those working their butts off to make it through another week to those making a fortune exploiting those working their butts off to make it through another week. When George Bush announced tax cuts that benefited people like teachers and firefighters by $350 to $500 a year and multi-millionaires by $88,000, the White House spokesman and master of mendacity, Ari Fleischer, said those very words: \"The-president does not believe in punishing people because they are successful.\" 28 Big brother speaks Here are a few of Orwell's Newspeak terms coined in 1948 that are so relevant to what is happening today. Crimethink: to even consider that the authorities could be wrong in any way. Crimestop: to instinctively change your thought processes whenever you are in danger of breaking the law of crimethink and never listening to views that expose the ruling cabal. This has been described as \"protective stupidity\". Thinkpol: the Thought Police who's role is to eliminate crimethink through spying, surveillance cameras, etc. Blackwhite: to accept whatever the authorities say without question and, as Orwell, put it \" ... loyal willingness to say black is white when party [government] discipline demands this. It also means the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know black is white, and forget that one has ever believed the contrary\". Duckspeak: to speak without thinking, as in quacking like a duck. Facecrime: to show any facial expression that Big Brother surveillance could interpret as having something to hide. This could be a look of anxiety or failing to react to official statements or alleged \"victories\" in the correct manner, including not cheering when a war was won. Doublethink: the refusal or inability to see contradictions and to have two contradictory beliefs in your mind at the same time while believing them both to be true. This comment by boy George Bush is an example: \"See, we love - we love freedom. That's what they didn't understand. They hate things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we don't seek revenge, we seek justice out of love.\" This asks us to believe that love = mass murder of civilians. This is an apparently impossible contradiction or doublethink, but tens of millions of Americans and others 'believe that both are true. Doublethink, and therefore crimes top (refusing to think anything ill of the government) are essential to tyrannies because their whole foundation is based on contradictions and lies. The character called Winston in Orwell's 1984 defined doublethink or doublespeak as: \"To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against. logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party [government] was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 256 needed! and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, t{)apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.\" ~9 Newspeak today The Orwellian society is now all around us, gathering pace by the hour, and naturally a vital component of the Illuminati thought control today is, as Orwell envisaged, the manipulation of language. Here are some of the real meanings behind modern Newspeak that the spinners constantly work to camouflage. American interest: the interest of those who control the United States and anyone who resists that control is acting \"against American interests. National security: the security of the authorities to hide their agenda and the control of the people through increased security to meet manufactured dangers. World community: you hear this mantra pour from the mouths of the globalists like Bush, Powell and Blair. It implies that 'free' nations are bound together in pursuit of freedom, peace and morality as a \"world community\" when, as we saw with Iraq, this is Newspeak for American and British tyranny on behalf of the Illuminati. \"World community\" is also designed to prepare the way for the acceptance of the world government Anti-government groups: any organisation that seeks to highlight and challenge government dictatorship. They are, therefore, dubbed highly dangerous anarchists or potential terrorists. Extremist: anyone saying anything different to the government-supported norm (see also \"militant). Redistributing wealth from mega rich to starving poor is considered \"extremism\" by those in power. Conspiracy theory: any claim that the government is lying and following an agenda hidden from the people. Change: a big Newspeak word that means to introduce the Illuminati global society by creating problems and undermining the status quo to bring about the perceived need for \"change\". The word \"reform\" is used in the same way, not least by Tony Blair, who claims that people are either \"reformers\" (those who accept change in line with the agenda) or \"wreckers\" (those that resist such change).\" Right and Left Conservative and Liberal: terms designed to present every issue as black and white polarities and obscure the fact that there are more than two sides to every debate. Nation building: after bombing and invading a target country you place a puppet government in power to represent your interests while claiming it is a government chosen by the native people. This ensures the country is run by your dictat, but without your overt control. We don't want people to realise that a campaign of global conquest is happening before their eyes (or visual cortex). Peacekeeping: occupation of a country by foreign troops. Peace process: giving the impression that you are working for peace when it is merely an interlude before launching more conquest through war. Terrorist: those who protest. through violence, but also anyone who attacks or challenges the interests of the west, especially America, Britain and Israel, or stands in the way of further conquest. Liberation: mass murder and terrorism against civilians in the name of stopping terrorism that’s nothing whatsoever to do with the people you kill or maim for life. War on terrorism: the constant repeat of this process. "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 257 Attack: when America and Co are the target. Retaliation: when America and Co attack. First-strike: When America and Co attack first in retaliation for what America and Co claims their target country could do to them (see also lies). Self-defence: killing the other guy before he even thinks of killing you. Western values: these are values you want to impose on others, but don't have yourself. Mythical belief in the 'West' as the good guys appearing over the ridge to kill them baddy Indians. See also John Wayne. Campaign contribution: bribe. Affirmative action: racial discrimination that affirmative action is supposed to eliminate. The only way to do achieve racial equality is for everyone to be chosen on their merits irrespective of their colour, creed or background (see fairness, and justice) and for everyone to have an equal opportunity to develop their talents. Education: brainwashing. Tidying up exercise: the phrase you use when you want to make major changes while disguising them as insignificant. This was used to lie to the British people about changes to the constitution of the European Union that pretty much removes what is left of British sovereignty. It was only a \"tidying up exercise\" to \"streamline\" existing legislation and make the EU more \"democratic\". Classic Newspeak. Good citizens: slaves that do not protest at being s0 or even realise that they are. Equality: make everyone a slave. Democracy: elected, or even unelected, dictatorship in which the majority often vote for the losers. See also tyranny of the uninformed majority. Crime: breaking a law passed without our agreement no' matter how ludicrous it may be. Freedom of the press: freedom to report the official version of events . Human rights: the right to do what the government tells you. Tolerance: do not criticise or challenge the behaviour of anything and anyone, no matter what the circumstances. Zero-tolerance: tyranny. Free trade: using slave labour to make your products in the world's poorest countries for a few cents and exporting them without tariff charges to the richest countries to sell for top-of-the-range prices. Also means to dump your products in any country you wish and destroy the local economy and livelihoods of the world's poorest people. Competition: translational corporations competing to see which can exploit the global population most effectively. Capitalism: cartelism. Isolationist: anyone who does not want to dictate to others and control the people of other nations. Level playing field: fixing the system in favour of those you wish to win."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 258 Propaganda: whatever your opponents say because you only tell the truth, Freedom: slavery The distorted use of these words arid others is designed to plant a false reality into the conscious, and, especially, subconscious mind. This manipulates peoples to see themselves and the world in a way that suits the ambitions of their leaders. 'Hate crime' = Thought Crime One of the most powerful expressions of the Orwellian thought police is the so-called hate crime. In Canada they have a 'Hate Crimes Unit' and there are other versions of this around the world like the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain that is dominated by. people with their own agendas to pursue. Such organisations are in daily search of those who are expressing a view that the Thought Police deem is inciting racial hatred. You can even be charged with a \"hate crime\" for revealing true information that the thought police decide could \"create an atmosphere\" in which racial attacks or \"crimes\" could take place. To suggest that the official story of what happened to Jewish people in Nazi Germany is not 100% correct is to be branded a \"hatemonger\" and a \"racist\" by reflex action. No further debate is necessary for the psychological fascists; you are an \"historical revisionist\" (Newspeak for \"racist\" because you challenge the official version of history) and you must be castigated and condemned to public vilification. George W. Bush called those who questioned his lies about Iraq as \"historical revisionists\" in the hope that the tainting of that term would undermine his gathering critics. But strangely, if anyone says that the horrors of the Pol Pot genocide in Cambodia were exaggerated or that the Irish did not suffer as much as they claim from British rule and the potato famine, this is not considered racist or a sign of hatred against Cambodians or the Irish. So isn't that racist to condemn one opinion of history and not the other? Why should Cambodians or the Irish suffer such discrimination by the Hate Crimes Unit? Surely that makes the Hate Crimes Unit guilty of a hate crime? Arrest them, I say. Jewish people can state they would never drink from a bottle of wine that had not been opened by a Jew and that's fine, no problem. But a white person who says he would not drink from a bottle of wine that had not been opened by a white person is called a racist. Personally I don't care either way, just get me a glass. The 'Jewish' press can talk of the \"plague of Jewish-Arab marriages\" without any consequences (and nor should there be, however repugnant the comment might be). But if the Arab press talked of the \"plague of Arab-Jewish marriages\" they would be branded anti-Semitic.30 Jewish people can say they are the race chosen by God and above all other races, but when a white person says that his is the master race he is branded a racist and a \"white supremacist\". There are no chosen people or master races, white, Jewish, or blue with pink spots. There is only one consciousness. The body is a hologram, an illusion, so all claims to racial superiority or inferiority are the work of the minddead and the same goes for those so obsessed with race that they look for racism everywhere. The point I am making, however, is that the Onvellian concept of the 'hate crime' is extremely arbitrary (though give it time) and basically depends on \"'\" the power wielded by those controlling the policies of the hate crimes authorities. 'Hate crime' legislation is not about protecting minorities from discrimination, that's the movie. The real reason for 'hate crime' laws is to stop legitimate debate and the free-flow of information and opinions that do not suit the manipulators. \" Once you start making a person's thoughts and opinions a crime to express you are living in a totalitarian state. It is not racial hatred to suggest that official history is not correct, just as it is not racist against Americans to say that the official story of 9/11 is a lie from start to finish. This nonsense is exploited to stop proper investigation into people and events and has nothing to do with stopping racial hatred. But this is the way Newspeak works; it is designed to manipulate the landscape of language and frighten people into keeping quiet for fear of being, dubbed a racist and hatemonger, with the consequences all that entails, in the hatred directed at you. I have experienced this after being targeted some years ago by purveyors of hatred masquerading as 'anti-racists' and yet there is not a racist cell in my body. The whole concept of racism from my philosophy is silly. How can anyone be racist about a hologram? Ironically it is those who \"cry \"racist\" most often who are the biggest racists and merchants of hate. They abscessed with it. Israeli"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 259 writer, Israel Shamir, highlighted this with regard to those. ~ho snout \"anti-Semite\" at everything that moves: \"Elie Wiesel is still very much with us. In his book, Legends of Our Time, this Jewish writer wrote: 'Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart a zone of hate healthy, virile hate - for what the German personifies and for what persists in the German'. Not 'the Nazi', but 'the German'. For this sermon of hate he received the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize from the Norwegian Academy, in company with the Cambodia-destroyer Henry Kissinger and the Kana-murderer, Shimon Peres. Armed with this recognition of the Norwegians, Elie Wiesel called (at Christmas Eve!): 'War [with Iraq] is the only option'. If you need to feel guilt, feel guilt for this Nobel Peace Prize. \"This vast difference in the feelings of Norwegians towards their national genius Hamsun and towards Elie Wiesel, the schmaltzy hate-monger, leads us to a conclusion: in prevailing post-WWII mainstream discourse, the taboo on criticism of Jews has caused strong bias and undermined the humanist idea of the Equality of Man. Pre-war anti-Semitism has been superseded by another extreme, philo-Semitism, a belief that Jews can do no wrong and should never be referred to except in the most complimentary terms. This equally racist attitude has created severe misbalance in politics and discourse. It has to be corrected in order to save our planet and mankind from the triumphant 'Semitism' of their definition.\" 31 How can it be \"anti-Semitic\" to highlight the number of people loyal to Israel who are behind the wars of American conquest in the Middle and Near East that transform the Arab lands in line with Israel's desires? Or to state how many people loyal to Israel control the media and the flow of information? Would it be racist to point this out if the architects of the Bush policies were dominated by Arabs and American troops invaded Israel? If highlighting bias is going to be denounced as racist, we might as well all walk away and let the world burn. Yet when British politician, Tam Dalyell, notes the obvious conflict of interest between the number of Israel-supporters in the Bush government and their policies favourable to Israel, he is dubbed an \"anti-Semite\". If you are talking about racial inequality, where does it lie in this case? Canadian writer Henry Makow, whose grandparents were victims of the Nazis, condemned the appalling treatment by the American and Canadian authorities of Ernst Zundel, who was dubbed a \"hate criminal\" for questioning the official story of the Holocaust. Civilised societies treat all people the same no matter what their colour, creed, background or opinion. Tyrannies do not, and that means Canada and the United States are tyrannies. Makow wrote: \"Zundel's claims are repugnant, but he has a right to be wrong. Society needs people to dispute the historical record. One may be right. If spreading false information is a crime, shouldn't we also lock up [US news anchor man] Tom Brokaw? Canada has locked up Ernst Zundel. According to his wife, he is being mistreated in prison. He risks deportation as a 'security ·risk'. Bernie Farber of the Canadian Jewish Congress concedes Zundel doesn't 'actually wield the stick' but 'provides oxygen' to extremists. That definition would curb eveyone’s freedom of speech. \"When questioning the truth becomes 'hate', we have entered Orwell's '1984' era of thought crime. Don't kid yourself. This is the slippery slope to tyranny and Jewish organizations are partly to blame. We must stand up in defiance. The charge of hate is used selectively to disarm legitimate opposition. The definition of 'hatred' is very selective. For example, lesbians spew hatred of men but they are never arrested. Feminists teach impressionable girls that all males are potentially violent sexual predators. That's OK. The Talmud is full of hatred against Christ and Christians, but that doesn't count either. \" ... Jewish organizations dishonor Holocaust victims by using them for political purposes. It is tasteless to cast Jews as the world's premier victims. Humanity is one family and no genocide is more important than another. To use 'hate' to disarm opposition to the Zionist agenda is also repugnant. It leads to tyranny and more anti-Semitism. For Ernst Zundel to deny or understate the Jewish Holocaust is grotesque. But it is no t a crime. In these questions, only the truth matters. Let the truth speak for itself. Let Zundel be judged by it.\" 32 This is a vital point if we wish to live in freedom. Either we have freedom of expression or we don't. You can't be a little bit free. You either are or you aren't. If you want the freedom to say what you want then you must give the same freedom to all others and defend that right when it is challenged, even if you don't agree with them. Freedom of expression does not exist unless it applies to all. People in Nazi Germany did not"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 260 have the freedom to speak out and warn the population about the real agenda of the fascists. Look again at what the Nazi Propaganda Minister, Dr Joseph M. Goebbels, said: \"The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic, and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State.\" All dictatorships want to curb this basic right to express your thoughts and opinions, but 'anti-racist' organisations and people who have targeted me, like Bernie Farber of the Canadian Jewish Congress and a Canadian lawyer called Richard Warman, at the amazingly titled Canadian Human Rights Commission, want to decide who has free speech and who does not. Their like can be found across the world, but the moment their right of expression is challenged they are the first to squeal. Actress Brigitte Bardot was threatened with legal action for' attacking Islam, homosexuals, the unemployed, teachers and illegal immigrants, and calling for a return of the guillotine. She made the comments in her book, Un Cri Dans Le Silence. She said gays were fairground freaks, teachers arrive at work with greasy hair wearing disgusting jeans and mudd'y:tr~iI1ers, and that 'the professional unemployed' don't even want to work illegally We may find her views either appalling and laughable, but they are her views and she has a right to them. What she does not have a right to do unchallenged is force her views on others or seek to introduce discrimination on the basis of her views. But would' you rather live in a world in which she could express her thoughts, unpleasant as they may be, or one in which the Thought Police dictated to her - and therefore you - what you could and could not say? Her freedom of speech is actually yours. If everyone is not free then no one is. Israel Shamir makes the point very well: \"Millennia before the Great Cultural Revolution, the Chinese knew the secret of harmony: the non-Manichean balance of opposing ideas, the principles of Ying and Yang. Properly balanced, Jewish idE!as can be beneficial: anti-Christian zeal would limit Church excesses, just as materialism and egoism can keep the feet of Man on the ground while his head is in heaven, feminism can balance male chauvinism, and the sex obsession of Freud can balance the asceticism of spiritualists. Balanced, even Zionism will shrink to the humane proportions of Jewish love for Palestine. But balanced it should be. Crackpot correctness The reign of terror called 'political correctness' (PC) is Orwellian thought control or crimethink. I have yet to work out who decides what is 'political' and what is 'correct', but it certainly has nothing to do with anyone I know. Let us just think, or crimethink, about this for a moment. We are allowing some unknown 'authority' to dictate what we can and cannot say with our own freewill. What?? The vehicles for its imposition are the robot radicals with their hearts on their sleeves and their brains in the place where the Sun don't shine. They believe that we must remove any words, phrases or opinions that might upset anyone. Unless, of course, you are a target of these people for your allegedly politically correct words, phrases or opinions, in which case they seem to have no problem with hurling the very abuse in your direction that-they would condemn if it was issued from the mouths of anyone else. The 'PCs', or Purveyors of Claptrap, are yet another Orwellian tyranny. In an article headed \"Politically-Correct Censorship Rampant in US Schools\", the Australian Sunday Times reported the insane results of 25 years of political correctness. The article focussed on a book by Diane Ravitch, a former American government official, called The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn.34 A reviewer in the Chicago Sun-Times said the book would cause readers to gnash their teeth as they read of the outrages against common sense.35 Ravitch says: \"Some of this censorship is trivial, some is ludicrous and some is breathtaking in its power to dumb down what children learn in school.\" 36 She reveals that a story entitled The 'Friendly Dolphin was rejected by one school committee because it discriminates against students who did not live near the sea. A story called The Silly Old Lady was rejected because it contained a \"negative stereotype\" of an elderly woman {who put too many gadgets on her bicycle. Another entitled A Perfect Day for Ice-Cream had to be rewritten without reference to ice-cream because of a ban in California on any mention of junk food. Other concepts banned by the Thought Police included disobedient children, ghosts, parents who quarrel, ski trips and birthday parties. In some schools, dinosaurs cannot be mentioned because they imply a theory of evolution that not all Americans agree with. Such"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 261 lunacy was being routinely introduced across America, Ravitch said, and the same is happening in Britain and elsewhere. These decisions are being made by the Orwellian \"bias and security\" panels that advise state education boards what children should read. Ravitch says that these panels operate \"an increasingly bizarre policy of censorship\" that has been \"stripping away everything that is potentially thought-provoking and colourful from the texts children are to encounter.\"3? Note that: stripping away anything that is \"potentially thought provoking\". That is the idea and the agenda behind political correctness, as it was in Orwell's Big Brother society. The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook by Henry Beard and Christopher Cerf38 shows how far down the road we have travelled. A person confined to a wheelchair is called \"differently abled\"; a person without a job is \"unwaged\" (the constant use of the prefix 'un' was part of Orwell's Newspeak in 1984, as in \"ungood\"); to be disabled is now to be \"physically challenged\"; your partner is your \"significant other\" to avoid the \"sexual stereotyping\" of boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife; if you are shorter than average you are \"vertically challenged\"; George Bush is not stupid, he's \"mentally challenged\"; a waiter or waitress becomes a waitron; women are wimyn or wimmin to avoid \"man\". Mailman should be personperson then and manhole needs to be personhole? Then you have ableism, ageism, lookism, sizeism, weightism; all of them straight from. the Orwell dictionary. Political correctness now includes avoiding sports at school that involve anyone winning or losing. It might upset them, see. But why then don't they ban all exams to avoid winners and losers in academia? Oh, it's OK to win if you excel in the classroom, but not if your gift is on the sports field. And that's '!he point. These mind-fascists say they want to celebrate the diversity of people and then spend all their time destroying it, not least the diversity of the language. Yet more doublethink. When opinions or descriptions deemed unacceptable to these zealots are erased from use, it forces people into a land of saqleness, mediocrity and the inability to communicate what they really think and feel. The zealots decide what is right and wrong, acceptable and incorrect. They are mind-police, nothing less, and the ultimate racists, ageists, ableists, lookists, sizeists, weightists and chauvinists because they are more obsessed with identifying such people than anyone else on the planet. I see an old lady and they see a potential victim of discrimination on the grounds of age. I see a woman and they see a potential victim of discrimination on the grounds of her sex. It is now politically incorrect to say\" that someone is \"crippled\". Why? What are we supposed to do, encourage them to be Olympic champion for the one hundred metres? They will have other skills and abilities that an Olympic champion will not have. So celebrate those advantages instead of being obsessed with the disadvantages. I have a right hand mangled by arthritis that I cannot use except for one finger to type. I am basically disabled in the right hand and not so good in the left, either. So what am I then? Differently abled? No, call me crippled if you want, I don't give a damn. It does not matter unless it matters to me. Surely what we should be doing is encouraging people to see that how others describe them doesn't matter; to free them from being effected by labels, whatever they are. When we impose rigid descriptions we emphasise the differences by developing a 'special' term for those that want to be treated like everyone else. You can't call people mentally handicapped any longer; they are \"people with learning difficulties\". But why do they have learning difficulties? Because they have a mental handicap. What have I got with the physical handicap in my hands then, digit turning difficulties? I worked closely with the mentally handicapped for years and they are incredible people with abilities, not least in the way they can express love, that are a wonder to behold. What an insult to them to say that they must be called by some manufactured phrase because they might be upset or suffer discrimination. They're bigger than that, even if the thought-censors aren't. People have different abilities, bodies and challenges. That's what makes for the glorious diversity of life. Why do these agents of discrimination want to hide that when it should be a source of celebration? I can't catch footballs any longer like I did when I was a goalkeeper because it's too painful. But I still intend to take Manchester United and the Miami Dolphins to court for the blatant discrimination of not playing me in their first team just because I have a crippled hand. One of the most insane examples of political correctness came in my home town of Leicester when police raided a woman's house and took away her collection of china pigs after complaints from local Muslims. They said that the display of model pigs were \"racially offensive\" to them.39 Not as offensive as their idiocy is to me, mind. We should be tackling real discrimination on the grounds of handicap, race, or sex, not inventing a new industry of nonsensical Newspeak and political correctness that insults the intelligence of all involved. But, then, from the Illuminati's point of view, it is not crazy at all. "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 262 Method in the madness We should not be kidded by the ridiculous words and terms spawned by the censors of political correction. Yes, it appears so breathtakingly dumb and many of its ignorant practitioners are. But behind that is a coldly calculated plan that has been long in the making. In 1984, Orwell's Newspeak changed the language to remove the words that described political ideas at odds with the official position and a major· aim was to reduce the number of words available to people. This is the true reason for political correctness and the gathering lack of emphasis on expanding the vocabulary of children and students. Orwell knew that as you reduce the number of words available, you contract correspondingly the ability to express your thoughts as \"Yours. To suppress words is to suppress thought, or, as Orwell said: \" ... if thought .corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought\". Listen to politicians and. the military in their public statements. They use glib phrases that lack the clear meaning that a bigger vocabulary of words would offer. They don't want to be specific, that's the idea, and incomprehensible Newspeak jargon is used for the same reason. The further you reduce the words (and through the generations even the awareness of them) the more bland communication becomes and the desire to write and read books will diminish. Blandness is what the manipulators are looking for and any words that make a clear statement are targeted. Wilson Bryan Key writes in The Age of Manipulation about his experience of writing a speech with others for US President Dwight Eisenhower: \"For thirty-six sleepless hours, three writers turned out draft after draft, reviewed by a White House deputy press secretary who offered terse comments like, 'Much too specific!' 'Ease up on factual references!' and 'Take it back and fuzz it up!' 'Fuzz it up,' we discovered eventually, meant avoid all clear, factual statements about anything more specific than the time of day ... The speech was endlessly discussed for likely audience reactions, belief and attitude reinforcements, and implied meanings ... Would anyone take the empty rhetoric seriously? The speech read smoothly, but said absolutely nothing about anything. This was precisely what it was intended to say. During audience interviews after the oration, most expressed satisfaction with the great man's words. 'Ike really gave it to them!' 'He has my vote!' 'I like the way he thinks!' Great speech!'\" 40 The manipulators want to reduce the words available to express a thought and, through this, influence what and how people think. When the words to express a thought have gone, so has the thought because in this reality we think in words. The same happens to memory which cannot be consciously retained without the ~ words to express it. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Newspeak as: noun, usage: often capitalized; propagandistic language marked by euphemism, circumlocution, and the inversion of customary meanings. Etymology: Newspeak, a language 'designed to diminish the range of thought,' in the novel 1984 (1949) by-George Orwell.\" There you have the key motivation of Newspeak: \" ... to diminish the range of thought\". A Newspeak engineer in 19~4 says they are cutting Newspeak to the bone and every year there will be fewer word~ to use. \"In the end we shall make thought crime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it.\" To do this, the Orwellian controllers targeted what they called .\"Oldspeak\", the language that had developed over thousands of years, and also \"Old think\", those ideas and attitudes resistant to the 'change' and 'reform' demanded by those in power. When Donald Rumsfeld described the resistance by Germany and France to the Iraq war as an example of \"Old Europe\" this was another attack on Oldthink. Political correctness is an example of the enforcement of Newspeak, but mostly it takes over simply by repetition of use. Orwellian prophecy George Orwell's vision of the new tomorrow was such a mirror of what we see today both in the outcome and the techniques used to achieve it. He featured a \"revolutionary group\" called the Resistance that the Orwellian authorities claimed was led by the evil, Emmanuel Goldstein (see Osama bin Laden and endless· others). The Resistance appears not to have really existed, but they were blamed for every ill. One of the worst crimes a citizen could commit was to read Goldstein's book that laid out in simple terms the structure of control under which the people were living. To read the book and to accept the contents was the ultimate thoughtcrime. More than fifty years ago Orwell described the technology of control such as the \"Speakwrite\", a voice recognition machine, and the \"Telescreen\", twoway television with only one channel that poured out the government propaganda. We are fast heading for that same situation today. We may"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 263 have endless channels, but they are basically the same one churning out the same unquestioned government line. Orwell talked of the \"proles\" or \"proletarians\", which made up around 85% of the Orwellian population. They were the unthinking masses and the authorities looked upon them as cattle, just as they do today. They didn't suffer the level of surveillance of those considered intellectually dangerous because they didn't question anything. Then there was \"prolefeed\", the brain-numbing 'entertainment'. and made-up 'news' for the masses to keep them dumbed down and incapable of free thought. Spot on. There was also the \"unperson\", someone removed from circulation and all files until he or she officially ceased to exist. To talk about an unperson was a thoughtcrime, just as to highlight the suffering, indignity and injustice imposed upon the inmates of Guantanamo Bay is considered to be \"supporting the terrorists\". Anything in any publication that put the Orwellian government in a bad light was described in Newspeak as \"malreported\" or \"malquoted\" because the authorities were never wrong. We are also now seeing the Orwellian 'anti-terrorism' programmes being introduced to encourage and reward the public to spy on each other and report their neighbours, workmates, clients and even fellow students to the authorities. Orwell's nightmare world is not coming, it's here. Erasing history History may not seem to be all that important to control, but it is. By studying history you can compare the assumptions and values of the world you are experiencing. As Orwell put it: \"Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\" In fact all three are happening together, but his point is valid in the way history is perceived in this reality. The Illuminati have always sought to re-write history: The destruction and removal of the unique historical treasures and texts in the museums of Iraq was part of that. One of the tasks of the Orwell character called Winston is to invent a biography of a fictional soldier named Ogilvy, who can then be honoured by Big Brother in a public address. After writing the description of Ogilvy's life, Winston marvels at how \"once the act of forgery [is] forgotten, [Ogilvy will] exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar\". It is the same principle as faking the history of what happened to Private Jessica Lynch or the real story of 9/11, By presenting a false version of September 11 th, which is now official history, a whole series of events have taken place, including mass slaughter, because the people have overwhelmingly accepted the lie. Look at American propaganda about its own history. The people are taught about the glorious victories and how their nation has always been the bastion of freedom, justice and morality. This fabrication colours the way many Americans view themselves and the actions of their government today. \"We don't need telling that we are going to war to liberate Iraq and bring freedom and justice - that's what we have been doing since this great nation was formed.\" The true history of the 'liberators', the United States and Britain, is one of breathtaking, grotesque, exploitation, imposition and mass murder on a scale that beggars belief. The US record on human rights is a disgrace and yet its official history emphasises its wonderful record of giving freedom to the oppressed. Even today, America jails five to ten times more of its people per head of population than any of the developed countries - some seven times more than China. The United Nations even removed the US from its Human Rights Committee. Such is the delusion through the faking of US history that Texas representative, Dick Armey, gave this response to the UN decision: \"It reduces the United Nations to a farce when they expel the-champion of human rights.\"41 No, it reduces your knowledge of your own country's history to a farce to believe for a moment that this is the case. If the truth about America and Britain was in the official historical record it would be so much more difficult to sell the lie to the people when another country is due to be 'liberated' by extermination. Replacing Old speak with Newspeak is also designed to eventually prevent the reading of historical accounts through loss of the language and even the need to censor history will be eliminated. They manipulate the media? No. They own it! The Illuminati have been fast increasing their control of the global media by acquisition and merger, and through destroying the opposition by denying non-Illuminati operations the advertising that they also, control. This is crucial to their goal of brainwashing the population through hypnosis, Newspeak and the suppression of alterative views. The American media is basically owned by five groups, all of which, through the Illuminati, are connected to the same agenda and you find the same in: other countries.

Internet: the web giant America Online or AOL.42 AOL Time Warner is followed in size by Disney, Viacom, Vivendi Universal (which merged with the Bronfman family's Seagam) and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. This network dominates television, movies and publishing. In 1997, the films produced by the four biggest motion picture companies, Disney, Warner Brothers, Paramount (Viacom) and Universal (Seagram) accounted for two-thirds of the total box-office receipts for the year.43 By 2003, only 20% of American' newspapers, even local ones were not owned by the media corporations and the same can be found across the world. Michael Powell, the son',ofCo1in Powell, and head of the US Federal Communications Commission, is seeking to still further increase the share of the media that one company can own and Tony Blair is doing this in Britain. Both are serving their hidden masters. With this level of media control, imagine the potential for programming the people with the same lies and disinformation; the same conditioned view of reality; the same Newspeak and subliminals. Imagine, too, the potential for the suppression of information and views that challenge and expose the official lies. When Alice ill W0I1derlalld and the World Trade Center Disaster was published, copies were sent to every major television programme, radio station and newspaper in Britain and America. It is an expose of the lies surrounding 9 j11 and yet out of all those media organisations only one, the Sunday Herald in Scotland, contacted me. Even then they wrote a story about me that did not mention the content of the book. Such is our free society. The Illuminati dictate the policy and view of almost all areas of society. Often through their 'charity foundations', they fund 'scientific' research (insisting what the outcome will be before the money is handed"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 265 over - see (And the Truth Shall Set You Free). This aims to hold the scientific party line about the nature of reality. They also own the pharmaceutical cartel that funds the 'medical' system training the doctors and dispensing their lethal drugs and destructive vaccines. They own the translational 'food' corporations that dictate what the people eat. They own the drinks corporations that decide what the people drink. They own the oil supplies and power companies on which modem society depends. All these aspects of Illuminati control are coordinated from a central point to lay siege to our bodies, minds and freedom of choice. But by far the most vital strand in that web is the ownership of the media to dictate what the people think. It is through the mind and emotions that the game is played with the subconscious reality the number one target. I have long been exposing the central ownership of these apparently unconnected areas of society and at last far more people are beginning to see it. Thinking like a reptile The deal is simple. You know that reality is an illusion and how it is created by the beliefs that we accept to be real. You also know that five-sense behaviour is orchestrated from the subconscious mind and not the conscious. This is the experiencer and interpreter of reality, not the prime creator. The subconscious produces the thought fields, the wave patterns, and the conscious observes them into holographic, illusory, reality. OK. So armed with this knowledge you target the subconscious with an explosion of messages designed to programme its beliefs with the sense of reality that suits you. You are literally hypnotising the population. A hypnotist wants to get you relaxed and into a trance-like state that allows powerful access to the subconscious mind. He or she will then implant the messages they want you to follow when you think, and I emphasise think, the hypnosis is over. The story of the man who was told not to see his daughter when he came 'out' of his hypnotic state is a good example. The human population is caught in the same hypnotic trance, following the commands planted into the subconscious mind. This brings us back to the Reptilian connection. At the heart of this conditioning, appropriately, is the most ancient part of the human brain known by scientists as the R-complex or reptilian brain. It is the result of our reptilian genetic history. The Reptilians behind the Illuminati naturally know better than anyone how to manipulate the reptilian brain and it is through this that humanity is largely controlled and directed. The human brain is in two parts, or hemispheres. We have the right brain and the left-brain that are connected by a mass of nerve fibres. The left side is 'rational', 'logical' and 'intellectual'. It works closely with the physical senses and can be summed up by can I \"touch it\", \"see it\", \"hear it\", \"smell it\" or \"taste it\"? It communicates through spoken and written words. The right brain is where we manifest imagination, intuition, instincts, dream-states and the subconscious. It is the artist, musician and creative inspiration. It communicates through images and symbols, not words. This right side is closely related to the reptilian part of the brain. Reptiles communicate through imagery and symbols -like the Illuminati secret society network - and this makes the reptilian brain most open to conditioning by movies and television. Researcher Skip Largent writes: \"All movies and television are a projection of the reptilian brain. How so? Movies and television (video games etc.) are all undeniably dreamlike, not only in their presentation of symbolic-reality, but also in that humans experiencing movies, etc., have the same brain wave patterns as when they are dreaming. And guess where dreaming originates in your head? In the reptilian brain (although other parts of our brain are involved). The 'language' of the reptilian brain is visual imagery. All communications transferred by reptiles are done so by visual symbolic representations, each having specific meaning.\" This is what the Illuminati are doing through their subliminals and symbolism. The movie and television industries are not only owned by the Illuminati; they overwhelmingly created them. They understand how visual images can be used to condition the population. In normal circumstance the reptilian-dominated right brain receives images through the eyes or the imagination and the left brain decodes those images into thoughts and conclusions. The Illuminati have intervened in this process, however, to control human perception. Their aim is to disconnect the functions of these two distinct parts of the brain so we can be manipulated through the right brain while only being aware of the left - or manipulated through the subconscious while only being aware of the conscious. They plant images into the right brain (the dream-state, the non-conscious) using symbolism, subliminal imagery and pictures, while often telling the left-brain how it should interpret those images. This is done through 'education', 'science' and the media."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 266 Television news does this all the time. The right brain is shown pictures and the reporter's voice-over tells the left brain what they mean. Show me some television news pictures without words and I'll give you many possible explanations for what is happening. But the news reporter only tells you about one - invariably the one given to them by the authorities. The left brain is told by external sources how to decode right brain images. What we urgently need to do is regain control of our left brains and decide for ourselves what we are seeing. Another aspect of the reptilian mind is the 'hive' mentality and they have sought, very successfully so far, to transfer that hive or herd state to the human population. This is one reason why they are so desperate to destroy individuality of all kinds. You will find that words like imagination, imagine, dream and suchlike are used widely in advertising. They know that if they can use those trigger words that encourage the right-brain, non-conscious, daydream state, they can access your subconscious mind with imagery and then tell your left brain how to decode that into conscious language - I want that car; I think the police should be given more powers to stop crime; I need Viagra to be a real man again; we need a world government to solve our problems. Television and movies are producing a fantasy world of make-believe to open up the unconscious right brain and allow the Illuminati secret access through that to the conscious mind. Television and movies are packed with subliminal messages. Children are most at risk from this and they are being targeted by fantasy images to this end. In early childhood the mental state is controlled almost exclusively by the reptilian brain and the purveyors of children's 'entertainment', like Disney, exploit this knowledge. I was also interested to find an article in the Los Angeles Times that highlighted another trait of the reptilian brain - greed and excess. The article was headed ':Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in Southern California\". French anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille is quoted as saying: \" ... The desire for excess comes from the 'reptilian brain', the earliest, most primitive structures in our mental evolution. The reptilian wants to grab as much food as possible, to be as big and powerful as possible, because it's focussed on survival. When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the rep tilian, the reptilian ways wins .. \"Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago, and more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and diabetes. We're racking up mountains of debt (the late fees we pay on credit cards have more that tripled since 1996, to $7.3 billion a year) and burning up fossil fuels like crazy. We demand things that, deep down, we don't really want or even use.\" 45 This is how the reptilian mind sees reality and this is the world we live in because the Illuminati are reptilian. The whole focus is on survival and the Matrix consciousness has perhaps projected these sentient programs in a reptilian form because nothing concentrates the mind more than the fear of not surviving. We are their energy source and, through them, an energy source for the Matrix itself. They are seeking to control us and maintain the flow of fear energy. Their apparent arrogance is a cover for panic. What completes the circle is that once programmed with an externally implanted reality, the people who have built their prison then police it to keep the others in. Anyone who has another reality at odds with the manufactured consensus is ridiculed, condemned and generally abused for refusing to conform to the prevailing illusion. Newspeak is designed to remove even the language available to describe any other reality, except the one the Illuminati wish to perpetuate. Round and round we go, one programmed generation programming. the next, each more emphatically than the last. The walls close in by the day. But it doesn't have to be like this. We can and will break the circle and we shall now look at how this is being done.

These unconsciously reinforced fantasies actually threaten survival.\" Wilson Bryan Key OK, so how do we set ourselves free? There are many researchers of the five-sense conspiracy who believe the situation we face is now pretty much hopeless. It has gone too far, I hear some of them say, and the people are so programmed with false beliefs they will never wake up and rise up in time. If I were looking at the world purely from five-sense reality I would agree with them and I do think that events will need to get even more blatant before the spell is broken. But that is all it is: a spell, a hypnotic state, and that is reversible anytime we choose. The Illuminati don't orchestrate the daily assault on mind and body because they think it's a laugh and a bit of fun. They do it in the understanding that consciousness in awareness of its true and infinite power could dismantle their manipulated reality in an instant. They are terrified that the human collective mind will wake up and remember what it has been programmed to forget. The food and' drink additives, genetically modified crops, 'medical' drugs, vaccines, electromagnetic pollution, subliminals, 'science', 'education', media manipulation and the suppression of alternative ways of healing and thinking are designed with one aim in mind: to hypnotise human consciousness and disconnect it through mind and body from its infinite potential: \"Look into my eyeeeeees. You have no power. You are ordinary and insignificant, a chemical process destined for oblivion~ You must look to your leaders to guide you and protect you. They are the all-powerful ones who know what you need. Only they can change your life. Obey, obey, obeeeey. When I click my fingers you will wake up and do whatever we tell you to dooooooo ... \" Click. \"Hey, honey, I've just been watching the TV news and I'm sure glad we have our leaders to guide and protect us, cos' what would we do without them? I get this feeling we should watch a game show tonight, honey, what time does Wheel of Fortune come on?\" \" Anything on the news, Chuck?\" \"I can't remember, honey, but I think we should vote for Bush.\" The suppression is actually far more potent than the indoctrination. Without the first you can't have the second. A mind in its awakened state would see through the lies before the sentence was even complete, just as we can clearly see subliminals once we are aware of their existence. If you go back to page 404 and look at the picture of the plants you'll see what I mean. The same applies to the manufactured illusion we call the 'world', When we de-programme and unplug ourselves from the Matrix illusion, the hypnotists suddenly lose their power over our sense of '\" reality. What had once been, subliminal now becomes crystal clear. With this understanding, the Illuminati have sought to suppress and demonise the knowledge of who we are and the true nature of our infinite self. Those who have talked about the other dimensions or frequency realms within the Matrix have been burned at the stake or, more latterly, ridiculed, condemned and filed under \"freaks\". But it is those who speak of Oneness, the unity of all, who offer the greatest challenge to the Matrix mentality because awareness of the One disl1iantles the illusion of duality and division on which the Matrix depends for its control. Would Israeli soldiers kill an Arab child, or anyone else, if they realised that they and the child and the tank and the gun were all the same? Would an Arab suicide bomber kill Jewish people if he had that understanding? Would anyone go to war with anyone if they knew that they were their 'enemy' and their 'enemy' was them? It may be called an invasion of Iraq, an Arab-Israeli conflict, a murder or a stat~ execution, but these are all examples of people killing or attacking themselves. The human race has a fetish for self-abuse. It is the killer and the killed, the maimer and the maimed, and the prisoner of its own ignorance. How those beyond"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 269 the illusion must despair at our plight. But it doesn't have to be like this. It’s a choice we have the infinite power to make . Reality reloaded It is good to be aware of the five-sense manipulation and the role of otherdimensional entities, but by far the most important information in this book is about reality and how we create it. That is our getaway car. It is because this understanding has been suppressed that we are caught in a web of our own making. The trouble is people don't realise that they are the spinner and the spun. We are creating our reality, but we think we are not. Therefore, we are not in control of the reality we create. Our ignorance has handed that power to anyone who can indoctrinate our belief in what is real. We create our reality in the sense that our subconscious manifests the thought fields that the conscious mind then decodes into holographic 3-D illusions. But the control of those illusions comes from the subconscious beliefs that create the thought fields the conscious mind decodes into its daily experience. The Illuminati and their other-dimensional masters know that if they can programme our subconscious beliefs they will be controlling our five-sense illusion. That's the level at which the game is played and everything else is manifested from that. The loss of this knowledge has led to a process of perpetual self-delusion that I call \"combing. the mirror\" (Figure We first accept that the world we think we see around us is real and we also believe that this five-sense level of being is who we are. Already the prison door is creaking shut. This delusion leads to the belief that if this world is real and we are expressions of this world it follows that we must change the five-sense world for our experience to change. Clunk! Gotcha! Now turn the key before they suss they've been had. The five-sense reality is an illusion created by our beliefs. If we don't change our beliefs we cannot change the experience. That's impossible because one is the manifestation of the other. We can run around in the five-sense reality all we like, campaigning and complaining, moaning and groaning about the state of our lives, but nothing will change. It can't. To transform our reality we need to transform our. sense of reality because one comes from the other. When we look in the mirror and we don't like our hair style do we try to change it by combing the mirror? No, we comb our hair and the mirror reflects that. Silly Is it may seem to comb a mirror to change your hair, that is what the human race is doing. It looks through its eyes at a holographic reflection, a mirror of its subconscious sense of reality, and tries to change what it doesn't like by combing the mirror - seeking to change the five-sense illusion within the five-sense illusion. To change a reflection we need to change what is being reflected - our programmed sense of what is real. Believe small and you will reflect small. Believe no power and you will reflect no power. Believe can't and you will reflect can't. And vice-versa. Billions are spending their lives thrashing around in a reflection and getting more and more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated that nothing is changing and things. ~He. only getting worse. But of course nothing is changing as they would wish. How can it? It's getting worse because the more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated people become at aimlessly thrashing around in a reflection, while thinking it's real, the more their mental and emotional state \"gets worse\" and must reflect in the mirror as their world \"gets worse\". It is a vicious circle that can only be broken when we realise that five-sense reality is an il.1usion and we are creating it. We can have a five-sense illusion that is a prison because inner prisons must become outer prisons; or we can have an illusion that is a paradise. It's our choice, our decision, but whatever we choose, the five-sense 'world' will still be an illusion, a reflection. Nailing the norms We are creating our own universe, one unique to us. The more you redefine your reality in relation to the consensus the more you will 'stand out' from the crowd and be that nail above the rest. The reason the Illuminati seek to pound such people back into the pack is that they threaten to undermine the very consensus reality on which the Matrix depends. They show there is more than one possible reality. Visionaries are dangerous people to the Illuminati and they want rid of them. A maverick is a demon to a manipulator of consensus reality. The world needs a global outbreak of the STARS virus - the Sudden Tendency to Altar Reality Syndrome. We need mavericks acting with spontaneity and freedom of thought and lifestyle, and encompassing only those current 'norms' that respect freedom not servitude."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 270 The further you remove yourself from the collective norms the more you remove the chains of collective reality and the Matrix. Whenever we are told to do or believe something, no matter how mundane, it is worth considering: \"Oh yeah, who decided that?\" The answer will almost always be: \"I dunno.\" Why are we being dictated to by 'norms', the origin of which we cannot even locate? But we do it all the time. Then there is the next point: \"Why should I do or believe that?\" For what reason should I follow this norm? The answer hew will invariably be something like: \"That's what you have to do, everyone does it\". That's what I have to do? Who says so?

The norm for norms is that normally they turn out to be baloney. A few examples: Norm: Homosexuality is wrong or at least should not be talked about. It's unnatural. Baloney: No matter what the shape of your body we can only express love for ourselves because all is One. \"I will only love myself if the other part of me I am loving is in a different body to the one I am in.\" Ugh??? Crazy, but that is what the 'norm' is saying. Even if the homosexual relationship is purely for lust and sex, so what? The body is a hologram, it's not real. Enjoy the illusion, but know that's what it is and the illusion cannot control you. What can be 'natural' or 'unnatural' in an illusion? It is a matter of free choice and that also includes the freedom not to participate. Norm: Sex should only happen between a man and a woman in a stable relationship and anything beyond the missionary. position is \"kinky\" and \"disgusting\". Baloney: Who decided that? 'Who imposed this blueprint on what is 'normal'? How dare anyone dictate to others what they will not derive pleasure from so long as everyone involved is agreed? No, no, you must only enjoy your illusory hologram in ways that we decide is \"moral\", otherwise we shall condemn you (while wishing we could do the same). I'll do you a deal. I won't tell you what to do with your computer or your money if you don't tell me what to do with my willy (not that I do much these days, as I was telling the Viagra salesman). Norm: You must never take drugs. Baloney: As always with norms everything is black and white. Are there drugs to be avoided? Of course there are. But there are others taken in the right environment with experienced people that can take you into wonderland and show you the illusion of the world you think you live in. Funny how these are often the substances targeted by the authorities. The trick is to access the natural ability to go into other realities without drugs, but used sensibly they can be a step on the road. Why, if drugs are bad for you, are we encouraged to take them like ~andy when they are dispensed by doctors on behalf of the Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel? Those drugs serve the agenda while those revealing the illusion do not, simple as that. It is not that drugs are good or bad, right or wrong, it is what drug s and in what circumstances. Norm: You must never break the law. Baloney: First of all there are so many laws, and increasing by the day, that it is impossible not to break them all the time. Do you always keep to the speed limit and always remember to wear a seat belt? No? You are a law breaker then. Shame on you, I'll call the police. What are laws anyway? They are passed by elected or unelected dictatorships with the people affected by the laws, having no say in them what so ever? If the people then insist that you must obey the law no matter what the circumstances, they are accepting a perpetual state of tyrannical control. If a law was passed that all our children had to be given to the government would we obey it? No, we'd collectively defy it. So why don't we do the same with other laws that impose the dictatorship? We have forgotten the power of unity. If everyone charged with an offence recorded by a traffic camera refused to pay the fine, the system would collapse. If we don't collectively defy the laws designed to impose the global fascist state, we will all live in a global· fascist state. Hardly rocket science is it? This one 'norm' alone - \"you must never break the law\" - is enough to condemn the world to dictatorship by the few, never mind all the others. We need to demand that every 'norm' of consensus reality prove itself to be an instrument of fairness and freedom. If they do not then why should we be ruled by them? It is a norm that our children are vaccinated when this is actually waging war on their immune system. It is a norm that children must get a 'good education' when that is Newspeak for a good indoctrination of consensus reality. One after another these norms collapse when the scales are peeled from our eyes. It is vital that we keep asking ourselves: is this my reality I am accepting here or is it externally implanted because I am conceding my uniqueness to norms and indoctrination? The following is an excellent symbolic story of the way the 'norms' become accepted without question or even the knowledge of where they came from. It was sent to me by someone through my website. Start with a cage containing five monkeys. Inside the cage, hang a banana on a string and place a set of stairs under it. Before long, a monkey will go to the stairs and start to climb towards the banana. As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the other monkeys with cold water."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 272 After a while, another monkey makes an attempt with the same result all the other monkeys are sprayed with cold water. Pretty soon, when a monkey tries to climb the stairs, the other monkeys will try to prevent it. Now, put away the cold water. Remove one monkey from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new monkey sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his surprise and horror, all of the other monkeys attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted. Next, remove another of the original five monkeys and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm! Likewise, replace a third original monkey with a new one, then a fourth, then the fifth. Every time the newest monkey takes to the stairs, he is attacked. Most of the monkeys that are beating him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs or why they are participating in the beating of the newest monkey. After replacing all the original monkeys, none- of the remaining monkeys have ever been sprayed with cold water. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approaches the stairs to try for the banana. Why not? Because as far as they know that's the way it's always been done! Wilson Bryan Key put it well when he wrote: \"Programmed from infancy with basic assumptions, unconsciously supported ideas are usually taken for granted: When assumptions surface they should always be questioned.\" l Assumptions instant reactions from conditioned belief - are the very building blocks of imprisoned reality. What is this 'normal' anyway? Who defies it and on what basis? What is normal to one will not be normal to another. What is genius to one will be insanity to another. 'Norms' are only beliefs that have solidified through repetition into unquestioned acceptance. We should let these rule our lives? Mum's the word The Thought Police have a vast army of allies with which to programme and control the global population. 'They are called the global population. Consensus reality is so all pervading in the minds of the masses that they are deluded into policing their own prison, and people conform to the manufactured consensus because they fear the consequences of being different. They might ask themselves a rather important question given the circumstances now before us. Are they more fearful of the consequences of being different or those of living in a global fascist state? It is no exaggeration to say that this is the choice we are facing because the latter is where the consensus reality is leading us so fast. If we are not to travel that road we must disconnect ourselves from the reality that is taking us there. That means expressing our own uniqueness and refusing to be battered into conforming to another's version of what we should be. The fear of expressing our uniqueness of view and lifestyle is generated from the fear of what other people think: our mothers, fathers, friends, neighbours and workmates. If you are in the public eye there is the added fear of mass ridicule and what the media will say about you. But I went through all this in the early 1990s and I am still here, stronger than ever. There is nothing that we cannot achieve if we decide that nothing will stop us. So some brain-doner journalist writes that I am mad. So some brain-doner reader believes it and laughs at me in the street. So? It only matters if it is my reality that it matters and it is not. Sod 'em, who cares? I am me, I am free. Families, friends, neighbours and workmates often serve and police the mindprison and we need to stop conceding our uniqueness to these people. I can understand how difficult it is to do things that are at odds with the consensus reality and the norms as perceived by parents etc. We don't want to see them upset and we would like them to be proud of us. Or at least most people would. But hold on here. Parents may choose to provide the apparent vehicle for us to experience this illusion, but they do not have the right to be lifelong mind programmers an~, dictators to their offspring. Their 'children' are the same Oneness that they are. Parents and children are illusory states of the same One consciousness and each have an equal right to express themselves. There needs to be guardianship and basic guidance in childhood, but that is different from an imposition of belief. Many parents police their children mercilessly and insist they conform to the consensus reality that their own parents conditioned them !p believe in. This has to stop if we are to walk the path of freedom. If parents want to believe in consensus reality, that's fine and proper, and their rightful"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 273 choice. But once they seek to manipulate their children to do the same they become unknowing agents of the Matrix: \"Your mother is so upset you want to live in a commune. Her heart was set on you being a banker/doctor/lawyer. I don't know if she'll ever get over this.\" Really? Well tell her to try. How come I didn't get upset because she wasn't a striptease artist? I set my heart on that. As always in this illusion of duality there are two points of osculation here, the imposer and the imposed. Both are responsible for the suppression- of uniqueness and freedom of thought. Anyone who seeks to impose their reality on another by whatever means is a psychological fascist and servant of th~ Matrix, but so is anyone who concedes their uniqueness to such imposition. Step one on the road to freedom from control is to refuse to have another tell you what to think and do with your life. If they don't like our choice they can do the other thing. It doesn't matter what your parents or your friends and associates say about your choices. What matters is that you are you and not what someone else is telling you to be. Why should we concern ourselves with the reactions of those who don't even respect our right to be who we are? I don't care what my children do with their lives, as long as it is what they truly want to do and they respect the freedom of others to do the same. It is their choice, not mine. If we focussed on not allowing others to impose their will on us and not imposing ours on others, the difference to our lives and the world would be fantastic. So much human potential is locked away behind the barrier marked: \"What would people say if I said or did this?\" Let it go and let it flow. Just do it!!! Yes, you might see old 'friends' drift away and a whole host of new ones appear. So? Great. Master of illusion An illusion can only control you when you think it is real. Once you recognise that your five-sense reality is an illusion it immediately loses so much of its power over you. You still hurt your toe if you bang it on the table leg even though the table and your toe are only holograms. To know intellectually it is an illusion is not to know it on a level deep enough to disconnect you from it and there is still the consensus reality, the collective mind, broadcasting the belief that it is real. You can also still get pulled into Matrix thought and reactions after you have recognised the illusion. I have heard this called \"having a 3-D moment\". \"How dare you say that tome? ... I'm going to ... \" Stop!! Deep breath. Three-D moment. It's an illusion remember? Yeah, shit, what was I thinking? OK, I'm fine again now. Phew! Naturally this happens as you begin to unplug, but the control the Matrix has over you starts to diminish. I have found that if you keep telling yourself it is all an illusion, a dream world, you begin to 'see' that fact with ever increasing clarity. Another thing I have found interesting is to be consciously aware that you are seeing from your brain and not your eyes. It is a case of recognising that what you think you are seeing is happening in the visual cortex in the brain and not in your eyes. I don't know what others may experience when they do this, but the world seems very different to me. As the process of unplugging continues, things that mattered to you before become less important and your outlook on life and yourself starts to transform. You become more tolerant of yourself and others. When you see it's an illusion and we are all the same Oneness creating our experience, what is there to get worked up about? The only time I am interested in what other people do is when they are imposing their will on others, as the Illuminati are on the rest of us. Short of that what people do is entirely up to them and it's none of my business. Your attitudes to everything change once the recognition of the illusion goes deeper and deeper and you start to be that awareness rather than just intellectually accept its existence. Don't think it, know it. Don't try to do it, just do it. These are very different states of being; When, you become more consciously aware of the illusion, you can begin to enjoy it without it all the hang ups .that imprison us when we think it is real. We can have fun and \"express our desires, as long as they don't impinge on the freedom of others. My outlook is that I will try anything I fancy and if I don't like it I won't do it again. If I do like it I will do it as often as I like. The Matrix illusion uses fear and guilt to hold us in its grasp, If we have an experience we don't like or wish we had not done, the guilt and trauma can stay with us for a lifetime effecting our every reaction. But when you know that our 3-D experiences takes place in a dream world, their effect is far less profound. Are we effected for a lifetime by the experiences we have in our nightly dreams? We might wake up feeling fearful and shocked n<?w and again because the dream seemed so real, but soon the feeling is gone and we can even laugh about it. \"It was only a dream\", we say. Yes, and so is this, albeit a lucid one. The only difference is that we are conditioned to believe that this dream is real and its effect upon us is compounded a trillion times. We can remove its control by not only seeing, but"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 274 living the fact that this is only a dream that we are creating. 'Death' is only the awakening from a dream and nothing to fear. Seeing through the mirror When we observe our daily experience we are looking at a mirror of ourselves. It is a mirror of our belief in what is real. It's no good us blaming anyone else for what we don't like in our lives, the responsibility is ours. Taking that responsibility and ceasing to blame others - or ourselves come to that - is to take a massive step on the freedom road. The power the Illuminati use to control and manipulate us is only the power we give away to them and others every day. The most destructive expression of this is blaming others for our plight. To do that is to accept that others have power over our lives and the reality we create. In truth, only we have that power if we choose to use it; but if we believe that others are in control of our destiny we., will create that reality. The Illuminati are not the only ones responsible for the world as it is. How could they be? There are only a relative handful of them working in awareness of the goal. A few manipulate and billions allow themselves to be manipulated. Where does the real responsibility lie? We can't be controlled unless we allow ourselves to be and, crucially, insist that others do the same. Divide and rule is the bottom line of all dictatorships and th~ human race has conceded to that on a mega scale. Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right against Left, in the way the Matrix must operate to maintain its control by duality and division. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusory fault lines. We are all One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab and vice versa. They are both expressions of the One and need to be observed and treated the same, none more or less important than the other. I refuse to see black people in terms that I would not see white, nor to see the 'Left' as I would not see the 'Right'. How could it be any different, except when we believe the illusion of division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us. It promotes the illusion of division and duality and if we accept that, the trap is triggered. There is no way out 'of an' illusion based on division if we buy the belief that the division is real. Ditching doublethink Everyone else's freedom is our freedom. If one person does not enjoy the freedom of all others then none are free. Once again, how can they be? A little bit of freedom is no freedom. This is a simple truth that the robot radicals of the Left and the robot righteous at the other polarity cannot seem to grasp. Freedom of speech is not only the freedom for others to say what is acceptable to us. That is tyranny. It is the freedom to express your thoughts, no matter how much we may not agree with !hem. A truly free society (and those who believe in freedom rather than using it as· a weapon of coercion) would campaign as fiercely for the freedom of people with whom they disagree as they would for those they support. But what happens? The opposite. The leadership, and I emphasise the leadership, of the British and Canadian Green Parties have campaigned to stop me speaking in public. The British Green Party banned me from speaking at their conference years ago, despite an invitation from members, because I was saying things about reality and the nature of life that they thought would lead to them being ridiculed. The 'Anti-Nazi' League in Britain organised protests at some of my events years ago when, ironically, I have been warning of the rise of the Fourth Reich (or the overt re-emergence of the Third) since the early 1990s. Yet ask any of these people what they think about freedom of expression and they will say it is a fundamental human right. What an example of Orwell's doublethink, the ability to hold two contradictory views and believe both to be true. It is possible to encompass the apparent paradoxes of life in that the same event can look very different from different points of observation and all can be true from the perspective of the observer. But that is not the same as doublethink. Either you believe in freedom of speech or you don't. Freedom of speech for one, but suppression for those you don't like is not freedom of speech. Anyone who seeks to prevent the free expression of thought by anyone else is an agent of control and they should know that before their self-delusion leads to the very fascist Orwellian state they claim to oppose. Orwell must be squirming at the antics of those people. We need to start focussing on the right to freedom' of expression because what is happening - and what the robot radicals are seeking to enforce - is the same as what occurred in Nazi Germany. Books unacceptable to the Nazi Party were banned and burned; those who tried to speak out against the Nazis had their public meetings banned or disrupted; others were jailed and killed for their views. This is happening today and the robot radicals are often the vehicle through which it is done. Some home truths for these deluded people: if"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 275 it is OK to talk about Arab or Islamic extremism and terrorism it must be OK to talk about Jewish extremism and terrorism. If it is not we do not live in a free and fair society. If it is OK to say that the official version of history is true, it must be OK to say the official version is not true. If it is not we do not live in a free and fair society. If what the alternative history claims is not correct then the evidence produced by official history will demolish it. So what's the problem? It is not a matter of agreeing or not agreeing; it is about the right to express ones thoughts like everyone else. Once that freedom is curtailed all freedoms are-doomed. How is it possible to have a free debate or come to informed conclusions when one view is constantly emphasised and another suppressed? The depths of immaturity beggar belief. But the robot radicals are far more obsessed with posturing their own self-righteousness and self-purity - ,\"Look at me, I'm anti-Nazi and anti-racist, I'm such a good person\" - than ever they are at promoting or defending freedom for all. Doublethink, doublethink, doublethink. It is terminal (for freedom) self-indulgence. I hear people ask about those who would use their freedom of speech to call for violence against others or encourage sexual acts with children. But wouldn't you rather have such people in the open where they can be seen and identified than have them doing exactly the same in secret? Why is it fine for George Bush, Tony Blair and Co to call by the hour for violence against Iraq, Afghanistan and a long list of others to come, and yet it is not fine for others to do the same on a much lesser scale of potential slaughter? It is doublethink and double standards. If one is illegal, so should be the other, or rather t' other way round. If someone is calling for violence against others or the abuse of children I want to know about it, not have it go on behind the scenes unexposed where nothing can be done. This is what happens when you suppress freedom of expression, you push it underground where it festers and often prospers beyond our awareness. Let's have it out in the open where we can deal with it and know what we are dealing with. If you see someone supporting sex with children, you know to keep your children well away from him. If such views cannot be expressed how would you know to protect your kids from him or her? Laws to defend freedom, the freedom not to be murdered, abused and subjected to violence etc., are one thing. Laws to curtail freedom of expression are quite another. We only need one 'law': do what you like, but don't do it by removing the freedom of others. If you think about it, no other law is necessary and it can be filed under a simple heading - the Law of Respect. To purge ourselves of the Matrix mentality we need to be aware of our own doublethink. This is almost a barometer of our sense of disconnection because the more we become aware of reality the less doublethink we manifest. Doublethink is largely the product of prejudice and rigid belief because this colours our judgement of everything. When America attacks another country in the name of liberation while killing thousands of civilians and wreaking utter devastation, the acceptance that \"liberation\" and \"mass slaughter\" can both be true comes from (a) the bias most Americans have towards America and (b) the belief that their nation is the global home of freedom and justice. Once you see everything as One, there is no 'America' or 'Iraq' and there. is no bias to one or the other. Your only measurement is freedom, fairness and justice for all in any given circumstances. You can see how the politicians prepare the people to encompass the doublethink. George Bush's speechwriters have had him say: \"See, we love - we love freedom. That's what they didn't understand. They hate things; we love things. They act out of hatred; we don't seek revenge: we seek justice out of' love . \"You need to tell your loved ones, the little ones in particular, that when they hear the president talking about al-Qaeda , Iraq and other places, I do so because I long for peace. \"I want to send the signal to our enemy that you have aroused a compassionate and decent and mighty nation, and we're going to hunt you down.\" Orwell could have written that. Such nonsense is designed to prepare the people to accept the doublethink: love is killing; mass murder of the innocent is not revenge, it is justice and love; endless war is a longing for peace. The reference to a \"compassionate and decent and mighty nation\" is there to make the people feel good about themselves and \"mighty\" through the weapons of destruction wielded by the troops that will kill thousands in their name. It is the old John Wayne mentality that is leading vast tracts of the American psyche like a lamb to the slaughter house. The doublethink trap is to give the people the choice between the belief they are loving, compassionate, decent and mighty or that their government is guilty of mass murder and imperial conquest. They want to believe the first is true, but they are faced with the fact that their troops have invaded another nation and are killing its civilians (although the scale of this is suppressed). To square"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 276 the circle they resort to self and collective dishonesty, accept the doublethink, and believe that both contradictory beliefs are true. This is the way doublethink prospers and the antidote is to free ourselves of bias and beliefs set in concrete. We are not Americans or British, Israeli or Iraqi, we are the One. These labels are illusions and why should we be biased in our perception of fairness and justice by favouring one expression of the One against another? The murder of a child in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Palestine is no more or less important than the murder of a child in New York or Tel Aviv. We are in this together and we need to grow up and realise we are all the same. United States of Amnesia  The United States is the spiritual home of doublethink and self-deception. It is an Orwellian society that thinks it is the freest country in the world and has the right to impose the same Orwellian 'freedom' on everyone else. Individually they are overwhelmingly lovely people, but, as I have said before, there is a level of the American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. Or, as Tom Foley, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, put it: \"Individually, we are reasonably modest, but collectively, we have been told again and again that we are the greatest thing in the history of the world.\"2 The former head of the CIA, Admiral Stansfield Turner, said that if anyone says the United States is not fit to be an imperial power the burden is on them to say why. Well, as this book has shown, that doesn't take long. His reasons for why the US is fit to run an empire are revealing of the American collective psyche. They \"won\" the Cold War (what has that got to do with it?); they are the most democratic country in the world (with an unelected president); they are the best 'example of \"free enterprise\" (controlled by a cartel of corporations that destroy free enterprise across the globe); and the world needs a leader and no one else can do it (it doesn't).3 Turner conceded that America knew little about the world it was intending to \"lead\" (control), but \"we believe ours is the right way\".4 His words betray an arrogance and ignorance (the two invariably go together) that you find with Bush-supporting Americans. One lady, Bea Kristol from Washington, was interviewed by the UK Daily Telegraph about American imperialism and was puzzled and shocked by the very suggestion: \"But the word 'imperial' implies that there is something in it for America.\" 5 Yep, she really said that and no doubt believed it. Taking over Iraqi oil and handing out fantastic contracts to US companies to rebuild what the US invasion had destroyed does not imply there is something in it for America even on that level? Doublethink. Robert Joss, the Dean of Stanford Business School, said that Americans (though not all by any means) genuinely feel they are \"trying to bring goodness to everybody else\".6 Tom Foley said Americans had a \"very pervasive notion of our good intentions\". This led to an assumption that \"any sort of objective examination of the United States must result in approval, if not vigorous. applause\".? Michael Ignatieff, director of the Carr centre in the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, gave this excellent summary of why Americans are so easy to manipulate: \"There is nothing more frightening than American innocence. It's a fearsome, sometimes murderous innocence. Our inability to question our own motives is truly alarming.\" 8 Failing to question motives is essential to doublethink. Ignatieff said that America was controlled by an ideology, \"but like all ideologies, it doesn't believe it is one. It just believes that it is the Truth.\" 9 America's ideology believes it is fine to spend hundreds of billions a year on weapons of mass destruction while 43 million Americans can't afford health insurance. Doublethink again. But Orwellian mind-control in America is so powerful and all-pervading that you can understand how this mentality is formed. Schoolchildren are told every day to face the US flag and say: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America ... one nation under God, indivisible and with liberty and justice for all. \"I have my three-year-olds doing it\", said Teresa ~. West, head teacher of the Glen Forest elementary school in Falls Church, Virginia. to Wanda Nelson, deputy head of Lake Anne School-in Reston, said: \"We do it at 8.25 every morning. If one of the children comes late with their parents and the pledge is announced over the loudspeakers, they stop dead in their tracks and say it right there, children and parents alike.\" 11 When she was told that we don't even have flags in British schools, she was shocked. \"You have no flags? How on earth do you engender patriotism?\" What she can't seem to grasp is that patriotism should not need to be engendered. Only false, blind, patriotism needs that. It should come without pressure from a pride in the decency and sense of justice a country truly stands for and not through the brainwashing of a lie. One British couple who moved to the US told the Daily Telegraph that only a month at an American school their children were coming home singing patriotic songs. America is the world's most mind-controlled nation (together with Israel) and has long lost the ability to collectively think straight. So it doublethinks - or"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 277 doesn't think at all. Anila Daulatzai, a young American of Afghan parents, was invited to teach a class about Afghanistan and she asked the students if they would like to know more about Afghanistan (who the US was bombing at the time) and Pakistan. Most said they didn't have the time. Anila went on: \"Almost 60 per cent of the class were white American males who wanted to serve in the US government ... I suggested that we might take a more critical look at the nature of the US involvement in that area. How they built up the Taliban to fight against the Soviet Union. How they had used Osama bin Laden in that effort. How they had built up Saddam, used him and then turned against him as the evil one. I said those things in a very neutral way - and I did know something about the area, because I spent a long time working in refugee camps there. \"It didn't make any difference. Students started raising their hands and saying: 'I don't agree with what you're saying'; 'America is the greatest place on Earth'; 'If you don't like it here, go back to where you came from'. I pointed out that I was born up the street; that I had thought the point o(an academic institution was to debate issues in a courteous way and that we were not on a Fourth of July parade in a bar. This, I'm afraid, is an ignorant and arrogant nation.\" 12 All these reactions are straight from the pages of 1984. I have been saying for some years that the United States was created as a mind-control experiment, ultimately controlled from Europe and it is clearly working. It is because the people see everything as 'parts', like 'Americans' and 'Afghans' or 'Iraqis' that the attitudes expressed above are possible. Only with an understanding of Oneness can the conflict and injustice wane. Fortunately there are tens of millions of Americans and growing - who do not fall for the doublethink promoted by their government and it is through them that the change is coming. Hypocritic oaths It is worth being aware of our responses to people and events and to constantly scan our views for doublethink, as well as the statements of the politicians and manipulators. This is especially the case with those who hold strong political or religious views. They are fodder for doublethink. Christian doublethinkers support war and ask God to bless the troops doing the killing while claiming to serve Jesus, the \"Prince of Peace\". Religion and politics are the headquarters of doublethink. Over thousands of years, religion has brilliantly served the structure for human control. They have indoctrinated the populous with prison-of-the-mind belief systems that should never be questioned. They have imposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination, isolation and the attempted genocide of non-believers. They. have fought each other. for dominance of the human mind, producing an explosion of opportunity for the Illuminati to divide and rule for millennia. The major religions have their origin in the very region of the world, the Near and Middle East, from whence so much of the Illuminati network emerged. More coincidence? Not a chance. Religions are creations of dualism and division. They promote the dualities of good and evil, God and the people, and while they say \"God is everywhere\", what are really saying is that 'He' is only interested in an exclusive contract based on believing what the men-in-frocks tell you to believe. They say they support \"right\" against \"wrong\", but then, when it suits them, they decide that 'right' and \"wrong\" are the same. They quote Jesus as saying \"turn the other cheek\", but then back wars of conquest, murder and robbery. Again, here is the prejudice necessary for doublethink. These are wars against Muslim countries, the non-believers, and surely this is a case of onward Christian soldiers? The war is serving the desires of 'Jesus', this doublethink goes, because it is ridding the world of a religion that is in competition with their own corporate brand. Also the US president is a Satanic ... er, sorry, Christian, believer and he is serving the cause of Jesus. Extreme Islamic fanatics (far fewer in number than the propaganda claims), believe that they need to rid the world of the Christian and Jewish non-believers and they support violence against them in the name of serving the cause of their religion. Round and round and round. Former House of Representatives Speaker, Tom Foley, talked of the power that religion has over the American mind: \"We are not a nation which prays in the closet. We expect the President to be our principle preacher; to express constantly the idea that God has showered us with special blessings and that we, therefore; have a special identity, a special mission in the world. It is a mission which is realised in part by just being who we are, but which also requires us to encourage others to be just like us.\" 13 "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 278 This \"encouragement\" includes dropping bombs on people. Hey, that'll make them more like us. They have been \"saved!!\" Hallelujah, praise the Lord. There are\" many Christians, Muslims and Jews who do not fall for the doublethink because they either have the intelligence to see through it and/ or they express the peaceful and compassionate versions of their faith. However, when you concede your Oneness and infinite possibility to a desperately limited religious belief (as they all-are) you are thinking duality and limitation, the mentality of the Matrix, and there is no way home until its victims free themselves from those clerical clutches. Watching the words There is a simple 'rule' for seeing through the Newspeak and doublethink of politicians and their ilk. It is this: whatever they say they mean the opposite; whatever they claim, the opposite is true. \"Will\" means \"won't\" and \"won't\" means \"will\"; ~'I do\" means\"1 don't\" and \"1 don't\" means \"1 do\"; \"1 believe in peace\" means \"1 believe in war\"; \"It has not been decided\" means that it has; \"It has been decided\" means that it hasn't; \"Conflict is not inevitable\" means that it is; \" So and so country is dangerous to the world\" means it is no threat to anyone; \"I never had sexual relations with that woman\" means ... well, you know what it means. The Illuminati have an entire spoken and symbolic language on meaning reversal. Writer Michael Ellner described the society that such reversal creates: \"Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality.\" Watch the political and military leaders and you will realise that seeing through them really is very straightforward. Most of the time there is no need even to read between the lines; just reverse the apparent meaning of the statement. If we observe the 'news' programmes and political outpourings of propaganda from this perspective these one-time instruments of persuasion are immediately neutered. When you use this technique it can be frustrating to see the scale of the daily lies that people like Bush, Blair and their cronies are prepared to tell, but it can also be funny because they're pathetic really. Most importantly, by reversing their statements they are telling you what they are planning to do or what they are saying really means. Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, said that the latest superstate constitution of the European Union\" does not significantly change the relationship between the EU and its member sovereign nations\". Once more the reverse is true. George Bush said the government \"has taken unprecedented measures to defend our homeland and, more importantly, we will continue to hunt the enemy down before he can strike\". This means they have taken unprecedented measures to impose control of American citizens and will continue to invade and conquer any country they choose even though that country has not attacked anyone\". The principle of meaning reversal and non-specific blandness applies to all Newspeak. Reverse the apparent meaning and you see the real meaning. Remember, too, that the line pushed by the mainstream media about a person or event has originated almost every time from governments and their spinners and is aimed at getting you to accept their version of the story. Political incorrectness The other point with regard to language is simply to defend it from extinction as we know it. We need to ensure that Oldspeak is not replaced inexorably by the smoke and-mirrors of Newspeak that already comprises today's political vocabulary. This means using the language and refusing to bow to the Gulag agents of political correctness or 'PC'. \"You can't use those words\" = you watch me, darlin'. If we refuse to use the ludicrous language of the PC Plods (oops, reference to the policeman in the Noddy children's stories with its character called 'Big Ears' that might be seen as a slight against those with vertically endowed hearing devices). I'll try again. If we refuse to use the ludicrous language of the PC Plods there is nothing they can do, just as if everyone refused to pay street parking' fines, the system would collapse. The destruction of specifics in language, the crucial specifics necessary to articulate free thought, is only possible if we accede to it.

I have a large plunger in my hand and I wonder what the term is for where I am going to shove it. More escapology As we have seen, our minds are being assaulted with subliminals to programme. our reality. But research has found that even if you can't actually see subliminal messages their effectiveness is dramatically reduced when you are aware they are there. It is worth noting to yourself when you read a paper or magazine, watch television or even walk down the street that you know you are receiving subliminal and symbolic messages, but you reject them. You can consciously place mental barriers in your subconscious by visualising a shield, or whatever form you want the barrier to take, blocking the subliminals. Visualisation is simply a way of focussing the mind on what\" you wish to repel and you can then do so without needing to constantly think about it. You are using the power of your mind to block the influence of the subliminals, which depend on people being unaware of them. Bringing the hidden into conscious awareness dilutes its power, as, again, we can see with the example of the 'sex' in the picture of the plants. Awareness is the key. Subliminal techniques are the exploitation of human denial. We don't see what our denial does not want to see. For this and other reasons it is good to be honest about what we are denying about ourselves. We are all in denial of something and while it is there it eats away at us affecting us mentally and emotionally from beyond the conscious threshold. We are what we are, all glorious expressions of th~ same Infinite One. What are you hiding from yourself about yourself? What am I? True freedom demands that we find out, be honest with ourselves, and let the denial go. With the denial eliminated, often the desire also goes. I have a fetish for being whipped with a garden hose. There, said it, it's out now, I feel so much better. Actually, that's not true (it's really a rubber thong). No, no, shut up Icke, while you're still ahead. The point is though, that if I did get a thrill, from a garden hose, so the hell what? Would I be hurting anyone, other than myself, by free choice? Would it mean I was a bad person or my work would be less credible? No, it would not. Then, why the denial? Answer: \"The fear of what others would think\" - the bottom line reason for denial of self. This does not only apply to sexual themes. People deny that they are frightened or lack confidence and they erect 'front personalities' that appear to exude courage and self esteem, to hide the reality of how they really feel. These hidden insecurities can then be exploited. There is nothing wrong with feeling fear or lacking self esteem. They are potential manifestations of the One, when in a state of illusory disconnection. Face them and they can be dealt with. Deny them and you give them power over you and your ability to see through the illusion. We cannot be honest with others until we are honest with ourselves and it is our lack of self-honesty that the manipulators so exploit. You're a failure? Oh yeah? Who says? Insecurity is one of the manipulators' prime weapons. They give us 'role models' in every walk of life to whom we are supposed to aspire and against whom we are encouraged to judge our own 'success'. Ladies, look at these rich and famous actresses and models, aren't they just sensational? Oops, you don't look like them do you? What a shame. But don't despair. Buy our creams, hairspray and plastic surgery and you, too, could be beautiful just like Julia. Hey, guys, do you want to be attractive to women like Brad? Well just give us a credit card number and we'll change the shape of that terrible nose or fill your penis with fat to make women swoon. You, too, could be like Arnie Schwarzenegger. Go on, you know you want to; that's how real men should be. (What, muscle bound with only one expression??) We are also encouraged to identify with a group to ensnare us in the herd mentality. Americans are told to feel proud about the 'victories' of their military, even though they do not get within thousands of miles of a bullet being fired.

Among the main ways we are held in the illusion, the headlights of the five-senses, is by focussing our minds 24/7 on materialism. That is not say it is 'spiritual' to be poor and live in a dump; that's equally silly. It is not the material objects in themselves that are the trap. They are only holographic illusions anyway. It is to see them as the goal, the symbols of success that confirm we have, or have not, 'made it'.

There is nothing wrong with any of these sensations (mine's a glass of red wine and a record by Queen), but the five-sense trap is to believe that this is all there. is. To hold us in the illusion the symbols of success are all related to the five-senses and this is where insecurity comes in. Most people don't find their sense of security, self-esteem and 'success' from within themselves. They look to others to tell them or confirm they are 'successful' and 'doing well'. To elicit this reaction they have to 'succeed' in the terms the people around them have been conditioned to perceive as success - big car, big house, lots of money in the bank. This is the whole basis of the' American: Dream' that has held that nation's collective mind in slavery for centuries. When you don't 'succeed' in these terms (and the vast majority can't because the system is rigged for the few) they are considered, and often consider themselves, a failure. This lack of self-esteem can then be further exploited and the 'losers' are held up as an example of what happens if you don't keep chasing the 'dream'. The whole insane system depends in its entirety on consumption and the constant expansion of consumption; people are pressured and enticed to consume more with every year and to consider the amount they consume as a measurement of their 'success'. The obsession to 'succeed' in this way leads to people borrowing more and more money to provide the trinkets that display their alleged 'success' while they spend their lives in perpetual terror of not being able to meet the repayments. Every year the merry-go-round gets faster and faster and faster and faster and faster, faster, faster, faster, stress, ulcer, heart attack, faster, faster, faster ... Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! That is success?? Illluuuuuuuuuuuuuusion Money and fame do not happiness make. That is not to say there is anything wrong in itself to have money and be Jell known. It's just an experience. But it is not the key to the door marked happiness, contentment and fulfilment. It is certainly not a ticket to a Oneness concert. Whether you are Brad Pitt or Ethel next door, the road home lies within not without. We will travel home in a new reality, not a new. Ferrari. I have come across a lot of rich and famous people in my life and I have not met many who were happy, contented and fulfilled, especially when they stopped and looked back at their lives and asked what it was all for. Often they get so absorbed in pursuing the material 'dream' they can't see the twigs, never mind the forest. Little matters like love, happiness, contentment, relationships, who the~ are and what they are doing here, are lost in: a blur of daily activity chasing the rabbit in the top hat. They become human doings, not beings. They exist rather than live because they have forgotten what living is. Ironically, by withdrawing from the five-sense obsession with possession and remembering who we are, we can give ourselves the power to manifest whatever we want. The five-sense world is an illusion, the creation of our minds, and that inc1uqes wealth and poverty and all in between. A Ferrari is a thought field, so why can't it be yours if that is what you want? It can, but only if you become deeply connected to the process of holographic manifestation that you can consciously create whatever you desire. Once you know the material trinkets are illusions and symbols of nothing but manifested thought, they lose their control over us; we can enjoy them, if that is what we choose to do. When we know the illusion is not real we control the illusion, not the other way round. We live life instead of life living us. OK, time for a break. Now, where's that garden hose? Paaaam, I'm ready!!

Albert Einstein In the first Matrix movie, Neo (\"The One\"), overcame' death' and transformed his awareness beyond the illusion in a hotel called the 'Heart 0' the City'. This was clearly no coincidence in such a symbolic production. It is through the heart that we connect with the Oneness of all and see through the veil of illusion, the veil of fears. I talk about us being disconnected from Oneness, but I only use that term to keep it simple. In fact we are not disconnected at all. We can't be because the Oh-e is always the One. To put it more accurately, we have fallen for the illusion of disconnection, duality and polarity, and as such we create the holographic appearance of disconnection. We do not need to be reconnected, we simply have to realise that we were never disconnected. The sense of division is an indoctrinated illusion. The apparent experience of disconnection comes when we close our heart chakra, our direct link to Oneness, and become mesmerised by the illusory world of the 'head', the mind. The heart chakra or vortex is the balance point for the other six major chakras and that is an expression of Oneness: the balance of all (Figure 64, overleaf)· That is what 'love' is: the balance of all. Balance - Oneness in awareness of itself - does not have polarities between which to vibrate. One cannot oscillate with One because there can be only one 'One'. As I experienced myself in the Amazon, Oneness does not vibrate; it is still. Thus, spiritual people talk about the stillness of the heart. They are speaking of the stillness of Oneness that we express through the heart vortex. What do we say when we see the troubles of the world'? \"It makes my heart ache\" and \"It breaks my heart\". These feelings relate to Oneness observing the illusion through the heart and our empathy with another expression of the One suffering the consequences of illusory disconnection. My heart aches because I know it does not have to be like this and I know how it could be if we would only remove the chains that bind us to illusion. If we experience the world through the heart and not the head, our whole reality is transformed., Instead of 'thinking' what to do, we feel it, or know it in the heart; the place from where you feel love or where you feel your heart ache. This is our connection with the One in our Matrix state and the Illuminati seek constantly to close the heart vortex through events that trigger fear, resentment and a desire for revenge .. The whole global economic system is designed to this end - to generate competition and conflict that divides the sense of One; and to create a daily cycle of stress that comes from chasing the material 'dream' and illusory 'success', or seeking to survive on the scraps that are left for those cast aside in the stampede for the pig trough. It is harder to open your heart when you hate the guy in the job that you want or when there is far more week than wages. To generate the energy of fear on which their masters depend, the Illuminati have to close the heart chakra; for only then will we be dominated by the emotional states that the heart knows are only illusions of mind. Energy flows where attention goes, as they say, and we are pressured to focus our attention on fear, resentment, revenge and survival. Frustration is a massive heart suppressor. It is no surprise that studies have revealed how those who score high in hostility and aggression are seven times more likely to die of a heart attack than those who score low.! These emotions suppress the heart chakra and reduce the flow of energy. This creates a compressed field of energy that manifests through the physical heart as a heart attack. There you have the basis on which stress causes heart disease. 'But if we do not concede our reality to these manipulated emotions, we rise above them and they no longer dictate our health or how we see ourselves and others. When we feel and know from our heart we find empathy with all other expressions of the One. The heart does not identify with being American or British or Jewish or Arab. It identifies only with Oneness, balance, fairness and justice for all. It does what it believes to be right, no matter what or who is involved. Those who manipulate the John Wayne mentality in America to glean support for their wars of conquest would have no chance if they were speaking to open hearts. These would reject immediately the idea of violence against anyone. The heart knows that this only begets more violence and that all violence is the One attacking itself. With open hearts all war would end"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 283 through lack of interest. But the Illuminati bypass the wisdom of the heart and target the head that sees reality in terms of us and them - good guys (us) and bad guys (them). The head believes that it is American or British, Arab or Jew. It sees only the parts, not the whole. It believes in light and dark, left and right, good and evil; and such entrenched belief creates this illusory duality. It edits what it ~sees' to confirm its beliefs and it sees what it is told to see. One example of this is the belief in God Bless America, Land of the Free, fulfilling its God-given destiny to bring' peace and justice to the world by promoting violence and injustice. All ideology is the Matrix at work. Ideology is the illusion that there is only one way and its advocates are the zealots that seek, in their arrogant self obsession, to impose their beliefs on others. How can there be only one way when you are dealing with infinity? There can only be infinite ways because the Infinite is all possibility. Wisdom is diversity; ideology is, well, bloody stupid. Wilson Bryan Key writes: \"The moment anyone accepts an objective reality, an eternal truth, they have become vulnerable, manipulable, and eminently exploitable. They have ceased to function as an autonomous, creative, thinking individual, living in an integrated, interdependent, world.\" 2 Figure 64: The heart chakra, the 'spiritual heart' and our connection with the 'One '. Illustration by Neil Hague If you can give a term or title for what you are and believe, the Matrix has you. I don't care if you call yourself an American, an Arab, a Jew, an Aussie, an African or Chinese; you are thinking division and thinking small. Or are you a Christian, Hindu, Buddhist' or Muslim? Then the Matrix has you. These are ideologies, the' belief in some absolute truth within the infinity of possibility. There is no single answer to anything. Advocates of these religions would deny vehemently that they are ideologies, especially Buddhism. But so long as they can give themselves a name they must be. The truth just is; we all just are. It is the force with no name."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 284 When we \"think\" and observe from an open heart, we are accessing infinite balance, love, wisdom, knowing. The intuitive become the guide that leads us through the maze of manipulation that entraps the head in illusion it believes to be real. Seeing is not believing; not even feeling is believing; knowing is believing, or rather knowing is knowing. Belief is an illusion of mind. As we surrender to the heart, the head begins to view reality from another, greater, perspective. In doing so, it becomes One with the heart and what we think and feel are the same because they come together and know. When they do, it is Krmistice Day for the soul; the war is over. The inner peace becomes outer peace because the two are but one. The conflict in the world 'outside' is only a mirror of the war within us all. If we make peace with ourselves, we make peace with life itself, for we are life itself. When we do this, the Illuminati will be no more because they will be erased from our sense of reality every bit as much as the man who could not see his daughter. The Illuminati are also illusions of our minds, as is the brain that they seek to programme. Even our minds beyond the brain are illusions. So is the heart chakra, albeit a higher level one. It is but a stepping stone to true, all-embracing Oneness, where there is no heart or soul or head; only the balance of everything, the All Knowing, which simply 'is'. An illusion (mind) is creating an illusion (reality). The Oneness of all is the only truth, everything else is illusion. The mystic, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, brilliantly described the antidote to all this: \"We must not only cut asunder the snare of the mind and the senses, but flee also from the snare of ~e thinker, the snare of the theologian and the church-builder, the meshes of the Word and the bondage of the Idea. All these are within us waiting to wall in the spirit with form; but we must always go beyond, always renounce the lesser for the greater, the finite for. the Infinite; we must be prepared to proceed from illumination to illumination, from experien ce to experience, from soul state to soul state ... Nor must we attach ourselves even to the truth we hold most securely, for they are but forms and expressions of the Ineffable who refuses to limit itself to any form or expression.\" 3 We are not our bodies. We are not our brains. We are not our minds. We are not even our thoughts. We are the silence, the stillness, between them. Even as we think we are purveyors of illusion. We live in a world that is designed to be neither silent nor still. There are keepers at every gate to the One. We are kept busy, busy, busy, to maintain the chatter of mind. The development of cities concentrates people and stress, movement and noise. Where is the silent? Where is the still? They are within us and that is where we must go to experience the One. It is worth making space every day to calm the mind and go into the silence and stillness where knowing is waiting to communicate. Sri Aurobindo said: \"To discover the new country within us, we have to leave the old one behind.\" Meditation is one way of achieving this, although I prefer to call it sitting quietly. There is a lot of junk talked about meditation and this method or that. I have met many meditation addicts who are no more enlightened than those who never do it. I have met a lot of psychoactive drug junkies in a similar state. It is not the meditation or the drugs; it is where you allow them to take you or, more to the point, where you allow you to take yourself. Sitting quietly, for me anyway, is to surrender to your heart and allow it to take you home. If you have never done this, it can be frustrating trying to stop the chatterbox in the head. So don't try. By doing so you are giving it power through attention. Don't try to do anything, just be. This removes the power from the mind and with repetition you will find that the chatter will subside and you can go into timeless, Oneness states, where there are no questions, nor even words; there is only knowing, being.\"\" It is like taking a deep breath, stepping back and looking at life from another perspective. What you believed to be so important becomes ever more irrelevant as the divisions melt away and unity is all that remains. Within the realm of illusion, visualisation is concentrated thought (like \"prayer'!')and thought creates holographic reality. Visualising what you want to create in holographic experience can be extremely effective in the manifestation of what you desire. Through this we can experience whatever we choose - pleasant or unpleasant, a nightmare or our wildest dream. Our beliefs decide the experience. A television psychic from my childhood used to say: \"Think lucky and you'll be lucky.\" But it is nothing to do with luck; it is manifestation of reality by sense of reality. If we know we are Oneness and the rest is illusion, we can enjoy the holographic 'world' and have fun with it. We can experience all that is available to us - anything. Life is not an \"either or\", it is an \"as well as\". Our limitations are only our sense of limitation. Illusion can only control us when we think it is real, just as a magician cannot fool us when we know how he does it. From the knowledge of Oneness and the manifestation of 'reality' through thought, we can create an illusion that we like in the full knowledge that this is whatever we are doing. By freeing the mind of fear, doubt and a sense of limitation, we can live' in an illusory paradise in the knowledge that we are paradise - the One. "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" 285 Love thy \"enemy\"? People have said that they can't understand why I say we must love those that seek to control us and perpetuate human suffering. But love is Oneness and so love is the balance of all things. Hatred comes from the illusion of division. Hate is not the other polarity of love because love is Oneness and Oneness has no polarities. If we hate those who cause the mayhem we are holding ourselves in the illusion and, therefore, the control of those we hate. This is yet another loop. The manipulators are full of hate and fear; so do we want to join them?? To love someone is not to stand by and let them impose their will upon you or others. Love stands up for what it believes to be right no matter what the challenge or intimidation. It is possible to expose what is going on and change that reality without hating those involved. It is essential to do this because, otherwise, we are the same as that which we claim to dislike. We see this all the time when we delude ourselves into believing that the methods we condemn, when used by others, can be justified for us to employ because we are trying to do \"good\". You do not achieve what you believe to be right by doing what you know to be wrong. Friedrich Nietzsche put it like this: \"He who fights with monsters might take care; lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into You.\" How often do we see those who challenge \"evil\" turn into a mirror of those they condemn? Look at the political Left and Right as one prime example. The far Left hates the far Right and vice versa. Yet they are the same in both thought and method. Hatred, resentment and a need for revenge are cancers of the soul. When we feel these emotions, who are the victims? We are. The targets might be having a great time, unaware of how we feel about them, while we cook in our own stew of seething fury at the expense of joy and happiness. Hatred and resentment are, with fear, the ultimate in self abuse. It's time to let them go and see them for the illusions that they are. We don't need to fight the Illuminati, but change the reality in which they exist. Scientist\" and philosopher Buckminster Fuller said: \"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" Wise monkeys In the years since that mound in Peru, I have seen the awakening of the human heart gathering in both numbers and power. The transformation I was told about in 1990 is coming to pass, even as the forces of control also appear to be increasing their power. But this is, in fact, the final card of a gambler who forgot the golden rule: don't play with those w):1o know more than you do. The Illuminati plays Oneness = four threes plays a full house. The awakening is challenging the domination of Illuminati reality in the collective unconscious - consensus reality. The 'hundred monkeys' are pooling their realisations on the human 'Worldwide Web' and there they can be accessed by anyone attuning to that awareness. This is happening at an ever quickening pace. It can be seen in the millions on the streets in protest at the invasion of Iraq - many of whom had never done anything like that before. It can be seen in their articulated understanding that those in authority are pedalling lies to sell a secret agenda to the people. It can be seen in the empathy with those of other skins and other cultures who face the violence of the so-called civilised world. The hundredth monkey syndrome means that people are spontaneously awakening with a knowing that something is seriously not right with the direction they are being taken. Now is the moment to push on. We need to become even more vocal with this knowledge and consciously connect with the Infinite knowing, Infinite Love, that will dismantle the freeze vibration of 'solidified' ignorance. Those who know about the suppression and manipulation in science, politics, the media and all the other vehicles for control need to speak out and expand the understanding of the people for what is unfolding. If you know something, say so. The fear of doing this will not even register compared with the consequences for you and your children of looking the other way. Come on, let's go. Live, love, laugh and be happy This is such an exciting moment to be here in the five-sense illusion. We are witnessing and manifesting a transformation of reality that will change our conscious experience on a scale that will beggar belief. Oneness put the kettle on we're coming home. But then, we never left; we just deluded ourselves that we"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" 286 had. Laughter is so important in all this. The voice that speaks to me is full of fun and laughter and having experienced where it comes from, I am not surprised. There are no tears in 'heaven'; no pain in the One. And, anyway, isn't it all such a bloody hoot? What can we do, but laugh? On the second night of ayahuasca in Brazil, I could hardly stop laughing at what the voice was saying. For hours Pam and I were in hysterics as the voice told me about the nature of human reality. It is so hilarious. Here we are running around a Time Loop like a mouse in a wheel, believing in 'time' that doesn't exist. The quicker we 'move' 'forward', the quicker we 'go' 'back', when, in truth, we never go anywhere. What a laugh. Our bodies only 'die' because we think they do. We only feel pain and suffer illness because we think we do. We only grow old because we think we do. We bang our heads against a solid wall that cannot be solid; we bang our toe on a table when the table is an illusion and so is the toe. We fear the future when there is none. We regret the past when there is none. We fear the unknown when we are the All-Knowing.

My daughter, Kerry, would not think of herself as a philosopher, but she is and she lives her life by manifesting what she needs whenever she needs it.

The government and 'legal' system of the United States is controlled by the 'Crown'. As explained in chapter two, the Crown is not the British monarch as widely believed, but the 'City', an independent state in London. In turn, the 'City' or the 'Crown' is really the Knights Templar Church, also known as the Crown Temple or Crown Templar, and this is located between Fleet Street and Victoria Embankment. The Temple grounds are also home to the Crown Offices at Crown Office Row. The Crown Temple controls the global 'legal' system, including those in the United States and Canada, because all Bar Associations are franchises of the .~ - International Bar Association at the Inns of Court at Crown Temple based at Chancery Lane in London. All Bar Association)' are franchises of the Crown and all Bar Attorneys throughout the world pledge a solemn oath to the Temple, even though some may not be aware that this is what they are doing. Bar Association 'licensed' Attorneys must keep to their oath, pledge and terms of allegiance to the Crown Temple if they are to be \"called to Bar\" and work in the 'legal' profession. The 'ruling' monarch is also subordinate to the Crown Temple and has been so since the reign of King John in the 13th century when royal sovereignty was transferred to the Crown Temple and, through that, to the Roman Church. King John (11671216) is a key to this story. It was at .the Chancel, or Chancery, of the Crown Inner Temple Court in January 1215 that King John was faced with the demands of the English barons to confirm the rights enshrined in the Magna Carta. When he signed the Magna Carta in 1215 history records this as an event that extended human freedom, but the real affect was very different as we \"shall see. The 'governments' of the United States and Canada are other subsidiaries of the Crown Temple and so is the US 'central bank', the Federal Reserve. Indeed the global banking system is controlled by the Crown Temple as well as the 'legal' system. Bar Associations are awarded their franchises by the four Inns of Court at Temple Bar. These are the Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn and they are nothing less than exclusive secret societies without charters or statutes. They are a law unto themselves. The Inner Temple controls the legal system franchise for Canada and Britain while the Middle Temple does the same for the United States. Queen Elizabeth II is a member of both temples. I have explained earlier in the book that the Illuminati always seek to control both 'sides' in any situation. Thus at least five signatories to the American Declaration of Independence were Temple Bar Attorneys who had pledged allegiance to the Crown! Another Middle Temple agent during the formation of the United States was Alexander Hamilton who structured the American banking system in line with the Crown Temple agenda for control of the new United States (a 'State' is a legal entity of the Crown - a Crown Colony!). As Michael Edward points out in an excellent Internet study: \"Americans were fooled into believing that the legal Crown Colonies comprising New England were independent nation states, but they never were nor are today. They were and still are Colonies of the Crown Temple, through letters patent and charters, who have no legal authority to be independent from the Rule and Order of the Crown Temple. A legal State is a Crown Temple Colony. \"Neither the American people nor the Queen of Britain own America. The Crown Temple owns America through the deception of those who have worn their allegiance by oath to the Middle Templar Bar. The Crown Bankers and their Middle Templar Attorneys rule America through unlawful contracts, unlawful taxes, and ,contract documents of false equity through debt deceit, all strictly enforced by their completely unlawful, but 'legal', Orders, Rules and Codes of the Crown Temple Courts Our so-called 'judiciary' in America. This is because the Crown Temple holds the land titles and estate deeds to all of North America.\" Seven Middle Inn Templars who had pledged an oath of allegiance to the Crown Temple (including Alexander Hamilton) were among the members of the Constitutional Convention who signed the completed 'American Constitution'. How symbolic it is that copies of the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence hang on the wall of the library of the Middle Temple in London. After all, they were the force behind both of them. While Middle Bar Templars were orchestrating the illusion of freedom from the perceived rule by King George III, the king, too, was a sworn member of the same Middle Temple. Michael Edward continues: \"1776 is the year that will truly live in infamy for all Americans. It is the year that the Crown Colonies became legal Crown States. The Declaration of Independence was a legal, not lawful, document. It was signed on both sides by representatives of the Crown Temple. Legally, it announced the status quo of the Crown Colonies to that of the new legal name caIIed 'States' as direct possessive estates of the Crown. \"The American people were hoodwinked into thinking they were declaring lawful independence from the Crown. Proof that the Colonies are still in Crown possession is the use of the word 'State' to signify a 'legal estate of possession.' Had this been a document of and by the people, both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution would have been written using the word 'states'. By the use of 'State'the significance of a government of estate possession was legally established. All of the North American States are Crown Templar possessions through their legal document, signed by their representation of both parties to the contract, known as the Constitution of the United States of America. \" 2 Britain and Ireland are owned by the Roman Church So the United States, together with Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, are controlled by the Knights Templar 'Crown', but who owns the Knights Templar 'Crown'? Well, er, the Pope, or rather the Illuminati that controls him. On May 15th 1213, our own fr iend King John, who was a puppet of the Templars, effectively signed away the Kingdom of England and Ireland to Pope Innocent III and the Roman Church, witnessed by the CrownTemplars. As King John said at the time: \"I myself bearing witness in the house of the Knights Templars. The King John charter stated: "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"\"We wish it to be known to all of you, through this our charter, furnished with our seal ... not induced by force or compelled by fear, but of our own good and spontaneous will and by the common counsel of our barons, do offer and freely concede to God and His holy apostles Peter and Paul and to our mother the holy Roman church, and to our-lord pope Innocent and to his Catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom Ireland, with all their rights and appurtenances .. : we perform and swear fealty for them to him our aforesaid lord pope Innocent, and his Catholic successors and the Roman church ... binding our successors and our heirs by our wife forever, in similar manner to perform fealty and show homage to him who shall be chief pontiff at that time, and to the Roman church without demur. As a sign ... we will and establish perpetual obligation and concession ... from the proper and especial revenues of our aforesaid kingdoms ... the Roman church shall receive yearly a thousand marks sterling ... saving to us and to our heirs our rights, liberties and regalia; all of which things, as they have been described above, we wish to have perpetually valid and firm; and we bind ourselves and our successors not to act counter to them. And if we or anyone of our successors shall presume to attempt this, whoever he be, unless being duly warned he come to his kingdom, and his senses, he shall lose his right to the kingdom, and this charter of our obligation- and concession shall always remain firm.\" Historical accounts concentrate on the fact that this charter obligated the Crown to pay money to the Roman Church, but it also states that if the terms of this charter are broken, the 'right to the Kingdom' shall be lost. When King John signed the Magna Carta on June 15th 1215 he broke the terms of the charter with the Pope and therefore lost the right to his kingdom. Pope Innocent III then declared the Magna Carter null and void. From this time the 'Crown' passed fr om the monarch to the Knights Templar who, to this day, govern Britain on behalf of the Roman (Illuminati) Church. This means, if we take it a stage further, that ultimately, through the Crown Temple, the Roman Church also owns the United States, Canada and all countries and Bar Associations controlled (overtly or covertly) by the Crown! This is why the Peace Treaty between the American Colonies and the British Crown in 1783, stated: \"It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by the grace of God, king of Great Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc., and of the United States of America ... \" {My emphasis) How ironic that a Roman Catholic is barred from being the British monarch while all along the monarch and the 'kingdom' have been owned by the Roman Church.

That every time you close your eyes, You re-live the hell you saw. You say you seem to cry a lot, That you've tried to take your life, You say you're unemployable, Depend upon your wife. Well I have to say I'm sorry, The answer must be no. We can't pay you compensation, I can't bend the rules you know. It's clear you have a problem. You may even be insane. But you cannot prove to me, It was caused at Alamein. But its no good you complaining, We all made a sacrifice You'll try to make the best of it, If you ask for my advice It could have been much worse, you know After all we won. Like I told you years ago, You are a hero, son. "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III Because We Are Jews By Rabbi Mordechi Weberman There are those who ask us why we march with the Palestinians. Why do we raise the Palestinian flag? Why do we support the Palestinian cause? \"You are Jews!\" they tell us. \"What are you doing?\" And our response is very simple: \". It is precisely because we are Jews that we march with the Palestinians and raise their flag! It is precisely because we are Jews that we demand that the Palestinian people? be returned to their homes and properties! Yes, hi. our Torah we are commanded to be fair. We are called upon to pursue justice. And, what could be more unjust then the century old attempt of the Zionist movement to invade another people's land, to drive them out and stealthier property? The early Zionists proclaimed that they were a people without a land going to a land without a people. Innocent sounding words. But utterly and totally untrue. Palestine was a land with a people. A people that were developing a national consciousness. We have no doubt that would Jewish refugees have come to Palestine not with the intention of dominating, not with the intention of aking a Jewish state, not with the intention of dispossessing, not with the intention of depriving the Palestinians of their basic rights, that they would have been welcomedby the Palestinians, with the same hospitality that Islamic peoples have shown Jews throughout history. And we would have lived together as Jews and Muslims lived before in Palestine in peace and harmony. To our Islamic and Palestinian friends around the world, please hear our message. There are Jews around the world who support your cause. And when we support your cause we do not mean some partition scheme proposed in 1947 by a UN that had no right to offer it. When we say support your cause we do not mean the cut off and cut up pieces of the West Bank offered by Barak at Camp David together with justice for less than 10 % of the refugees. We do not mean anything other than returning the entire land, including Jerusalem, to Palestinian sovereignty! At that point justice demands that the Palestinian people should decide if and how many Jews should remain in the Land. This is the only path to true reconciliation. But we demand yet more. WE demand that in returning the land back to its rightful owners we have not yet done enough. There should be an apology to the Palestinian people which is clear and precise. Zionism did you wrong. Zionism stole your homes. Zionism stole your land. \" By so proclaiming we proclaim before the world that we are the people of the Torah, that our faith demands that we be honest and fair and good and kind. We have attended hundreds of pro-Palestinian rallies over the years and everywhere we go the leaders and audience greet us with the warmth of Middle Eastern hospitality. What a lie it is to say that Palestinians in particular or Muslims in general hate Jews. You hate injustice. Not Jews. Fear not my friends. Evil cannot long triumph. The Zionist nightmare is at its end. It is exhausted. Its latest brutalities are the death rattle of the terminally ill. We will yet both live to see the day when Jew and Palestinian will embrace in peace under the Palestinian flag in Jerusalem .. And ultimately when mankind's Redeemer will come the sufferings of the present will long be forgotten in the blessings of the future.
